    " Title: Poll Shows Bernie Sanders Supporters' Willingness to Pay for Campaign Promises\n\nArticle:\n\nA poll conducted by Vox and Morning Consult during the first week of April revealed that supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders express strong support for initiatives like free college tuition and universal health care, with over 70% in favor of both. However, when it comes to funding these proposals, support drops significantly, particularly among those unwilling to pay more than $1,000 for a single-payer health care system.\n\nThe poll found that about 66% of Sanders supporters would not be willing to pay an additional $1,000 in taxes for universal health care, with 8% unwilling to pay anything at all. When asked about the percentage of their income they would pay, voters seemed more generous, with half stating they would not pay or would pay less than 5% of their income, and a quarter stating they would pay between 5 and 10%.\n\nSanders supporters also showed strong support for free public college tuition, but 14% said they would not pay additional taxes for it, and another half said they would only pay up to $1,000 a year.\n\nSanders' plan would impose an additional $5,000 of federal tax liability on households earning $50,000, with the aim of nationalizing vital services currently in the private sector. However, the poll data suggests that the majority of Sanders supporters, and potentially a majority of voters, are not willing to pay enough to support these nationalized services.\n\nThe poll results echo a common theme in top-down, controlled economic experiments, where costs are too great and the system collapses due to lack of funding. The economy where vital services are completely in the hands of government has been a disaster for other countries, such as Greece.\n\nThe poll data challenges the narrative pushed by Sanders on the campaign trail, which positions him as a leader of a political revolution seeking to make America fairer by destroying the job-creating and investing class and usurping a corrupt campaign finance system. The poll data shows that Sanders' most ardent backers are not willing to pay for what he is promising; they just want it.\n\nThe poll also raises questions about the sustainability of Sanders' platform, particularly in light of the fact that his base is primarily young, college-educated whites, a demographic that has been a consistent voting bloc for the Democratic Party since the 1960s.",
    " Title: Film Director Dinesh D'Souza Indicted for Alleged Federal Campaign Law Violations\n\nArticle:\n\nConservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza, known for his anti-Obama documentary \"2016: Obama's America,\" was indicted Thursday on charges of violating federal campaign laws. The indictment alleges that D'Souza illegally donated to a Senate campaign and made false statements in connection with the contributions.\n\nD'Souza, who is 52 and a best-selling author and activist, is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in New York on Friday. The indictment states that D'Souza will be charged with one count of illegally donating to Republican Wendy Long's Senate campaign and one count of causing false statements to be made to authorities in connection with the contributions.\n\nAccording to FoxNews.com, the donation in question was made to Long, who lost a 2012 Senate bid against New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. D'Souza is accused of directing various donors to give contributions to Long's campaign totaling $20,000, and then reimbursing them. Individuals are only allowed to donate a maximum of $5,000 to a candidate per election cycle.\n\nGeorge Venizelos, the assistant director in charge of the New York FBI office, stated, \"Trying to influence elections through bogus campaign contributions is a serious crime. Today, Mr. D'Souza finds himself on the wrong side of the law.\"\n\nD'Souza's co-producer in \"2016,\" Gerald Molen, told FoxNews.com that he believes D'Souza is being singled out by federal authorities. The 2012 film, which examined President Obama's past and early influences that may have shaped his political ideology, was a surprise hit, making over $33 million at the box office.\n\nMolen stated, \"Neither the filmmakers nor the American public can allow this prosecution to deter us from the film's release.\" He added, \"I am calling upon the American people to show their elected officials that this kind of selective prosecution will not stand, by joining us at the box office.\"\n\nMolen, who won an Oscar as a co-producer for \"Schindler's List,\" said the charges against D'Souza deeply disappoint him, as D'Souza is a \"great American.\"\n\nThe alleged illegal contributions came to light during the FBI's routine examination of campaign contributions filed with the FEC during the 2012 election year. D'Souza faces a maximum of two years in prison for the illegal contributions charge and a maximum of five years in prison for the false statements charge. The indictment was announced by Venizelos and U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who was appointed by President Obama in 2009.",
    " Title: Trump Faces Growing Threat from Mueller Investigation as Legal Filings Raise New Questions\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has taken steps to divert attention from the ongoing investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, but the relentless focus on Trump's conduct in the 2016 campaign and subsequent events has increased the President's vulnerability.\n\nOver the past week, a series of legal filings related to the Russia investigation has brought new questions about potential cooperation between Trump's campaign and Russian election meddling efforts. The President, however, maintains that he is being vindicated and cleared, arguing that there is no collusion.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump announced the departure of his chief of staff, John Kelly, and dismissed new revelations from the Russia probe. He also promoted violent demonstrations against French President Emmanuel Macron, a former ally, and tweeted about the ongoing investigation, stating, \"This is collusion illusion, there is no smoking gun here.\"\n\nThe President has a history of disregarding evidence that contradicts his preferred version of events and has mounted a long campaign to discredit the special counsel. However, the deepening record of the Mueller investigation is raising the possibility that Trump's talent in creating alternative realities is facing its stiffest test yet.\n\nNew and damaging information for the White House comes at a time when Mueller's investigation appears to be delving deeper into the White House and Trump's inner circle, expanding well beyond the 2016 campaign. The special counsel is reportedly looking not just at allegations of possible cooperation between Trump associates and Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election, but also at possible obstruction of justice.\n\nTrump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, and former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, have reportedly provided substantial cooperation to Mueller, and there is documentary evidence in addition to testimony from witnesses. The depth of the President's legal and political difficulties will only become clear when Mueller files a final report, and Trump's team will have the chance to challenge his findings and make their defense.\n\nHowever, it's increasingly looking like the President's denials and distractions are failing to keep up with the special counsel's accelerating pace. The future course of the investigation remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the Mueller investigation continues to cast a long and growing shadow over the Trump administration.",
    " Title: Trump Frustrated Over Sessions Recusal Overshadowing Congress Address\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is reportedly frustrated with his senior staff and communications team for allowing the controversy surrounding Attorney General Jeff Sessions to overshadow his address to Congress. According to sources, Trump feels that the Sessions news, which the administration deemed a nonstory, has taken the spotlight away from his speech to Congress.\n\nOn Thursday, Sessions recused himself from any current or future investigations into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign after it was reported he had met with the Russian ambassador to the US, something he had previously failed to disclose. The renewed focus on Russia is seen as a major letdown after Tuesday when top officials were riding high, congratulating one another on Trump's speech to Congress.\n\nTrump reportedly expressed his frustration to his inner circle in the Oval Office on Friday, stating that he feels attacked by the media, former Obama administration officials, and others, and frustrated that things are not going more smoothly. The President is reportedly upset because he does not believe he is getting the credit he thinks he deserves for his time in office so far because of self-inflicted wounds and missteps.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said in response to CNN's reporting that \"The President had a fantastic week advancing his agenda to lift up all Americans and keep the nation safe. His joint session speech will go down in history as one of the best.\"\n\nTrump's mood is reportedly adding to tremendous pressure inside the West Wing, and aides have been seen in tears in recent days at multiple meetings. With so much on the administration's plate - leaks, the Russia story, pending executive order, and Obamacare repeal and replacement - White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus reportedly decided not to travel to Florida with the President this weekend as had been previously planned.\n\nWhite House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, who initially decided to also stay in Washington on Friday, ended up traveling to Florida on Saturday and is joining Trump, Sessions, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross at dinner at Mar-a-Lago. The White House has not confirmed these reports.",
    " Title: Conservative Defenses of Chris Christie Amid Bridge Scandal: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the George Washington Bridge scandal, leading conservative figures have been defending former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie by drawing comparisons with other political controversies, such as the Benghazi and IRS scandals during the Obama administration.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, political strategist Karl Rove questioned the lack of attention from the Clinton camp regarding the bridge scandal and compared it to the coverage of the Benghazi and IRS controversies. He suggested that it would be challenging for Democrats to turn the bridge scandal into an issue due to the significant attention given to Christie.\n\nFormer New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani made a similar argument on ABC's \"This Week,\" stating that administrative issues can occur during campaign mode, and that the Obama administration may have missed some things during that time, citing Benghazi as an example.\n\nThe defense of Christie by ad hominem attacks on President Obama and Hillary Clinton implies that the George Washington Bridge scandal is real. If the scandal were a phony one, conservatives would be labeling it as such.\n\nHowever, for the conservative argument to hold up under scrutiny, the Obama \"scandals\" would need to be genuine. But, as other writers have pointed out, the Benghazi and IRS controversies are not real scandals, and the public is divided over these stories due to the lack of merit in the accusations.\n\nConservatives can argue that media bias played a role in the coverage of the bridge scandal, but the scientific term for this argument is \"bullshit.\" The media scrutinized both stories intensely, and the only reason they've moved on is that after months of reporting, they found no evidence of scandal.\n\nAttacking journalists investigating the bridge scandal for not succumbing to politically motivated efforts to scandalize the Obama administration is not likely to retrain their focus on Benghazi and the IRS. Instead, it will make them suspect ulterior motives.\n\nSecond, meta whining like this is seen as superficial and unproductive. Liberals spent a significant amount of time during the Bush years complaining about how Democrats would be treated differently if they engaged in similar actions. However, complaining about the media or implying that Democrats would handle a political issue less responsibly might make conservatives feel better, but it also smacks of sour grapes.\n\nThe biggest drawback is that the bridge scandal is still unfolding, and new developments could make the situation much worse for Christie. If the lane closures were orchestrated by Christie's subordinates without his knowledge, then conservatives could potentially neutralize charges of incompetence by invoking the Healthcare.gov fiasco. However, if the traffic in Fort Lee scandal is a story of hapless operatives acting out revenge fantasies, then the defense is likely to fall apart.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Acknowledges \"In-artful\" Comment on Financial Status, Maintains Accuracy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with Fusion TV's Jorge Ramos, published Monday night, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admitted that her comment about being \"dead broke\" when she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, left the White House in 2001 was \"in-artful.\" However, she maintained the statement's accuracy.\n\nWhen asked, \"Do you regret telling Diana Sawyer that you were once 'dead broke'?\", Clinton responded, \"Well, I regret it. It was in-artful.\" She continued, \"It was accurate \u2014 but we are so successful and we're so blessed by the success we've had and my husband has worked incredibly hard.\"\n\nClinton then attempted to shift the conversation towards her concern for working families, stating, \"What I worry about is not my family. I worry about other families in our country who feel like they\u2019re running in place, they\u2019re not getting ahead or maybe they're falling backwards. What I want to do\u2014and this is what Bill has always done since the very beginning of his public life\u2014is to try to create more ladders of opportunity for more Americans so that they can have the same opportunities that Bill and I have had.\"\n\nRamos persisted with his line of questioning, asking, \"Do you know your net worth? Do you know how much money you have?\" Clinton answered, \"Um, you know, within a range,\" before mentioning their two homes. When pressed about the value of their wealth, Clinton responded, \"Yes, indeed,\" without providing specific figures.\n\nAccording to CNN, former President Bill Clinton earned $106 million between 2001 and early 2013. Hillary Clinton has reportedly earned an estimated $12 million since leaving the State Department in 2013. In a June 9 interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer, Clinton stated, \"We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt.\"",
    " Title: Trump Plans Rebuttal to Clinton's Foreign Policy Criticism, Defends Iraq War Stance\n\nArticle:\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has announced plans to deliver a rebuttal to Hillary Clinton's harsh criticism of his foreign policy in a speech last week. In an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Trump suggested he might deliver his response as early as Monday, before the election in California and four other states.\n\nTrump mocked Clinton for working with speechwriters on her San Diego remarks and dismissed her criticisms, including her characterization of him as \"temperamentally unfit\" for the presidency and driven by personal feuds, by insisting he has \"very strong, very thick skin.\"\n\nRegarding Clinton's assertion that he supported the Iraq War, Trump stated, \"I was against it from before it started.\" However, it's clear that Trump opposed the war by 2004, but there's not yet any public evidence that he opposed it before the war began in 2003. In a 2002 interview on Howard Stern's show, Trump said, \"Yeah, I guess so\" when asked about then-President George W. Bush's push to go to war. Trump later characterized his comments as moving toward opposing the war.\n\nClinton, the Democratic front-runner, countered Trump's Iraq War claim during a separate interview on \"State of the Union,\" stating, \"We have evidence and audio of him supporting it, so I think that's another example of him trying to rewrite history.\"\n\nTrump also criticized protesters who have been involved in violent clashes outside his campaign events, labeling them \"thugs\" planted by Democrats. Asked for evidence to back his claim that the protesters are being sent by Democrats, Trump said, \"Well, they have Bernie signs.\" Anti-Trump protesters clashed with his supporters outside a rally last week in San Jose, and there have been instances of violence at Trump events in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Chicago.\n\nTrump suggested that police should be \"very strong\" with protesters at his events but said he's not criticizing police for how they've handled the protests so far. Trump also defended his claims that a judge overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University is biased because of his Mexican heritage, pushing back against criticism that his objections are racist. Trump stated, \"He's a Mexican. We're building a wall between here and Mexico.\" Trump first broached these issues in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published Thursday.",
    " Title: Missouri State Trooper Accuses \"Violent Agitators\" of Using Peaceful Protests as Cover for Criminal Acts\n\nArticle:\n\nMissouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, in charge of the law enforcement response to protests in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, accused \"violent agitators\" of using largely peaceful protests as a cover for criminal acts. Johnson made the statement during a press conference early Tuesday, following a night of unrest that resulted in 31 arrests.\n\nAs Johnson spoke, two handguns and a Molotov cocktail, confiscated during the night by authorities, lay on a table in front of him. The majority-black town of approximately 21,000 has been in turmoil since the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was fatally shot by a white police officer following a confrontation on August 9. Local authorities have used tear gas and smoke canisters almost daily against protesters upset with the response to the shootings by Ferguson Police.\n\nJohnson stated that officers had come under heavy gunfire from protesters, and at least two people had been shot. He did not provide the condition of the shooting victims. Four officers had been injured when they were struck by rocks or bottles, though Johnson claimed that police had not fired a single shot.\n\nCiting a \"dangerous dynamic in the night,\" Johnson requested that protests take place during daylight hours, allowing officers to effectively isolate any troublemakers. However, Johnson said that his forces could not make protesters leave the streets after sunset if they did not want to.\n\n\"This nation is watching each and every one of us,\" said Johnson. \"I am not going to let the criminals that have come here from across this country, or live in this neighborhood, define this community.\" Johnson added that some of those arrested overnight had come from as far afield as New York and California. The trooper also directed his wrath at the assembled media, saying they had put themselves and officers in danger by failing to clear areas when asked before imploring them to \"not glamorize the acts of criminals.\"\n\n\"We do not want to lose another life in this community,\" Johnson added.\n\nShortly before midnight local time, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that police fired tear gas at a group of protesters who had reportedly defied orders to leave the parking lot of a burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that has been near the center of demonstrations over the past eight days. St. Louis County Police Chief Sam Dotson told reporters that shots had been fired in the area and media members were told to go to a designated area about a quarter of a mile away.\n\nLate Monday, reporters estimated that the number of protesters had dropped to around 100, far fewer than the number of media members who were covering them. A photographer for the Getty photo agency was arrested while covering the demonstrations and later released. Two German reporters were arrested and detained for three hours. Conservative German daily Die Welt said correspondent Ansgar Graw and reporter Frank Herrmann, who write for German regional papers, were arrested after allegedly failing to follow police instructions to vacate an empty street. They said they followed police orders.\n\nAt his news conference, Johnson said in some cases it was not immediately clear who was a reporter, but that once it was established, police acted properly.\n\nAs darkness fell, National Guard units with armored vehicles were waiting at a staging area about a half-mile from the portion of West Florissant Avenue that has been the scene of the largest protests. Closer to the protest site, a crowd of demonstrators was marching and growing in size. Sheriff's deputies in body armor and state troopers carrying wooden bats and gas masks stood watch over the group.\n\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that some protesters began throwing bottles at police shortly after 10 p.m. local time. Authorities responded by ordering protesters to clear the streets and firing high-pitched sound cannons.\n\nAnother group of protesters marched toward the police lines and stopped, defying orders that demonstrators could not assemble in a single spot, but had to keep moving instead. The Post-Dispatch reported that an armored vehicle moved down the street trying to clear the crowd and a group of pastors locked arms and helped to move protesters away from the police line.\n\nIn federal court earlier Monday, a judge denied a request from the American Civil Liberties Union for a restraining order that would have prevented authorities from enforcing the no-stopping rule.\n\nA grand jury could begin hearing evidence Wednesday to determine whether the officer, Darren Wilson, should be charged in Brown's death, said Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County's prosecuting attorney.\n\nThe St. Louis County medical examiner's autopsy found that Brown was shot six to eight times in the head and chest, office administrator Suzanne McCune said Monday. However, she declined further comment, stating that the full findings were not expected for about two weeks.\n\nLawyers for Brown's family and hired pathologists said an independent autopsy determined that Brown was shot six times, including twice in the head.\n\nForensic pathologist Shawn Parcells, who assisted former New York City chief medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden during the private autopsy, said a bullet grazed Brown's right arm. He said the wound indicates Brown may have had his back to the shooter, or he could have been facing the shooter with his hands above his head or in a defensive position across his chest or face.\n\n\"We don't know,\" Parcells said. \"We still have to look at the other (elements) of this investigation before we start piecing things together.\"\n\nA third and final autopsy was performed Monday for the Justice Department by one of the military's most experienced medical examiners, Attorney General Eric Holder said. Holder was scheduled to travel to Ferguson later this week to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown's death.\n\nDue to the unrest, the Ferguson-Florissant School District announced late Monday that classes would be canceled for the remainder of the week. Students were due to return from summer vacation last week, but were held out due to the unrest.",
    " Title: Trump Criticizes RNC, RNC Chairman Over Nominating Process\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 at Trump Tower, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump criticized the Republican National Committee (RNC) and its chairman, Reince Priebus, over the party's nominating process. Trump described the process as a \"disgrace\" and a \"scam.\"\n\nTrump expressed his displeasure with several aspects of the Republican nominating process, including the allocation of delegates in states like Colorado, where Sen. Ted Cruz was awarded all 34 delegates without a primary or a caucus. Trump disagrees with the practice of some delegates not being bound to vote for their state or district winner at this summer's GOP convention in Cleveland.\n\n\"It should go to a vote in Colorado like other places... The delegate situation is a very unjust way of doing things,\" Trump said. He suggested that the best way to determine the allocation of delegates would be through a vote of the people.\n\nWhen asked if he would call for Priebus to step down should he become the nominee, Trump responded, \"I have not given that any thought.\"\n\nIn an emailed statement, Sean Spicer, the RNC's chief strategist and communications director, defended the current system, stating that each state and territory submitted a plan on how to allocate and select their delegates last year.\n\nTrump hinted at the possibility of a lawsuit after winning Louisiana, stating the party did not give him enough delegates. However, his campaign later downplayed the legal threat.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump aide Paul Manafort accused the Cruz campaign of not playing by the rules in its attempt to woo delegates. The Trump campaign has also threatened to \"file several protests\" to the RNC.\n\nPriebus defended the RNC nominating system on Monday, stating that the rules have not changed and there's \"nothing mysterious\" about what Colorado Republicans did. Last summer, the Colorado GOP opted to select unbound delegates to the Republican convention.\n\nIt is unusual for the Republican presidential front-runner and the head of the RNC to be at odds, especially less than 100 days before the convention begins. Last year, after Trump threatened to run as a third-party candidate, Priebus convinced Trump and other GOP rivals to sign a pledge backing the party nominee. Earlier this month, Trump and Priebus met privately at the RNC headquarters on Capitol Hill.\n\nTrump's tone was sharply different during the interview, stating, \"I would have won Colorado... The Republican system is unfair, unjust, and they should create a fair system based on votes\u2014not a system like they have now that is based on politics as usual.\"\n\nTrump also compared the Democratic National Committee's process to the Republican one, stating, \"I tell you, it's unfair even from the Democrats' side... It's corrupt there, and it's more corrupt on the Republican side.\"\n\nMore of \u2588\u2588\u2588's interview with Trump will run Wednesday morning.",
    " Title: Late Release of Kavanaugh Documents Causes Controversy at Confirmation Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Monday night, the White House released 42,000 pages of documents related to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's time working in the George W. Bush White House. This late release, just one day before his confirmation hearing, sparked criticism from Democrats who argue that it does not provide enough time for senators to review the records before the hearing.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) expressed his displeasure on Twitter, stating, \"Not a single senator will be able to review these records before tomorrow.\" He also referred to the Trump White House as the \"least transparent\" in history.\n\nThe heated start of Tuesday's hearing saw Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) attempting to begin the proceedings, only to be interrupted by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). Harris objected, stating, \"We have not had time to read or analyze\" the documents, and thus, \"We can not possibly move forward.\"\n\nSenators Harris, Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) immediately objected to the late release of documents and requested a postponement of the hearing. Chairman Grassley, however, continued with his introduction, talking over the objecting senators.\n\nOther Democratic senators, including Richard Blumenthal and Cory Booker (D-NJ), agreed that the process was unfair and turned the hearing into a mockery. Booker asked Grassley, \"What is the rush?\" and \"What are they trying to hide?\"\n\nDuring the Democrats' protest, a group of protesters erupted and chanted about \"obstruction of justice.\"\n\nIn response to the Democrats' objections, Chairman Grassley first addressed Sen. Booker, expressing displeasure with Booker's questioning of his integrity. Grassley then explained that the committee has already read 483,000 documents of Kavanaugh's executive branch service, making it more pages than the last five Supreme Court nominees combined. He also noted that this is \"more materials than we have had on any Supreme Court nominee in history.\"\n\nThe late release of documents has not only been criticized by Democrats but also by some Republicans, as Judge Andrew Napolitano stated on Fox News that the White House's release of documents was \"exquisitely unfair\" because it hardly gives Democrats time to sift through all the information to prepare their questions.",
    " Title: Pro-Gun Organizations and Politicians Remain Silent Following Connecticut Massacre, Marking a Pause in the Ongoing Gun Control Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, on Friday, pro-gun organizations and politicians have remained largely silent, marking a pause in the ongoing gun control debate.\n\nThe tragedy unfolded when a 20-year-old resident of Newtown, Adam Lanza, took a high-powered rifle from his mother's arsenal, killed her, and then drove to the school. Upon arrival, Lanza, a socially awkward individual described as being on the autism spectrum, forced his way into the school and killed 20 first-graders at close range and six school staff attempting to shield the children.\n\nConservative radio host Rush Limbaugh criticized gun control proponents as early as Friday for trying to exploit the tragedy for political gain. This approach seemed to strike an awkward note in a country where even pro-gun rights Americans paused to consider the implications of America's long-running affinity for guns.\n\nWhen David Gregory, host of NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d sent out 31 invitations to pro-gun Senators in the new Congress to discuss the issue on Sunday, no takers emerged. The Shooting Sports Foundation, a pro-gun rights group headquartered just a few miles from where the shootings took place, also remained silent, as did the National Rifle Association (NRA).\n\nIn the absence of pro-gun rights voices, some conservative bloggers reminded readers of several instances in recent years when legal gun carriers thwarted gunmen intent on killing many people. In Portland, Oregon, one concealed weapons owner claims he brandished his gun after alleged mall shooter Jacob Roberts opened fire. According to the man, Roberts, whose rifle was jamming, fled the scene after seeing the gun and minutes later shot himself.\n\nEven on the blog of Eugene Volokh, a Russian-born UCLA law professor whose article \u201cThe Commonplace Second Amendment\u201d has been cited in recent court rulings favoring gun rights, commenters sounded less partisan than thoughtful in response to a blog entry where Mr. Volokh acknowledged no one knows if arming more Americans in anticipation of mass shootings would ultimately save lives.\n\nAfter Friday\u2019s massacre in Connecticut became the 7th major mass shooting in the US this year, police later Friday arrested a Cedar Lake, Indiana, man who owned 47 guns, after he threatened to go to a local elementary school and open fire.\n\nOn Sunday, a man in Newport Beach, California, fired 50 shots in a mall parking lot, hurting no one. In July, a college dropout proclaiming he was \u201cThe Joker\u201d opened fire on a midnight screening of a \u201cBatman\u201d movie in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 people and injuring 58, many of them seriously.\n\nPrevious massacres, including the Aurora shootings, have barely budged American support for the Second Amendment, which the Supreme Court in recent years has ruled applies to Americans armed to defend themselves and their homes. However, some polls suggest a majority of Americans do support some gradual restrictions on gun ownership.\n\nSensing a pause from pro-gun rights groups and individuals, pro-gun control advocates like Huffington Post columnist Robert Cavnar, a licensed gun owner, noted that \u201cthe conversation has finally begun.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe age and innocence of the victims in this massacre, coming right on the heels of the Oregon shootings and the Jovan Belcher murder-suicide, have finally caused the self-imposed discussion moratorium, enforced by the millions of dollars invested by the NRA and gun manufacturers, to be ended,\u201d he writes. As proof, he says, \u201cThe NRA has uncharacteristically gone subterranean since the shooting, and its website is completely silent on the matter.\u201d\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert (R) of Texas became the only national voice to wave the Second Amendment banner in the wake of the shootings. He told Fox News' Chris Wallace on Sunday that the massacre could have been averted had the principal been heavily armed.\n\nAfter saying mass killers tend to choose gun-free zones as places to attack, he noted, \u201cChris, I wish to God [slain principal Dawn Hochsprung] had had an M-4 in her office, locked up so when she heard gunfire, she pulls it out\u2026and takes him out\u2026before he can kill those precious kids.\u201d",
    " Title: Obama Administration Halts Arctic Oil Drilling Lease Sales Through 2017\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration has announced the cancellation of plans to sell oil drilling rights in the Arctic Sea through 2017, marking a significant change in policy following the approval of new drilling permits for Shell Oil earlier this year. This decision comes in response to Royal Dutch Shell's decision last month to suspend its oil exploration in offshore Alaskan waters due to disappointing results from a well in the Chukchi Sea.\n\nSecretary of the Interior Sally Jewell stated, \"In light of Shell's announcement, the amount of acreage already under lease and current market conditions, it does not make sense to prepare for lease sales in the Arctic in the next year and a half.\"\n\nEnvironmental groups, who criticized the administration for approving permits for Shell to drill while President Obama was highlighting the effects of climate change in Alaska, have applauded this move. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) called it \"an essential reprieve\" for Arctic Waters. NRDC's Franz Matzner stated, \"The next step should be to take Arctic and Atlantic waters off the table to oil and gas drilling for good.\"\n\nIn addition, the department also denied requests by Shell and the Norwegian company Statoil to extend their existing leases beyond 10 years. Both companies had asked for five-year extensions, arguing that they should have more time due to regulations preventing them from exploring for oil. Without those extensions, the leases will expire by 2020.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) criticized the decision, stating it was \"absurd.\" She argued that the Interior Department is creating regulatory roadblocks to prevent drilling and then using the lack of drilling to justify canceling the lease sales. Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy Committee, said, \"This is a stunning, short-sighted move that betrays the Interior Department\u2019s commitments to Alaska and the best interests of our nation\u2019s long-term energy security.\" She further stated that the decision is part of a destructive pattern of hostility toward energy production in Alaska that began the first day this administration took office.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Praise for Obama Administration's Diplomatic Post Closures in Response to Terror Threat\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration's decision to close diplomatic posts across Central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa over the weekend has received praise from lawmakers in both political parties. The Washington Post reports that this response is being hailed as a smart move in light of the most serious intelligence since the September 11, 2001, attacks, suggesting potential terrorist strikes in the affected regions or elsewhere.\n\nHouse Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) commended the administration's decision on CBS-TV's Face the Nation, stating, \"The administration's call to close these embassies... was actually a very smart call.\" Representative Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.) echoed this sentiment on ABC-TV's This Week, saying, \"What we have to do now is the most important issue, is protect Americans throughout the world.\"\n\nInitially, 19 locations were affected by the closures, including Abu Dhabi, Amman, Cairo, Riyadh, Dhahran, Jeddah, Doha, Dubai, Kuwait, Manama, Muscat, Sanaa, Tripoli, Antanarivo, Bujumbura, Djibouti, Khartoum, Kigali, and Port Louis. Posts in nine locations were set to reopen on Monday: Dhaka, Algiers, Nouakchott, Kabul, Herat, Mazar el Sharif, Baghdad, Basrah, and Erbil.\n\nThe terror threat has not only brought together some lawmakers but has also influenced the ongoing discussion about National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance programs. As reported by NPR's Dina Temple-Raston, the subject has shifted from debating whether to curb these programs\u2014a debate sparked by the revelations of Edward Snowden, the so-called \"NSA leaker\"\u2014to a discussion of the programs' effectiveness in uncovering potential terrorist attacks.\n\nAccording to The Hill, the \"weekend terror threat... has opened up a new front in the debate over the NSA's surveillance programs.\" A handful of lawmakers, primarily national security hawks, have used the Sunday news shows to declare the NSA programs a success and credit the controversial surveillance methods for uncovering a potential terrorist attack.",
    " Title: Biden Secures Victory in Maine, Leads Democratic Presidential Race with 10 Super Tuesday Wins\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has emerged victorious in the Democratic presidential primary in Maine, making it the last state to be called in the Super Tuesday contests. Biden's win in Maine adds to his 10 victories, leaving him ahead of Senator Bernie Sanders, who has secured four wins.\n\nBiden's Super Tuesday victories include primaries in Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Virginia, and Maine. Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, won his home state, as well as Colorado and Utah. He also claimed victory in California, the delegate-rich state of the Super Tuesday contests.\n\nBiden, who was the unrivaled front-runner before the early primary contests, faced a setback with lackluster fourth- and fifth-place showings in Iowa and New Hampshire. A slight rebound in Nevada's caucuses last month, where he came in a distant second to Sanders, and a landslide victory in South Carolina last week, gave him momentum going into the Super Tuesday contests.\n\nThe waning field of rivals, with moderate candidates like former South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., suspending their campaigns and endorsing Biden, consolidated the moderate vote in states that voted Tuesday. Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg also suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden on Wednesday, making the race, essentially, a two-candidate contest. Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who had a poor showing on Super Tuesday, is still in the race.\n\nIn his victory speech, Biden told supporters, \"To those who've been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign.\" He added, \"It may be over for the other guy.\"\n\nSanders, despite finishing behind Biden Tuesday night, expressed excitement about his campaign's position. \"I am excited about where we are. We have come a long, long way,\" Sanders said Tuesday night.\n\nThe next tests for the candidates will come on Tuesday, when voters in Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, and Washington state head to the polls, and on St. Patrick's Day, March 17, when Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio have their chance to vote. Georgia will hold its primary on March 24. As of 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, Biden had 566 delegates to Sanders' 501. A candidate must reach 1,991 delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination for president.",
    " Title: The Rise of Donald Trump and the Shift in Republican Economic Messaging\n\nArticle:\n\nFor the past several decades, the Republican party has been advocating an economic message that positions the prosperity of the wealthy as beneficial for the general public. However, the recent rise of Donald Trump, a candidate who has been described as a demagogue, indicates a shift in the party's base's acceptance of this message.\n\nThe Republican establishment has faced significant challenges in the 2016 election, with their candidates being not only defeated but also humiliated by Trump, whose rhetoric has been compared to that of Benito Mussolini and George Wallace. This shift can be attributed to the growing disillusionment among the Republican voter base, who feel they have been misled by the party's economic narrative.\n\nThe economic narrative the right wing of the Republican party, often referred to as the Money Party, has been promoting for the past 40 years is based on the idea that the economy flourished in the decades following World War II, but has since been hindered by excessive government regulation, high taxes, and an overly generous welfare system. This narrative suggests that the American dream has been stifled due to these factors, leading to the economic struggles experienced by ordinary Americans.\n\nHowever, an examination of the actual economic history of America since 1945 reveals a different story. Inflation-adjusted per capita GDP in the U.S. grew from $17,490 in 1945 to $27,837 in 1974, and then increased to $55,185 in 2014, nearly doubling since 1974. This indicates that the country is twice as rich per person now as it was then.\n\nDespite this wealth increase, the average household income of the bottom 50% of American households was $25,475 in 1974 and $26,520 in 2014. This means that half the population has not benefited from the additional $10 trillion of national wealth generated over the past 40 years. This group includes half of the nation's middle class.\n\nMeanwhile, the average household income of the top 5% of American households has increased from $187,729 to $332,347 over the same period. The income of the top 0.01% of households, approximately the nation's 13,000 wealthiest households, has increased by about seven-fold, from less than $5 million to more than $30 million per year.\n\nTrump's appeal to voters extends beyond his exploitation of racism and xenophobia, as he taps into the economic anxieties of white middle and working-class voters. His message, albeit crude and bombastic, resonates with many people who feel they have been losers in the contemporary economy, despite the party's promises of a thriving economy.\n\nThe Republican party's focus on issues such as cutting capital gains taxes, eliminating the estate tax, and reducing Social Security and Medicare may not align with the economic interests of middle- and working-class Americans, even if they are culturally conservative. These voters are angry about the empty promises of a Republican party that caters to the economic interests of the rich.\n\nIn conclusion, the rise of Donald Trump and the shift in the Republican base's acceptance of the party's economic message can be attributed to the growing disillusionment among the working and middle classes. The party's narrative, which positions the prosperity of the wealthy as beneficial for all, has been exposed as a myth, as the majority of Americans have not experienced the economic benefits of the past four decades.",
    " Title: Grand Jury Decision in Ferguson Shooting Case: Latest Developments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson for the shooting of Michael Brown, several developments have unfolded in Ferguson, Missouri, and beyond.\n\n1. Darren Wilson Speaks: Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, who shot and killed Michael Brown on August 9, spoke publicly for the first time on Tuesday with ABC News. Wilson described the altercation, stating that Brown did not have his hands up when he was fatally shot.\n\n2. President Obama's Remarks: President Obama, speaking from Chicago at a scheduled immigration event, condemned the \"destructive\" behavior that caused fires, gunfire, and property damage. He also acknowledged the many peaceful protests throughout the country, expressing his support for them.\n\n3. Governor Nixon's Press Conference: Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, in a press conference alongside National Guard and law enforcement leaders, promised to deploy more than 2,200 troops to maintain peace in Ferguson.\n\n4. Ferguson Mayor's Criticism: Ferguson Mayor James Knowles criticized the National Guard for a slow response, stating that they did not deploy quickly enough to prevent violence and arson in the wake of the grand jury's decision.\n\n5. Wilson's Public Appearance: Officer Darren Wilson will speak with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on World News Tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET, marking his first public appearance since the shooting.\n\n6. Family's Response: Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Michael Brown's family, criticized the prosecutor who handled the grand jury, stating, \"We object as publicly and loudly as we can on behalf of Michael Brown Jr.'s family that this process is broken. The process should be indicted.\"\n\n7. Grand Jury Testimony: The grand jury documents, which are detailed, include Wilson's account of the altercation, describing Brown as looking like a \"demon\" and the encounter as \"fighting Hulk Hogan.\"\n\n8. Arrests and Violence: At a Tuesday news conference, authorities reported 61 arrests, with 59 of those arrested being local residents. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar stated that it took \"10,000 policemen\" to control the chaos, and that the situation on Tuesday night was worse than the worst night in August.\n\n9. Social Media Activity: Twitter reported over 3.5 million tweets sent by midnight ET after the decision was announced at about 9 p.m.\n\n10. Overnight in Ferguson: The streets of Ferguson were calmer on Tuesday morning. Police reported 29 arrests, two police cars set on fire, at least a dozen buildings burning, looting, and rioting. One officer was shot (not seriously), and police used tear gas to disperse crowds. However, no deaths or serious injuries have been reported. Flight restrictions out of Lambert-St. Louis International Airport have expired.\n\n11. Gunshots and Building Fires: St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar reported at a 1:30 a.m. CT news conference that at least a dozen buildings were burning and at least 150 gunshots had been fired, none by police.\n\n12. Police Officer Shot and Woman Killed: In a burglary that may have been timed to take advantage of law-enforcement focus elsewhere, a police officer was shot, and a woman was killed in a St. Louis suburb south of Ferguson, Missouri. The suspect remains at large.\n\n13. FAA No-Fly Zone: The Federal Aviation Administration issued a no-fly zone at 11:15 p.m. ET to \"provide a safe environment for law enforcement activities.\"\n\n14. Protests Turn Violent: Despite efforts by Brown's family and civil rights activists, minutes after the ruling, violent protests erupted in Ferguson. Demonstrators taunted police, shattered windows, and set fire to two St. Louis County police cars. Scores of police officers, armed with riot gear, dispersed a crowd of about 300 with volley after volley of smoke bombs, pepper spray, and bean bags. Looters plundered a Walgreens and Autozone store, while a Little Caesars pizza restaurant and local beauty shop were set ablaze.\n\n15. Peaceful Protests in Other Cities: Demonstrators reacted more peacefully in several other cities, including New York, Oakland, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Washington, D.C. In New York, hundreds marched to Times Square chanting, \"No justice, no peace, no racist police,\" and carrying signs that read, \"Jail Killing Cops\" and \"Resistance Is Justified.\" Protesters in Oakland, California, laid in the middle of an intersection in silent protest, then marched down Broadway shouting, \"Hands up, don't shoot,\" and \"Black lives matter\u2014all lives matter.\"\n\n16. President Obama's Call for Calm: In a nearly 10-minute statement in the White House press room after the ruling, President Obama said, \"We are a nation built on the rule of law.\" He urged, \"We need to accept this decision was the grand jury's to make.\" He later added, \"We need to recognize that the situation in Ferguson speaks to the broader problems that we still face as a nation.\"",
    " Title: Mueller's Indictment of Gates and Manafort Deepens Legal Peril for Key Figures in Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election has resulted in new criminal charges against former Trump campaign aide Richard Gates and President Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. The charges, unveiled on Thursday, accuse the pair of tax evasion, bank fraud, and money laundering.\n\nObservers had anticipated that Gates, a key figure in Mueller's investigation due to his close relationship with Manafort, might strike an agreement with Mueller to avoid trial. The superseding indictment released Thursday deepens the legal peril for Gates, potentially aiming to maximize pressure on him should he be wavering on cooperating with the investigation.\n\nSeth Waxman, a former federal prosecutor, stated that the timing of the filing is intended to continue ratcheting up the pressure on Manafort and Gates to cooperate with the investigation. Waxman suggested that the new filings signal to Gates that Mueller is not \"messing around.\"\n\nGates' testimony at trial could prove especially damaging for Manafort, as they worked hand-in-hand for over a decade, including on lobbying work for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine. Steven Cash, a lawyer at Day Pitney who specializes in criminal litigation and national security-related matters, noted that Gates' testimony would be like having the second-in-command of a company testify against the CEO.\n\nA plea agreement with Gates would put heavy pressure on Manafort to cut a deal of his own. If he flipped, it's possible he could give Mueller inside information about any contact between the Trump campaign and Moscow during the summer of 2016, a key period when Russia began orchestrating the release of hacked Democratic emails.\n\nTrump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia, describing the allegations as a \"hoax.\" Mueller's team first unveiled an indictment against Manafort and Gates in late October, which included bank transactions and accused them of money laundering, bank fraud, and other financial crimes stemming from work overseas that pre-dated their involvement in Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nFormer prosecutors suggest that Gates' testimony, should he choose to cooperate, could help prosecutors sort through their evidence against Manafort. He could also fill in holes in timelines and help walk prosecutors through some of the complex financial transactions that he and Manafort are accused of carrying out.\n\nThe possibility of Gates on the witness stand could be enough to get Manafort to cooperate with Mueller's prosecutors, which is likely their main goal. Manafort worked for Trump's campaign for six months before resigning under pressure in August 2016 over reports of his dealings with a pro-Russia oligarch in Ukraine. He was in the room for a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer who had promised Donald Trump Jr. damaging information on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign, and could provide inside information about any contact between the campaign and Russia.\n\nIf Gates were to strike a plea deal, he would be the fourth known witness to cooperate with Mueller's investigation, in addition to former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, and a California man ensnared in the probe for selling bank account numbers to foreigners committing identity fraud.\n\n\"I think the question is not are there going to be more indictments and guilty pleas. I think there will be,\" said Jack Sharman, a former Whitewater special counsel. \"The larger question is ultimately what is the relation of any of those offenses to the original core mission of the special counsel, who was appointed because of concerns over presidential campaign involvement.\"",
    " Title: Monsanto Ordered to Pay $289 Million in Damages in Glyphosate Cancer Case\n\nArticle:\n\nA California jury has ordered chemical giant Monsanto to pay $289 million in damages to Dewayne Johnson, a man who claimed that the company's Roundup and RangerPro herbicides, containing glyphosate, caused his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This is the first lawsuit to go to trial alleging a glyphosate link to cancer.\n\nThe jury found that Monsanto knew its weedkillers were dangerous and failed to warn consumers. The company denies that glyphosate causes cancer and intends to appeal against the ruling.\n\nDewayne Johnson, a groundskeeper, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2014. He regularly used a form of RangerPro while working at a school in Benicia, California. The implications of this verdict will be felt far beyond Monsanto's headquarters in Missouri.\n\nGlyphosate is the world's most common weedkiller, and the science about its safety is still far from settled. In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the World Health Organization's cancer agency, concluded that it was \"probably carcinogenic to humans.\" However, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) continues to insist that glyphosate is safe when used carefully.\n\nThe EPA's assessment has been questioned, with campaigners citing evidence of what they say was inappropriate industry involvement in the decision. Some Democrats have even called for a Department of Justice investigation into alleged collusion between government officials and Monsanto.\n\nIn California, where a judge recently ruled that coffee must carry a cancer warning, the agriculture industry sued to prevent such a label for glyphosate. In Europe, the battle over glyphosate has been fierce. French President Emmanuel Macron is trying to ban it despite the resistance of some French lawmakers and the fact that the European Commission recently granted the weedkiller another five-year license.\n\nThe jury found that Monsanto had acted with \"malice\" and that its weedkillers contributed \"substantially\" to Johnson's terminal illness. The jury ordered the agricultural multi-national to pay $250 million in punitive damages, together with other costs that brought the total figure to almost $290 million.\n\nJohnson's lawyer, Brent Wisner, said the jury's verdict showed that the evidence against the product was \"overwhelming.\" \"When you are right, it is really easy to win,\" he said, adding that the ruling was just \"the tip of the spear\" of future legal cases.\n\nIn a statement after the ruling, Monsanto said it was \"sympathetic to Mr. Johnson and his family\" but would \"continue to vigorously defend this product, which has a 40-year history of safe use.\" The company added, \"Today's decision does not change the fact that more than 800 scientific studies and reviews - and conclusions by the US Environmental Protection Agency, the US National Institutes of Health, and regulatory authorities around the world - support the fact that glyphosate does not cause cancer, and did not cause Mr. Johnson's cancer.\"",
    " Title: Investigation Intensifies Following Boston Marathon Explosions; Suspicious Incidents Reported Across U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nInvestigators are diligently examining remnants of the explosive devices used in the Boston Marathon bombings, which occurred on Monday. The remains include parts of one or two kitchen pressure cookers packed with nails, ball bearings, and black powder; a torn dark nylon backpack or duffel bag; and a circuit board, wires, and other parts from timing devices. The aim is to trace these items back to their point of sale and compile a list of potential buyers.\n\nA piece of a pressure cooker lid was found on a rooftop near the blast site, indicating the immense force of the explosion, according to a law enforcement official. The investigation involves scrutinizing numerous videos and photographs from surveillance cameras near businesses, as well as from marathon spectators' smartphones and television crews. As of yet, no one has claimed responsibility for the explosions.\n\nThe investigation entered its third day, and there were signs of national apprehension. In New York City, officials reported an increase in reports of suspicious packages. Similarly, in Oklahoma City, the scene of a devastating bombing in 1995, City Hall was briefly evacuated Wednesday morning due to a stolen rental truck parked outside. However, officials there confirmed that no bomb was present.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., parts of two Senate office buildings were temporarily closed as authorities investigated reports of suspicious letters or packages. The Secret Service also reported that a letter addressed to President Obama contained a suspicious substance and was intercepted at a screening facility outside the White House. A suspect was arrested Wednesday evening.\n\nIn New York, the police department received 143 reports of suspicious packages between Monday afternoon and midnight on Tuesday, marking an increase of over 300% compared to a similar time period last year, according to Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly.\n\nFurthermore, the John Joseph Moakley United States Court House in Boston was evacuated in the afternoon as officials called out \"code red\" and bomb-sniffing dogs were deployed inside.",
    " Title: Media's Portrayal of Hillary Clinton and the Benghazi Report: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's report on the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, has sparked a media frenzy, with headlines suggesting a negative impact on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, despite the report not directly implicating Clinton in the incident.\n\nThe Washington Post, for instance, stated that the report \"is likely to provide fodder\" for Clinton's political opponents, acknowledging that the only references to Clinton came from partisan Republicans in an addendum, not from the review itself. CNN's Wolf Blitzer described the report as \"fueling heated debate, partisan debate, about her leadership,\" while correspondent Elise Labbott suggested Clinton would \"have to address Benghazi during\" any 2016 campaign.\n\nJennifer Rubin, a Washington Post blogger, accused the media of being too \"incurious\" when it comes to Clinton, labeling Benghazi as Clinton's \"drip, drip, drip problem.\" Partisan Republicans, such as Sen. Marco Rubio, have used the report to call for further investigations into Clinton.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Clinton's name does not appear in the bipartisan portions of the Senate review. The question of \"leadership\" has been a lopsided one, with media outlets using the Senate report as an indictment of Clinton's leadership, while overlooking significant aspects of Clinton's actions following the tragedy.\n\nOne such overlooked aspect is Clinton's acceptance and implementation of the findings of the Accountability Review Board (ARB), an independent, nonpartisan review panel that looked into what went wrong and how to prevent a similar tragedy in the future. The ARB report, like the Senate report, also singled out bureaucrats, not the Secretary of State, for scrutiny over diplomatic security failures.\n\nClinton has acknowledged ultimate responsibility for any bureaucratic shortcomings that played a role in the Benghazi tragedy. \"I do feel responsible,\" she said under questioning by Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN). \"I feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department. I take it very seriously.\"\n\nThe Accountability Review Board's recommendations, largely in line with those contained in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report, are being implemented. Leaving out this fact from discussions of leadership is problematic.\n\nIt is crucial to consider the full context of Clinton's actions following the Benghazi attack, rather than focusing solely on a single question during her Congressional testimony. The media's portrayal of Clinton and the Benghazi report should reflect the entirety of the situation, not just the parts that fit a particular narrative.",
    " Title: Trump's Trade War with China: A Look at the Current State of Affairs\n\nArticle:\n\nIn March 2018, President Donald Trump declared that \"trade wars are good and easy to win.\" However, over a year later, it appears that Trump is losing the trade war he initiated with China.\n\nThe tariffs imposed by Trump on Chinese goods may have slowed China's economic growth, with most data sources indicating a slight dip in 2018. This slowdown could be due to government efforts to control credit growth, but many believe that Trump's tariffs negatively impacted business confidence and slowed investment.\n\nThe U.S., on the other hand, has also been affected by the trade war. The imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made products increased prices for American consumers and factories. Two studies by trade economists suggest that the losses to the U.S. economy are in the tens of billions of dollars annually.\n\nChina's retaliation has particularly impacted American farmers, with the country halting most imports of soybeans from the U.S. Inventories have piled up, agricultural exports have decreased, and farm incomes have declined. Desperate farmers have appealed to Trump for help, to which he responded with direct payments. However, relying on government aid is not a sustainable business model, and a wave of farm bankruptcies has begun.\n\nChina's autocratic regime and its residents' tolerance for economic hardship may have given it an advantage in a trade war with the U.S. A trade truce between the two countries, enacted in late 2018, left most of the U.S.'s significant goals, such as intellectual property theft, currency manipulation, forced technology transfer, and access to the Chinese market, unfulfilled.\n\nMeanwhile, the struggle to control the future of high technology is arguably even more important to the balance of economic power between the U.S. and China. The U.S. has been putting pressure on Huawei Technologies Co., China's leading telecommunications manufacturer, but Germany recently announced it would not exclude Huawei.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. has implemented export controls on many technology products. This could hurt Chinese tech in the short term, but in the long term, it could push China to accelerate its efforts to replicate and surpass U.S. technology.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's trade war with China appears to be losing ground on multiple fronts. The ferocious attacks have inflicted some damage, but China seems to be coping with the losses effectively. It appears that trade wars may not be as easy to win as Trump believed.",
    " Title: Court's Ruling on Trump's Twitter Account: A Closer Look at the Second Circuit's Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nEarlier today, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that former President Donald Trump cannot block Twitter users from following his @realDonaldTrump account. The decision, made by an ideologically diverse judicial panel, appears to be a straightforward application of conventional First Amendment law. However, this article will argue that the court's reasoning contains a crucial error, reflecting a fundamental misunderstanding of speech on private social-media platforms.\n\nBoiled down to its essence, the court's reasoning contained two key elements. First, it ruled that Trump's Twitter account represents an outlet for official communications and interactions that is controlled by President Trump. Second, it found that under these circumstances, Trump's decision to block users represents impermissible state action undertaken to suppress dissent.\n\nThe first element is fundamentally mistaken. By no traditional legal measure of \"control,\" Trump does not control his Twitter account. Twitter owns and controls his account, and he has no legal right to wrest control of it from Twitter. The court's misunderstanding of the platform is made evident by this deeply flawed analysis.\n\nThe fact that government control over property is temporary, or that the government does not \"own\" the property in the sense that it holds title to the property, is not determinative of whether the property is, in fact, sufficiently controlled by the government to make it a forum for First Amendment purposes. See Seattle Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad (1975) (holding privately-owned theater leased to and operated by city was a public forum). Temporary control by the government can still be control for First Amendment purposes.\n\nThere is no \"control\" at all, temporary or otherwise. When a politician rents a theater or other private venue, there is typically an exchange of money and a rental agreement that explicitly grants enforceable legal rights to access the property and control others' access to the property, and\u2014critically\u2014limits the landlord's power during the course of the rental.\n\nCompare that level of control to the absolute lack of rights the user has under Twitter's terms of service:\n\nWe may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or the Twitter Rules or Periscope Community Guidelines, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (iv) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable.\n\nThere is no exchange of money, the user has no right to the platform, and Twitter can not only eliminate your access entirely but censor any single tweet. If it chooses, it can even remove Trump's ability to block, mute, or take any other action. And that's not all\u2014when you use Twitter, your speech isn't even purely \"your\" speech anymore. Twitter grants itself the right to your communications, too:\n\nBy submitting, posting, or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).\n\nWriting in response to the trial court's ruling against Trump last year, law professor Greg Dolin compared Twitter to a radio call-in show that is hosting a government official as a guest. The politician has no right to be on the show, the host can send the politician packing at any time, and the host has ultimate control over not only the politician's presence but also any callers' speech. In other words, Trump remains on Twitter entirely at Twitter's discretion.\n\nIn that circumstance, there is no \"public forum.\" There is instead a public official using a private platform to attempt to amplify his specific message, with the permission of the entity that controls the platform. The court's ruling, in this circumstance, represents government intervention in Twitter's control of its own service. The court is overriding the permissions Twitter gave its own user.\n\nMoreover, the court gives short shrift to Trump's own free-speech rights under the government-speech doctrine. Again, to borrow one of Professor Dolin's analogies, \"If a politician is holding a rally in a park (a traditional public forum), it doesn't follow that he must permit critics to share the stage with him.\" The Twitter thread beneath any tweet can undermine or amplify the president's chosen message. So long as Twitter grants the user the ability to regulate his or her Twitter replies, then that regulation is an integral part of the user's expression.\n\nIf, say, Vice President Kamala Harris wins the White House and Twitter permits her to use its services to announce that she's forming a committee to study the feasibility of reparations for slavery, does she then have to allow that thread to be hijacked by white nationalists and other vile alt-right voices? I say no. The Second Circuit says yes.\n\nIt's common for social-media users to use phrases like \"my Facebook page\" or \"my Twitter feed.\" Yes, it is \"my\" speech on social media, but it is not my page or my feed. A private company is allowing a public official to use the private company's services to amplify his message. The private company is in legal control, not the public official, and if members of the public don't want to be blocked on a Twitter feed, they should take their objections to Twitter, not to federal court.",
    " Title: Local Woman Establishes Classroom Cafe to Empower Homeless and Refugees\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with our news outlet, Ms. Brodie, a 27-year-old resident of Park Slope, Brooklyn, shared her journey towards entrepreneurship and the establishment of a unique classroom cafe. The cafe, which serves as a platform for empowering the homeless and refugees, is part of a series of articles featuring local philanthropists and their inspirations.\n\nMs. Brodie's family has a history of food and service, with her grandmother publishing a well-known cookbook in South Africa in the 1960s to raise funds for the Union of Jewish Women. Her father taught her how to drive while transporting leftover food from local restaurants to shelters, and she often spent her Sunday afternoons giving cooking lessons to friends and delivering extra meals to shelters.\n\nAfter college, Ms. Brodie volunteered at a homeless shelter before working at the Human Rights Campaign in Washington. It was during this time that she developed the idea for a different approach to food distribution and service for the homeless and refugees. With no background in the food industry, she enrolled at the Institute of Culinary Education in Lower Manhattan and attended a food business boot camp in Harlem, also taking up shifts at restaurants.\n\nAfter discussing her idea with friends, meeting with philanthropists, and sending \"millions of emails,\" Ms. Brodie set up her classroom cafe in June. Nearly half of her students received job offers before they had completed the program.\n\nMs. Brodie's cafe offers a unique approach to empowering the homeless and refugees by providing them with culinary skills and job opportunities. The specific number of emails sent and the identities of the philanthropists she met with were not disclosed in the interview.",
    " Title: California Farmers Frustrated Over Delayed Payment for Land Seized for High-Speed Rail Project\n\nArticle:\n\nFarmers in California's Central Valley are expressing frustration over the state's seizure of their land for the construction of the high-speed railway and the delayed payment of hundreds of thousands of dollars owed for years. The California High-Speed Rail Authority, tasked with the project, has been criticized for offering farmers multiple excuses for the delayed payments and the constant changes in the project's plans, delays, and shifting costs.\n\nJohn Diepersloot, a fruit farmer who cleared a large parcel of his peach orchard for the train, told The Los Angeles Times that he is out-of-pocket a quarter-million dollars for infrastructure costs and has not received any payment for over a year. Mark Wasser, a Sacramento-based attorney representing more than 70 farmers and businesses affected by the project, stated that the authority has come back four times to change the land they want to take.\n\nRail authority officials acknowledge they have not yet paid numerous landowners, but have not provided a reason for the delay. Don Odell, the authority's chief of real property, said in a statement to Fox News that they strive to work closely with affected property owners and ensure they receive fair market value for their land and other expenses incurred due to the construction of the high-speed rail system.\n\nCalifornia's high-speed rail project has been plagued with delays, shifting plans, and questions over the cost and funding almost since its inception. The projected $79 billion project is years behind schedule, with the latest estimate for completion set for 2033. The bullet train planners have been under increasing pressure to make progress on the system that many believe had no plausible way of living up to its goal of getting riders across the state in three hours or less.\n\nIn February, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced he is putting the plan for a rail line between Los Angeles and San Francisco on hold in favor of a much-shorter line between the cities of Bakersfield and Merced. This move had Republican lawmakers in the Golden State calling for a referendum vote on the project. In his State of the State address in February, Newsom argued against the frequent complaint that the Merced-Bakersfield line would be a \"train to nowhere\" and said that a high-speed railway would \"form the backbone of a reinvigorated Central Valley economy.\"\n\nPresident Trump labeled the entire high-speed rail project a \"disaster\" and called for Sacramento to return the funds given to the state by the federal government. In March, the head of the state's rail authority fired back at Trump's effort to block more federal dollars from going to the California project. At that point, the Federal Railroad Administration had given California $2.5 billion to construct a Los Angeles-to-San Francisco link, with another $929 million pledged. However, federal authorities and the president claimed the terms of the federal grant had not been met and threatened to withhold any future payments while demanding repayment for the funds already doled out to California.",
    " Title: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo Faces Challenges as Democratic Party Shifts Left\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is heavily favored to win a third term as the state's governor, may face challenges as the Democratic Party nationwide increasingly aligns with progressive priorities. The incumbent Democrat spent $18 million to fend off an aggressive challenge from political novice Cynthia Nixon in the primary election.\n\nDuring the campaign, Cuomo agreed to restore voting rights for parolees and moved closer to marijuana legalization. However, some remain skeptical of Cuomo's recent shift towards more progressive policies.\n\n\"If he wants to have a chance in a Democratic primary, as Democratic voters really turn to the left, he\u2019s going to have to lay out some progressive credentials,\" said Patrick Egan, a politics professor at New York University. Cuomo has denied he will run for president in 2020.\n\nWhile Cuomo won easily against Nixon, the active challenge to his left nearly cost him his lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, who held off an unexpectedly strong challenge from an insurgent candidate. The primary election also resulted in losses for several Democrats in the state Senate who for years had caucused with Republicans, giving that party control of the state's upper chamber.\n\n\"Everything 'left' that he\u2019s done is basically because Cynthia pushed him to do it,\" said Mindy Rosier, a 43-year-old public school special education teacher from Manhattan and a Nixon supporter.\n\nThe election of President Donald Trump has sparked a call to action for voters on the party's left flank. Voters in more liberal states like Florida and Georgia have nominated more liberal candidates for governor's races, but the movement has also been seen in more conservative states.\n\nTeachers went on strike in Oklahoma and West Virginia earlier this year in efforts to secure higher pay, and voters later defeated some lawmakers who voted against those efforts in Oklahoma's state contests.\n\n\"One of the things I\u2019ve been most struck by is how the reaction to Trump has so deeply affected state-level contests, even at the district level,\" said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs.\n\nIn New York, progressive anger was centered in the challenges to Democratic state senators who had handed the state's senate majority to Republicans. Several of those incumbents lost on Thursday. It was part of an effort by Democrats to regain power at the state level after suffering dramatic losses in states during the Obama Administration.\n\n\"Senate Republicans have held New York back for too long, and the oncoming blue wave will elect a functional Democratic majority in November,\" said Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the senate minority leader, who supported the Democratic challengers.\n\nHaving a more liberal senate may help Cuomo, experts said. The governor said that \"nobody has stood up to Donald Trump like I have\" at a debate last month, and New York was not immune to the surge in voter turnout among Democrats seen across special elections and nominating contests in the last year.\n\nNearly 1.5 million Democrats voted in Thursday's nominating contest, compared with less than 600,000 in 2014. \"He was able to effectively run against Washington and the Trump administration, messaging that may have helped draw energy from Democrats eager to participate in elections this year to check the President,\" said Daniel Lewis, associate professor at Siena College.",
    " Title: Obama Names Susan Rice as National Security Advisor Amidst Ongoing Controversy over Benghazi\n\n Article:\n\n President Barack Obama announced the appointment of Susan Rice as his national security adviser on Wednesday, a move that has been met with criticism from Republicans over her initial account of the 2012 Benghazi terror attack.\n\n Speaking in the Rose Garden, Obama described Rice as a \"tireless advocate\" for advancing America's interests. Rice will replace Tom Donilon, who is stepping down from the post. Rice, the current U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, does not require Senate confirmation for the job.\n\n The ambassador was initially considered for the secretary of State position, which does require Senate confirmation, but withdrew from consideration amid the ongoing fallout over her role following the Benghazi attack. Rice appeared on five Sunday shows after the attack, stating that it was triggered by protests over an anti-Islam film, an explanation many lawmakers said at the time was inaccurate.\n\n The administration later acknowledged that there were no protests on the ground in Benghazi, though they have not officially ruled out that protests elsewhere may have played a role. Republicans have criticized Rice for her statements, with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) accusing her of \"misleading\" the public on Benghazi.\n\n The administration, under pressure from the media and Republicans, recently released the so-called \"talking points\" that showed officials drafting and re-drafting their storyline in advance of Rice's appearances. The intelligence community did cite demonstrations, but references to militant and Islamic extremist groups, and to prior security warnings and incidents, were ultimately removed after objections from various administration officials.\n\n It is unclear to what extent Rice was involved in this process. Officials, speaking in her defense, have stated that she was merely citing the assessment she was given on Sept. 16.\n\n Former Obama aide Samantha Power has been nominated to succeed Rice as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Power was an aide to the Obama campaign in 2008 but resigned after a report was published in which she called then-candidate Hillary Clinton a \"monster.\" Donilon is leaving the security adviser post after his wife took a job that involves a lot of foreign travel. He has been in the administration since the start, first as deputy national security adviser.",
    " Title: House Intelligence Committee Memo Alleges FISA Abuse and Raises Questions About FBI and DOJ\n\nArticle:\n\nA classified report compiled by the House Intelligence Committee, which has been described as \"shocking\" and \"explosive\" by Republican lawmakers who have read it, alleges extensive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuse. The report, which is classified as Top Secret, has raised serious questions about the upper echelon of the Obama Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), as well as the infamous Trump-Russia dossier.\n\nAccording to National security journalist and Fox News contributor Sara Carter, the memo contains information about the DOJ, FBI, and the Trump-Russia dossier. Carter also reports that sources told her \"they would not be surprised if it leads to the end of Robert Mueller's Special Counsel investigation into President Trump and his associates.\"\n\nTexas Rep. Louie Gohmert and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, among other Republican lawmakers, have spoken out about the contents of the classified intelligence memo. Gohmert tweeted a link to Carter's story, stating, \"Read the CLASSIFIED @ HouseIntelComm memo on repeated FISA warrant abuses. The truth may not set the guilty free but it needs to come out.\"\n\nGaetz also issued a statement on his congressional website, calling for the document to be released to the public. He wrote, \"The House must immediately make public the memo prepared by the Intelligence Committee regarding the FBI and the Department of Justice. The facts contained in this memo are jaw-dropping and demand full transparency. There is no higher priority than the release of this information to preserve our democracy.\"\n\nPennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry told Fox News, \"You think about, 'is this happening in America or is this the KGB?' That's how alarming it is.\" Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz said, \"I believe the consequence of its release will be major changes in people currently working at the FBI and the Department of Justice.\"\n\nNorth Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows told Fox News, \"It's troubling. It is shocking. Part of me wishes that I didn't read it because I don't want to believe that those kinds of things could be happening in this country that I call home and love so much.\"\n\nThe release of the memo and its potential impact on the ongoing Special Counsel investigation remains to be seen. However, the contents of the classified report have sparked concern and calls for transparency among Republican lawmakers.",
    " Title: Ryan's Focus Shifts from White House to Congressional Leadership\n\nArticle:\n\nRyan, the current House Budget Committee Chairman, has reportedly shown little interest in pursuing a presidential bid, according to his associates. Instead, he appears to be more focused on amassing power within Congress and promoting his signature Medicare plan and spending cuts.\n\nRyan's growing influence among House Republicans since his failed vice presidential run in 2012 is evident. He played a significant role in formulating the GOP's new debt ceiling strategy and is crafting a budget plan that will guide the GOP caucus on key issues.\n\nWith his growing power as Speaker John Boehner's unofficial wingman, Ryan seems to view national ambitions as potentially diluting his influence. Instead, he is considering a run for House GOP leader or even speaker, a possibility his associates suggest he has warmed to since the election.\n\nRyan is also cultivating a national political and financial network that could support him in any role. He recently met with Spencer Zwick, Mitt Romney's fundraising guru, who indicated that much of the 2012 donor base is ready to back him if he were to reconsider a White House run. Ryan also made a fundraising trip to Texas last month for his Prosperity PAC, meeting with top Romney donors who encouraged him to run.\n\nWhile some conservatives suggested Ryan challenge Boehner immediately after the election, he has no intention of doing so. However, in conversations with longtime associates, a subtle but significant change in Ryan's mood has been observed. He seems open to ultimately running for leadership, suggesting to two friends that this is the best and safest way to advance Medicare and budget cuts.\n\nRyan would not challenge Boehner or his No. 2, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, for their current positions. However, many Republicans believe Boehner may leave office in a few years, potentially after the 2014 election, to make way for the next generation of leaders. Ryan's current trajectory, running the Budget Committee until 2014 and then taking over the Ways and Means Committee, could provide the safest path to leadership.",
    " Title: Graham Calls for Special Counsel to Investigate FBI, DOJ Actions During 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has called for Congress to establish a special counsel to investigate the FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) over allegations of bias during the 2016 election. Graham's call comes as newly released documents reveal anti-Trump sentiment among FBI employees who handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server and the Russia investigation that became Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe.\n\nThe documents, which include transcripts of interviews with fired FBI agent Peter Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, show they were determined to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president and had discussed impeachment once he took office.\n\nGraham took to the Senate floor, stating that Mueller has had his chance to investigate Trump, and it's now time to scrutinize the other side. He plans to introduce legislation to create another special counsel for this purpose.\n\n\"There's more than smoking guns here. There's overwhelming evidence that somebody outside the political system should look into,\" Graham said.\n\nThe Mueller investigation appears to be winding down, and Democrats are pushing for the release of Mueller's final report. The Democrat-led House approved a resolution Thursday morning urging Attorney General William P. Barr to release Mueller's final report. The resolution passed unanimously.\n\nHowever, when Senate Democrats attempted to bring the issue to the upper chamber, Graham objected. He stated he would have allowed it if Democrats agreed to support the special counsel Graham wants, but Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) refused.\n\nGraham also announced that his committee will hold hearings on bias at the FBI and DOJ. He plans to investigate whether the FBI misled judges when it obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to spy on Trump campaign advisor Carter Page.\n\nThe hearings will focus on how the FBI obtained the warrant using a salacious, unverified dossier written by former British spy Christopher Steele. The dossier contains unsubstantiated claims about Trump's ties to Russia.\n\nThe FBI used the dossier as part of its argument to the court to obtain the surveillance warrant on Page, and used it in subsequent renewals of the warrant. The dossier claims Page met with Russian officials with ties to Kremlin strongman Vladimir Putin during the 2016 campaign. Page has vehemently denied the claim. It also claims longtime Trump fixer Michael Cohen met with Russians in the Czech Republic to coordinate plans\u2014a charge he has also denied.\n\nRepublicans have claimed the FBI has failed to disclose that the dossier's author was being funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign as opposition research. The dossier, along with texts between Strzok and Page, are among the Republicans' top evidence for alleged misconduct at the FBI and DOJ.\n\nThe House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees, when they were controlled by Republicans last year, called in Strzok and Page to testify about their behavior. Those transcripts were secret until this week, when Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, now the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, inserted them into the Congressional Record.\n\nIn a transcript released Thursday, Strzok stated his favorable opinion of Clinton did not influence the investigation into her use of her home server to send classified emails. However, he acknowledged that Clinton was not a target, subject, or suspect during the investigation. Instead, investigators viewed her as \"a critical player.\"\n\nStrzok also disputed assertions that his texts to Page showed animus toward Trump\u2014though his memory didn't align with that of Page, with whom he was having an extramarital affair at the time. She testified that a text she sent to Strzok telling him the Trump investigation would save the country from a \"menace\" referred to Trump. Strzok told the committee that he thought the menace was Russia.\n\nStrzok also disputed the meaning of the now-famous text in which Page fretted Trump would win the election. Strzok responded, \"No. No he won't. We'll stop it.\" This has been widely taken to mean the FBI would do what it had to do to prevent a Trump victory. While Strzok said in his testimony that he didn't recall writing the text, he did add that he believes the \"we\" he meant was the American voters.\n\n\"My answer 'No' was my personal belief that I did not think he would be,\" the fired agent said, adding later, \"My best sense looking at this text that I didn't recall until I read it very recently was that 'we' is my belief that the American people\u2014there is no way that they're going to elect him.\"\n\n\"What it is not is any statement that I would ever consider, let alone take any official action, to impact the presidency of the United States,\" he said.",
    " Title: Government Shutdown: A Familiar Specter in U.S. Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe specter of a federal government shutdown has returned to the United States capital, reemerging after a four-year absence. The news swept through the halls of Congress like a cold desert wind, stirring up memories of past political standoffs and bureaucratic chaos.\n\nThe catalyst for this latest drama, according to President Donald Trump, is $1.6 billion for a border wall. This, as you may recall, was the wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for. However, given the numerous assurances during the campaign that Mexico would fund the wall approximately 6,256,765 times, some confusion may arise as to why a government shutdown is being considered, and why not simply call Mexico?\n\nIf a government shutdown were to occur, it would be a unique event, as many politicians have expressed concern over the potential chaos and disorder that may ensue. Government shutdowns, we are told, will result in mass chaos, disorder, and tragedy. However, in most shutdowns, the majority of the government continues to function.\n\nSenator Jeff Flake, for example, stated, \"We don't need a government shutdown. That never ends well.\" This sentiment is shared by many politicians who were asked about the potential shutdown this week.\n\nLooking back to the last federal government shutdown in 2013, there was a record amount of media panic, coupled with an abundance of inside-the-Beltway weeping and gnashing of teeth. The assumption was that Republicans would never recover from the political capital they squandered while fighting over Obamacare funding, and that the 16-day shutdown would result in widespread misery.\n\nHowever, America survived the shutdown, and Republicans ultimately recovered from their post-shutdown poll dip and went on to take back the Senate. The nation, it seems, managed to dodge mass tragedy. Washington D.C. returned to its usual business of self-importance, back-slapping, business-card swapping, and squandering money.\n\nPerhaps, just perhaps, more than a few Americans realized that many government officials are full of hot air, and that expansive government bureaucracies aren't as important as they'd like you to think.\n\nUnfortunately, when the government winds don't blow their way, many people call for...wait for it...more government. The assumption being that as long as their team is in charge, everything will be okay. News flash: That's a bad strategy. Nevertheless, in today's combative political arena, so it goes. You can see it in the sudden rash of calls to \"rethink\" free speech. You can see it in the bizarre paeans to communism that keep popping up at the New York Times. (No, those headlines are not made up.)\n\nAs for the latest episode in the grand historic saga of government shutdowns, we'll have to wait and see. In the meantime, take heart: Here in Texas, the legislature is shut down every other year\u2014and that's by design. Somehow, we all manage to survive.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Seek to Delay or Repeal Parts of ObamaCare, Particularly the Medical Device Tax\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Democrats who voted in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, are now expressing concerns about the tax increases included in the legislation, particularly the medical device tax set to increase on January 1.\n\nWith influential constituent groups facing onerous tax increases, senators such as Al Franken (D-MN), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Charles Schumer (D-NY), Patty Murray (D-WA), John Kerry (D-MA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and others are aiming to delay or repeal parts of ObamaCare.\n\nOne of the first provisions to be repealed was the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) Act, a long-term care insurance measure that was initially booked as reducing the deficit. After the bill passed, Democrats realized it was a disaster and repealed the provision.\n\nAnother contentious provision was the \"1099 provision,\" which would have required small businesses to file additional paperwork for various transactions. This provision was also repealed.\n\nNow, health-care industry lobbies that supported the subsidy-and-mandate-laden bill are lobbying to kill the cost-control measures that offset the costs of its subsidies. The Independent Payment Advisory Board is a target for many providers, and the medical-device industry has convinced two Democratic Obamacare-backing Senators to try to kill the medical device tax.\n\nDavid Bowen, who helped to craft the legislation, stated that Senate Democrats had planned to provide insurance coverage first, \"knowing that that would bring on a cost battle second.\" The mandates and subsidies in RomneyCare, the Massachusetts health care reform law, caused health care costs to dramatically increase, leading to never-before-seen controls on insurers and health care providers as they also raised taxes.\n\nAs Senate Democrats have gotten a look at what is in ObamaCare, the parts of the law that were intended to control costs have gradually been stripped from the legislation. The medical device tax, in particular, has been a point of contention. The tax is a tax on gross receipts instead of a tax on profits, and the tax will be imposed even if a company sells its products at a loss.\n\nA recent study found that investment in medical research and development will fall by $2 billion per year because of the device tax\u2014and that is a cautious estimate. The tax's adverse effect on investment will keep expensive medical devices from becoming affordable and widely available in the future.\n\nMore immediately, the device tax will increase the prices of essential medical products for consumers. The actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services made it plain that Obamacare's \"fees and the [device] tax would generally be passed through to health consumers in the form of higher drug and device prices and higher insurance premiums.\"\n\nWhatever costs cannot be passed along to patients will be absorbed by the medical device companies, which will lead to job losses. One study found that, depending on the elasticity of the tax, the medical device industry will be forced to fire between 14,500 and 47,100 workers\u2014up to 10% of the workforce.\n\nWhile Democrats wanting to repeal the medical device tax is a step forward, the legislation still needs to be paid for to remain the law of the land.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney Announces Senate Bid in Utah, Faces Challenges Over Perception of Allegiance to Utah and Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the former Governor of Massachusetts, has announced his candidacy for the Senate in Utah, addressing concerns about being labeled a \"carpetbagger.\" In a video shared on social media on Friday, Romney emphasized Utah's unique qualities and the state's people's character, aiming to demonstrate his focus on the state rather than on the presidency or past aspirations.\n\nThough Romney is well-known in Utah and faces little competition from the Democratic party, two prominent Republicans have raised questions about Romney's alignment with Utah issues and his criticism of President Donald Trump. State Auditor John Dougall, one of these Republicans, suggested that voters are concerned about electing a senator who may not fully understand Utah-specific issues.\n\nDougall, who has expressed interest in challenging Romney, said in a telephone interview on Friday that Utah issues are distinct from those in Massachusetts. He added that Romney had contacted him to inform him of his impending announcement. Dougall declined to disclose who is encouraging him to run but implied that support would come from those opposed to aligning with Trump.\n\nEarlier this week, Utah Republican Party Chair Rob Anderson criticized Romney's criticism of Trump and questioned Romney's Utah credentials in an interview with the Salt Lake Tribune. Anderson later stated on Twitter that Romney satisfies all qualifications to run for Senate and would treat all candidates equally to ensure a fair nomination process.\n\nIn response to Dougall's comments, Romney's spokesperson did not immediately provide a comment. Dougall also noted in an email that Utahans have a favorable view of Romney and that the odds are in his favor.\n\nIn recent weeks, Dougall has been vocal on his Facebook page against a \"coronation\" of Romney, arguing that voters need to know Romney's stance on issues. Dougall stated, \"What we need is not somebody who doesn't like the president. I think the key thing right now is folks need to know what he stands for.\"",
    " Title: Romney's Foreign Policy Tour Aims to Highlight Differences with Obama, but Domestic Focus Remains\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer one-term Governor Mitt Romney embarks on a foreign tour, a trip that allows him to discuss his foreign policy positions, which may be more challenging to address in the United States where the focus is primarily on jobs and the economy. The tour includes stops in Israel, Poland, and London.\n\nThe visit to Israel, a region where President Obama has not made significant progress in the peace process, serves to highlight the anxiety surrounding the Arab Spring. Poland offers an opportunity to discuss the American relationship with Russia, an issue on which Romney has been critical of Obama.\n\nRomney's advisers are aware of the political risks of criticizing a sitting president abroad, but they believe he can make his points without explicit attacks. The trip also provides an opportunity to tap into the deep pockets of wealthy Americans living abroad, similar to John McCain and Obama's fundraising efforts during their campaigns.\n\nRomney may face questions about his foreign policy positions during the trip, which can be challenging for a candidate who is not well-versed in national security issues. His earlier claim that Russia is the nation's \"No. 1 geopolitical foe\" drew criticism from foreign policy experts and some Republicans.\n\nThe contrast with Obama is not entirely beneficial for Romney. The raid to kill Osama bin Laden and Obama's decisions to wind down the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have been widely popular. Romney's overseas trip could draw attention to these successes. Unlike Obama, who visited Afghanistan and Iraq as a candidate, Romney is avoiding both. However, this may not entirely insulate him from the need to address how his views differ from the president's on troop withdrawals.\n\nShifting the conversation to foreign policy goes against one of Romney's campaign imperatives\u2014to focus on the domestic economy. By traveling abroad, he is essentially taking his eye off the ball for a week. Romney will discuss economic issues, such as trade policy and the global banking system, but Americans who are struggling with job loss or mortgage payments may not find his comments relevant to their lives while he is abroad.\n\nIn contrast, President Obama will have the campaign trail to himself during Romney's foreign tour. Obama is making a West Coast swing across Nevada, California, Oregon, and Washington this week, and he will also stop in Louisiana before returning to the White House. Both candidates will speak early in the week at the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Reno, Nevada, but once Romney leaves for Europe on Tuesday, Obama will be the only one out on the trail.",
    " Title: Post-Election Lunch Meeting Between President Obama and Congressional Leaders at the White House\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama is hosting a lunch meeting with congressional leaders at the White House on Friday. This post-election gathering, following the power shift away from the president's party, has become a Washington tradition, albeit an often awkward one.\n\nThe details of the discussions between President Obama and congressional Republicans may remain undisclosed, but historical precedent suggests that the leaders will describe the meeting using diplomatic terms. For instance, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich once described a similar meeting as \"a very positive meeting.\" Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi referred to it as \"an extension of friendship,\" and former President George W. Bush called it \"a very constructive and very friendly conversation.\"\n\nSheila Burke, who was chief of staff to Bob Dole during his tenure as Senate majority leader, describes these meetings as \"Kumbaya with an edge.\" She notes that while there may be some awkwardness due to opposition or bitterness, the participants are professionals who ultimately want to legislate.\n\nThese meetings occur behind closed doors and can be frank, as the president does not want to concede defeat on his agenda, but the new majority has its own agenda and a mandate from voters. After his meeting with Clinton in 1994, Bob Dole stated, \"I think the president understands that we're going to hit the ground running.\"\n\nIn 2006, when Nancy Pelosi visited the White House after becoming the first female speaker of the House, President Bush congratulated her and acknowledged the challenges that remained. Pelosi, in response, spoke of the need to make progress and highlighted the Democratic Congress's plans to raise the minimum wage.\n\nThe relationship between Pelosi and Bush was solidified during the 2008 financial crisis, when Pelosi, at Bush's request, pushed through the financial industry rescue known as TARP. John Lawrence, Pelosi's former chief of staff, attributes the strength of their relationship to the level of trust and collaboration that was built, despite policy differences.\n\nPresident Obama's lunch meeting with GOP leaders on Friday will likely cover a range of policy issues, including Obamacare and immigration. In an interview with NPR's All Things Considered, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough expressed optimism about the meeting, stating, \"Judging from the conversations that he, the president, has been having and many of us have been having with our colleagues up on the Hill, I think it should be a productive conversation.\"\n\nNo information is available regarding the menu for the lunch meeting.",
    " Title: Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Kicks Off with \"America vs. Socialism\" Theme\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) commenced on Wednesday, adopting an \"America vs. Socialism\" theme to emphasize the perceived leftward shift within the Democratic Party, particularly its presidential candidates. The annual conservative gathering, held near Washington D.C., will feature speeches from President Trump, various conservative figures, and White House officials, with the aim of arguing against socialist policies.\n\nMatt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union (ACU), which organizes the event, stated in an exclusive interview that the theme is intended to highlight the question of whether the United States is a capitalist or socialist country. The conference, which runs through Saturday, aims to capitalize on the Democrats' internal divisions over big-government policies, as demonstrated during Tuesday's primary debate in South Carolina.\n\nFront-runner Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, faced criticism over his praise of Cuba's Fidel Castro and the high costs of his proposed policies. As the Democrats grapple with these internal divisions, Republicans are seeking to portray Sanders as the face of the opposition.\n\nSchlapp expressed concern that Democrats, such as Sanders, aim to \"transform America.\" He explained, \"Transform is an important word in that, they\u2019re not saying make America kinder and gentler, they\u2019re saying transform it\u2014keep some of the parts we like, but change everything else.\"\n\nSchlapp emphasized that the conference will focus on the relevance of conservatism in the current political climate, stating, \"We will focus at this conference on how conservatism is more relevant now than ever, because the belief values the individual human being and tries to undergird each one of our God-given rights\u2014the right to life, the right to private property, the right to chart the course for our own individual life.\"\n\nIn addition to socialism, the conference will address the impeachment effort against President Trump and what Schlapp described as a \"disgusting path from 2015 forward to stop Trump, lie about Trump, and eventually attempt a coup against Trump.\" The conference will feature presentations and speeches from Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Republican lawmakers, White House officials, and others from Trump's reelection campaign.\n\nAs per tradition, the conference will include a straw poll, allowing attendees to assess the president's performance. CPAC 2020 will conclude on the day of the South Carolina primary, the last early-state contest before Super Tuesday.",
    " Title: Midterm Elections: A Look at the Stakes and the State of the Parties\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming midterm elections on Tuesday will determine the balance of power in the U.S. Congress, with the Republican Party and the Democratic Party vying for legislative control. This article provides an analysis of the performance of both parties, focusing on their legislative accomplishments, economic growth, and handling of cultural issues.\n\nOn the Republican side, the party has two major legislative accomplishments under President Donald Trump's administration: the repeal of the individual mandate, the least popular element of Obamacare, and the tax overhaul that reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The tax cut, combined with Trump's deregulation efforts, has led to strong economic growth, with consumer spending, capital investment, and exports all on the rise. Unemployment has plummeted below 4%, and job openings outnumber the unemployed for the first time on record. Wages and salaries have risen 3.1% in the third quarter, the highest jump in a decade.\n\nOn the Democratic side, after the 2016 election, the party could have re-examined its agenda, but instead, it focused on undoing the outcome of the election. The party has been embroiled in a series of conspiracy theories and scandals, with figures such as Christopher Steele, Michael Wolff, Michael Avenatti, and Stormy Daniels making headlines. The Democrats have also been criticized for their handling of cultural issues, with some members promoting controversial figures and ideologies, such as the pussy-hat resistance's association with anti-Semitic figures, the promotion of the violent thugs of Antifa by DNC deputy chairman Keith Ellison, and Elizabeth Warren's claims of Native heritage.\n\nThe Democratic Party has also been criticized for its response to the migrant caravan, with some members remaining silent on the issue. This silence has been interpreted as a reflection of a party beholden to a borderless ideology that has little support among broad swaths of the country.\n\nIn conclusion, the Republican Party has earned the right to retain its majority in Congress, with two major legislative accomplishments and strong economic growth under President Trump's administration. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, has been criticized for its focus on undoing the 2016 election results, its handling of cultural issues, and its response to the migrant caravan. The midterm elections will determine the balance of power in Congress, and the performance of both parties will play a significant role in the outcome.",
    " Title: Democrats' Focus on Removing President Trump vs. Checks and Balances on Executive Power\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Democrats' failed attempt to remove President Donald Trump from office, a question arises: why have they not seriously considered the reverse - removing power from the president?\n\nOver the past 33 months, numerous behavior-specific explanations have been proposed for Trump's removal, including coordinating with the Kremlin, obstructing the Russia investigation, making \"racist comments\" about four congresswomen, accepting \"dirt\" from foreign governments, and the two impeachment articles: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\n\nHowever, there has been a lack of a structural critique of the ever-accumulating executive branch power itself. Democrats may dislike Trump's use of authority, but they do not seem to want less of it in the White House, especially when they regain power.\n\nDuring his response to Trump's State of the Union address, leading presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) criticized the tariff-happy president for not being punitive enough toward American companies. In her official Democratic Party response, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer focused on the executive actions taken by Democratic governors in defiance of their legislatures, rather than Trump's monarchical gestures during the speech.\n\nThe Democratic presidential field, with the notable exception of faltering front-runner Joe Biden, has been engaging in a race to see who can make the most elaborate promises of immediate executive action. Forget 100 days; we're now talking 100 hours to see what that magical Oval Office pen and phone can do.\n\nOn Day One, President Elizabeth Warren would wipe out student loans for 42 million people, ban fracking \"everywhere\" and block any future fossil fuel leases on public lands and offshore. A future President Sanders' Day One list is yet to be released, but it includes an executive order to \"legalize marijuana in every state in this country.\"\n\nWhile legalizing marijuana is a wonderful and long-overdue idea, Sanders' method of achieving it is not. Federal law, including the Controlled Substances Act, is constitutionally required to originate from or be struck down by either Congress or constitutional amendment. A presidency with enough power to legalize Activity X irrespective of Congress or the desires of states is a presidency with enough power to criminalize that same activity when the other team wins. It's a seesaw of authoritarianism, and we should all want to get off.\n\nCompared with the structural reaction against President Nixon's actions during the Watergate scandal, the personal response to Trump's imperial actions is remarkably different. After Watergate, Democrats (and some Republicans) went on a spree of pruning back the runaway executive branch. The 1973 War Powers Resolution, the 1974 Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, the 1974 upgrade of the Freedom of Information Act, and the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act were all enacted to reassert the legislative branch's authority and prevent governments from hiding their activities.\n\nHowever, presidents of both major parties, particularly during this century, have fought doggedly to break free from their institutional shackles. George W. Bush, with his high-ranking veterans from the Nixon administration, made rolling back the Watergate reforms a key philosophical aim. Barack Obama, after campaigning as a constitutionalist, made a mockery of war powers in Libya.\n\nAs Congress has become more partisan, it has been more willing to forfeit anything like the consistent application of constitutional prerogatives, particularly concerning the wielding of life-and-death military power. For anyone who would like to once again see an independent legislature, the 99% partisan impeachment process in both chambers of Congress is cause for despair. As is the Democratic presidential field's will to executive power. If ever America is to get off the populist seesaw, we're going to need to root less for politicians, and more for the rules and mores that can restrain them.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Discussions on Immigration Reform: Schumer, Ryan, and Gowdy Hold Private Talks\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic Senator Chuck Schumer has engaged in private talks on immigration with Republican Representatives Paul Ryan and Trey Gowdy. These discussions, which have not been disclosed until now, are part of an ongoing effort by key House Republicans to reach a deal with Democrats on immigration reform.\n\nThe talks, while not leading to any agreement on contentious issues like a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11.7 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, provide insight into the urgency and high stakes surrounding the immigration reform debate. These discussions are informal, serving as a means for Capitol power players to exchange private information.\n\nSen. Schumer and Rep. Ryan have met four times since 2013, discussing various issues, but immigration reform was a significant topic. Rep. Gowdy, a respected figure on the right who chairs the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, has also met with Schumer.\n\nIn response to inquiries about his discussions with Schumer, Rep. Gowdy's spokeswoman, Amanda Infield Duvall, stated, \"Congressman Gowdy has met with people of all political persuasions on immigration. He meets with people all the time on the issue.\"\n\nSchumer's office declined to comment on the talks with Ryan and Gowdy. A source close to the issue stated that Schumer and Ryan \"did not negotiate any specifics of House legislation at all in these meetings.\"\n\nThe White House is also monitoring the situation, with administration officials quietly trying to gauge the stance of House Republicans on immigration. Katie Beirne Fallon, the president's new legislative affairs director, discussed immigration with top aides and lawmakers in Republican leadership during her first rounds on Capitol Hill.\n\nDespite the ongoing discussions, there are no substantive, across-the-aisle talks as of yet. Even immigration reform's biggest advocates express doubts about a bill passing in 2014. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) stated, \"The biggest impediment to making progress on immigration that I've seen over the last year... is a complete lack of confidence that the law will be applied, that the enforcement measures will happen.\"",
    " Title: Protests Over George Floyd's Death Lead to Destruction of Confederate Monuments and Debate Over Property Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nDemonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd have resulted in the defacement and toppling of several Confederate monuments across various southern states in the past week. The latest incident occurred on Sunday evening in Birmingham, Alabama, where a statue of Confederate officer Charles Linn was destroyed in a public park.\n\nThe destruction of Confederate monuments is part of a series of vandalisms that have swept the nation. Other affected sites include the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument in Birmingham, which was defaced before authorities disassembled and relocated it; a Confederate monument on the University of Mississippi campus; a statue of General Robert E. Lee in Richmond, Virginia; Confederate statues in North and South Carolina; a 131-year-old statue of a Confederate soldier in Alexandria, Virginia, which was removed before any harm could come to it; and statues of Thomas Jefferson in Birmingham and Mayor Frank Rizzo of Philadelphia, which were vandalized.\n\nThe debate over the removal of these monuments centers on the perceived impact they have on civil unrest. Those advocating for their removal argue that their presence causes racial tensions, while those who support their preservation view them as symbols of state heritage. Protesters claim that the statues' removal will alleviate some racial tensions, while others are skeptical that the mere relocation of marble and bronze will solve underlying social problems.\n\nHowever, the deliberate destruction of public property is not an appropriate mode of protest, besides being illegal. The vandalism of Confederate statues is doing a far worse injustice than the states may have done by erecting them. Property, both private and public, is sacred, and nothing\u2014not anger, not resentment, not unrest\u2014can justify its violation. To vandalize property is to scorn a sacred principle of the American system and to reject one of the premises upon which our nation was founded.\n\nIn a republic, citizens are free to use their vote to change the way government makes its decisions. But one of the things that enables a civil society to function is that its citizens agree to submit to the state's judgment, even when they believe said judgment to be in error. It is this general agreement that keeps our civilization from descending once again into a Hobbesian nightmare.\n\nHowever, by vandalizing these statues, some protesters have shown that they will not abide by the government's decisions and are willing to break the law to prove it. This spurning of the rule of law is toxic to the health of any republic and, if it carries on unpunished or is even encouraged by officials, will continue to grow until bronze statues are not the only things getting hurt.\n\nHistory is rife with examples of revolutions that have disregarded basic rights to life and property. Such chaos has been commonplace since the French Revolution and the subsequent Reign of Terror. The events then and in many revolutions since serve as grim reminders that no matter how righteous one's cause may be, going beyond the law to address one's grievances can easily upset a nation's social and political order and lead to devastating and deadly unforeseen consequences.\n\nWhether in Birmingham or anywhere else, property, public and private, must be protected. If these Confederate statues truly are stirring up the discord accredited to them, then they should be removed in a manner to be determined by law\u2014the citizens of any of these states are free to change their laws and their representatives. And, if this is what citizens decide to do, then, regardless of whatever social value is lost or gained, there is nothing criminal in it. But the wanton defacement and destruction of public property witnessed this week is as inexcusable as it is unlawful and unethical, and such vandalism must not be permitted to continue.",
    " Title: Journalist Calls for Condemnation of Antifa and Prosecution of Its Members\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2017, the political culture of the United States experienced a significant shift, with reasonable individuals allegedly surrendering to unreason and political tribalism overtaking human decency. This is according to an opinion piece by an unnamed journalist.\n\nThe primary tragedy of the events in Charlottesville was the loss of a young woman's life. The secondary tragedy, as the author sees it, was the distortion of the political culture. The President of the United States reportedly declared some portion of neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and alt-right white nationalists as \"very fine people.\"\n\nThe author criticizes a portion of the left-wing intelligentsia for allegedly embracing their own thugs and supporting Antifa, a far-left-leaning anti-fascist movement. They are compared to the American heroes who stormed Omaha Beach, a comparison that, according to the author, did not age well.\n\nThe author, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, expresses his disapproval of Antifa, stating that their actions are not resistance or anti-fascism, but lawlessness and violent repression. He questions if authorities have ceded control of the streets in key American towns to a Marxist/anarchist mob.\n\nThe author calls for the condemnation of Antifa and the prosecution of its members, stating that their actions are evil and they do not occupy the moral high ground. He warns that if the basic truths of the evil nature of both violent Marxists and violent fascists are not understood simultaneously, the country may continue to tear itself apart.\n\nThe author also mentions David French, a senior writer for an unspecified publication, senior fellow at the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Institute, and an attorney, who has similar views on Antifa and the alt-right.",
    " Title: President Trump to Attend March for Life, First President to Do So\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump will attend the March for Life, an annual anti-abortion event in Washington, as announced on Twitter on Wednesday. The event, themed \"Life Empowers: Pro-Life is Pro-Woman,\" is scheduled for Friday.\n\nTrump will be the first president to attend the march, according to Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life. In 2018, Trump became the first president to speak at the march via video feed. The administration has consistently worked to regulate or restrict abortion access since Trump assumed office.\n\nMancini stated in a Wednesday statement that March for Life is \"deeply honored\" to welcome Trump to the group's 47th annual march. \"He will be the first president in history to attend and we are so excited for him to experience in person how passionate our marchers are about life and protecting the unborn,\" she said. A press release for the march indicates that Trump will speak at the event.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, and GOP Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey are also scheduled to speak at the march. Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List, described Trump's presence at the March for Life as a \"watershed moment\" for the Pro-life Movement.\n\nAbortion rights activists criticized Trump's announcement as a ploy to appeal to a minority of supporters on the issue. NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue called Trump's move \"an act of desperation,\" accusing him of \"turning to deception and disinformation about abortion to gin up a vocal and extreme minority as he faces the escalating reality that his presidency is crumbling around him.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund, the political arm of the nonprofit reproductive health care organization, tweeted that \"since day one, the Trump-Pence administration has sought to undermine our access to health care, including safe, legal abortion.\" The group added, \"But the 77% of us who support that access will have our say in November. Let's make sure that next year, he's there as a private citizen.\"",
    " Title: House Considering Vote on Short-Term Spending Bill and Obamacare Defunding; Senate Unlikely to Follow\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republican leaders are reportedly planning to vote this week on a short-term spending bill to fund the government and defund the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. This move increases the possibility of a government shutdown, as the Senate is unlikely to support any proposal that does not fund the health care law.\n\nThe proposed strategy, aimed at avoiding a showdown over the health care law, has faced resistance from hard-line conservatives who insist the spending bill prohibit all Obamacare funding. House Speaker John Boehner and other top House GOP leaders have been grappling with this issue, as they seek to avoid a government shutdown before the end of the fiscal year on September 30.\n\nNo decisions have been made, according to House Republican spokesman Michael Steel, who told CNN that discussions will continue among House GOP members tomorrow. House Republicans are scheduled to discuss the next steps on a vote on the \"continuing resolution\" Wednesday morning, with a potential Friday vote on a measure to fund the government through mid-December.\n\nHowever, the measure is unlikely to gain traction in the Senate, as majority Democrats have made it clear that any attempt to defund the new health care law is a non-starter. A senior House GOP aide expects Senate Democrats to strip the Obamacare defunding language and potentially send the spending bill back to the House with other changes.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has criticized House Republicans, invoking Albert Einstein's definition of insanity in reference to their repeated attempts to defund Obamacare. Another idea gaining traction is attaching a one-year delay of Obamacare to legislation that would raise the nation's borrowing authority.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has also weighed in on the issue, stating that some House Republicans are threatening to shut down the government if they cannot shut down the Affordable Care Act. He also noted that if this strategy does not work, some House Republicans have suggested they would not pay the bills that Congress has run up, which could potentially cause America to default on its debt for the first time in its history.\n\nLouisiana Republican Rep John Fleming stated that he is still awaiting details on the end game from GOP leaders on how this plays out as they near the deadline for the end of the fiscal year. Another Louisiana Republican, Rep Steve Scalise, said the battle to defund Obamacare should be waged on both the spending bill and the bill extending the debt limit.",
    " Title: North Korea Shifts Focus to Economy Amidst Regional Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea commenced its annual spring parliamentary session on Monday amidst escalating tensions in the region involving Pyongyang, Seoul, and Washington. In a surprising turn of events, the ruling party prioritized a stronger economy as a top national goal, alongside the expansion of its nuclear arsenal.\n\nRecent weeks have seen North Korea issuing a series of threats against the United States and South Korea, including plans to sever communication hotlines with the South and to launch military strikes against the U.S. mainland. The regime has also reaffirmed its commitment to retaining its nuclear weapons under any circumstances. However, the parliamentary focus on economic reform suggests that North Korea may not be as consumed by its own paranoia as its propaganda suggests.\n\nThe Associated Press reports a noticeable shift in North Korea's rhetoric towards a message that balances economic development with nuclear advancements. John Delury, a North Korea analyst at Seoul's Yonsei University, stated, \"There was a danger that this was getting to the point... of a permanent war footing. In the midst of this tension and militant rhetoric and posturing, Kim Jong-un is saying, 'Look, we're still focused on the economy, but we're doing it with our nuclear deterrent intact.'\"\n\nDespite North Korea's threat to close the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a site inside North Korea where South Korean companies and managers oversee manufacturing performed by North Korean workers, the complex remains open. South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper reports that the site was operational on Monday, defying Pyongyang's Saturday threat to \"mercilessly shut down\" the complex unless South Korea ceased actions perceived as damaging to North Korea's dignity.\n\nThe Kaesong Industrial Complex is a critical economic lifeline for North Korea, generating approximately $87 million annually from the wages of 54,000 North Korean workers. A worker earns an average of $134 per month, but most of the earnings go directly to the regime's coffers. The closure of the complex would significantly impact the livelihoods of North Korean workers and their families, as well as the residents of Kaesong and surrounding areas.\n\nMeanwhile, both the U.S. and South Korea have been demonstrating increased shows of strength in the region. South Korean President Park Geun-hye has stated that the country will respond powerfully to any provocation without political considerations, and that the military should be prepared for sudden and surprise provocations by North Korea. The U.S. has also sent a squadron of F-22 fighters to the region, and has flown various generations of bombers over the Korean Peninsula during ongoing Seoul-Washington war games, which have prompted strong protests from the North.\n\nReuters reports that the South has updated its rules of engagement to allow local units to respond immediately to attacks, rather than waiting for permission from Seoul. The U.S. has also deployed advanced aerial military technology to the region, including B-52s, B-2s, and F-22s, in what appears to be a display of military might amidst ongoing tensions.",
    " Title: ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson Emerges as Favorite for U.S. Secretary of State\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is reportedly zeroing in on ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as his nominee for the position of U.S. Secretary of State. Tillerson had a second interview with Trump on Saturday at Trump Tower, and has emerged as the favorite in the long-running competition to lead the State Department, according to a person familiar with the transition deliberations who spoke on condition of anonymity because Trump has yet to announce his pick.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Trump praised Tillerson, stating, \"He's in charge of an oil company that's pretty much double the size of his next nearest competitor. It\u2019s been a company that's been unbelievably managed.\" Tillerson's deals in Russia, particularly, are likely to draw scrutiny, given his personal relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe nomination of an oil executive like Tillerson would signal a departure from the global consensus on greenhouse gas emissions, as Trump has promised to cancel the Paris climate agreement negotiated by President Obama. Tillerson's Senate confirmation hearings would likely focus on his $2.2 billion investment in Russian oil exploration in the Arctic Ocean, which he negotiated in 2011.\n\nTillerson has worked for Exxon since graduating from college with an engineering degree in 1975, and has no previous governmental or diplomatic experience. However, as CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson has negotiated with countries all over the world for oil exploration rights, particularly in the Middle East and Russia.\n\nEnvironmental groups are expected to oppose Tillerson's Senate confirmation if he is nominated. The New York Attorney General is investigating whether ExxonMobil lied to investors and consumers about the risks of climate change from burning fossil fuels. Additionally, Tillerson's stance on human rights may also face scrutiny, as he was president of the Boy Scouts of America at the time when it began allowing gay scouts, and in 2015 ExxonMobil changed its anti-discrimination policy to include gays and lesbians. However, the Human Rights Campaign remains skeptical of the company's policy, stating it was prompted by Obama's 2014 executive order targeting federal contractors, not a change in corporate values.",
    " Title: New Survey Reveals Divergent Views on American Identity Among Democrats and Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nA new survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has found that there is a significant divide between Democrats and Republicans regarding what constitutes the American identity. The survey reveals that while both parties share some common ground, they differ significantly on various aspects of American identity.\n\nOne of the key differences lies in the interpretation of American identity. Republicans are more likely to view it as rooted in Christian beliefs and the traditions of early European immigrants, while Democrats tend to emphasize the country's history of cultural diversity and offering refuge to the persecuted.\n\nDespite these differences, a significant majority of respondents, regardless of party, believe that the U.S. is losing its identity. Lynele Jones, a 65-year-old accountant from Boulder, Colorado, who identifies as a Democrat, expressed this sentiment, stating, \"There's so much turmoil in the American political situation right now. People's ideas of what is America's place in the world are so different from one end of the spectrum to the other.\"\n\nThere are some areas of agreement among Democrats, Republicans, and independents about the American identity. These include a fair judicial system and rule of law, the freedoms enshrined in the Constitution, and the ability to get good jobs and achieve the American dream.\n\nHowever, significant gaps emerged in other aspects considered inherent to American identity. For instance, about 65 percent of Democrats considered a mix of global cultures as extremely or very important to American identity, compared to 35 percent of Republicans. Conversely, 29 percent of Democrats saw Christianity as that important, compared to 57 percent of Republicans.\n\nRegarding the issue of immigration, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to view the ability of people to come to the U.S. to escape violence and persecution as very important. This contrasts with the views of 55 percent of Republicans who hold this perspective.\n\nReggie Lawrence, a 44-year-old Republican from Midland, Texas, who runs a business servicing oil fields, expressed his view that the country and its Constitution were shaped by Christian values. He believes that as these values wane, so does the structure of families and ultimately, the country's identity.\n\nPatrick Miller, a political science professor at the University of Kansas who studies partisanship and polling, attributes these findings to long-standing differences in the U.S. between one camp's desire for openness and diversity and another's vision of the country grounded in the white, English-speaking, Protestant traditions of its early settlers.\n\nThe poll also found that Democrats were nearly three times as likely as Republicans to view the U.S. as a country made up of many cultures and values that change as new people arrive, with more Republicans favoring an essential American culture that immigrants adopt.\n\nThe survey also revealed that Republicans overwhelmingly viewed immigrants who arrived in the past decade as having retained their own cultures and values rather than adopting American ones.\n\nThe areas seen as the greatest threats to the American way of life varied between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats coalesce around a fear of political leaders, political polarization, and economic inequality, while most Republicans point instead to illegal immigration as a top concern.\n\nInterestingly, fear of influence from foreign governments was roughly the same on the left and right, with about 4 in 10 Democrats and Republicans alike viewing this issue as extremely or very threatening.\n\nThe poll, which was conducted between February 16-20, surveyed 1,004 adults using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.",

She claimed that the Castro regime, which has made no commitments to expand democratic principles on the island, can continue its dictatorial ways without making any concessions while the White House granted all the concessions the regime wanted.\n\nRos-Lehtinen also criticized the administration's handling of the case of Alan Gross, an American citizen who was arrested in Cuba and later released in a swap for three convicted Cuban spies. She argued that Gross should never have been in jail in the first place and that the administration's false equivalency in the swap failed to acknowledge that Gross was, in essence, a hostage while the Cuban Five spies, who endangered American national security, received full due process, including trial by jury.\n\nThe representative also criticized the administration's deal with Cuba for not including a voice for the freedom-loving people of Cuba. She quoted Jorge Luis Garcia Perez \"Antunez,\" a leader of the largest resistance coalition in Cuba, who stated that the deal was a betrayal that left the democratic opposition defenseless.\n\nRos-Lehtinen also highlighted the increase in political arrests in Cuba, with more than 8,400 arrests in 2014 at the hands of Mr. Castro's security forces. She also noted the administration's travel advisory for Cuba, which states that U.S. citizens traveling to Cuba should be aware that the Cuban government may detain anyone at any time for any purpose and that the Cuban state security or judicial systems will not carry out their responsibilities according to international norms.\n\nThe representative also criticized the administration's claim that the Cuban regime's engagement with the International Committee of the Red Cross is a success, stating that the Red Cross will not have access to Mr. Castro's gulags and will not be able to monitor prison conditions. She also pointed out that the administration's claim of the release of 53 political prisoners is misleading, as the Castro regime continues to arrest more people, as evidenced by the recent crackdown of more than 200 arrests on the island on International Human Rights Day on Dec. 10.\n\nRos-Lehtinen concluded by stating that the Castro regime will not change their oppressive tactics and will not loosen their grip on the island. She argued that the Obama administration's policy of dictator engagement has undermined the national security of the United States and sets a dangerous precedent that emboldens other desperate, sanctioned regimes. She called on the legislative branch to oppose this overreach of executive action and reaffirm the need to continue defending freedom and democracy everywhere in the world.",
    " Title: Jared Kushner's Unannounced Trip to Saudi Arabia Raises Questions Over Classified Information Sharing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn October 2017, Jared Kushner, senior advisor to then-President Donald Trump, made an unannounced trip to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to meet with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS). The meeting, which reportedly lasted until 4 a.m. on several nights, has raised questions about the nature of their discussions and potential sharing of classified information.\n\nAccording to reports by The Washington Post and The Intercept, Kushner and MBS discussed various topics during their late-night meetings. However, the specific details of their conversations remain unclear. After the meeting, MBS reportedly told confidants that Kushner had discussed the names of Saudis disloyal to the crown prince, according to three sources who have been in contact with members of the Saudi and Emirati royal families since the crackdown. Kushner's attorney's spokesperson has denied these allegations.\n\nFollowing the meeting, MBS launched an anti-corruption crackdown on November 4, 2017, arresting dozens of members of the Saudi royal family and imprisoning them in the Ritz-Carlton Riyadh. Several figures named in the President's Daily Brief were among those rounded up, with at least one reportedly being tortured.\n\nNow, Congressional Democrats have asked FBI Director Christopher Wray to investigate whether Jared Kushner leaked classified information from the Presidential Daily Brief to MBS. In a letter to Wray, Democratic Reps. Ted Lieu, Gerald Connolly, Donald Beyer, Pramila Jayapal, Peter Welch, and Ruben Gallego requested an immediate investigation to determine the accuracy of the reports and to explore the extent to which information and sources may have been compromised.\n\nThe letter notes that the \"integrity of classified information\" falls within the purview of the FBI, but that \"while the President has the authority to declassify and share information, the President's advisers do not.\" If Kushner discussed names with MBS as an approved tactic of U.S. foreign policy, the move would be a striking intervention by the U.S. into an unfolding power struggle at the top levels of an allied nation. If Kushner discussed the names with the Saudi prince without presidential authorization, however, he may have violated federal laws around the sharing of classified intelligence.\n\nIt is worth noting that, only months before the meeting, Jared Kushner sought a $500 million loan from officials in Qatar for a troubled New York City real estate project. The FBI's investigation into Kushner's actions could potentially shed light on whether he was trading classified information for financial benefits. Over the past two years, Kushner has reportedly sought substantial overseas investment from various sources, including South Korea's sovereign-wealth fund, France's richest man, Israeli banks and insurance companies, and a Saudi developer, among others.\n\nThe FBI's investigation into Jared Kushner's actions is crucial in determining the accuracy of the allegations and the potential implications of his actions on U.S. foreign policy and national security.",
    " Title: Texas Governor Abbott Clarifies New Sanctuary City Law, Rejects Constitutionality Claims\n\nArticle:\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott has clarified the implications of the recently signed bill that outlaws sanctuary jurisdictions in the state, addressing concerns about its constitutionality and its impact on American citizens.\n\nDuring an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas, Abbott emphasized that the law creates civil and criminal penalties for those who refuse to cooperate with immigration officials, including jail time for sheriffs or police chiefs who release criminal aliens subject to an immigration detainer.\n\nAbbott countered claims by Democrat legislators and left-of-center Texas news outlets that the law is unconstitutional due to states being pre-empted by federal law in the area of immigration. In response to an article published in the Dallas Morning News, Abbott stated that the article \"directly misstated what the legal status of this law was out of the U.S. Supreme Court \u2013 in the Arizona decision.\"\n\nAbbott explained that the controversial \"show me your papers\" component, which some label as the law's most contentious aspect, is not as strict as the Arizona law. While the Arizona law required law enforcement to ask for papers, the Texas law does not require it, but allows it. Abbott emphasized that the \"controversial part of this law has been ruled on by the U.S. Supreme Court and upheld.\"\n\nThe governor reassured American citizens living in Texas that the bill has no impact on their daily lives, stating, \"For American citizens, this bill has no impact on them whatsoever.\" He clarified that the law targets only people who are in the country illegally, have committed violent crimes, and are subject to an ICE detainer request.\n\nThe law's author, Senator Charles Perry (R-Lubbock), confirmed that police can already inquire about the immigration status of a person they detain, and this bill does not change that. He also stated that citizens and legal residents do not need to carry papers to prove they are in the country legally.\n\nThe new law poses penalties for law enforcement officials who ignore detainer requests on illegal immigrants in their jails from immigration officials. Abbott stated, \"All law enforcement officers are going to be required to follow this law. If they refuse to follow this law, or if they adopt sanctuary city policies, they are subject now to the stiffest penalties in America for adopting sanctuary city policies.\"\n\nReferring to Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez and Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez, who have either ignored or threatened to ignore immigration detainers, Abbott said they must come into compliance with the law. If they do not change their policies, they will be in violation of the law and subject to its penalties.\n\nGovernor Abbott believes this law will make Texas a safer place and help avoid tragedies like the murder of Kate Steinle by a previously deported illegal alien released from the local jail in the sanctuary city of San Francisco. He stated, \"This law makes Texans safer because it prevents the types of policies that California has that lead to the tragic murder of Kate Steinle.\"\n\nThe new sanctuary city law goes into effect on September 1, 2017.",

That's what we do. But I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that's the balance that the government has to decide.\"\n\nRegarding the question of whether he thinks some vaccines are dangerous, Mr. Christie clarified that he did not make such a statement. \"I said different disease types can be more lethal, so that the concern would be measuring whatever the perceived danger is by vaccine and we've had plenty of that over a period of time versus what the risk to public health is. You have to have that balance, and that's exactly what I mean by what I said,\" he explained.\n\nHis office later issued a clarification on the remarks, stating that Mr. Christie believes vaccines are an important public health protection. Regarding measles, there is \"no question\" children should be vaccinated, according to the clarification. However, different states have varying requirements on vaccinations, which is why Mr. Christie called for a balance in determining which ones should be mandated by the government.\n\nIn a separate interview with NBC's Savannah Guthrie, President Obama advised parents to get their kids vaccinated, stating that measles is \"preventable\" and that the science is \"pretty indisputable.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Support for Intelligence Community Amidst Allegations of Russian Election Interference\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast to President-elect Donald Trump's criticism of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) following reports of Russian election interference, the two top Republicans in Congress have offered strong support for the intelligence community. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have praised the intelligence agencies for their work and warned against using the issue for partisan gain or casting doubt on the outcome of the election.\n\nMcConnell, in a statement to reporters, expressed his \"highest confidence\" in the intelligence agencies, while praising the Central Intelligence Agency specifically. He stated that the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services panels will investigate findings by intelligence agencies that Russia hacked into emails and computers used in the presidential campaign.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, in a statement, praised the intelligence agencies for \"working diligently\" to take on cyber threats from foreign governments. He also emphasized the need to protect the democracy from foreign influence and avoid casting doubt on the election results.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Friday that the CIA has told senators that Russian President Vladimir Putin's government was actively seeking to help Trump win the election, a step beyond an earlier finding that the goal was to undermine the credibility of the U.S. political process.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, in an appearance on Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show With Trevor Noah,\" explained his reasons for ordering a full review of the evidence of Russian hacking. He stated that the review aims to gather all the threads of the investigations and put them in a single document that can be shared with members of Congress, relevant intelligence agencies, and the transition team.\n\nTrump's team has attacked the CIA for its findings and questioned the credibility of the agency. Trump's spokesman, Jason Miller, didn't comment directly on McConnell's remarks when asked by reporters on a conference call, but criticized the reports about the CIA's findings, stating that it is an attempt to de-legitimize President-elect Trump's win.\n\nThe White House defended the intelligence community, with press secretary Josh Earnest stating that spy agencies are staffed by \"patriots.\" He added that President Obama has benefited enormously from their work, expertise, advice, and service to the country.\n\nSenate Armed Services Chairman John McCain and the incoming Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, have stated that the Senate will investigate Russia's interference in the presidential election. A small group of Electoral College members, including Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, has requested a briefing from the intelligence community on the possible scope of Russian interference in the U.S. election.\n\nThe allegations concerning Russia have taken on new significance now that Trump is considering Exxon Mobil Corp. chief Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. Tillerson is known for having ties to Putin, and the oil chief was awarded Russia's Order of Friendship, a high civilian honor given to distinguished foreign nationals. If Trump does nominate Tillerson, the Russian allegations could pose problems for his Senate confirmation, even for some Republicans.",
    " Title: Obama Prepares for Fiscal Cliff Negotiations with Historical Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama is set to engage in a series of challenging negotiations regarding the debt ceiling and the impending fiscal cliff. Lawmakers have until December 31 to reach a deal to prevent $700 billion in federal budget cuts, which could potentially lead to a recession and set the tone for the beginning of Obama's second term.\n\nAccording to NPR's Mara Liasson, Obama is approaching these talks with clear bottom lines and is not making initial concessions as he did during the stimulus package negotiations in 2011. Liasson suggests that the president is using lessons learned from the failed debt ceiling talks in 2011 in these new negotiations.\n\nThe fiscal cliff discussions will contribute to Obama's legacy, a topic that presidents often consider. During his first three years in office, Obama hosted small dinners at the White House with noted presidential historians, including Doris Kearns Goodwin, Robert Caro, Michael Beschloss, and Robert Dallek. The purpose of these dinners was not just for historical discussion, but to provide the president with historical perspective on his predecessors.\n\nJodi Kantor, who reported on the dinners for The New York Times, stated that the conversations were not idle, but aimed at giving the president strategic advice and learning from the mistakes and triumphs of his predecessors. The historians primarily focused on transformative presidents such as Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan.\n\nDuring the third dinner, historian H.W. Brands suggested that President Obama might find a better model for his presidency in Theodore Roosevelt. Brands noted that Roosevelt was able to push the country and the government in a progressive direction while presiding over 7 1/2 years of peace and prosperity. Roosevelt also dealt with a hostile Congress and, despite being a Republican, supported universal health care.\n\nThe historians were honest with Obama, telling him that there was one quality they wished he shared more with Theodore Roosevelt: forging a day-to-day relationship with the American people. The president took this advice to heart, as evidenced by his quotation of Theodore Roosevelt during his vision for a second term in Osawatomie, Kansas.\n\nThe upcoming fiscal cliff negotiations may present another opportunity for Obama to channel some of that inner Roosevelt as he negotiates with the same members of Congress as in 2011. The difference this time is the legacy that both Obama and those involved in the debt talks will leave behind.",
    " Title: AOC Defends Campaign Activities Amidst Debate Cancellation and Alleged Election Law Violation\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has defended her campaign activities amidst criticism over her decision to cancel an in-person debate and allegations of election law violation. Ocasio-Cortez, who is facing primary challenger Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, stated that she is not skipping debates, in contrast to her predecessor, Joe Crowley, who infamously skipped debates in 2018.\n\nHowever, Ocasio-Cortez has cancelled an in-person debate scheduled for Wednesday, citing social distancing rules. The representative explained that the debate might violate the phase one and phase two reopening guidelines set by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has allowed gatherings of up to 10 people since mid-May.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has participated in two online virtual debates with her primary challengers, including one on May 18. The Parkchester Times-sponsored debate, which was the same one Crowley shirked in 2018, was cancelled due to the social distancing concerns.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ocasio-Cortez has been active in George Floyd protests and hosted a socially distanced graduation party in a church parking lot on Sunday. The event, which included free burgers, balloon animals, and a DJ, was held next to an early voting site, leading to allegations of election law violation from Ocasio-Cortez's challenger.\n\nCaruso-Cabrera's spokesman, Hank Sheinkopf, accused Ocasio-Cortez of violating the election law, stating, \"AOC directly violated the election law. She doesn\u2019t pay her taxes. She said yes to a salary increase. Who wants this type of person in Congress when we\u2019re all in trouble?\"\n\nIn response to the allegations, a representative for Ocasio-Cortez did not return a request for comment. After the allegations, Ocasio-Cortez moved the party a block away from the early voting site. The specifics of the alleged election law violation remain unclear.",
    " Title: Google Employees Call for Cancellation of Military AI Project, Citing Ethical Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nThousands of Google employees have signed an open letter urging the internet giant to cease work on a military project known as Project Maven. The project involves the use of artificial intelligence to enhance the precision of military drone strikes. The letter, addressed to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, states, \"We believe that Google should not be in the business of war.\" The letter further requests that Project Maven be terminated and that Google establish, publicize, and enforce a clear policy prohibiting the development of warfare technology.\n\nThe letter, which has been signed by 3,100 employees, including \"dozens of senior engineers,\" according to the New York Times, claims that staff have already raised concerns with senior management internally. Google employs over 88,000 individuals worldwide.\n\nIn response to the concerns, Diane Greene, head of Google's cloud business, assured employees that the technology would not be used to launch weapons or operate or fly drones. However, the employees who signed the letter argue that Google is putting users' trust at risk and disregarding its \"moral and ethical responsibility.\"\n\n\"We cannot outsource the moral responsibility of our technologies to third parties,\" the letter states. \"Google's stated values make this clear: every one of our users is trusting us. Never jeopardize that. Ever.\"\n\nThe letter continues, \"Building this technology to assist the US government in military surveillance - and potentially lethal outcomes - is not acceptable.\"\n\nGoogle confirmed in March, following an investigative report by tech news site Gizmodo, that it is allowing the Pentagon to use some of its image recognition technologies as part of a military project. A Google spokesperson told the BBC, \"Maven is a well-publicized Department of Defense project and Google is working on one part of it - specifically scoped to be for non-offensive purposes and using open-source object recognition software available to any Google Cloud customer.\"\n\nThe spokesperson further explained, \"The models are based on unclassified data only. The technology is used to flag images for human review and is intended to save lives and save people from having to do highly tedious work.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added, \"Any military use of machine learning naturally raises valid concerns. We're actively engaged across the company in a comprehensive discussion of this important topic and also with outside experts, as we continue to develop our policies around the development and use of our machine learning technologies.\"\n\nGoogle is currently working on establishing policies for the use of its artificial intelligence technologies.",
    " Title: Senate Approves McConnell's Impeachment Trial Plan, Setting Stage for Trump's Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate, in a party-line vote of 53 to 47, ratified Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's impeachment trial plan early on Wednesday, paving the way for the trial against President Donald Trump to commence as early as Wednesday. The Senate rejected ten other amendments proposed by Democrats by the same margin. An 11th amendment, which aimed to extend the timetable for the prosecution and defense to file trial motions, received the support of one Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, but still failed.\n\nThe trial centers around charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, which were approved by the Democratic-led House last month. The charges allege that President Trump used the power of his office to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rivals, withholding military aid and a White House meeting as leverage. The president then sought to conceal his actions from Congress by blocking witness testimony and documents, according to the charges.\n\nPresident Trump's legal team argues that the charges are baseless and that they criminalize a president's prerogative to make foreign policy as they see fit. The team also claims that the impeachment is unconstitutional because the articles of impeachment do not outline a specific violation of a law.\n\nOn Tuesday, the debate focused primarily on what would constitute a fair trial. \"This initial step will offer an early signal to our country,\" Mr. McConnell said before the debate began. \"Can the Senate still serve our founding purpose?\"\n\nSenator McConnell also received a reminder about the limits of his power to control an inherently unpredictable proceeding. Under pressure from Republican moderates, he was forced to make some last-minute changes to the rules he unveiled on Monday, which would have compressed opening arguments by both sides into two 12-hour marathon days. Mr. McConnell's rules also would have refused to admit the findings of the House impeachment inquiry as evidence without a separate vote later in the trial.",
    " Title: Graduate Student Workers at Harvard End Strike Despite Lack of Contract Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nGraduate student workers at Harvard University have ended their 29-day strike, returning to work on Wednesday, despite not reaching an agreement with the university on a new contract. The union representing the school's graduate student employees, the Harvard Grad Students Union-UAW, has hailed the strike as a victory, citing agreements in negotiations and a statement from Harvard that named the end of January as a possibility for finalizing a contract.\n\nThe strike, which began on December 3, involved thousands of graduate student workers, including teacher assistants, teaching fellows, tutors, and researchers. The work stoppage marked the first strike of graduate students on the Ivy League campus since 1973 and threatened some of the university's educational operations during a critical moment of the school calendar.\n\nIn an email to supporters on Monday, members of the bargaining committee of the Harvard Grad Students Union-UAW vowed to \"hold them accountable to this stated goal.\" The move to call off the strike came after the union agreed with Harvard to let federal mediators assist in negotiations. The school's spring semester begins this month.\n\nThe union's demands include a $25-an-hour minimum wage, expanded health care benefits, and stronger protections against sexual harassment and discrimination with a new third-party arbitration process for complaints. Talks with Harvard officials had lasted more than a year prior to the strike.\n\nDuring the strike, union leaders said Harvard threatened student workers instead of agreeing to protections against workplace abuse, spent money on police details instead of health care, and canceled exams and moved to Scantron tests instead of agreeing to fair pay.\n\nThe university has proposed compensation changes that would include 8.2% raises over three years for research assistants and 7.2% for teaching fellows, in addition to a $17 per hour minimum wage for instructional work. The current rate is $12 per hour. Harvard has also proposed a new financial assistance fund totaling $100,000 per year for reimbursement under Harvard's insurance plan, which includes co-pays for mental health visits. The graduate student union has drawn support from Democratic politicians, including presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.",
    " Title: White House Releases Transcript of First Trump-Zelensky Call, Preceding Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has released a transcript of President Donald Trump's first phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a brief congratulatory conversation that took place on April 21, 2019, and lacks the controversy of their later call that led to an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe initial phone call, which took place aboard Air Force One, began with President Trump congratulating President Zelensky on a \"job well done\" and on \"a fantastic election.\" In response, President Zelensky expressed gratitude and acknowledged the U.S. as a great example.\n\nDuring the six-minute conversation, President Trump expressed confidence in President Zelensky's ability to do a great job, mentioning that he has many friends in Ukraine who expect him to win. The second call, on July 25, included President Trump asking President Zelensky to investigate a company tied to the 2016 Democratic National Committee hacking and Democrat Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham stated that the president \"took the unprecedented steps to declassify and release the transcripts of both of his phone calls with President Zelensky so that every American can see he did nothing wrong.\" The transcript was read in full by Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, during the second public impeachment hearing on Friday.\n\nCommittee Chairman Adam B. Schiff expressed gratitude for the transcript's release but quickly turned to demand the Trump administration release the rest of the documents Congress requested throughout the inquiry. In the April call, President Trump extended an invitation to President Zelensky to visit the White House, which was accepted. President Zelensky also invited President Trump to attend his inauguration. President Trump responded that he would consider it, but said \"at a very minimum, we\u2019ll have a great representative.\"\n\nThe full transcript of the April call can be found in the article's source.",
    " Title: FBI Takes Possession of Hillary Clinton's Email Server, Server Reportedly Found to be Blank\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has taken possession of the personal email server used by Hillary Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State, according to a report by The Washington Post. Barbara Wells, an attorney for Denver-based computer services firm Platte River Networks, confirmed that federal agents picked up the server from a private data center in New Jersey on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post, Wells revealed that the server \"was blank\" and no longer contained useful information. She explained that the information had been migrated over to a different server for purposes of transition. According to Wells, the data on the old server is not available on any servers or devices in Platte River Network's control.\n\nThe Justice Department is reportedly investigating whether classified information was improperly stored on or passed through the server, which Clinton used for all her correspondence during her time as Secretary of State. In March, Clinton declared that the private server would never be turned over, citing personal emails between herself and her husband Bill Clinton, as well as details about her daughter's wedding.\n\nIt is important to note that the server was not secure, and it is illegal to send or receive classified information on a private email account or server. Earlier this week, it was reported that Clinton had at least two classified, top-secret emails hosted on her server. The FBI's investigation into the matter is ongoing.",
    " Title: House GOP Report Questions Hillary Clinton's Awareness of Security Issues in Benghazi\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republicans have released a new report that alleges former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was aware of security problems in Libya prior to the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi. The report also questions the validity of the State Department's own internal review, known as the Accountability Review Board (ARB), stating it had serious deficiencies.\n\nThe report suggests that Clinton should have been held accountable for security breaches that led to the deaths of four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya. The report concludes, \"Systemic failures at the State Department during Secretary Clinton's tenure resulted in a grossly inadequate security posture in Benghazi, which contributed to the deaths of four Americans, including the first U.S. ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979.\"\n\nThe report points to Clinton's own testimony that she was aware of the security concerns in Benghazi, though other reviews have stated she was never made aware of the specifics, including some of the requests for additional security or military protection that were denied.\n\nHouse Republicans are determined to keep Benghazi as a political issue in 2014, with House Speaker John A. Boehner announcing a new website, www.gop.gov/benghazi, designed to catalog various Benghazi reports and highlight questions the Republicans believe are still unanswered.\n\nA review released last month by the Senate intelligence committee, run by Democrats, also found that the State Department should have done more to boost security. However, that review laid more blame on Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who the report said failed to ask for stiffer security in the immediate run-up to the attack. Stevens was killed in the initial assault.\n\nThe report appears to be aimed at raising questions about Clinton in particular, as she is considering another run for the White House in 2016. The report contrasts the State Department's performance with that of the Defense Department, which the investigators said \"held military commanders accountable for what happened on their watch in Afghanistan.\" The specifics of Clinton's involvement and the extent of her knowledge remain a matter of debate.",

Journalist Michael Tracey, who has been covering the events, has provided a firsthand account of the destruction and its effects on the community.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Tracey shared images and videos of the devastation in Minneapolis, including boarded-up businesses, looted stores, and the remains of the Minneapolis Third Police Precinct building. He noted that many businesses, such as a grocery store owned by an Iranian individual, a Halal market, and a wig shop, were targeted and had their entire inventory stolen.\n\nTracey also spoke with local business owners, including the Somali owner of a small deli who shared that his security fired shots to fend off the rioters. The deli owner noted that the instigators were primarily white, while the blacks hung back. He also mentioned that he had not seen a single police officer or patrol car during his five-day stay in the Minneapolis/Saint Paul area.\n\nIn addition to the physical destruction, Tracey also documented the emotional toll the riots have taken on the community. He shared images of a former dental office that provided care to underprivileged children and the uninsured, which was completely destroyed.\n\nTracey suggested that the extensive damage caused by the riots may not be receiving adequate coverage in the media due to potential political implications. He stated that the scope of the violence and destruction might be seen as helping President Trump, who has promised to maintain law and order during the chaos.\n\nThe riots in Minneapolis have led to a resurgence of Black Lives Matter protests and have been accompanied by looting and historical revisionism. The events have resulted in charges being filed against the officers involved in George Floyd's death, with Derek Chauvin being charged with second-degree murder and the three other officers being charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.",
    " Title: Organizations Urge Commemoration of Sandy Hook Anniversary, Push for Gun Control Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy last year, the nation mourned together. As the anniversary of the tragic event approaches on December 14, organizations such as Organizing for Action (OFA) and the White House are encouraging communities to come together in remembrance and reflection.\n\nOFA, a non-profit organization founded by former President Barack Obama, has been reaching out to supporters, urging them to host remembrance events in their communities. The events aim to commemorate the 26 lives lost at Sandy Hook and call for action to prevent future gun violence.\n\nOFA's email to supporters states, \"By hosting a Newtown Anniversary event, you are joining thousands of Americans across the country as we remember the tragic events that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School one year ago.\" The organization promises to provide resources and support for these events.\n\nSimilarly, an email from Vice President Joe Biden, sent through WhiteHouse.gov, focuses on President Obama's gun control executive orders and the need for further gun control measures. The email highlights the progress made in implementing the 23 executive actions announced by President Obama in January, which aim to keep guns out of dangerous hands, provide support for school resource officers, and reduce the stigma around mental illness.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that none of the gun control measures mentioned in the emails would have prevented the Sandy Hook tragedy or other similar incidents. These incidents were not related to gun trafficking or the lack of universal background checks, as Vice President Biden suggests. Furthermore, under President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder's leadership, prosecutions of gun-related crimes have decreased by 45 percent.\n\nIn conclusion, organizations such as OFA and the White House are urging communities to commemorate the Sandy Hook anniversary and push for gun control measures. While the intentions behind these efforts are clear, it is crucial to consider the context and effectiveness of the proposed measures in preventing future tragedies.",
    " Title: White House Addresses Allegations of Clinton Foundation Donations During Hillary Clinton's Tenure as Secretary of State\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House faced a barrage of questions on Thursday regarding foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, including reports of donations linked to a deal that helped Russia nearly monopolize the global uranium market with State Department approval.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has grappled with similar questions, but neither the campaign nor the White House has provided sufficient answers to quell the growing controversy. The scrutiny of foreign money surrounding Hillary Clinton, including significant speaking fees paid to her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and megadonations to their charitable foundation after she became America's top diplomat, will likely intensify and follow her on the campaign trail.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest insisted that President Obama is not troubled by reports that the Clinton Foundation accepted $2.35 million from a businessman involved in Russia's uranium deals that required approval from the U.S. State Department, as well as other countries.\n\n\"At this point, there has not been any evidence presented that would prompt the president or anybody at the White House to be unsettled by Secretary Clinton's conduct as secretary of state,\" said Mr. Earnest. \"In fact, everyone here at the White House, including the president, continues to be very proud of her service to this country.\"\n\nThe contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite a memorandum of understanding between Mrs. Clinton and the Obama administration that required donations to the foundation to be disclosed to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe deal gave Russia's atomic energy agency, Rosatom, control of uranium mines spanning from Asia to the Western U.S., including half of America's uranium supply. Shortly after the Russians announced plans to buy mining giant Uranium One, a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin and the deal paid Mr. Clinton $500,000 for a speech in Moscow, according to the newspaper. That was about five times Mr. Clinton's typical speaking fee.\n\nMr. Earnest said he was not familiar with the details of the Russian case. Asked whether the administration is concerned that examples continue to emerge about questionable donations from foreign governments or foreign entities to the Clinton Foundation, he said no.\n\n\"The president and the administration continue to have a strong confidence in the decision-making of Secretary Clinton,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Mr. Earnest declined to answer a reporter's question on whether it is now \"clear\" that Mrs. Clinton did not abide by an agreement she signed with the administration before becoming secretary of state in 2009 to disclose donations to the foundation and the speaking fees paid to her husband.\n\n\"I'm not sure that that's clear, but you should go ask Secretary Clinton's team about that,\" Mr. Earnest said.\n\nThe Clinton campaign did not respond to questions about violating the memorandum of understanding.\n\nMrs. Clinton, who is the odds-on favorite to win the Democratic presidential nomination, also came under fire from her potential Republican rivals.\n\n\"It's the Clinton way: raking in millions from foreign governments behind closed doors while making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep. Now they're scrambling to refile their taxes and account for her decisions as Secretary of State,\" Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard who plans to announce her Republican presidential run May 4, wrote on her Facebook page.\n\nShe continued: \"The American people will have a choice. Are we going to demand trust and transparency from our leaders? Have we had enough of a ruling political class that doles out favors to the wealthy and well-connected few?\"\n\nThe Clinton campaign has tried to tamp down the controversy since it emerged this week in previews of the book \"Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.\"\n\nThe book, by conservative political adviser Peter Schweizer, argues that the Clintons got rich from speaking fees and donations in return for favors from Mrs. Clinton to various foreign interests while running the State Department. Other dealings include a free trade agreement in Colombia that benefited a major foundation donor's investments in the South American nation, development projects in Haiti after a devastating earthquake in 2010, and more than $1 million in payments to Mr. Clinton by a Canadian bank and major shareholder in the Keystone XL oil pipeline that occurred while the project was under State Department review, according to reports.\n\nThe Clinton campaign tried to dismiss the accusations as a right-wing \"smear project,\" but that becomes increasingly difficult as mainstream news outlets pick up the story. Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon sent a memo Thursday to supporters and donors in an attempt to beat back the accusations.\n\n\"The bottom line remains that the book fails to produce a shred of evidence supporting the theory that Hillary Clinton ever took action as Secretary of State for the purposes of supporting the interests of donors to the Clinton foundation,\" he wrote.\n\nAt a campaign stop in New Hampshire this week, Mrs. Clinton brushed aside reporters' questions about connections between contributions from foreign entities and her actions as secretary of state, calling them merely \"distractions and attacks.\"\n\n\"I know that that comes, unfortunately, with the territory,\" she told The Associated Press.",
    " Title: Federal Response to Malheur National Wildlife Refuge Occupation Proves More Effective Than Expected\n\nArticle:\n\nThe takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge by a self-appointed militia, led by the sons of right-wing radical Cliven Bundy, sparked concerns among liberals that the group would not be held accountable for their actions. The militia demanded that federal lands be turned over to private interests, including farmers, miners, and other private entities, without payment.\n\nInitially, the federal government appeared to take a passive approach, allowing the militia to remain at the refuge for several weeks, during which time they were able to go back and forth for grocery shopping, media events, and other activities. Only one occupier was arrested for using a stolen vehicle to drive to the store.\n\nCriticism from liberal commentators arose, with some arguing that the federal government's inaction was a double standard, suggesting that the response would have been more immediate if the occupiers were people of color. However, the solution to this double standard is not more shootouts, but rather a call for law enforcement to exercise restraint and patience when dealing with non-white suspects.\n\nThe occupation was eventually ended on Tuesday, when law enforcement confronted the militia on the open highway, resulting in a shootout and one fatality. Eight arrests have been made, and the leaders of the occupation are in custody. The federal government has since closed in on the refuge, closing roads and access, and it is expected that the remaining militia members will soon give up due to the lack of leadership and access to the outside world.\n\nThe federal strategy of patience and waiting proved to be a more effective approach than attempting to raid the refuge, which would have given the militia the martyrdom they desired and potentially resulted in further loss of life and property damage. The federal government's approach also minimized the propaganda value of the occupation, as the militia members were able to show their true colors and were ultimately apprehended in a less dramatic and less damaging manner.\n\nThe federal strategy of patience and waiting is not yet over, as some militia members remain at the refuge. However, with the leaders in custody, it is likely that the federal approach will continue to pay off. This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of smarter, less aggressive policing, and the dangers of the \"shoot first\" philosophy of policing. It is a more effective way to apprehend suspects and minimize harm to innocent people.",

Richard Gordon, head of the Philippine Red Cross, described the situation to the BBC as \"absolute bedlam.\"\n\nAccording to the BBC, a massive international relief effort is underway, but rescue workers have faced challenges reaching some towns and villages cut off since the storm. \"There's an awful lot of casualties, a lot of people dead all over the place, a lot of destruction,\" Gordon said.\n\nLynette Lim of Save the Children described the scene in Tacloban, one of the hardest-hit cities, after visiting over the weekend. \"Complete areas have been totally flattened,\" Lim said. \"It was truly catastrophic.\"\n\nFreelance journalist Aurora Almendral spoke to NPR from the town of Hilongos en route to Tacloban City. She reported that some people who had managed to secure food, water, and medicine were worried about looters who might try to take it. Almendral also shared the story of a young woman who has not heard from her family since before the storm, including her father, mother, brother, and four-year-old daughter.\n\nIn updates, it was announced that Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has ordered the USS George Washington (CVN 73) and other U.S. Navy ships to the Philippines to assist in typhoon relief efforts. The U.S. Marine Corps is also moving \"surface maritime search and rescue, airborne maritime SAR, medium-heavy helicopter lift support, fixed-wing lift support, and logistics enablers\" into the region. Approximately 215 U.S. military personnel are currently deployed in the Philippines to help in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan.\n\nUnited Nations officials report that about 9.5 million people in the Philippines have been affected by the typhoon and its aftermath, with around 620,000 forced from their homes. The number of confirmed deaths, which was just over 200 on Sunday, is now estimated to be around 1,000. However, officials are warning that the death toll could reach 10,000.\n\nThe U.S. military is bringing in water, generators, and trucks as part of the relief effort. Foreign governments and aid groups have begun shipping food, medicine, and supplies to the hard-hit Visayas region on the Philippines' eastern seaboard. Meanwhile, Typhoon Haiyan has moved out into the South China Sea and hit Vietnam on Monday, causing damage but no reported deaths.",
    " Title: Synthetic Grass Advocates Push for Mandate in Drought-Stricken California\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Synthetic Grass Warehouse, the nation's largest distributor of artificial grass, has proposed a law to make synthetic grass a viable option in California, a state currently experiencing a severe drought. The company, based in Anaheim, suggests that Governor Jerry Brown consider a law allowing and encouraging the use of synthetic grass in residential and commercial areas, including front and backyards, businesses, and dog runs.\n\nVictor Lanfranco, co-founder of the Synthetic Grass Warehouse, argues that if every Californian switched to synthetic grass, the state would no longer be in a drought. He points out that synthetic grass requires no water for maintenance, and its appearance and feel closely resemble real grass.\n\nThe company's synthetic grass is richly textured and colored, with a dozen varieties available for home use. The grass part is non-absorbent and anti-bacterial, requiring grooming with a brush instead of a mower. The Synthetic Turf Council, based in Atlanta, estimates that replacing a typical 1,800 square-foot lawn with artificial grass could save 99,000 gallons of water per year, per lawn, and eliminate pesticide and fertilizer run-off.\n\nGovernor Brown has already proposed fines of up to $10,000 for excessive water use and ordered a 25% reduction in statewide water usage. City and county agencies, as well as retail and wholesale water agencies, will be able to issue penalties and enforce restrictions.\n\nHowever, Mr. Lanfranco argues that homeowners are in a difficult position due to homeowners associations requiring watered lawns and the state's water usage reduction. He believes that the governor should intervene to allow homeowners to install synthetic grass where it is currently not permitted.\n\nThe Synthetic Grass Warehouse's proposal aims to save water and alleviate the state's drought situation. The company's poster proclaims, \"Imagine a California where water was no longer wasted on grass!\" The future of synthetic grass in California remains to be seen, as the proposal is yet to be officially presented to Governor Brown.",
    " Title: President Trump Responds to Jay-Z's Comments on Black Unemployment Rate\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump responded to rapper Jay-Z's comments about the black unemployment rate in a Sunday morning tweet. Trump asked someone to \"please inform Jay-Z\" that the black unemployment rate is at the \"lowest rate ever recorded\" after the rapper suggested money does not equate to happiness during an interview with CNN host Van Jones.\n\n\"Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!\" Trump tweeted Sunday, before declaring the overall economy has been doing well.\n\nThe comments from the president appear to be triggered by an appearance the rapper made on Van Jones' new show Saturday night. During the interview, Jay-Z said that while the black unemployment rate has decreased, it does not mean Trump is a good leader.\n\n\"It\u2019s not about money at the end of the day. Money does not equate to happiness,\" Jay-Z said. \"You\u2019re missing the whole point. You treat people like human beings. That\u2019s the main point. You can\u2019t treat someone like: you\u2019re going to treat me bad but pay me really well.\"\n\nThe black unemployment rate has reached its lowest levels since the 1970s, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics first began recording the unemployment rate in America.\n\nThe Moore Charitable Foundation, the non-profit organization behind \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation, is working to balance out biased American media.

    " Title: Texas, Arizona Deploy National Guard to Mexico Border; Trump Seeks Up to 4,000 Troops\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. state of Texas is deploying 250 National Guard members to the border with Mexico following a request from President Donald Trump. According to a Guard spokesman, these personnel will be dispatched to patrol the area within the next 72 hours. Arizona is also planning to deploy 150 troops to the same region next week.\n\nPresident Trump has expressed his intention to send up to 4,000 National Guard members to secure the border with Mexico, pending the construction of his proposed border wall. New Mexico and California have been asked to take similar action to Texas and Arizona.\n\nOn Friday, President Trump outlined plans to end a practice known as \"catch and release,\" as part of his stricter anti-immigration policies. Under this policy, illegal immigrants are released while awaiting deportation hearings. Instead, Trump wants illegal immigrants to be held in detention until their cases are resolved. He has requested a detailed list of military and other facilities from the U.S. Department of Defense that could perform this function.\n\nIn recent tweets, Trump has criticized illegal immigration, accusing Democrats of allowing \"open borders, drugs, and crime.\" He has also threatened to use the \"nuclear option\" to pass tougher immigration laws and has implied that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) could be at risk if Mexico does not stop the movement of migrants over the border.\n\nMexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto has condemned what he calls \"threatening or disrespectful attitudes\" from Trump. The deployment of troops to the Mexico border has been described by Trump as a \"big step,\" but both his predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, also dispatched the National Guard to the same area.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense has approved funding for up to 4,000 National Guard troops from the Pentagon budget until the end of September, according to the Associated Press. The construction of a \"big, beautiful wall\" along the Mexican border was a key campaign promise for Trump, but the plan to erect a new physical barrier has been hindered by lawmakers and appears to have stalled.\n\nA major government spending bill Trump signed last month included $1.6 billion (\u00a31.1 billion) for the border wall - significantly less than the $25 billion the White House sought. Most of the funding can only be used to repair existing sections of the border where there is already a wall, not to build new segments.\n\nLast month, the Pentagon confirmed that Trump had held \"initial\" talks with his defense secretary about using some of the Pentagon's budget to build a wall. However, two Democratic senators wrote to the defense secretary on Monday, stating that his department has \"no legal authority\" to use its funds for such a purpose. They warned that such a move could result in cutting funds from other priorities for U.S. service members.\n\nIn December, U.S. Border Patrol announced that arrests at the southern border had fallen to their lowest level since 1971, suggesting that fewer people were attempting the crossing.",
    " Title: New Mexico's Quay County Declares Itself a \"Second Amendment Sanctuary County\" in Protest of Gun Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to pending legislation that expands background check requirements for gun purchases, Quay County, New Mexico, has declared itself a \"Second Amendment Sanctuary County,\" according to Fox News. The two contested laws in question are House Bill (HB) 8 and HB 83.\n\nHB 8 proposes requiring background checks for gun purchases between private citizens, a measure that the New Mexico Sheriff's Association has deemed unenforceable. HB 83, on the other hand, would establish an \"Extreme Risk Protection Order\" that would allow for the seizure of guns and ammunition from individuals deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nNew Mexico House Republicans have expressed support for Quay County's decision to pass a resolution in protest of the laws. State Rep. Rod Montoya (R-Farmington) stated, \"We see counties starting to fight back against the over-reach of House Democrats. New Mexicans who are not even accused of a crime can lose their 2nd Amendment rights under this bill, and that's beyond wrong.\"\n\nUnder HB 8, it would be a misdemeanor to buy or sell a gun privately without a federal background check. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has come out against both HB 8 and HB 83. The NRA Institute for Legislative Action issued a statement regarding HB 83, stating, \"Unchallenged statements made by a petitioner before a judge, alleging that someone is a danger to themselves or others in an ex parte proceeding \u2014 prior to any formal court hearing at which the respondent can be represented by counsel and present counter-evidence \u2014 would be sufficient for law enforcement to enter that person's home and confiscate their private property.\"\n\nThe NRA further stated, \"It violates due process and puts law enforcement in a more dangerous situation and does nothing to protect citizens.\" New Mexico Sheriff's Association also expressed concerns about HB 83, stating, \"I agree with our sheriffs and our county commissions, both of which are telling us these bills only harm law-abiding New Mexicans.\"",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Alter Filibuster Rule to Advance Judicial and Executive Nominations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift, the United States Senate, led by the majority leader, Harry Reid, has altered the filibuster rule to advance judicial and executive nominations. The move comes in response to the Republican party's refusal to confirm appointments to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and their previous obstruction of the National Labor Relations Board and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nThe rule change, which was enacted due to the Republicans' refusal to confirm judges to the D.C. appellate court, lowers the threshold for confirming judicial and executive nominations from a supermajority to a simple majority. This change, according to Reid, was necessary given the unprecedented level of obstruction by the Republican party during the Obama administration.\n\nThe Constitution grants presidents the right to nominate top officials in their administration and name judges, and it does not specify the ability of a Senate minority to block these nominations. The practice of filibustering nominations, which barely existed before the 1970s, has seen a dramatic increase during the Obama administration.\n\nAccording to Reid, half of all filibusters waged against nominations in Senate history have occurred since President Obama was elected. Twenty of his district court nominees were filibustered, while only three such filibusters took place before he took office. There has also been a record-setting amount of delay in approving the president's choices for cabinet positions and federal agency posts, even when no objections have been raised about a nominee's qualifications.\n\nThe rule change does not affect the 60-vote threshold for blocking legislation, a practice that the article notes is worth preserving. However, the rule change may lead to broader filibuster changes, such as a proposal by several younger Democratic senators to require \"talking filibusters,\" which would force objecting lawmakers to stand up at length and make their cases. This could potentially end logjams that have prevented important legislation from reaching votes.",
    " Title: Beto O'Rourke Denies Attempting to Flee Scene of 1998 Drunken Car Crash\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a debate against U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz at Southern Methodist University, U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, the Texas Democrat vying to replace Sen. Ted Cruz, contradicted police reports from 1998 by denying he tried to flee the scene of a drunken car crash.\n\nO'Rourke stated, \"I did not try to leave the scene of the accident, though driving drunk, which I did, is a terrible mistake for which there is no excuse or justification or defense.\" He further added, \"I can only tell you that I was able to have a second chance in my life.\"\n\nHowever, O'Rourke's comments appear to contradict the police reports published by the Houston Chronicle last month, which claimed O'Rourke \"attempted to leave the accident\" after he lost control of his car and hit another vehicle in 1998. The police report stated, \"The driver attempted to leave the accident but was stopped by the [witness].\"\n\nThe witness, who also called 911, reportedly \"turned on his overhead lights to warn oncoming traffic and to try to get [O'Rourke] to stop,\" the report continued. This was the first time O'Rourke has challenged reports of the incident. Last month, he acknowledged that he \"drove drunk and was arrested for DWI in 1998.\" He didn't deny he tried to flee the scene.\n\nThe police report also stated that O'Rourke was visibly intoxicated and \"unable to be understood due to slurred speech.\" O'Rourke recorded 0.136 and 0.134 blood alcohol levels on Breathalyzer tests, the records said. The state legal limit at the time was 0.10. The charges of DWI were later dismissed after he completed a court-approved diversion program, the Chronicle reported.",
    " Title: EU Members Rush to Address Future After UK's Brexit Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU), the EU's founding nations convened in an emergency meeting on Saturday to discuss the potential implications and future of the alliance. According to a German government-run newspaper, Die Welt, the German government fears that the UK could be the first of several nations to exit the EU. The paper called for keeping the UK as an \"associated partner country.\"\n\nNigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party, celebrated the Brexit vote results, describing the EU as \"doomed\" and \"dying.\" Far-right leaders in France and the Netherlands have also called for their own referendums on EU membership, according to Sky News.\n\nForeign ministers from Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg met in Berlin on Saturday and issued a statement expressing their desire for Britain to quickly invoke the article in the EU charter that allows it to initiate negotiations for departure. Regarding other members, they stated, \"We have to find better ways of dealing with these different levels\" of commitment to closer European unity. Founding nations aim to increase political and economic cooperation, but some newer nations are hesitant to relinquish more sovereignty.\n\nAn online petition seeking a second Brexit referendum drew over 1 million signatures, reflecting the divisiveness of Thursday's vote to leave the 28-nation bloc. The petition site hosted by the House of Commons website experienced unprecedented activity, causing it to crash on Friday.\n\nScotland plans to initiate talks with EU nations and institutions to explore ways to remain in the bloc despite Britain's vote to leave, according to Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon. She also indicated that a new referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom is \"very much on the table.\"\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen both reacted to the Brexit vote. Orban stated, \"Brussels must hear the voice of the people, this is the biggest lesson from this decision.\" Rasmussen said, \"Britain's exit will echo for years to come and change the Europe as we know it.\"\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel stated that it \"shouldn't take forever\" for Britain to deliver formal notification of its intent to leave the EU, but acknowledged that the matter is in London's hands. Merkel also expressed a desire for an \"objective, good\" climate in the negotiations, stating, \"there is no need to be particularly nasty in any way in the negotiations; they must be conducted properly.\"\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault suggested that Britain should name a new prime minister in the coming days to expedite its departure. However, it is likely to take months to name a replacement for outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron, who is resigning and wants his successor to handle the departure negotiations. Ayrault stated, \"they must designate a new prime minister, which would certainly require several days.\"",
    " Title: Voting Irregularities: Long Lines in Florida, Confusion in New Jersey\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the voting day progresses, reports of irregularities have emerged, with long lines and confusion being the most significant issues in several states. This article will track significant irregularities throughout the day.\n\nIn Florida, voters have faced long wait times, with some waiting up to three hours to cast their ballots. The Miami Herald reported that some voters have refused to leave the line despite fainting, and in one case, a man suffered a seizure while filling out his ballot. In Miami-Dade, a woman was seen in line holding a catheter bag.\n\nThe long lines in Florida are attributed to the length of the ballot. The proposed amendments, backed by Republican state lawmakers, are lengthy, with one amendment coming in at 640 words. Voters who have not done their homework must read their way through a ballot that, in some counties, is 12 pages long.\n\nIn Virginia, long lines were also a problem, causing some voters to be late for work. In New Hampshire, voters struggled to find parking spaces and anticipated long wait times in lines.\n\nNew York City has experienced long lines, confusion, frustration, and anger due to Superstorm Sandy. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie authorized the use of fax and email voting, but some voters who requested ballots through those methods never received them. The Newark Star-Ledger reported that when the state announced the new provisions, they did not mention that those people voting by email or fax also need to send a hardcopy via mail.\n\nIn the case of email voting, voters still need to print, sign, and scan a physical ballot, then send it to their county clerk via email. However, hackers can forge ballots or signatures, send in fraudulent votes, and erase their tracks online, according to Andrew Appel, a computer science professor at Princeton University.\n\nIn Pinellas County, Florida, the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections Office mistakenly made robocalls that told voters they had until 7 p.m. \"tomorrow\" to turn in mail-in ballots. However, polls close at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, and any ballots turned in after that time will not be accepted. The calls went out between 8 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. due to a glitch with the SOE's phone system. About 12,000 calls did not get through, according to SOE spokeswoman Nancy Whitlock. The \"tomorrow\" in the message meant for Monday was incorrect when it was delivered. The SOE stopped sending out calls as soon as they noticed the problem.",
    " Title: Analysis: Jane Mayer's \"The Making of the Fox News White House\" Sparks Debate on Media-Political Relationships\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent article titled \"The Making of the Fox News White House,\" published in The New Yorker magazine, journalist Jane Mayer argues that there is a close alignment between Fox News and the Trump administration. The article has sparked debate, with some finding the relationship between the two unprecedented, while others argue that similar relationships between media and political entities have existed in the past.\n\nMayer's article, which was discussed on CNN and MSNBC, suggests that the relationship between Fox News and the White House is particularly close due to the involvement of Bill Shine, a former Fox News executive who now serves as the White House communications director. Mayer's piece has been met with criticism for its portrayal of this relationship as unique, with some pointing out instances of media-political relationships in the past, such as the coverage of Franklin D. Roosevelt's disability, John F. Kennedy's debauchery, and the creation of an \"echo chamber\" by Obama strategist Ben Rhodes.\n\nCritics of Mayer's article have also pointed out the irony in her allegations of media collusion, given her own network's history of close relationships with political figures, such as Chris Matthews's public support for President Obama and Lyin' Brian Williams's adoring interactions with the Obama administration. Mayer also suggests that Fox News and Trump's relationship is characterized by a \"rage-based model\" that spins the country in an increasingly inflamed direction. However, some have argued that similar partisan and emotionally charged narratives can be found in other media outlets, particularly those with a liberal slant.\n\nThe article has sparked a larger conversation about the role of the media in politics and the potential for media outlets to shape public opinion. Some argue that Mayer's piece is an example of hypocrisy, given The New Yorker's own history of close relationships with political figures and the publication of sympathetic interviews and books about political leaders. Others argue that the article is a fair analysis of the relationship between Fox News and the Trump administration, and that it is important to examine the potential for media outlets to influence political outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, Jane Mayer's article \"The Making of the Fox News White House\" has sparked debate and discussion about the relationship between media and politics. While some argue that the article is an example of media collusion, others see it as a fair analysis of the close relationship between Fox News and the Trump administration. The article has also brought attention to the larger issue of the role of the media in shaping public opinion and the potential for media outlets to influence political outcomes.",
    " Title: Justice Department Threatens Lawsuit Against Harvard Over Affirmative Action Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department has issued a letter to Harvard University, threatening to sue the Ivy League institution if it does not hand over documents regarding its admission policies. The department is investigating whether Harvard's policies violate civil rights laws by discriminating against Asian-American applicants.\n\nThe investigation stems from a 2015 lawsuit that alleges Harvard's affirmative action policies discriminate against Asian-American applicants. The Justice Department is examining the school's compliance with Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits institutions receiving federal funding from discriminating based on race, color, or national origin.\n\nThe letter, dated Friday and obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588, sets a Dec. 1 deadline for Harvard to provide the requested documents. The Justice Department's probe follows reports of an investigation into whether university affirmative action admission policies broadly discriminate against white applicants.\n\nIn a response letter dated Oct. 6, attorneys for Harvard questioned the timing of the probe, stating it was unusual for the department to resurrect a complaint filed nearly 2-1/2 years earlier. Harvard maintains that its admissions policies are compliant with U.S. laws and has worked to increase financial aid to ensure diversity in its classes.\n\nHarvard stated earlier this year that just over half of the freshmen admitted in 2017 were women, more than one in five was Asian, and almost 15 percent were African-American. In a statement on Tuesday, Harvard spokeswoman Anna Cowenhoven said, \"The university will certainly comply with its obligations under Title VI. We have an obligation to protect the confidentiality of student and applicant files and other highly sensitive records.\"\n\nAffirmative action programs in higher education were designed to address racial discrimination. The Supreme Court has ruled that universities may use affirmative action with the aim of helping minority applicants gain admission to colleges. However, U.S. conservatives argue that affirmative action can hurt white people and Asian-Americans by giving preference to other minority groups.\n\nIn response to the investigation, a Justice Department spokesperson, Devin O' Malley, said, \"The Department of Justice takes seriously any potential violation of an individual's civil and constitutional rights.\"",
    " Title: Clinton's Wall Street Ties Remain a Contentious Issue in 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent Democratic debate, Hillary Clinton defended her ties to Wall Street, a topic that has become a significant vulnerability in states with early nomination contests. John Wittneben, the Democratic chairman in Emmet County, Iowa, endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders after losing 40 percent of his savings in individual retirement accounts during the Great Recession. He believes that Wall Street executives, whom he believes should be in jail, were responsible for his losses.\n\nClinton's financial ties to Wall Street banks and other financial services firms, totaling $3 million in paid speeches and $17 million in campaign contributions over the years, have contributed to this image problem. Some undecided Democrats view her as overly cozy with big banks and other special interests. In a time when liberals are gaining influence within the party, many Democrats believe her past representation of Wall Street as a senator from New York is problematic.\n\nClinton has criticized the American economy as being \"rigged\" for the rich, but some party members question her commitment to regulating Wall Street excess if elected. Despite promising greater regulation of hedge funds and private equity firms, liberals criticize her for refusing to support the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act, a law that separated commercial and investment banks until its repeal under President Bill Clinton. Senator Bernie Sanders, a presidential candidate, favors its restoration.\n\nFurthermore, some Democrats view Clinton's strong support from wealthy donors and a big-money \"super PAC\" as contradicting her increasingly progressive rhetoric on free trade and other economic issues. This image problem persists despite Clinton's efforts to address concerns about her ties to Wall Street.",
    " Title: FBI Launched Investigation into President Trump After Firing of James Comey in 2017, According to Report\n\nArticle:\n\nA report published by The New York Times on Friday night revealed that the FBI launched an investigation of President Donald Trump in May 2017, immediately following his dismissal of FBI Director James Comey. The investigation reportedly focused on whether the president was working on behalf of Russia against American interests, with part of the probe being of a criminal nature, looking at whether the president obstructed justice.\n\nThe report, citing former officials and others familiar with the probe, stated that law enforcement officials became concerned by the president's behavior and initiated the investigation. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, took over the probe several days later upon his appointment by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nPresident Trump responded to the report via Twitter, stating, \"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!\"\n\nThe president also tweeted, \"At the same time, & as I have often said, getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!\"\n\nRegarding James Comey, the president tweeted, \"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America. He was a Crooked Cop.\" He also stated, \"He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats - leaking machines who have NO interest in going after the Real Collusion (and much more) by Crooked Hillary Clinton, her Campaign, and the Democratic National Committee.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called the development \"absurd.\" She stated, unlike former President Barack Obama, President Trump \"has actually been tough on Russia.\" Sanders also said that Comey was fired for being a \"partisan hack\" and that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was \"a known liar\" who was also fired.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes of California, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said the Times' report is \"yet more evidence that FBI leaders actually had no real evidence against the Trump team.\" Nunes indicated that the investigation was an attempt to undermine the president and avenge Comey's firing.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, indicated that he plans to look into the development. Nadler stated, \"In the coming weeks, the Judiciary Committee will take steps to better understand both the president's actions and the FBI's response to that behavior, and to make certain that these career investigators are protected from President Trump's increasingly unhinged attacks.\"",
    " Title: Obama Acknowledges U.S. Torture of al Qaida Detainees Post-9/11\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama admitted on Friday that the United States tortured al Qaida detainees captured following the 9/11 attacks, marking some of his most extensive comments to date on a contentious set of CIA practices he prohibited upon taking office.\n\n\"We tortured some folks,\" Obama stated during a televised news conference at the White House. \"We did some things that were contrary to our values.\"\n\nAddressing the forthcoming release of a Senate report that criticizes the CIA's treatment of detainees, Obama attributed the mistreatment to the pressure national security officials felt to prevent further attacks. He urged Americans not to be overly \"sanctimonious\" when judging the actions through the lens of a seemingly safer present day.\n\nThis stance, which Obama expressed as a presidential candidate in 2008 and early in his presidency, explains why he did not push for criminal charges against Bush-era officials who implemented the CIA program. To this day, many of those officials maintain that their actions were not torture, which is a felony under U.S. law.\n\nObama's remarks on Friday were more emphatic than his previous comments on the subject, including a 2009 speech in which he announced his ban on \"so-called enhanced interrogation techniques\" and \"brutal methods,\" but did not explicitly state that the U.S. had engaged in torture.\n\n\"I believe that waterboarding was torture, and whatever legal rationales were used, it was a mistake,\" he said in April 2009.\n\nThe administration of President George W. Bush authorized the use of harsh interrogation techniques on militant detainees in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, after deciding they did not constitute torture.\n\nObama told reporters the techniques were employed due to the fear of imminent further attacks.\n\n\"It's important for us not to feel too sanctimonious in retrospect about the tough job that those folks had,\" he said. \"A lot of those folks were working hard under enormous pressure and are real patriots.\"\n\nOn Friday, Obama did not address two other central arguments of the soon-to-be-released Senate report: that the brutal interrogations did not yield life-saving intelligence, and that the CIA deceived other elements of the U.S. government about exactly what it was doing.\n\nThe president also expressed confidence in his CIA director, John Brennan, in the face of an internal CIA report documenting that the spy agency improperly accessed Senate computers. There have been calls for his resignation on Capitol Hill.",
    " Title: Iran Nuclear Negotiations: Ongoing Talks Offer Uncertainty and Potential Risks\n\nArticle:\n\nThe deadline for Iran's nuclear negotiations extended once again on Thursday, as Secretary of State John Kerry warned that failure to reach a deal could potentially end the process. The ongoing talks, involving Iran, Russia, China, Britain, France, Germany, and the United States, are not aimed at eliminating Iran's nuclear weapons program but rather at determining the extent of Iran's nuclear infrastructure, the level of inspections, and the compensation provided for the privileges granted.\n\nInspections are crucial to any agreement focused on reducing the threat of Iran's nuclear weapons programs. The negotiations aim to increase the \"breakout time,\" or the length of time it would take Iran to construct a nuclear bomb using known equipment and materials, from its currently estimated 2-3 months to a year.\n\nHowever, Iran's reluctance to accept several proposed deals suggests that the negotiations may serve as a satisfactory outcome for the Iranian government, providing them with some sanctions relief, international recognition, and regional enemies questioning the U.S.'s commitment to their security.\n\nIt is essential to note that the extent of Iran's nuclear weapons work and the number of its facilities remain largely unknown, despite efforts by intelligence services. The Congress has been instrumental in imposing sanctions, with Senators Corker and Cardin ensuring that any agreement reached in Vienna will be subject to a 60-day review by the Congress.\n\nAn agreement would ease sanctions on Iran, with the Iranian economy primarily benefiting the Revolutionary Guards and citizen militia, as they control much of the economy. The lifting of nuclear-related sanctions would result in approximately $100 billion in revenue for Iran.\n\nWhile an agreement would alleviate President Obama's political dilemma of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon without resorting to military force, it has already created security concerns as regional allies reassess their alliances. A prolonged negotiation, free from deadlines, might mitigate some of the insecurity, providing exposure to Iranian leaders and potentially intelligence on their nuclear infrastructure.\n\nIn conclusion, Iran does not appear to have made the fundamental choice to abandon its nuclear weapons programs. Until Iran makes this choice, continuing negotiations may offer a better outcome than an agreement, as it maintains sanctions, exposes Iranian leaders, and aligns the U.S. with key European allies.",
    " Title: Poll Analysis Suggests Trump's White Identity Politics May Be Less Effective in 2020 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nA new analysis of public opinion over the past four years indicates that U.S. President Donald Trump's brand of white identity politics may be less effective in the 2020 election campaign. The analysis comes amid widespread criticism of Trump's racially charged comments about four minority women lawmakers and the fallout from a mass shooting of Hispanics in El Paso, Texas, that many Democratic presidential candidates swiftly blamed on the president's rhetoric.\n\nAccording to a \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll of 4,436 U.S. adults in July, people who rejected racial stereotypes were more interested in voting in the 2020 general election than those who expressed stronger levels of anti-black or anti-Hispanic biases. In 2016, the reverse was true. The analysis shows that Trump's narrow win came at a time when Americans with strong anti-black opinions were the more politically engaged group.\n\nThe July poll found that among Americans who feel that blacks and whites are equal, or that blacks are superior to whites, 82% expressed a strong interest in voting in 2020. That was 7 percentage points higher than people who feel strongly that whites are superior to blacks.\n\nUniversity of Michigan political scientist Vincent Hutchings, who reviewed \u2588\u2588\u2588's findings, said, \"There is some indication that racial liberals are more energized than the racially intolerant. That would seem to be good news for the Democrats and bad news for the Republicans.\"\n\nThe July poll did have a silver lining for Trump. Most white Republicans approve of his performance in office, and over the past four years, they have become increasingly supportive of his signature issue: expanding the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Some 82% now support it compared to 75% last year.\n\nTrump is still as popular as ever with conservatives who dominate the predominantly white, working-class communities that helped him win in 2016, said Duke University political scientist Ashley Jardina, who also reviewed the poll findings. In his 2016 campaign, Trump focused on the grievances of white voters who feared the global economy was leaving them behind and who wanted more restrictions on immigration. He employed put-downs of Latino immigrants and inner-city, typically black, residents.\n\nTrump has asserted repeatedly that his words are not meant to be racially divisive. \"I think my rhetoric... brings people together,\" he said earlier this month. Responding to the \u2588\u2588\u2588 polling analysis, a spokesman for Trump's reelection campaign, Daniel Bucheli, said the president \"enjoys broad support from diverse groups of Americans, and this coalition of supporters, to include minorities and first-time voters, continues to grow daily.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on the poll findings. The \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis also found that Americans were less likely to express feelings of racial anxiety this year, and they were more likely to empathize with African Americans. This was also true for white Americans and whites without a college degree, who largely backed Trump in 2016.\n\nWhite Americans are also 19 percentage points more supportive of a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and 4 points less supportive of increased deportations, when their responses from the July poll were compared with a \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll in January 2015. The July 17-22 poll also found that 29% of whites agreed that \"America must protect and preserve its White European heritage,\" down 7 points from a \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll conducted in August 2017 and 9 points down from another \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll in August 2018. The poll also found that 17% of whites and 26% of white Republicans said they strongly agree that \"white people are currently under attack in this country,\" a drop of about 6 points and 8 points respectively from 2017.\n\nPaula Ioanide, an expert in American race relations at Ithaca College, said the poll findings were consistent with her research that racial anxieties among whites peaked during the presidency of Barack Obama. Some white Americans \"are not feeling as under attack as they did in 2016,\" Ioanide said. With Trump in the White House, \"they've seen a kind of endorsement of the kinds of things that they wanted: A restoration of a white identity that they previously had felt was under attack.\"\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 and its polling partner, Ipsos, developed its race poll with political scientists at the University of Michigan and Duke University, asking a series of questions that measured respondents' perceptions of people from different racial backgrounds, the treatment of blacks and whites in America, and their interest in voting in 2020.",
    " Title: Maryland Governor Larry Hogan's Potential 2020 Presidential Bid: A Complicated Prospect\n\nArticle:\n\nMaryland Governor Larry Hogan, who won re-election in 2018 with record-breaking approval ratings, has sparked speculation within the Republican Party about a potential challenge to President Donald Trump in the 2020 primary elections. Hogan, a two-term governor and former businessman, has gained a reputation for his no-nonsense demeanor and bipartisan approach to governance.\n\nDuring the recent government shutdown, Hogan publicly criticized Trump, advocating for a solution to Washington's political dysfunction by highlighting Maryland's ability to work across party lines. In a notable instance, Hogan toured Baltimore-Washington International Airport in January to emphasize the impact of the shutdown on TSA workers, and he criticized Trump's approach to the shutdown.\n\nHogan's moderate, centrist approach to governance has earned him praise from some Republican insiders, who have publicly urged him to run for president. Jerry Taylor, head of the libertarian-leaning think tank Niskanen Center, has been one of Hogan's most vocal supporters, advocating for Hogan to consider running for \"higher office.\" Taylor has even gifted Hogan a book about the history of New Hampshire, a state that hosts one of the first primary battles in the path to the Republican nomination.\n\nHowever, challenging an incumbent president in the primaries is a daunting task. The last time a sitting president lost his party's re-nomination battle was in 1856. Melissa Deckman, a political science professor at Washington College in Maryland, expressed skepticism about Hogan's chances, stating that Trump remains popular with the Republican base. Deckman also noted that Hogan's moderate stance on social issues may not resonate with conservative voters in early primary states like Iowa or South Carolina.\n\nDespite the challenges, Hogan has not ruled out a potential 2020 run. In a recent interview on CNN, Hogan stated that he would only run if he believed he could win. Hogan's second inauguration earlier this month hinted at broader political aspirations, as he invited former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, a well-known Trump critic, to introduce him, and hired Mark Salter, a former speechwriter for the late Sen. John McCain and a vocal detractor of Trump, to help craft his address.\n\nWhile Hogan's address did not mention Trump by name, he criticized the \"debilitating politics of Washington\" and referenced his father, former Maryland Representative Lawrence Hogan Sr., who famously called for Richard Nixon's impeachment. Hogan is expected to visit the early caucus state of Iowa in March.\n\nFour years ago, few would have predicted Maryland's little-known governor would be discussed as a potential presidential candidate. However, Trump's challenges\u2014including apparent ceilings in his job approval numbers, ongoing concerns about the outcome of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, and questions about his business empire and potential conflicts of interest\u2014may have created an opening for a Republican challenger.",
    " Title: Worship Pastor's Song Criticizing Evangelical Trump Supporters Garners Attention\n\nArticle:\n\nDaniel Deitrich, the arts and worship pastor at South Bend City Church in South Bend, Indiana, has gained attention for a song he wrote titled \"Hymn for the 81%,\" a reference to white evangelical Christian voters who helped secure President Trump's victory in 2016. The song serves as a \"plea... to come home to the way of Jesus,\" according to Deitrich.\n\nThe anti-Trump pastor's song has garnered over 400,000 views on YouTube. The lyrics of the song accuse Trump evangelicals of \"putting kids in cages, ripping mothers from their babies\" and \"weaponiz[ing] religion.\"\n\nDeitrich told Religion News Service that he originally wrote the song's bridge as \"an angry middle finger to the listener\" and found it \"cathartic,\" but he toned it down and plans on releasing more songs.\n\n\"There\u2019s so much work to do to combat white supremacy, homophobia, transphobia, sexism \u2014 all the ways in which people are treated as less than the children of God that they are,\" he told RNS.\n\nAlthough Deitrich has received praise from many on the left, Faithwire editor Tr\u00e9 Goins-Phillips said it is not exactly a worship song.\n\n\"Deitrich\u2019s words are not elevating or edifying; they are divisive,\" Goins-Phillips writes. \"Our worship and discipleship should be challenging, but it should be challenging in ways that call us back to Scripture, not to our anger at one another.\"\n\nAnti-Trump evangelicals have been vocal in the last few weeks in opposition to the president and his supporters. Former editor-in-chief Mark Galli wrote an op-ed in Christianity Today called \"Trump Should be Removed from Office,\" and a group of \"Never Trump\" Republicans released an attack ad called \"The MAGA Church,\" mocking Trump's character and evangelicals' support of him.\n\nThe two events surrounded the Trump 2020 campaign's launch of \"Evangelicals for Trump,\" where more than 70 prominent pastors came out in support of Trump's re-election bid.",
    " Title: Democrats Call for Full Release of Mueller Report and Testimony from Attorney General Barr\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocrats have shown no signs of letting up in their pursuit of further investigations into President Trump, despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report finding no evidence of collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russia during the 2016 election. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, in a joint statement, called for the full release of the Mueller report and underlying documents, challenging Attorney General Bill Barr's impartiality and claiming he is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report.\n\nBarr, in a four-page summary released on Sunday, noted that while Mueller found no evidence of collusion, the special counsel did not come to a conclusion on whether President Trump obstructed justice. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversaw the majority of the Russia investigation after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, concluded that the evidence was \"not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\"\n\nDemocrats have questioned Barr's impartiality and called for a sweeping amount of documentation from the Mueller investigation. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated, \"The fact that Special Counsel Mueller's report does not exonerate the president on a charge as serious as obstruction of justice demonstrates how urgent it is that the full report and underlying documentation be made public without any further delay.\"\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has vowed to have Barr testify before the committee \"in the near future,\" and has called for \"full transparency\" on what Mueller uncovered \"to not exonerate the President from wrongdoing.\" Nadler, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, and House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings have also called for the release of the Special Counsel's full and complete report and all underlying documents.\n\nThe comments from Democrats underscore that they have no intention of accepting Barr's summary report as-is or putting the collusion and obstruction issues to rest, as they continue to pursue their own congressional investigations. The House Judiciary Committee is already leading an investigation into \"alleged obstruction of justice, public corruption, and other abuses of power by President Trump,\" which Chairman Jerrold Nadler announced earlier this month. Other House Democrats have also aggressively ramped up their own Trump-related investigations, which are likely to include a network of committee probes and high-profile hearings that are likely to last well into the 2020 election year.",
    " Title: Republican Party's Shift in Strategy: Focus on Asian-American Candidates and Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2014 midterm elections, Asian-American voters showed a significant shift in their political preferences, with nearly half backing the Republican candidate for the House of Representatives. This marked a 46-point swing in Asian support from the 2012 elections, where they voted predominantly for President Obama's re-election.\n\nThis shift has led some pundits to question the sudden change in party allegiance, but the eye-popping exit poll data may not accurately reflect long-term success. The Republican Party's previous outreach strategies, such as nominating minority candidates in long-shot districts and last-minute ads in other languages, have not proven successful.\n\nHowever, the 2014 elections saw a shift in the Republican Party's strategy, with a focus on building a bench of Asian-American candidates. Over three dozen Asian-American Republican candidates won elections at the state and local levels, in races such as school board, state senate, and city council.\n\nLanhee Chen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, noted in his post-election analysis that the Republican Party finally devoted time, attention, and resources to cultivating Asian voters.\n\nIn American Samoa, Aumua Amata Radewagen, a member of the Republican National Committee, will become the territory's first female representative to Congress. State Sen. Kimberly Yee, the first Asian-American elected to the Arizona legislature, cruised to re-election by 18 points. Even in traditionally Democratic strongholds like California, the Republican Party backed four successful Asian-American women running for the state legislature and county board of supervisors.\n\nThe election of these Asian-American candidates has a compounding effect, as argued by Tim Nguyen, chair of the Asian Pacific American Coalition. The election of prominent Asian-American leaders can inspire others with similar backgrounds to run for office.\n\nNewly elected California State Sen. Janet Nguyen, the highest-ranking Vietnamese-American in the country, can recruit candidates from Little Saigon to run as Republican candidates for school board and city council. Connecticut State Sen. Tony Hwang can raise money from the Taiwanese-American community that would otherwise not contribute to Republican coffers. San Diego City Council Chris Cate, the first Asian-American in half a century to be elected to the San Diego City Council, has the charisma to introduce GOP presidential candidates to Filipino-American voters in swing states such as Nevada, Florida, and Virginia.\n\nOne of these rising stars, Oklahoma State Sen.-elect Ervin Yen, a first-generation Taiwanese-American immigrant, is rock-solid on gun rights. Yen, who immigrated to the United States after the Communist takeover of China, is a strong believer in the principles that America was built on and the importance of defending the Second Amendment.\n\nFor the next two years, Republicans like Mr. Yen will be featured in Asian-language newspapers, sharing a conservative message with communities that have been historically neglected by the Democrats.\n\nThe Republican Party has elected a bench of bilingual stars who have real political power. Their influence is expected to increase significantly when the 2016 presidential candidates start campaigning.\n\nShawn Steel, a former chairman of the California Republican Party and the state's national committeeman on the Republican National Committee, will play a key role in this effort.",
    " Title: The Militarization of U.S. Police Forces: A Look at the Rise of SWAT Teams and the Impact on Civil Liberties\n\nArticle:\n\nThe use of police SWAT teams, originally established for handling violent situations such as hostage-takings, has expanded significantly over the past few decades, leading to concerns about the militarization of law enforcement and potential infringements on civil liberties.\n\nRadley Balko, in his book \"Rise of the Warrior Cop,\" details the transformation of SWAT teams, which stand for Special Weapons And Tactics, from rarely used specialized units to a near-daily occurrence. While SWAT raids initially began in the 1970s at around 300 per year, Balko notes that, as of 2005, there were approximately 100 to 150 SWAT raids per day.\n\nThe shift began during the Nixon era, with politicians seeking to appear tough on crime, even if it meant exaggerating the threat posed by illegal drugs. As the war on drugs escalated, police stopped announcing themselves when entering homes due to concerns that drug users would destroy evidence. This change marked a departure from the centuries-old rule that treated citizens' homes as their castles, requiring a warrant for police entry.\n\nThe increased use of SWAT teams has led to incidents where innocent individuals have been killed during raids. Balko cites over 50 such cases, often resulting from homeowners not recognizing the intruders in the middle of the night. One such case is that of Iraq War veteran Jose Guerena, who was shot and killed by police during a raid on his home. Guerena's home was suspected of containing drugs, but no drugs or evidence of drug dealing were found after his death. Guerena's brother was arrested on drug charges, and Balko notes that Guerena's crime seemed to be his association with someone.\n\nThe War on Terror has further contributed to the militarization of police forces, with the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security offering armored vehicles, including tanks and troop transports, body armor, and stun grenades, to police departments, large or small. Local police have eagerly accepted these resources, expanding the circumstances under which such equipment is used.\n\nIn a case from Concord, New Hampshire, the police chief, citing libertarians who moved to the state seeking increased individual freedom, requested and received an armored vehicle from the Department of Homeland Security. This raises concerns about the potential misuse of such equipment against peaceful, law-abiding citizens.\n\nWhile the police, courts, and military are generally considered legitimate functions of government, the ability to sleep securely in one's home without fear of armored intrusions is a fundamental freedom. As the public begins to question the effectiveness and morality of the war on drugs, it is crucial to consider the impact of the War on Terror and the continued militarization of police forces on civil liberties.",
    " Title: Education Department Revising Title IX Standards for Sexual Harassment Cases on College Campuses\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Education Department is reportedly revising Title IX standards for addressing cases of sexual harassment and assault on college campuses. The revisions, which have not yet been finalized, will allegedly bolster the rights of accused students, narrow the definition of sexual harassment, and hold schools accountable only for formal complaints filed through proper authorities and for conduct said to have occurred on their campuses.\n\nAccording to a draft obtained by The New York Times, the Department recognizes that sexual harassment and assault continue to present serious problems across the nation's campuses despite well-intentioned efforts by school districts, colleges, universities, advocacy organizations, and the Department itself. The lack of clear regulatory standards has contributed to processes that have not been fair to all parties involved, lacked appropriate procedural protections, and undermined confidence in the reliability of the outcomes of investigations of sexual harassment allegations.\n\nThe draft rule also states that the Department aims to ensure fairness and due process for all parties involved in Title IX investigations. However, some critics argue that the revisions may not be operating in good faith. For instance, the Department's Office for Civil Rights, which investigates Title IX complaints, is headed by Candice Jackson, who once asserted to The Times that \"90 percent\" of assault complaints \"fall into the category of 'we were both drunk,' 'we broke up,' and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.\"\n\nIn 2017, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos reached out to several men's rights groups to discuss the issue of rape on campus. The secretary met with members of Families Advocating for Campus Equality and Stop Abusive and Violent Environments, which advocate for students accused of sexual misconduct, and the National Coalition for Men, which refers to itself as \"the oldest Men's Rights organization in America.\" The latter group recently filed its own Title IX complaint against the University of Pennsylvania because the school has \"over 20 women programs... but nothing similar for men.\"\n\nThe finalized revisions to Title IX standards are yet to be announced. The Education Department has not provided further details on the specific changes to the regulations.",
    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Community Reports Increase in Terrorist Chatter Ahead of 9/11 Anniversary\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has observed a significant increase in chatter among terrorist organizations as the 13th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks approaches. A U.S. government official, speaking anonymously, informed The Blaze that there has been an increase in chatter among Islamic terrorist organizations, both online and over phone lines.\n\nWhile the intelligence community cannot definitively confirm whether an attack is imminent, the official stated that agencies have seen similar increases in chatter before the September 11 attacks. The rise in chatter is more challenging to decipher due to the emergence of the Islamic State group, which poses a threat to al Qaeda as it asserts dominance in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has openly declared its intent to bring terror to American interests worldwide, similar to al Qaeda. Former CIA case officer Brian Fairchild told The Blaze that the threat is two-fold, as ISIS and al Qaeda are in conflict, with ISIS having captured the imagination of young Muslims from around the world and depriving al Qaeda of its own fighters. Al Qaeda is reportedly split, and the approaching 9/11 anniversary may benefit both groups if a significant attack occurs in the United States.\n\nThe Islamic State executed American photojournalist James Foley on Aug. 19, and has used social media platforms to threaten terror attacks on American soil. Recently, Chicago's WGN network reported a tweet from the terror group on June 20, which includes a picture taken on Michigan Ave. The tweet reads \"Soldiers of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria will pass from here soon,\" and an Arabic message held up in the picture was translated as \"We are in your streets.\" The specifics of any planned attacks or the intentions of the terrorist organizations are not available.",
    " Title: \"Economy Advances: Profits Soar as U.S. Economy Remains Robust Amidst Global Economic Challenges\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's front-page headline on Monday, \"Profits Soar as Economy Advances,\" highlights the robust state of the U.S. economy. This economic growth, despite global economic challenges, such as those faced by China, underscores the country's unusual health.\n\nThe article suggests that the policies and appointments made by President Donald Trump have contributed to this economic growth. The piece also discusses the ongoing investigations and controversies surrounding the Trump family, but emphasizes that these stories have not been as damaging as portrayed by the media.\n\nThe article further discusses the historical context of the Clinton family's involvement in two of the three Constitutional crises in the author's lifetime. It mentions the impeachment of President Bill Clinton and the ongoing investigation into potential Russian collusion with the Trump campaign, led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe article also references a book, \"Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign,\" which suggests that Hillary Clinton's team began to engineer the narrative of Russian hacking and election interference shortly after her 2016 election loss. The article suggests that this narrative is a key part of the ongoing Constitutional crisis surrounding the Trump administration.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that the origin of the current Constitutional crisis is more complex than the passage from \"Shattered\" suggests, but provides a starting point for understanding the ongoing investigation and the role of the Clinton family in the political landscape.",
    " Title: Pope Francis Criticizes Unfettered Capitalism, but Supporters Argue for Its Benefits\n\nArticle:\n\nPope Francis, in his apostolic exhortation, has criticized free market capitalism, stating that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, does not inherently lead to greater justice and inclusiveness in the world. He further concluded that this opinion has never been confirmed by the facts and labeled unfettered capitalism as \"a new tyranny.\"\n\nIn response, this article will examine the benefits of capitalism as seen by its proponents. It is important to note that while capitalism may have its flaws, it is a system that has significantly improved the lives of many people in the real world.\n\nCapitalism, relatively new in human history, has allowed individuals to amass great wealth by serving and pleasing their fellow man. Examples of this can be seen in the success stories of entrepreneurs like J.D. Rockefeller and Henry Ford. Rockefeller's marketing of kerosene led to a significant decrease in its price, while Ford's production of cars made transportation more affordable for the common man.\n\nThe question posed is whether those who, through their actions, have created unprecedented convenience, longer life expectancy, and a more pleasant life for the ordinary person, while becoming wealthy in the process, deserve the scorn and ridicule they receive from intellectuals, politicians, and now the pope.\n\nProfits, a key aspect of capitalism, guide resources to their highest-valued uses and satisfy people's needs and desires. A survey of people's satisfaction with various services would likely show a higher level of satisfaction with profit-making enterprises such as supermarkets, theaters, clothing stores, and computer stores, compared to services provided by nonprofit government organizations like public schools, post offices, and departments of motor vehicles.\n\nProfits force entrepreneurs to find ways to please people in the most efficient ways or go out of business. In contrast, nonprofits have an easier time of it, as they continue to operate regardless of their effectiveness or level of satisfaction they provide.\n\nArthur C. Brooks, president at the American Enterprise Institute and author of \"Who Really Cares,\" has shown that Americans are the most generous people on earth. Furthermore, generosity is found to be more prevalent in countries that are closer to the free market end of the economic spectrum than they are to the socialist or communist end. Given Pope Francis' emphasis on charity as a key part of godliness, it is suggested that he reconsider his criticism of capitalism.",
    " Title: The New York Times Faces Criticism Over James Hodgkinson's Motives in Congressional Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nThe New York Times has faced criticism over the weekend for a story that seemingly attempted to redefine the motives of James Hodgkinson, the lone gunman responsible for the ambush shooting on congressional Republicans last week. While the exact motive behind the attack remains unclear, most believe hyper-partisan politics are to blame.\n\nAfter the shooting, authorities confirmed that Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old, was the shooter. His social media postings were heavily scrutinized, revealing that Hodgkinson was a stalwart supporter of socialist politics and had a deep hatred for President Donald Trump and Republicans.\n\nHowever, on Saturday, the Times attempted to paint a different picture, suggesting that Hodgkinson's attack was not politically motivated but rather the result of an unstable individual. The story's headline emphasized this idea: \"Before the Gunfire in Virginia, a Volatile Home Life in Illinois.\"\n\nThe story delved into Hodgkinson's personal life, describing his troubled home life, including instances of domestic abuse and the suicide of one foster child. The Times also reported that Hodgkinson likely suffered from some form of mental illness, and his political beliefs had \"little\" to do with his desire to target only congressional Republicans.\n\nCritics argue that the Times' story ignores the political context of the shooting, with some tweets accusing the paper of playing to its base or trying to cover up the shooter's actual motive. However, the Times has defended its journalism, stating that it is not playing to a base to publish news stories that are deeply reported in the days after a news event.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Times does not always whitewash the ideological beliefs of people who commit atrocities. Last month, when a racist man killed two people on a Portland commuter train, the Times emphasized the fact that the perpetrator was racist and had anti-Muslim views.\n\nThe full context of Hodgkinson's motives may never be known, but the debate over the Times' coverage highlights the role of the media in shaping public perception and the importance of accurate and unbiased reporting.",
    " Title: FBI Documents Reveal Hillary Clinton's Alleged False Statement Regarding Email Advice from Colin Powell\n\nArticle:\n\nFBI documents handed over to Congress this week indicate that during a three-and-a-half-hour interview in early July, Hillary Clinton told FBI agents that former Secretary of State Colin Powell advised her to use a personal email account. However, Powell soon issued a statement that he could not recall such a conversation.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the alleged false statement by Clinton occurred during a dinner conversation at a small gathering hosted by Madeleine Albright, another former Secretary of State, at her home in Washington. Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice also attended. Joe Conason, a journalist, describes the conversation in his upcoming book, \"Man of the World: The Further Endeavors of Bill Clinton,\" which The Times obtained an advanced copy of.\n\nConason writes that the conversation took place during the early months of Clinton's tenure at the State Department. He notes that Powell suggested using a personal email account for unclassified communications, a decision Clinton reportedly made months earlier to keep her personal account and use it for most messages.\n\nThe Times reports that Clinton has not publicly claimed that Powell advised her to use private email. The FBI's production of documents to Congress has been criticized by Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who said the Bureau has \"improperly\" limited access to its files.\n\nPowell's office released a statement on Thursday night, stating that he had no recollection of the dinner conversation. The statement also mentioned that Powell may have written a memo about his personal email use, which could exist in the FBI files. In his memoir, \"It Worked for Me,\" Powell writes about his personal email use and takes pride in having tried to advance the antiquated technology practices at the State Department. However, Powell's use of personal email and Clinton's aren't entirely parallel, as Powell did not have a server at his house or rely on outside contractors, as Clinton did at her home in Chappaqua, NY.\n\nThe FBI's decision to not prosecute Clinton for her email practices has been criticized, with Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) stating that the Bureau has \"improperly\" limited access to its files. Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri scolded that the material is classified, and any leaking of such material is illegal. However, the Clinton campaign has been accused of not taking the safeguarding of classified information seriously, as Clinton used a private server for her emails, which housed classified information.",
    " Title: Trump's Executive Order on Family Separation Draws Mixed Reactions from Liberals and Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's executive order ending the process of separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border has received mixed reactions from both liberals and conservatives. The Homeland Security Secretary briefed House Republicans on the executive order, but it appears that neither the order nor the GOP immigration bills have enough support.\n\nLiberals have been critical of the policy, which they describe as \"cruel and inhumane.\" They argue that the executive order merely swaps family separation for the detention of children. Some conservatives have also criticized Trump's policy and his handling of the controversy, but they have also accused Democrats of refusing to compromise on immigration.\n\nCNN's Chris Cillizza described Trump's decision as a \"fundamental miscalculation.\" He stated that being \"tough\" on immigration is not a political positive when it leads to images of children being separated from their parents. Rush Limbaugh, a conservative radio host, suggested that the media and Democrats would react to Trump's executive order by triumphantly claiming they forced Trump to \"cave\" on the issue while also backing legal challenges to keep the issue alive.\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo wrote in a New York Times op-ed that the Trump administration's treatment of immigrant children has left a \"dark stain\" on the history of the nation. He argued that the executive order does not solve the problem, as it still allows for the long-term detention of immigrant children and has potentially caused irreparable harm to those children used as pawns in the president's political agenda.\n\nThe Federalist's David Harsanyi conceded that family separation is \"callous and ineffective,\" but he argued that it does not excuse \"ginned-up moral panic, pious grandstanding, and comparisons to Nazi death camps.\" He accused Democrats of defending a policy that incentivizes more migrants to bring children (sometimes their own, but sometimes not) and of being unwilling to make any compromise on the issue.\n\nWith this executive order, the policy of separating families appears to cease. However, child internment will continue, with families together as prisoners in federal custody. Young children will still be locked in \"tender age\" camps, asylum-seekers will still be criminalized as dangers and threats to national integrity, and there is still the matter of those children already separated from their parents.",
    " Title: U.S. Military Involvement in Afghanistan: A Twenty-Year Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States' military engagement in Afghanistan, which began in 2001, may be viewed by future historians as a prolonged and costly endeavor, similar to other great powers that attempted to exert control over the country. The British, for instance, retreated in 1842 after suffering approximately 4,500 casualties, including those from massacres that preceded the invention of the roadside bomb. They relinquished their sovereignty over Afghanistan in 1919, marking the beginning of the unwinding of their empire.\n\nThe Soviet Union also ended its decade-long attempt to control Afghanistan in 1989, months before the fall of the Berlin Wall signaled the collapse of the Communist superpower. This withdrawal led to the chaos and power vacuums that Osama bin Laden exploited, a situation the United States vowed it would never allow to persist.\n\nThe American-led attack, named \"Operation Enduring Freedom,\" commenced on October 7, 2001, following the attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a plane crash in Pennsylvania. In his address to the nation from the Treaty Room of the White House, President George W. Bush pledged to \"win this conflict by the patient accumulation of successes, by meeting a series of challenges with determination and will and purpose.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the country rallied behind Bush. While a few warned of the dangers of entering what was dubbed the \"graveyard of empires,\" the war was more perceived as a retaliatory and justice-seeking mission rather than a nation-building effort.\n\nAfter bin Laden was killed in Pakistan in May 2011, and with Al Qaeda significantly weakened, politicians found it challenging to articulate the purpose of American troops' continued presence. Over 2,400 service members have died in combat since the invasion, according to the website icasualties.org. Neither President Barack Obama nor President Donald Trump could convincingly argue that, after nearly two decades, the United States had a significant role to play other than propping up a fragile democracy.",
    " Title: Elizabeth Warren Delivers Fiery Speech in Support of Hillary Clinton, Criticizes Donald Trump's Actions Toward Women\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring a campaign event for Hillary Clinton on Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren delivered a passionate speech, referring to women as \"nasty\" in a nod to a phrase used by Donald Trump during the third presidential debate. Warren's speech focused on Trump's alleged disrespectful behavior towards women.\n\nWarren criticized Trump for his behavior, stating, \"Donald Trump aggressively disrespects more than half the human beings in this country. He thinks that because he has money, that he can call women fat pigs and bimbos. He thinks that because he is a celebrity that he can rate women's bodies from one to 10. He thinks that because he has a mouth full of Tic-Tacs, he can force himself on any women within groping distance.\"\n\nWarren went on to say, \"Women have had it with guys like you. And nasty women have really had it with guys like you.\"\n\nThe speech drew attention to Warren's past praise for the late Senator Ted Kennedy, whom she described as her moral compass in politics. Warren said, \"Ted Kennedy changed my life. He changed how I understood what it is that a public servant does. I think of him in this race every single day, and I come to this convention and think about him every single hour.\"\n\nKennedy's loutish behavior towards women, which included causing the death of one, did not stop Warren from praising him. She spoke of the \"special\" inscription Kennedy had carved on the Senate desk she sits at.\n\nThe speech drew criticism for its hypocrisy, as some pointed out the irony of Warren's support for a candidate who has been accused of questionable actions towards women, while also criticizing Trump for similar behavior. Some also noted the inconsistency in Warren's praise for Kennedy, given his past behavior towards women.\n\nIn addition, some criticized Hillary Clinton for her association with Bill Clinton, who has been accused of sexual misconduct. Some also pointed out the contradiction in Clinton's campaign's focus on women's rights, given her support for policies such as sex-selection abortion and partial-birth abortions.\n\nThe speech also drew attention to a Clinton campaign ad featuring a young girl looking into a mirror, with Trump's alleged disrespectful comments towards women playing in the background. The ad ends with the question, \"Is this the president we want for our daughters?\" Some criticized the ad for implying that Clinton is a role model for young girls, while others questioned the authenticity of the ad's message, given Clinton's association with Bill Clinton and her own record on women's issues.",
    " Title: Congressional Democrats and Republicans Disagree on Trump Administration's Proposed CHIP Funding Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nCongressional Democrats and Republicans are at odds over the Trump Administration's proposal to roll back $15 billion in previously allocated funding, with a significant portion of the requested rescissions coming from the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The White House claims that the $7 billion cut from CHIP funding comes from unspent funds from 2017, which has now expired.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi have spoken out against the administration's proposal, setting the stage for an upcoming fight. Schumer stated, \"Let's be honest about what this is: President Trump and Republicans in Congress are looking to tear apart the bipartisan (CHIP), hurting middle-class families and low-income children, to appease the most conservative special interests and feel better about blowing up the deficit to give the wealthiest few and biggest corporations huge tax breaks.\"\n\nPelosi, in a statement to members, said her colleagues were not ready to strike a deal. \"These Republican rescissions show the hypocrisy of a GOP Congress that insists on tight budgets for children and families while handing enormous, unpaid-for giveaways to corporations and the wealthiest,\" she said.\n\nThe disagreement is not limited to Democratic leadership. Democratic senators have also expressed their disdain for the proposal, citing its requests for cuts to the CHIP program. In March, members of Congress voted to rescind $3.1 billion from the CHIP Contingency Fund and $3.6 billion in funds provided to states, totaling just under $7 billion.\n\nThe administration's proposal also includes sections 526, 527, and 529, which outline the rescission of specific funds and the unavailability of certain amounts for obligation in the current fiscal year.\n\nIn early February, lawmakers agreed to a 10-year extension of CHIP funding, which included $7 billion towards community health centers, $6 billion to deal with opioids and mental care, and other provisions supported on a bipartisan basis.\n\nIn 2011, Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan put forth an amendment that called for the rescinding of $44 billion in unobligated funds, an amount three times the size of the administration's proposal. The amendment won the support of 81 senators, including several Democrats and Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who is ambivalent about the president's proposal due to CHIP funding.",
    " Title: Pelosi Suggests President Trump's Actions May Be Building an Impeachment Case, Calls for Attorney General Barr to be Held in Contempt\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested on Wednesday that President Donald Trump's actions, particularly his continued obstruction of congressional subpoenas and demands for testimony, may be inadvertently building a case for impeachment. During a live interview with The Washington Post, Pelosi stated, \"He's becoming self-impeachable in terms of some of the things he's doing.\"\n\nPelosi has consistently cautioned against the divisive process of impeachment and has previously warned against Democrats rushing to initiate impeachment proceedings. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she suggested that Trump might be attempting to provoke Democratic lawmakers into doing so.\n\nDuring the interview, Pelosi pointed out that one of the articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon charged obstruction of Congress, but she did not commit to a similar narrow impeachment push against Trump.\n\nPelosi also called for Attorney General William Barr to be held in contempt for his refusal to release an unredacted version of the Mueller report. However, she stopped short of calling for Barr's impeachment.\n\nPelosi argued that the House Judiciary Committee had made accommodations to protect certain parts of the Mueller report, but the White House intervened, invoking executive privilege. She stated, \"The accommodations the committee has tried to make...I appreciate protecting sources and methods, some law enforcement concerns. That's not a reason to give us the report. It's an excuse not to give us the report, because we all agree that certain things should be redacted.\"\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to meet Wednesday to vote on a contempt citation for Barr for missing the committee's self-imposed deadline for turning over the full report last week. Pelosi noted that the contempt motion did not account for Barr's refusal to appear before the Judiciary Committee last week, objecting to being questioned by committee staff in addition to lawmakers.\n\nPelosi also took a swipe at Barr's no-show, suggesting he felt \"safer in the Republican majority in the Senate,\" where he had testified the day before.",
    " Title: \"Book Reveals Behind-the-Scenes Strategy of Kavanaugh's Supreme Court Confirmation\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the controversy surrounding Christine Blasey Ford's accusations against Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court nomination, there were speculations that he might withdraw from the nomination battle. However, President Trump and his top aides opted to fight back, according to a new book titled \"Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court.\"\n\nAuthors Mollie Hemingway, a Fox News contributor and senior editor at the Federalist, and Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network, interviewed Trump, top White House officials, several Supreme Court justices, and many others for the book.\n\nThe book reveals a central conundrum for Kavanaugh and his advocates, which is that any criticism of Ford would be perceived as a smear and victim shaming. Despite some details about Ford's behavior in high school and college that were \"dramatically at odds with her presentation in the media,\" the Kavanaugh team decided to focus on his record and the damage to his reputation.\n\nThe authors are critical of the coverage of the nomination drama, including in the New York Times and Washington Post, and blame in part \"the media's irrational personal dislike of Kavanaugh.\" They particularly unload on the New Yorker for publishing the allegations of Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh who claimed that he exposed himself to her and caused her to touch his genitals. The magazine was unable to find a corroborating witness, acknowledging that Ramirez had \"significant gaps\" in her memories and that it took her six days of assessing those memories and consulting with a lawyer to name Kavanaugh. He flatly denied the allegations.\n\nMichael Avenatti, the lawyer now facing criminal charges in three cases, later produced an affidavit from another accuser, Julie Swetnick. She claimed to have attended more than 10 house parties in the early 1980s at which Kavanaugh and a friend became inebriated and sexually assaulted women, and got them drunk so they could be gang-raped.\n\nHemingway and Severino call the allegations \"obviously ridiculous,\" saying \"no one could have hidden such crimes for decades, much less a man who went on to hold high-profile positions in the White House and then became a judge on the second-most prominent federal court.\" Kavanaugh said the charges were from \"the Twilight Zone.\"\n\nWhen NBC\u2019s Kate Snow interviewed Swetnick, the network acknowledged that some of her comments on camera \"differ from her written statement last week.\" Swetnick backed off from saying Kavanaugh had spiked the punch, recalling only that he had handed out the punch. More importantly, she dropped her claim that Kavanaugh was present at her rape, saying only that she had seen him earlier at the same party.\n\n\"Despite Swetnick\u2019s obvious credibility problems, many in the media continued to air her accusations,\" the book says. The book also touches on some of those alleged details involving Ford.\n\nThe authors, who obviously write from a conservative perspective, offer many examples of what they call \"the media\u2019s irrational personal dislike of Kavanaugh.\" The Times published a story co-authored by Emily Bazelon, who had already announced her opposition to Kavanaugh, saying that in college he was involved in a bar fight that involved throwing ice. (The paper admitted Bazelon was not a newsroom reporter and should not have been used on the story.) In a USA Today column, Erik Brady said Kavanaugh should give up his school coaching duties because \"credibly accused sex offenders\" should \"stay off basketball courts for now when kids are around.\"\n\nThe judge's staunchest supporter was his wife Ashley, who had prayed that her husband wouldn't get the nomination. Ashley sustained herself through the ordeal by praying regularly and studying the Bible. When Sen. Susan Collins, a key swing vote, gave a lengthy speech saying she would vote to confirm Kavanaugh, Ashley made an emotional call to her husband and told him to watch it. Kavanaugh, who knew that it would have been easier politically for the senator not to support him, texted her a message of thanks and promised that he would not disappoint her.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's DACA Ruling Puts Immigration Reform Pressure on Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court's conservative majority has cast doubt on the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, potentially leaving the issue in the hands of Congress. The court is expected to make a ruling in the spring of 2020, during an election year, when the politics of immigration are expected to be more challenging.\n\nSince the Senate's failure to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul in 2013, it has been unable to secure 60 votes for a substantial immigration bill. The chamber did pass a spending bill providing aid to the border this year, but the Democrats' internal disputes over the matter made the party more reluctant to engage with the Trump administration.\n\nThe biggest hurdle for a potential deal is the massive trust deficit between Senate Democrats and the president. Many Democrats feel burned by past negotiations, and some in the party seem unwilling to try again. Centrist Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) stated, \"It is exceptionally difficult to make any deal that sticks. For a man who is supposed to be a great deal-maker, we have yet to see a great deal.\"\n\nThe president's tweet this week, stating that \"If Supreme Court remedies with overturn, a deal will be made with Dems for them to stay!\" has been met with skepticism by both Democrats and some Republicans. In 2018, only eight Republicans joined the Democrats on a compromise immigration proposal, a number advocates say could have been much higher without Trump and his aides' opposition.\n\nThe House passed legislation dealing with DACA protections earlier this year, but the Senate has ignored it. The bar is high in the Senate, with its 60-vote requirement, and under the current party splits, the chamber's supermajority threshold on the filibuster would require either seven Democrats or 13 Republicans to cross party lines on any immigration bill.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) stated, \"We don't have the votes in the Senate, OK?\" and expressed his belief that the president liked the 2013 immigration reform but is unable to act due to pressure from hardliners like Stephen Miller. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) suggested narrowing legislation as much as possible to cover only the 660,000 young people whose status could be affected by the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nThe Senate, controlled by Republicans, is generally more divided on the issue than the Democratic Party. Trump lost 14 votes from the Senate GOP on his 2018 immigration bill, revealing that any legislation providing a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants is a bridge too far for some Republicans.\n\nDespite these challenges, some senators, such as Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), believe the chamber should begin working on a plan now rather than waiting for the Supreme Court to force Congress' hand just months from a presidential election. The biggest problem might be getting votes from Democrats for any plan that doesn't first have Trump's full and explicit support. The bipartisan immigration deal cut by Sens. Angus King (I-Maine) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) last year was supported by every Democrat but three, but King states he wouldn't replicate that deal today after Trump torpedoed it.",
    " Title: Iowa Caucuses Face Challenges in Implementing Absentee Voting Process Due to DNC Rules\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Iowa caucuses, often viewed as the first step in the presidential nominating season, have faced criticism and comparisons to pests that are difficult to eliminate. However, the caucuses serve a valuable function in the political process, despite efforts to undermine them.\n\nThe current challenge for the Iowa caucuses stems from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) requiring states, including Iowa, to establish an absentee voting process. The goal is to expand participation and prevent disenfranchisement of individuals who may be unable to attend in-person caucuses due to work, mobility issues, overseas military service, or other conflicts.\n\nIowa Democrats have made efforts to create a way to expand participation while maintaining the nature of the caucuses. However, the DNC has expressed concerns about the security of a proposed \"virtual\" telephonic caucus meeting, citing potential vendor issues. This has led to a dispute between the DNC and Iowa Democrats.\n\nThe DNC's concerns seem to arise from a misunderstanding of caucuses, as they are not elections and should not be held to the same standards for participation or security as elections. Caucuses do not produce an irreversible result that might put the wrong person in office.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses are unique in that they force voters to give up most of an evening in the middle of winter, which encourages voters to educate themselves about the issues and candidates. The caucuses are also significant for party-building, as candidates must meet voters and campaign on their ideas in Iowa, giving the rest of the country a better opportunity to take their measure.\n\nThe DNC's current rules may lead to the elimination of the Iowa caucuses, which could potentially impact the American political process and the \"American dream\" of anyone being able to become president. The DNC is currently considering a waiver for Iowa's absentee caucus process, but this only delays the issue until 2024. The DNC should reconsider its blanket prohibition on telephone caucuses or rethink its requirement for an absentee caucus process.",
    " Title: U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Testimony Under Scrutiny: A Closer Look at the Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent news regarding U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been met with skepticism due to conflicting reports in The New York Times and The Washington Post. The controversy revolves around Sessions' failure to disclose two meetings he had with Russia's ambassador to the United States during his confirmation hearing to become attorney general.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Sessions spoke twice last year with Russia's ambassador, a fact he did not disclose during his confirmation hearing. This has led to questions about potential contacts between members of President Trump's campaign and representatives of Moscow.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush's chief White House ethics lawyer, Richard W. Painter, has called the story a \"bombshell\" and suggested that such behavior would typically result in termination, revocation of security clearances, and potential criminal prosecution. On the other hand, Senator Ted Cruz has labeled it a \"nothing burger.\"\n\nInitially, this article aimed to present three hypotheses for the situation: (1) Sessions was colluding with Moscow and trying to hide it; (2) Sessions wasn't colluding with Moscow, but he forgot about his meetings with Kislyak; (3) Sessions wasn't colluding with Moscow, but decided to lie about contacts with Russians.\n\nUpon further investigation, the first hypothesis was dismissed, as collusion would typically involve more discretion. The second hypothesis was also questioned, as Sessions submitted a Questions for the Record (QFR) filing, and such documents are completed with great care, making an omission or falsehood unlikely.\n\nAfter reviewing the QFR, it was found that the Russia question, as posed by Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy, was: \"Several of the President-Elect's nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties. Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?\" Sessions' answer was: \"No.\"\n\nTherefore, all three initial hypotheses have been dismissed, leaving the question of why Sessions answered \"No\" to the question about contact with anyone connected to the Russian government, when he had indeed met with the Russian ambassador.",
    " Title: Iran's Foreign Minister Assumes U.S. Will Abandon Nuclear Deal, Hopes Europe Will Maintain Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nIran's Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has expressed the assumption that the United States will abandon the international nuclear deal restricting Iran's nuclear activities. In an interview with the Financial Times and the Guardian, Zarif stated that if the deal collapses, Iran would no longer be bound by its limitations on uranium enrichment, centrifuge numbers, and the production of plutonium. However, he reiterated that Iran would only use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\n\nZarif's comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump is set to announce next month whether he believes Iran has complied with the terms of the deal. If Trump determines that Iran has failed to adhere to the agreement, the U.S. Congress will initiate the process of reimposing sanctions on Iran. Trump has previously criticized the deal, referring to it as an \"embarrassment\" in a speech to the United Nations this month.\n\nFrance, Germany, and the UK, which, along with Russia and China, signed the deal, have recently defended it. If the deal collapses, Iran would no longer be bound by its limitations, according to Zarif. He stated, \"You either live by it [the deal] or you set it aside. You can not be half pregnant.\"\n\nZarif also noted that the deal allowed Iran to continue its research and development, thereby improving its technological base. He suggested that if Iran were to abandon the deal, it would do so with better technology.\n\nIn response to questions about Trump's unpredictability, Zarif said, \"I think he has made a policy of being unpredictable, and now he's turning that into being unreliable as well. He has violated the letter, spirit, everything of the deal.\"\n\nZarif added that Iran's options would depend on how the international community responds to the U.S.'s actions. \"If Europe and Japan and Russia and China decided to go along with the U.S., then I think that will be the end of the deal,\" he said. \"Europe should lead.\"\n\nEuropean Union officials have stated they could act to legally protect European investors in Iran if the U.S. reimposes sanctions. However, they have also criticized Iran over its non-nuclear activities in the region.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Announces Plan to Resurrect \"Gag Rule\" on Planned Parenthood\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has announced plans to reinstate a rule that would prohibit federally funded family planning clinics, including Planned Parenthood, from discussing abortion with patients. White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway stated that the administration is recognizing \"that abortion is not family planning\" and that the funds are intended for family planning services.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services officially filed the rule with the Office of Management and Budget on Friday. Planned Parenthood's clinics are major recipients of grants for family planning and basic preventive care. During the 2016 election, President Trump campaigned on defunding the organization.\n\nThe policy, often referred to as a \"gag rule,\" is likely to trigger lawsuits that could prevent it from taking effect. Planned Parenthood's executive vice president, Dawn Laguens, stated that the policy would make it impossible for women to access Planned Parenthood's services.\n\nHowever, the administration stated that Planned Parenthood can still receive Title X grants if it keeps the family-planning money separate from funds used to pay for abortions. An administration official told Fox News, \"This proposal does not necessarily defund Planned Parenthood, as long as they\u2019re willing to disentangle taxpayer funds from abortion as a method of family planning.\"\n\nKnown as Title X, the nation's family planning program serves about four million women a year through clinics, at a cost to taxpayers of about $260 million. The policy was rescinded under President Bill Clinton, and a new rule went into effect which allowed \"nondirective\" counseling to include a range of options for women.\n\nAccording to a Trump administration summary, the new proposal would roll back the Clinton requirement that abortion should be discussed as an option along with prenatal care and adoption. Doctors' groups and abortion rights supporters argue that a ban on counseling women infringes on the doctor-patient relationship. They point out that federal family planning funds cannot currently be used to pay for abortion procedures.\n\nAbortion opponents allege that the federal family planning program in effect cross-subsidizes abortion services provided by Planned Parenthood. The Republican-led Congress has unsuccessfully tried to deny federal funds to Planned Parenthood, and the Trump administration has vowed to religious and social conservatives that it will continue the effort.",
    " Title: Study Finds Similar Motivation for Ideological Bubble Formation Among Liberals and Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology has found that both liberals and conservatives are similarly motivated to avoid information that contradicts their beliefs, challenging the common perception that conservatives are more prone to forming ideological bubbles. The study, led by psychology professor Jeremy Frimer of the University of Winnipeg in Canada, was inspired by a conversation with a liberal philosophy professor who expressed a reluctance to engage with the opposing view on same-sex marriage.\n\nThe research, which involved five experiments with approximately 2,400 participants, identified several issues that people are particularly keen to avoid debating, including climate change, the merits of former U.S. presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and same-sex marriage. In one experiment, participants from both sides of the debate willingly forfeited a chance to win money to avoid hearing from someone with an opposing view on same-sex marriage.\n\nThe study's authors found that this avoidance of opposing viewpoints was not due to election fatigue or a feeling of being well-informed about the issues. Instead, participants from both sides were trying to avoid the discomfort that comes with conflicting opinions and were concerned that disagreeing with someone would damage their relationship with them.\n\nFrimer and his colleagues also found that this lack of interest in opposing viewpoints was not related to the participants' political ideology. \"People are looking to avoid feeling angry and frustrated when they hear from the other side, and they are also looking to avoid fights,\" Frimer said. The study suggests that people have a fundamental need to feel mental synchrony with others, and seeking out information from like-minded others could satisfy this need, while avoiding information from unlike-minded others could undermine it.\n\nThe study's findings add a new nuance to previous research on ideological bubbles, which has generally found that political conservatives are more prone to avoiding dissenting opinions than liberals. Frimer and his colleagues argue that the tendency to self-segregate by political beliefs is far from one-sided. \"Liberals are very open-minded \u2014 toward other liberals. Beyond that, they might be a little more self-congratulatory than the evidence warrants,\" Frimer said.\n\nThe study has some caveats. The participants were disproportionately wealthy, well-educated, and white. Additionally, the opinions included in the analysis were ones that the subjects had already developed; the researchers did not ask subjects to form a new opinion on a novel or hypothetical issue. It's also possible that one side may have better reasons to want to ignore the other or be justifiably disinterested in what the other side has to say.\n\nRegardless of political ideology, people tend to see their own views as unquestionably right and others' as unquestionably wrong. \"Liberals may think that conservatives' views truly are irrational, indefensible, and the product of fear \u2014 and thus not worth hearing,\" Frimer and his colleagues wrote. \"A conservative might have a similar impression of liberals' beliefs, opinions, and reasoning.\" The result: \"What could ultimately be a contest of ideas is being replaced by two, non-interacting monopolies\" \u2014 a situation we're all responsible for helping to create.",
    " Title: Kentucky Senate Debate Sparks Controversy: McConnell and Grimes Clash on Obama Agenda, Jobs, and Coal\n\nArticle:\n\nThe first and only Kentucky Senate debate of the season took place on Monday, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes engaging in a heated exchange. The debate, which was televised for an hour, centered on topics such as the Obama administration's agenda, job creation, and the coal industry.\n\nMcConnell accused Grimes of supporting President Obama's \"jobs-killing agenda,\" particularly in relation to the war on coal in Kentucky. Grimes countered that McConnell \"doesn't want to take responsibility for all that is wrong with Washington,\" attributing the issues to gridlock and partisanship championed by McConnell.\n\nGrimes also defended herself against McConnell's attempts to link her to Obama, stating, \"I have my disagreements with the president, but the president is not on the ballot this year.\" When asked about her voting history, Grimes, who has identified as a Clinton Democrat, declined to disclose whether she voted for President Obama, citing her constitutional right to privacy at the ballot box.\n\nMcConnell, who has faced criticism for his ties to the coal industry, accused Grimes of trying to \"deceive Kentuckians\" and \"hide her views.\" He also reiterated his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, calling it \"the worst piece of legislation in the last half century\" and advocating for its complete removal.\n\nGrimes, who has been critical of McConnell's conservative leadership, emphasized her plan to grow the middle class and create jobs. McConnell, in response, expressed his experience and steadfast leadership, even when faced with Grimes' accusations of profiting from his government job and opposing legislation to help children.\n\nThe closely-watched race is considered one of the toughest in McConnell's 30-year Senate career and is among the six or seven races that will determine whether Republicans take control of the Senate. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has invested $1.4 million in Grimes, in addition to the half-million already spent on the race.\n\nAccording to a nonpartisan average of polls by RealClearPolitics.com, McConnell currently leads by 3 percentage points. McConnell, who would likely become the Senate majority leader if his party takes control of the upper chamber, could potentially derail the remainder of Obama's second term if the Republicans win a net total of six races.\n\nThroughout the campaign, both candidates have received significant financial support from outside interests. Hollywood types are eager to unseat a top Capitol Hill Republican, while McConnell supporters are trying to prevent what they consider to be overspending and overreach by the Obama administration, including the Environmental Protection Agency's crackdown on the coal industry.\n\nThe McConnell campaign and its allies have consistently run TV ads comparing Grimes to Obama. Two groups, Kentuckians for Strong Leadership and the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition, have collectively invested $5.2 million in General Election ad time. Grimes, in response to these ads, accused McConnell and his allies of misleading Kentuckians with $50 million in deceptive ads.",
    " Title: Democrats' Strategies in Response to Kavanaugh's Supreme Court Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing battle over President Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, Democrats have resorted to two primary strategies: disruption and criticism. The nuclear option, invoked by former Sen. Harry Reid, has left Democrats with limited power to block Kavanaugh's ascension, prompting demonstrative actions and vocal opposition.\n\nSenators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both vocal opponents of Kavanaugh's nomination, attempted to halt the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing by calling for adjournment and interrupting proceedings multiple times. Other senators, including Richard Blumenthal, Mazie Hirono, Amy Klobuchar, Sheldon Whitehouse, Patrick Leahy, and Chris Coons, also disrupted the hearing.\n\nProtests outside the hearing included Women's March activist Linda Sarsour, who was arrested for disrupting the proceedings, and feminist protesters dressed as characters from \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" Social media platforms were flooded with criticism and calls to action, with Planned Parenthood Action tweeting, \"This is what the resistance looks like, and we're going to fight like hell to #StopKavanaugh.\"\n\nOne controversial incident involved accusations of white supremacy symbolism against Zina Bash, a former Kavanaugh law clerk. Amy Siskind of The Weekly List tweeted, \"What fresh hell is this!!!??? Kavanaugh's assistant Zina Bash giving the white power sign during the hearing? This alone should be disqualify!!!\" However, it was later revealed that Bash, who is half-Mexican and half-Jewish, and whose paternal grandparents were Holocaust survivors, was not making a white supremacy gesture.\n\nAnother controversy arose when Fred Guttenberg, the father of a Parkland shooting victim, claimed that Kavanaugh refused to shake his hand. However, it was later revealed that this encounter did not occur as described.\n\nWith judicial hearings often proving fruitless in terms of gaining insight into nominees' judicial philosophies, the hearing process has been criticized for its lack of substance. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could potentially end the circus by bringing Kavanaugh up for a vote. However, the political theater is expected to continue, with Democrats maintaining a visible presence in the opposition.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Decision on Affordable Care Act: Three Potential Outcomes for the Obama Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) this month. The court's decision could potentially impact the 2012 election, although the Obama administration aims to keep health care from becoming a defining issue of the campaign.\n\nAccording to sources close to the situation, the Obama administration is preparing for three main scenarios: the law being upheld, the individual mandate being struck down while the rest of the law remains, or the court overturning the entire ACA.\n\nIf the court upholds the ACA, the administration would likely celebrate a significant legislative victory. However, if the individual mandate is struck down, leaving the rest of the law intact, the administration would retain popular provisions such as covering pre-existing conditions, eliminating the \"donut hole\" gap for senior prescription benefits, and allowing young adults to stay on their parents' health plans until age 26.\n\nA poll by The New York Times/CBS suggests that 51% of voters either want the individual mandate struck down or the entire law upheld, while 41% want the whole law trashed. This aligns with years of polling showing that individual parts of the ACA, particularly banning discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, are more popular than the law as a whole.\n\nIf the court strikes down the individual mandate and also removes the provision covering pre-existing conditions, it would create a policy dilemma. The individual mandate is crucial for funding the popular provisions of the ACA. Without the mandate, the administration would need to find alternative funding sources to maintain these provisions.\n\nAnother scenario, considered a good bet by some SCOTUS watchers, is that the court could knock out the individual mandate and also strip out the pre-existing condition coverage, since it wouldn't work without the mandate. This is the scenario the Obama administration suggests the court should adopt if it eliminates the mandate.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario for the administration, a split verdict could result in a phantom law on the books that energizes tea party Republicans who want the ACA dead. The Obama administration is reportedly preparing for these outcomes, with quiet plans underway to address potential policy and political challenges.",
    " Title: Republican National Convention Shaping Up to Be a Contentious Event Amidst Lack of Support from GOP Leaders\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican National Convention, scheduled to take place in Cleveland this year, is shaping up to be a contentious event amidst a lack of support from several GOP leaders. The Democratic National Convention, on the other hand, is expected to follow the traditional script, with Hillary Clinton set to emerge as the party's nominee.\n\nThe Republican convention is facing a significant challenge, with numerous GOP governors, senators, and House members expressing reluctance to speak or attend the event. Trey Gowdy, the Republican Congressman from South Carolina, and Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo are among those who have publicly stated they will not be attending.\n\nThe lack of interest in speaking at the convention is unusual, as a speaking slot at a national convention is a significant opportunity for politicians to introduce themselves to the country and potential campaign financiers. The reluctance to participate in the convention is attributed to the widespread opposition to Donald Trump's campaign, with approximately 70% of the country objecting to it, according to Stuart Stevens, a Republican strategist.\n\nFurthermore, the #NeverTrump forces are reportedly planning to stage a coup at the convention, with an \"advance team\" heading to Cleveland this week to lay the groundwork for a contested convention. The plan is to \"unbind\" the GOP delegates, allowing them to \"vote their conscience,\" which is another way of saying they would overturn the will of their voters. However, the RNC is aware of the potential damage that could result from usurping the party's democratically elected nominee at the convention.\n\nDespite the efforts of the #NeverTrump forces, the RNC is expected to face challenges in papering over the chaos, given the conspicuous lack of relevant or respectable speakers. The convention's proceedings will likely be a stark reminder of a party without a clear identity or a strong chance of winning in November.",
    " Title: Unemployment Claims Decrease, but Remain Historically High in the U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nFirst-time unemployment claims in the United States totaled 2.1 million last week, marking a decrease from previous weeks and the lowest total since the onset of the coronavirus crisis. This figure, however, still indicates a high number of Americans remain jobless. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had anticipated 2.05 million claims.\n\nThe total represented a decrease of 323,000 from the previous week's upwardly revised 2.438 million. Continuing claims, or those who have been collecting benefits for at least two weeks, numbered 21.05 million, showing a clear picture of the ongoing joblessness. This number dropped sharply, falling 3.86 million from the previous week.\n\nIan Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, stated that the decline in continuing claims suggests that the reopening of states is pushing businesses to rehire some of the workers let go when the virus hit. However, Shepherdson noted that some of the data, particularly from California, remains noisy and may not accurately represent some states' situations.\n\nThe insured unemployment rate, a basic calculation of those collecting benefits versus the total labor force, decreased sharply to 14.5% from 17.1% the previous week. Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, commented that layoffs continue at a massive scale, but it may be that the job market is nearing a turning point.\n\nThe four-week moving average, which helps smooth out weekly volatility, rose to 22.72 million, an increase of 760,250 from the previous week. Since the pandemic was declared in mid-March, 40.8 million have filed claims as social distancing measures aimed at containing the coronavirus outbreak resulted in much of the $21.5 trillion U.S. economy being in lockdown for 2\u00bd months.\n\nA separate report Thursday showed that first-quarter GDP contracted by 5%, while the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker is indicating a 41.9% plunge in Q2, which would be the worst in U.S. history. This would place the U.S. firmly in recession territory, though most economists are expecting a rebound in the second half of the year after restrictions are lifted.",
    " Title: Former FBI Director James Comey Faces Criticism Over Actions Detailed in DOJ Inspector General Report\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Department of Justice Inspector General released a report yesterday, alleging that former FBI Director James Comey violated FBI rules, protocol, and potentially laws in his efforts to investigate President Trump and his administration. The report states that Comey failed to safeguard sensitive information obtained during his tenure at the FBI and used it to create public pressure for official action.\n\nAccording to the report, Comey's actions set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees and thousands more former FBI employees who have access to or knowledge of non-public information. The report states, \"In a country built on the rule of law, it is of utmost importance that all FBI employees adhere to Department and FBI policies, particularly when confronted by what appear to be extraordinary circumstances or compelling personal convictions.\"\n\nDespite these findings, Comey demanded an apology from his critics. In response to the report's release, Comey tweeted, \"I don't need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a'sorry we lied about you' would be nice.\"\n\nThe demand has been met with harsh responses from legal experts on both sides of the political aisle. Democrat and George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley wrote in The Hill that Comey's actions \"establish that Comey is the very antithesis of the ethical leader he described.\" Turley further stated, \"Rather than rave about who stole his strawberries, as Queeg did in 'The Caine Mutiny,' Comey claims someone stole a reputation that he tossed away two years ago.\"\n\nRepublican Gregg Jarrett argues at Fox News that Comey owes the American public a sincere apology for abusing his position as FBI director, violating government rules, concealing information from his former agency, leaking sensitive documents without authorization, mismarking memos without classification banners, improperly retaining records in an unsecured location, failing to surrender those records to the FBI, and assuming \"carte blanche authority\" he did not have.\n\nThe report's findings and the subsequent criticism have not deterred Comey from maintaining his innocence. In a statement, Comey portrayed the scathing report as a type of victory and encouraged his critics to send their apologies to him. The report states that Comey not only knowingly violated rules governing all FBI employees but that his decisions \"set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees.\"\n\nThe report's findings and the subsequent criticism have not deterred Comey from maintaining his innocence.

    " Title: President Trump Signs $1.3 Trillion Omnibus Spending Bill, Criticizes Excessive Spending and Democratic Tactics\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill on Friday, emphasizing the need for military rebuilding, but criticized Democrats for adding unnecessary spending and vowed never to sign another budget-busting measure.\n\n\"I've told Congress, I will never sign a bill like this again,\" Mr. Trump said, labeling the legislative process that produced it \"ridiculous.\"\n\nHours prior, the president had threatened to veto the bill, potentially leading to a government shutdown as funding was set to expire at midnight Friday. The veto threat took Washington by surprise, following repeated assurances from White House officials, including Vice President Mike Pence and budget chief Mick Mulvaney, that the president would sign the massive spending package.\n\nUltimately, the president decided to sign the bill \"because of the gains we made for our military,\" he said.\n\nCriticizing the bill he was about to sign for unnecessary spending, not addressing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and not fully funding a border wall, Mr. Trump called for changes to Congress' rules to make progress on vital issues. He demanded Congress approve a line-item veto for the president and for the Senate to eliminate the filibuster rule that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation.\n\n\"We've got to get a lot of great legislation approved, and without the filibuster rule, it will happen just like magic,\" said Mr. Trump. Allowing a line-item veto would require a constitutional amendment, as the Supreme Court ruled the procedure unconstitutional in the 1998 decision Clinton v. City of New York.\n\nMr. Trump boasted that the bill provided a historic boost to military spending, including the largest pay increase for troops in a decade. The investments, he said, fulfilled his pledge to rebuild the U.S. military into the most formidable fighting force in the world.\n\n\"They hollowed our readiness as a military unit and put America at really grave risk,\" he said of years of defense cuts. \"The omnibus bill reverses this.\"\n\nHe blamed the omnibus's huge price tag on Democrats, who he said demanded extra spending in exchange for funding the military. He said the Democrats oppose military spending.\n\n\"If we take something for the military, they want something that in many cases are a wasted sum of money,\" he said. \"It's not right, and it's very bad for our country.\"",
    " Title: Sarah Palin Dismisses Martin Bashir's Attacks, Calls for Higher Media Standards\n\nArticle:\n\nSarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, dismissed the attacks of former MSNBC host Martin Bashir on Thursday, stating that such incidents are \"par for the course.\" In her first comments since Bashir's resignation, Palin expressed her familiarity with such attacks during an interview on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\nBashir resigned on Wednesday following comments he made on his Nov. 15 broadcast, where he referred to Palin as a \"world class idiot\" and compared her to a slave owner, citing a diary of a former plantation manager who forced a slave to defecate in another slave's mouth.\n\nPalin acknowledged that many in the media had criticized Bashir's comments, stating, \"It was refreshing to see though, that many in the media did come out and say, \u2018Look, our standards have got to be higher than this.\u2019\" She emphasized that those with a media platform have a greater responsibility to maintain higher standards.\n\nWhen asked whether Bashir's resignation was sufficient, Palin responded that she had to move past it. She referred to Bashir's on-air apology during his Nov. 18 broadcast and expressed her willingness to accept his apology and move on.\n\nPalin stated that, five or six years ago, she would have been personally hurt by such attacks, but now she feels \"kind of calloused.\" She added that attacks are often directed towards conservative women and that there is an \"obvious\" double standard.\n\n\"As I've said before, the target of the attack is usually more significant than what the attack, the articulated words used, actually are, and that's part of that double standard,\" Palin said, adding that she had not heard from any feminist groups or organizations.",
    " Title: WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange Discusses Alleged U.S. Focus on Russia's Role in Democratic Hacks\n\nArticle:\n\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has stated that there is an \"obvious\" reason the Obama administration has focused on Russia's alleged role in Democratic hacks leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Assange suggested that the Obama administration is attempting to delegitimize the Trump administration as it enters the White House.\n\n\"They're trying to say that President-elect Trump is not a legitimate president,\" Assange said during the interview, which was conducted at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where he has been staying.\n\nAssange reiterated WikiLeaks' denial that Russia was the source of the Democratic documents released over the summer. \"Our source is not a state party, so the answer for our interactions is no,\" he said.\n\nIn December, Assange told Hannity that the documents the anti-secrecy group received looked \"very much like they're from the Russians\" but said his source was not them. When asked if WikiLeaks influenced the 2016 election, Assange pointed to private comments from members of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign in documents published by the group.\n\n\"Did [WikiLeaks] change the outcome of the election? Who knows, it's impossible to tell,\" Assange said. \"But if it did, the accusation is that the true statements of Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager, John Podesta, and the DNC head Debbie Wasserman Schultz, their true statements is what changed the election.\"",
    " Title: Putin Suggests Consideration of Statehood for Eastern Ukraine, Blames West for Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called for immediate talks on the political future of eastern Ukraine, suggesting for the first time that the region could be granted statehood. In a televised program on Sunday, Putin stated, \"We need to immediately begin substantive talks...on questions of the political organization of society and statehood in southeastern Ukraine with the goal of protecting the lawful interests of the people who live there.\"\n\nHistorically, Russia has advocated for greater autonomy for the eastern regions of Ukraine, where predominantly Russian-speakers reside, under a decentralized federal system. However, in the program, Putin did not directly address additional Western sanctions on Russia.\n\nPutin attributed the crisis in Ukraine to Western interference, accusing the West of supporting a \"coup\" against pro-Kremlin president Viktor Yanukovych in February. He stated, \"They should have known that Russia can not stand aside when people are being shot almost at point-blank range.\"\n\nPutin has denied that Moscow has sent regular troops to fight in Ukraine, but pro-Russian rebels have claimed that many Russian soldiers have volunteered while \"on vacation.\" The West accused Moscow this week of orchestrating a counter-offensive that has put Ukrainian government forces on the defensive in the nearly five-month conflict.\n\nNATO stated on Thursday that Moscow had over 1,000 troops on the ground in Ukraine and 20,000 troops massed by the border. Analysts, including Russian experts, see Putin's actions as an attempt to create a statelet in eastern Ukraine, similar to the de facto separatist states in Moldova and Georgia.\n\nPutin referred to the fighters in eastern Ukraine as defenders of \"Novorossiya,\" a loaded Tsarist-era name for what is now southern and eastern Ukraine. He first used the term in April, following the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, which sparked outrage in Kiev and the West.\n\nDespite Putin's stated support for a negotiated political solution to the crisis, he has used fiery, uncompromising rhetoric in recent days. In a talk with youth activists on Friday, he compared the shelling of the rebel-held cities of Lugansk and Donetsk to the Nazi siege of Leningrad. Aid groups have condemned indiscriminate shelling by both sides in the conflict, which has claimed almost 2,600 lives.\n\nPutin placed the blame for the fighting in eastern Ukraine squarely on Kiev. \"What is now happening, it seems to me, to be an absolutely natural reaction by people who live there and who are defending themselves -- they were not the first to take up arms,\" he said.\n\nWhile people in eastern Ukraine had been concerned about attempts to downgrade the status of the Russian language, there had been no serious incidents of violence in the region until pro-Russian rebels took control of several cities in April.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Campaign Strategy and Image Control Revealed in AP Report\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Associated Press has obtained emails that offer insights into the careful image-control apparatus of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign. The emails reveal a behind-the-scenes effort to review introductory remarks for college presidents and students presenting Clinton as a speaker, as well as suggesting questions that align with her campaign platform.\n\nThe campaign reportedly injects itself into minute details of Clinton's appearances, including suggesting questions for college officials to ask during events. For instance, in an email to the president of Greenville Technical College, the campaign suggested a question about making college affordable, which is one of Clinton's campaign issues.\n\nThe emails also suggest a meticulous planning approach that has sometimes pulled local officials uncomfortably into the political arena. Becky Mann, the head of public relations for South Carolina's Greenville Technical College, wrote in an email to the college's president that Clinton's campaign offered to write her introduction, but she declined.\n\nThe campaign's efforts to make Clinton appear less wooden and scripted than she did during her 2008 campaign have been countered by some of her worst answers, particularly in relation to her email scandal. The recently released State Department inspector general report, which found Clinton broke government rules with her personal email use, has increased the likelihood and pressure for the Justice Department to pursue criminal charges, according to an intelligence source familiar with the FBI investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, some U.S. intelligence officials are concerned that Donald Trump's \"shoot from the hip\" style could pose national security risks as they prepare to give him a routine pre-election briefing once he is formally anointed as the Republican presidential nominee. Despite their worries, the officials said the \"Top Secret\" briefing to each candidate would not deviate from the usual format to avoid any appearance of bias.",
    " Title: Romney Delivers Aggressive Speech Accusing Obama of Divisive Campaign Tactics\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, during a rally in Chillicothe, Ohio, delivered a fiery speech on Tuesday night, marking the most aggressive address of his presidential campaign. The Republican presidential candidate accused President Obama of running a \"campaign of division and anger and hate,\" taking on what he termed an \"outrageous charge\" by Vice President Biden.\n\nRomney's speech, which was personally written by him over two days, set the tone for the rest of the week as Romney plans to attend closed-camera fundraisers through Saturday while handing off the campaign to his new running mate, Paul Ryan.\n\nIn the address, Romney dismissed all euphemisms and claimed recent flare-ups on the campaign trail were signs of a president's campaign gone bitter. He pointed to Biden's claim Tuesday in Virginia that Romney and the Republicans intend to roll back Wall Street regulations and \"put y'all back in chains.\" Romney's campaign called it a \"new low,\" while Romney himself accused the president of being \"intellectually exhausted\" and out of ideas.\n\n\"His campaign and his surrogates have made wild and reckless accusations that disgrace the office of the presidency,\" Romney told a crowd of thousands at the final stop on his five-state bus tour. \"Another outrageous charge came a few hours ago in Virginia. And the White House sinks a little bit lower. This is what an angry and desperate presidency looks like.\"\n\nRomney also mocked Obama's statements during the 2008 campaign that without fresh ideas \"you use stale tactics to scare voters.\" Romney accused Obama of now making that strategy \"the heart of his campaign.\"\n\nObama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt responded that Romney \"seemed unhinged\" during the campaign speech.\n\n\"Particularly strange coming at a time when he's pouring tens of millions of dollars into negative ads that are demonstrably false,\" he said.\n\nEarlier, the Obama campaign defended Biden's comments, likening them to language used repeatedly by Republican officials.\n\n\"For months, Speaker Boehner, Congressman Ryan, and other Republicans have called for the 'unshackling' of the private sector from regulations that protect Americans from risky financial deals and other reckless behavior that crashed our economy,\" Stephanie Cutter, deputy campaign manager, said in a written statement. \"We find the Romney campaign's outrage over the vice president's comments today hypocritical, particularly in light of their own candidate's stump speech questioning the president's patriotism.\"\n\nBiden made the remarks during a stop in Danville, Va. He took a swipe at Romney's plan to ease financial regulations, by recycling a Romney bank analogy and creating an analogy of his own.\n\n\"He said in the first 100 days, he's going to let the big banks once again write their own rules,\" Biden said. \"Unchain Wall Street! They're gon na put y'all back in chains.\"\n\nThe remark's context is unclear. Some conservative blogs claimed Biden had just made a reference to slavery. Danville, aside from being the last capital of the Confederacy, is racially split\u2014the city is nearly half black and half white. The crowd at Tuesday's event reflected that makeup. The Romney campaign fired back without accusing Biden of any racial reference.\n\nIn his speech Tuesday evening, however, Romney accused Obama of seeking to divide America\u2014whether by race, occupation, or party affiliation\u2014as a campaign strategy.\n\n\"But he won't win that way. America is one nation under God. American history has been a story of the many becoming one\u2014uniting to preserve liberty, uniting to build the greatest economy in the world, uniting to save the world from unspeakable darkness,\" he said. \"So, Mr. President, take your campaign of division and anger and hate back to Chicago and let us get about rebuilding and reuniting America.\"\n\nRomney championed himself as the savior of the middle class, ticking off areas where Obama and his policies have failed the American people.\n\n\"After four years, it's clear that President Obama's policies are not fixing these problems, they're making them worse,\" Romney said.",

The grants are part of Macron's \"Make Our Planet Great Again\" competition, which he announced in June following Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement.\n\nIn an address from the Elys\u00e9e Palace, Macron, in response to Trump's announcement, urged scientists who were displeased with the move to \"come to France and work with us together\" on climate policy-related research. The competition will select around 50 projects out of a shortlist of 90 for the grants, which will be funded by the state.\n\nWhile the majority of candidates who entered are from the U.S., the competition for research grants was expanded to include climate scientists from other countries outside of France. However, some French researchers have expressed dissatisfaction with the president's decision to fund foreign scientists at a time when funding for domestic projects is reportedly lacking.\n\nMacron's attacks on Trump over the Paris agreement were met with praise from the French and international media. However, the Guardian reported that Macron's \"tough stance\" may have \"backfired,\" and likely prompted the U.S. leader to remind people he \"was elected to serve the citizens of Pittsburgh \u2014 not Paris.\"\n\nSpeaking in the Rose Garden after his announcement that the U.S. would be leaving the Paris climate agreement, President Trump said that the accord signed by the Obama administration in 2015 without the consent of Congress \"disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.\" Trump explained that the agreement would have left American taxpayers having to \"absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.\"",
    " Title: \"Bernie Sanders: A Political Career Defying the Odds and the Establishment\"\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, a 78-year-old independent from Vermont, is a front-runner in the Democratic race for the presidency. His political career, which spans nearly 40 years, has been marked by defying the odds and challenging the political establishment.\n\nSanders' political journey began in 1981 when he ran for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, against a Democratic machine that had controlled the city for decades. Despite facing formidable resistance, Sanders won by a margin of 10 votes. However, within Vermont's city council, 11 of 13 members opposed Sanders and actively conspired against his agenda.\n\nTwo years later, Sanders faced the same Democratic machine in his re-election bid but emerged victorious, this time with more than 20 percentage points. This early battle offered a taste of Sanders' career, which has been a nearly 40-year challenge to the political establishment.\n\nBouncing back from a bitter loss to former US First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, Sanders is running again for the top prize. This time around, he has faced a heart-attack and has raised over $100 million for his campaign.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, to Jewish parents, Sanders' humble upbringing in a tiny apartment made him class-conscious at an early age. He attended the University of Chicago and participated in anti-war and civil rights activism, including the 1963 March on Washington. He applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War but was too old to be drafted by the time his application was rejected.\n\nSanders entered politics in 1971, running for a US Senate seat in Vermont as a Liberty Union candidate, a party with anti-war and socialist roots. He lost that race, as well as a couple of campaigns to become governor. His first major political success came when he was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in 1980, beating a six-term incumbent. He went on to serve four terms.\n\nDuring this time, he met and married his current wife, Jane O'Meara, the former president of Burlington College, once described as a \"key adviser\" in his political career. Combined, they have four children from previous relationships.\n\nHe was first elected to the US House of Representatives in 1990, the first independent to do so in 40 years. He served there until he ran for and won a seat in the Senate in 2007. During that campaign, a younger Barack Obama stumped for him.\n\nSince first arriving in Washington, Sanders has assailed Republican and Democratic politicians alike as being beholden to wealthy donors and industries. For this, he was sometimes dismissed as a gadfly. He is the longest-serving independent in congressional history.\n\nIn 2010, he famously stood and spoke for eight-and-a-half hours to attempt to block the extension of Bush-era tax policies that Sanders said benefited the rich and worsened the nation's income gap. He became the chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs in 2013 and helped negotiate bipartisan solutions when former soldiers complained of dangerously delayed and inadequate care around the country. He was a staunch opponent of the Iraq War.\n\nSanders is fond of praising the social policies of Nordic countries, like universal healthcare and paid leave for new parents. He wants to make college free and erase all student debt.\n\nSanders has been attacked for his voting record on gun control, including his opposition to various forms of the Brady Bill, which required background checks and waiting periods for gun purchasers. He says his record merely reflects the priorities of his Vermont constituents.\n\nIn 2016, during his last presidential run, Sanders jumped into the Democratic race as a long-shot candidate, squaring off against establishment favorite Hillary Clinton. But once again, Sanders confounded expectations: setting fundraising records and, for a time, casting doubt on the once-seemingly inevitable nomination of Mrs. Clinton.\n\nNow, anti-establishment tone intact, Sanders is running on a characteristically progressive platform, featuring Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage, and tuition-free public college. He is quick to note that many items on his agenda - once deemed radical - are now embraced by Democrats.\n\nStill, some Democratic leaders remain sceptical that Sanders could win their party's nomination, a degree of doubt that seems to galvanize him. In October, his candidacy appeared in peril after Sanders suffered a minor heart attack and was forced to suspend his campaign. The episode reignited criticism that Sanders is too old to compete for the presidency. The Vermont senator - who will be 79 by election day - would be the oldest US president in history.\n\nBut within weeks, he was back, bolstered by an endorsement from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the party's liberal darling and youngest ever US congresswoman. Sanders is an unapologetic curmudgeon - he shrugged off a recent claim by Mrs. Clinton that nobody likes him, saying: \"On a good day, my wife likes me.\" And few other candidates could get away with telling a voter's crying baby to \"keep that down.\" But Sanders' supporters say it goes to show he is authentic.\n\nHe now draws crowds in the tens of thousands, as he makes the case that the 2020 election will be won because of his principle and policy, not in spite of it. And if the outsider candidate is able to clinch victory in Iowa, he may be poised to beat the odds once again.",
    " Title: Texas Abortion Law Based on Fertilization May Face Constitutional Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nThe state of Texas has become the 12th state to ban most abortions after 20 weeks, following a trend in state legislation this year. However, the definition of the 20-week limit may cause complications for women and their doctors, potentially affecting the constitutional validity of these laws.\n\nLike most abortion bans passed in states so far, the Texas law starts its 20-week limit at fertilization. But this is not the same as 20 weeks of pregnancy, as doctors measure pregnancy from the date of the last normal menstrual period (LMP).\n\nDr. Daniel Grossman, an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, and a vice president of IBIS Reproductive Health, explains, \"For a woman who has a normal menstrual period, ovulation or fertilization would generally occur two weeks later, after the start of that normal menstrual period. The age of the embryo or the fetus is essentially two weeks less than the number of weeks measured from the last menstrual period.\"\n\nLast menstrual period is generally how doctors refer to the weeks of pregnancy. Forty weeks LMP is considered full term for a normal pregnancy, even though at that point fertilization occurred only 38 weeks before. The use of a measurement that seems imprecise is due to the standard developing in the old days before ultrasound was widely used.\n\nHowever, most state laws, as well as a bill that passed the U.S. House last month, are written with a beginning of pregnancy pegged to fertilization. Elizabeth Nash, who tracks state issues for the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights think tank, explains, \"What we're seeing with these laws is that they are pegging the beginning of pregnancy to fertilization.\"\n\nThe reason people continue to refer to these laws as 20-week laws, despite the imprecision, is due to the term being used in the bill and often becoming the headline, according to Nash.\n\nRegardless of whether the laws seek to ban abortion at 20 weeks or 22 weeks, one thing is clear, says Daniel Grossman. The ban they would impose is earlier than what's currently considered viability, or when a fetus can survive outside the womb.\n\n\"I think there's definitely consensus that viability doesn't happen before 24 menstrual weeks,\" Grossman says. \"So when we're talking about banning abortion at 20 or 22 weeks even, that's clearly at least two weeks before the earliest point in pregnancy where viability would be a concern.\"\n\nThis is important because current Supreme Court precedent states that states cannot ban abortion before viability. Those pushing these laws, however, hope that by the time one of these laws makes its way to the justices, they might change their minds.\n\nSimilar doubts were raised about the constitutionality of an earlier ban that few thought would survive court scrutiny, according to Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee. \"The Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act was struck down by every lower federal court that considered it,\" Johnson said last week at a press conference on the federal version of the 20-week ban. \"Three U.S. District Courts; three U.S. Courts of Appeals all ruled it was in clear violation of U.S. Supreme Court precedent. But when it reached the U.S. Supreme Court, they said otherwise.\"\n\nWhether you count to 20 or 22, the ultimate number that will matter most is five\u2014the number of Supreme Court justices needed for a majority.",
    " Title: Obama Surprises National Security Team, Seeks Congressional Approval for Syria Strike\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's decision to seek congressional approval for a military strike against Syria came unexpectedly, as none of his national security team were aware of the move, according to three senior administration officials.\n\nDuring a National Security Council meeting last weekend, Obama hinted at his inclination towards taking action against Syria but had not made a final decision, the officials stated, requesting anonymity discussing internal deliberations. As Obama weighed his options, his advisers advised against seeking congressional authorization for a military strike, they said.\n\nHowever, when Obama gathered his senior advisers Friday night to inform them of his decision to launch a targeted strike against the Bashar Assad regime, he also disclosed an unprecedented move: he would ask Congress to authorize it first.\n\nObama first broached this idea to his national security team on Friday night following a one-on-one conversation with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough. During Friday night's discussions and again on Saturday morning in the Situation Room, Obama explained his rationale to his aides, some of whom were opposed to seeking congressional approval, according to the unnamed officials.\n\n\"Many people have advised against taking this decision to Congress, and undoubtedly, they were impacted by what we saw happen in the United Kingdom this week when the Parliament of our closest ally failed to pass a resolution with a similar goal, even as the prime minister supported taking action,\" Obama told the nation on Saturday, the officials reported. \"Yet, while I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective.\"\n\nIn the months leading up to Saturday's announcement, Obama had expressed his desire for broad support for any potential action against Syria\u2014a reflection of his long-held view that the credibility of military action comes with numbers. However, Russia, Syria's most powerful patron, would block any United Nations Security Council resolution against Syria. After the British Parliament rejected Prime Minister David Cameron's call for military action last week, it became clear to Obama that a groundswell of international support was not forthcoming.\n\nNotably, Obama contacted President Francois Hollande of France\u2014the only major U.S. ally that has endorsed a military strike\u2014before publicly announcing his decision to seek backing from Congress.\n\nAs Obama edged toward calling for a limited military strike against the Assad regime following Syrian forces' alleged killing of more than 1,400 in a chemical attack in a rebel stronghold outside of Damascus on Aug. 21, White House officials maintained their view that the president did not need to seek congressional approval.\n\nHowever, aides said Obama, who, as a presidential candidate, criticized President George W. Bush's rush to war in Iraq, saw formal consultation with Congress as a central part of his desired legacy to take the United States off a permanent war footing. The president was further convinced that this was the best course of action after the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, told him a Syria operation was not time-sensitive, and there was no negative impact for waiting, the officials said.\n\nCongress is set to return from its summer recess on Sept. 9 and is expected to debate and vote on an authorization that week. Obama would not rule out taking action immediately if Assad deploys chemical weapons before Congress is set to vote, the officials said.\n\nThe officials also emphasized that the president changed his own mind, and no congressional leaders directly asked him to seek authorization, even though about a third of rank-and-file House members have called for it. They declined to speculate what Obama would do if Congress does not approve use of force, while maintaining that Obama retains the authority to act alone.\n\nObama made clear in his remarks on Saturday that a \"no\" vote would send the wrong message to Assad and America's enemies. \"Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?\" Obama said. \"What's the purpose of the international system that we've built if a prohibition on the use of chemical weapons that has been agreed to by the governments of 98% of the world's people and approved overwhelmingly by the Congress of the United States is not enforced?\"",
    " Title: Partisan Divide Emerges Over Vote-by-Mail Expansion Ahead of November Election\n\nArticle:\n\nThe expansion of vote-by-mail options during the coronavirus pandemic has become a contentious issue in the lead-up to the November 3 U.S. election. President Donald Trump and his Republican allies have expressed concerns about vote-by-mail's vulnerability to fraud and its potential impact on their party's electoral prospects.\n\nDemocrats and voting rights groups argue that vote-by-mail is a necessary measure to protect voters from the virus and prevent disenfranchisement, particularly for vulnerable groups such as the poor and African Americans who tend to vote Democratic. The recent turbulent Wisconsin elections, which took place despite Republican efforts to block Democratic attempts to delay in-person voting and expand absentee balloting, highlight the partisan divide and the urgency to find a solution before the November election.\n\nRepublicans argue that vote-by-mail is more susceptible to fraud since voters do not have to appear in person at a polling place. President Trump has claimed, without evidence, that mail ballots are \"cheaters\" and \"fraudulent in many cases.\" However, Trump himself cast an absentee ballot by mail in Florida's Republican primary last month.\n\nTrump's opposition to vote-by-mail appears to be driven, in part, by concerns about higher voter turnout, which Democrats believe could disadvantage Republican candidates. Trump stated that a shift to easier voting would mean \"you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.\"\n\nTrevor Potter, a Republican former chairman of the Federal Election Commission and founder of the Washington-based Campaign Legal Center, found Trump's reaction puzzling, as Republicans often perform well in mail-in balloting. Potter noted that older Americans, who are more likely to support President Trump and are thought to be most vulnerable to the virus, are more likely to vote by mail. Conservative Utah is one of five states that have gone all-mail voting with little sign of fraud.\n\nAcademic, government, and news investigations over the years have found little evidence of election fraud of any kind. Utah and four other states that vote entirely by mail - Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, and Colorado - have reported little fraud.\n\nElection experts have noted scattered incidents of \"ballot harvesting,\" in which people collect and manipulate absentee ballots. The most recent example came in a 2018 North Carolina congressional race, where an operative gathered ballots for the Republican candidate, leading to the race's outcome being overturned.\n\nMore than a dozen states have already postponed primaries or expanded vote-by-mail to avoid crowded polling places. Vote-by-mail was used by about one-quarter of all voters in the 2018 midterm elections, according to a report by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. Along with the five states that vote entirely by mail, 28 states will allow voters to request a mail ballot without any excuse in November, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nSenator Ron Wyden (D-OR), co-sponsor of a bill to expand vote-by-mail and early voting to all states, stated that the expansion is not a novelty but an upscaling of what is already taking place. There are still 17 states, such as Texas, New York, and Louisiana, that would need to change their policies to guarantee that everyone who wants to vote by mail in November can, according to the Brennan Center.\n\nThe cost of ensuring vote-by-mail is available for all voters could be up to $1.4 billion, with postage alone costing up to $600 million. Even advocates of vote-by-mail acknowledge that states should keep the option of in-person voting for voters with disabilities, those who need language access assistance, or those who do not have regular mail access.\n\nDemocratic and Republican-aligned groups are already engaged in legal battles over vote-by-mail expansion in federal and state courts. In New Mexico, county clerks have petitioned the state Supreme Court to conduct their June 2 primary almost entirely by mail and allow all voters to be mailed an absentee ballot. State Republicans have sued to oppose both changes. In Texas, the Democratic Party sued the state's Republican leadership in federal court to allow no-excuse absentee voting. In Georgia, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Republican secretary of state for requiring voters to pay their own postage when submitting mail-in absentee ballots and applications, arguing that this amounts to a poll tax.",
    " Title: Majority of Americans Disapprove of COVID-19 Protests, Support for Restrictions Dips\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll by The University of Chicago Divinity School and The \u2588\u2588\u2588-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research indicates that a majority of Americans disapprove of protests against restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. The poll also shows a decrease in support for such measures, such as stay-at-home orders and restaurant closures, in recent weeks.\n\nThe survey finds that 55% of Americans disapprove of the protests that have occurred in some states, while 31% approve. In contrast, 8% said public protests, marches, and rallies should be unrestricted during the outbreak, 41% think they should be allowed only with restrictions, and 50% think they should not be allowed at all.\n\nOne notable example of protests against COVID-19 restrictions is the case of Shelley Luther, a Texas hair salon owner who was sentenced to seven days in jail for defying Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's emergency orders. She was released less than 48 hours later after Abbott removed jail as a punishment for defying virus safeguards.\n\nIn Michigan, thousands of people rallied outside the state capitol last month to protest Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's restrictions. Hundreds returned two weeks later, some of them armed, to demonstrate inside the statehouse.\n\nThe poll also reveals that 71% of Americans favor requiring people to stay in their homes except for essential errands, down slightly from 80% two weeks earlier. Similarly, 67% of Americans now say they favor requiring bars and restaurants to close, down from 76% in the earlier poll. The poll also suggests a dip in support for requiring Americans to limit gatherings to 10 people or fewer (from 82% to 75%) and requiring postponement of nonessential medical care (from 68% to 57%).\n\nMark Roberts, a retired transportation worker in Abingdon, Virginia, said he is going about his business despite Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam's stay-at-home order. Roberts said people in his southwestern Virginia community are driving the short distance into neighboring Bristol, Tennessee, to patronize restaurants open there.\n\nThe poll was conducted April 30-May 4 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Faces Challenges in Appealing to Women Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's statement, \"There's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other,\" was intended to support Hillary Clinton but has raised concerns about Clinton's appeal to women voters. In an email, Clinton asked, \"Are you with me?\" However, the question may not resonate with young women, as Clinton has faced criticism and low support from this demographic in the Democratic primary race.\n\nDuring a vox pop in Las Vegas, a location for the first Democratic debate, people expressed a unified dislike and distrust of Clinton. In the Iowa caucus, 84% of women under 30 voted for Bernie Sanders, while only 14% supported Clinton. The projection for New Hampshire shows an even more significant disparity, with 92% of young women under 30 planning to back Sanders, and only 11% supporting Clinton among women aged 30-39.\n\nHistorical events, such as the Lewinsky scandal, and Clinton's association with the Clinton family, have contributed to her negative image among some voters. Critics argue that Clinton should have left her husband, Bill, during the Lewinsky scandal, and that she is perceived as entitled, arrogant, elitist, and legally questionable.\n\nClinton's email arrangements during her tenure as Secretary of State, with all communications going through a private server, have also raised concerns and are the subject of an FBI investigation. This has reinforced the narrative of Clinton exceptionalism, with some people viewing the Clintons as taking unique shortcuts and operating in a manner that is not typical of other US citizens.\n\nThe Clinton campaign is grappling with the challenge of winning over young women, a demographic they may have initially considered as low-hanging fruit. Some speculate that this demographic is post-feminist, indifferent to the gender of their next leader, or yearning for change, which Sanders offers with his socialist platform.\n\nClinton's campaign strategy includes addressing public health issues, such as the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, to appeal to the African American constituency, which has traditionally supported the Clintons. However, controversial statements, such as Albright's comment about women not helping each other, may not be beneficial to Clinton's campaign.\n\nIn conclusion, Hillary Clinton is facing challenges in appealing to women voters, particularly young women, in the Democratic primary race. Criticism of Clinton's association with the Clinton family, her email arrangements, and her perceived elitist image have contributed to her low support among this demographic. The Clinton campaign is currently exploring strategies to address these issues and win over young women voters.",
    " Title: Federal Budget Deficit Drops Below $500 Billion for First Time Since 2008\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported on Wednesday that the federal budget deficit for fiscal year 2014, which ended on September 30, totaled $486 billion. This marks the first time since President Obama took office that the deficit has fallen below $500 billion.\n\nThe deficit for 2014, as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP), was 2.8%, which is slightly below the average experienced over the past 40 years. This indicates that President Obama has surpassed his self-imposed goal of cutting the deficit in half from its peak of $1.4 trillion, or 9.8% of GDP, in 2009.\n\nTaxes have increased significantly in the last two years, with government revenue crossing the $3 trillion mark for the first time in history in 2014. Spending, which had reached $3.6 trillion in 2011, decreased in 2012 and 2013, and rose only 1% or $44 billion in 2014.\n\nNew spending on Medicaid and Obamacare's subsidies for health insurance purchased on the exchanges increased by $49 billion, which was more than the overall increase. Social Security spending rose 5% or $37 billion, while the government's student loan subsidies boosted education spending.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, the Defense Department withstood a 5% cut, totaling $30 billion, and unemployment benefit spending dropped as the jobless rate declined.\n\nSpending began to decrease after Republicans took control of the House in 2011 and began to battle President Obama over his budget plans. A series of spending cuts, including the budget sequesters, helped keep spending in check.\n\nOn the revenue side, President Obama pushed through a tax hike for the wealthiest at the beginning of 2013, and the recovering economy has helped boost corporate income taxes by 17.5% over the last year.\n\nThe White House budget office did not respond to a request for comment, but outside budget analysts cautioned that the good news should be tempered by the dangers that still lurk ahead.\n\n\"While the deficit has indeed dropped significantly, this drop followed a massive increase, was largely expected, and does not suggest the country is on a sustainable fiscal path,\" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Deficit said in its analysis. \"Currently, debt levels are at historic highs and projected to grow unsustainably over the long run.\"\n\nCBO's projections from over the summer signal that $1 trillion deficits will return within a decade, and debt will also steadily grow. Driving that long-term debt is entitlement spending, particularly major programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n\nNet interest on the debt will also rise quickly in future years as interest rates rise. However, for now, low rates continue to help keep the deficit down. The government paid $271 billion in interest costs in 2014, the CBO said. Final 2014 numbers will be released by the Treasury Department later this month.",
    " Title: Media Outlets and Political Figures Respond to Allegations Against Alabama Senate Candidate Roy Moore\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the Washington Post's report on Thursday that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore allegedly molested a 14-year-old girl and dated three other underage girls, several Republican senators, including Vice-President Mike Pence, called for him to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. However, they did not specify what evidence would prove the events, which occurred decades ago, actually took place.\n\nMoore, in response, denied the claims without addressing the specifics, stating that he is the victim of a campaign to \"silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me.\" On Twitter, Moore wrote, \"The forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal \u2013\u2013 even inflict physical harm \u2013\u2013 if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me.\"\n\nAlabama state auditor Jim Ziegler echoed Moore's religious themes, noting that \"Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus.\"\n\nSteve Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist, compared the allegations to the video of Trump bragging about sexual assault, painting both as orchestrated political attacks. Bannon stated, \"The Bezos\u2013Amazon\u2013Washington Post that dropped that dime on Donald Trump, is the same Bezos\u2013Amazon\u2013Washington Post that dropped the dime this afternoon on Judge Roy Moore. Now is that a coincidence?\"\n\nBreitbart, the news outlet Bannon runs, began working to discredit the Washington Post report before it was even published. The article described the Post's forthcoming report, highlighted Moore's denial, and noted that the paper endorsed Moore's Democratic opponent, Doug Jones.\n\nOn Fox News, Tucker Carlson took a similar approach, dedicating only 46 seconds to the Moore allegations. Hannity, on the other hand, discussed Moore extensively, generating a controversy on his radio show when he appeared to call the candidate's alleged behavior with a 14-year-old \"consensual.\" Hannity later apologized, stating he \"misspoke and was not totally clear earlier today.\"\n\nHannity started his Fox News show by carefully and accurately laying out the allegations and Moore's response. However, the segment later highlighted the sexual-misconduct allegations against liberal Hollywood figures and Bill Clinton.\n\nLater in the program, Fox News legal analyst Mercedes Colwin claimed that women frequently make false sexual-harassment allegations in an attempt to make money. \"A lot of these women, it's all about money,\" Colwin said. \"And they bank on the fact that these corporations have a reputation that they want to save.\"\n\nIn response to the allegations, some right-leaning sites, such as Hot Air, the Daily Caller, and the Blaze, only published brief, straightforward posts noting the Moore news. On Fox News, Tucker Carlson took a similar approach, dedicating only 46 seconds to the Moore allegations. Hannity, on the other hand, discussed Moore extensively.",
    " Title: White House Denies 'Amnesty' Claims on Trump's Immigration Plan; Proposes Three-Year Legal Status for Certain Immigrants\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has refuted accusations from conservative groups that President Trump's new immigration plan, unveiled on Saturday, constitutes an \"amnesty\" for illegal immigrants. Vice President Mike Pence stated that the plan offers only a temporary solution and does not provide a pathway to citizenship.\n\nIn a press briefing at the White House, Mr. Pence, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser and the president's son-in-law, presented the new deal as a compromise between hard-right and hard-left factions. The hard-right has opposed any legal status for illegal immigrants, while the hard-left has resisted any funding for border fencing and demands a full amnesty for \"Dreamers\" without additional conditions.\n\nMulvaney, a former House member, reportedly received positive feedback from Democratic colleagues in Congress, though he did not disclose their names. The plan aims to end the ongoing government shutdown and prevent a second missed paycheck for federal employees as the shutdown approaches a month in length.\n\nThe proposal includes $5.7 billion for border wall construction, as well as changes to expedite the deportation of illegal immigrant families and address abuses in the asylum system. In exchange, it offers hundreds of millions of dollars in new humanitarian aid for the safety and health of illegal immigrants, restores a program terminated in 2017 that allows Central American children to apply for U.S. asylum from their home countries, and provides a three-year legal status for approximately 700,000 individuals currently under the Obama-era DACA program, as well as around 300,000 individuals under humanitarian protections who may soon become illegal immigrants.\n\nThe deal also includes items both sides generally agree on, such as more technology for drug detection at legal border crossings and an increase in the number of immigration judges to reduce the backlog of cases. The Senate will vote on the plan next week, and the fate of the shutdown and workers' paychecks reportedly depends on the bill's outcome.\n\nWhile Democrats have criticized the bill from the left, some of Mr. Trump's supporters on the right have expressed disapproval of the proposal's provision of legal status for illegal immigrants, including those under Temporary Protected Status. Activist Ann Coulter tweeted, \"Trump proposes amnesty. We voted for Trump and got Jeb!\" in reference to Jeb Bush, a 2016 GOP opponent of Mr. Trump who was a prominent advocate for legalizing illegal immigrants.\n\nVice President Pence clarified that the bill offers a three-year legal status, and he and Kushner indicated that if they can find agreement with Democrats on this issue, it could pave the way for broader negotiations on comprehensive immigration reforms. \"If we can get through this, I think there is a way toward having a lot of next steps,\" said Mr. Kushner.",
    " Title: North Charleston Police Chief Condemns Officer's Actions in Walter Scott Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the release of a video showing the fatal shooting of Walter Scott, an unarmed African-American man, by former North Charleston police officer Michael Thomas Slager, the police department's chief, Ed Driggers, spoke out against the officer's actions. Unlike in similar cases in Ferguson, Missouri; Cleveland, Ohio; Staten Island, New York; and Los Angeles, California, Driggers did not defend Slager, who claimed that the shooting occurred during a physical altercation after a routine traffic stop for a busted taillight.\n\nIn the video, Slager can be seen shooting Scott multiple times as he runs away. However, Slager's account, as reported in the official incident report, was contradicted by the evidence. There is no evidence that Scott tried to use Slager's taser against him, and Slager's demeanor during the shooting suggests he was not in fear for his life.\n\nNeither Driggers nor Mayor Keith Summey of North Charleston attempted to defend Slager, who is now facing charges for murder. Instead, they distanced Slager's behavior from that of the North Charleston police force as a whole. Driggers stated, \"The one does not totally throw a blanket across the many.\" He and the mayor noted that the police department is composed of more than 340 officers, and the video did not represent the overall law enforcement system.\n\nHowever, another officer, Clarence Habersham, who is African-American, was also present at the scene after Scott had fallen to the ground. Habersham's body language suggests he had witnessed similar incidents before, and he did not make a significant effort to save Scott's life. The circumstances surrounding the interactions between Slager, Habersham, and the third officer, who is Caucasian, are unclear.\n\nIn the past five years, police officers in South Carolina have used their guns against 209 individuals, and they were exonerated of wrongdoing every time. Walter Scott, a father, brother, cousin, and veteran, died after being shot multiple times with his back turned. If he remained conscious after being handcuffed, he spent his final moments alone and enchained.",
    " Title: Kentucky Gubernatorial Race Amidst Collapse of Obamacare-Funded Health Co-op\n\nArticle:\n\nThe collapse of the Kentucky Health Cooperative, a nonprofit health plan established with federal loan dollars under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), is causing a political stir in the tight gubernatorial race in Kentucky. The co-op's demise, part of a national trend with more than a third of the 23 nonprofit health plans created under Obamacare with $2.4 billion in federal loan dollars having failed, is particularly significant in Kentucky due to its high enrollment during the first two years of operations and the upcoming gubernatorial election.\n\nRepublican challenger Matt Bevin has seized on the failure as a validation of his concerns about Obamacare, laying blame on his Democratic opponent, Attorney General Jack Conway. Conway, on the other hand, attributes the co-op's collapse to \"market forces\" and argues that Kentucky consumers still have more choices due to the health law, with seven insurers to choose from during the upcoming open-enrollment season, up from just three plans two years ago.\n\nThe nonprofit co-op program was designed as a compromise to appease those who were dissatisfied with the health care law's lack of a government insurance option. Critics argue that the program was undermined from the outset, with the original $6 billion funding being slashed by more than half and the plans being saddled with rules that prohibited them from using federal funds for marketing and restricted which customers they could target.\n\nThe collapse of the co-op is not the only health care issue with political relevance in the Kentucky governor's race. The vast majority of Kentuckians who have gained coverage under Obamacare are enrolled in public programs, with over 500,000 individuals added to the Medicaid and CHIP rolls since 2013. During the Republican primary, Bevin was unequivocal about wanting to roll back Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, a stance that has led Democrats to criticize him for potentially abandoning half a million low- and middle-income residents.\n\nThe political impact of health care issues in the election remains uncertain, with some political observers doubting their decisiveness due to voters' lack of knowledge about the details of the policy arguments. However, veteran GOP strategist Scott Jennings argues that the collapse of the co-op, combined with plan cancellations and average rate hikes, could sway voters due to their unease.",
    " Title: Rep. Adam Schiff Compares Wuhan Coronavirus Casualties to 9/11 in Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring an appearance on MSNBC Monday night, Democratic Representative Adam Schiff argued that victims of the Wuhan coronavirus can be considered victims of the failed impeachment of President Donald Trump. Schiff stated, \"We can't act even slightly surprised by this because you told us this was going to happen in your argument in the Senate impeachment trial.\"\n\nSchiff continued, \"We said a lot, but little did we know just how great the casualties would be. Some days we lose the equivalent of the number of people we lost on 9/11.\"\n\nFox News' Sean Hannity previously reminded viewers in March that perhaps if Democrats had been less focused on the impeachment and more attentive to actual threats, more could have been done to protect and warn Americans about the coronavirus. Hannity stated, \"January 21, the very first person with coronavirus arrived in the U.S. from China. That's not long ago. The same time, Democrats, what were they doing? They were in the throes of an all-consuming, what has been the culmination of a three-year quest to impeach and throw Donald Trump out of office, undo an election that they never accepted the results of in the beginning.\"\n\nHannity further noted, \"January 23, House impeachment managers, what were they doing? Oh, they were doing their opening arguments and impeachment. Same day, China completely sealed off the entire province of Wuhan. Then on January 31, look at this. The president then declared that national health emergency, ordered mandatory two-week quarantines. He issued the travel ban on all travel to and from China. And on that same day, what were the Democrats doing? They were busy with impeaching the president. They were not caring. January 31, Senate Democrats desperately pushing for more impeachment witnesses, the day that Donald Trump put the travel ban quarantine in effect.\"\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the global death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 200,000 as of May 5, 2020. The reason for the pandemic is attributed to China's initial lies about the virus and suppression of physician whistleblowers who tried to speak out.",
    " Title: Tulsi Gabbard Calls on Biden and Sanders to Urge DNC for Debate Participation\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) has called on former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to urge the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to allow her participation in the next primary debate. The call comes after the DNC announced new qualifications for the event that barred Gabbard from participating.\n\nGabbard, who has refused to drop her long-shot White House bid despite dismal results in the first several nominating states, has garnered just two of the 1,385 delegates awarded thus far, falling way below the threshold set by the DNC. The new qualifications require candidates to have at least 20 percent of the delegates awarded thus far to make the debate stage in Phoenix on March 15.\n\nSix states will hold primaries and caucuses on Tuesday, though it is virtually impossible that Gabbard will net enough delegates from the contests to hit the 20 percent mark.\n\nGabbard has repeatedly railed against the DNC, accusing it at times of seeking to kneecap her campaign. She specifically cited a rule change last month regarding the polling qualifications for debates that allowed former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to appear onstage twice before he dropped out of the race.\n\n\"To keep me off the stage, the DNC again arbitrarily changed the debate qualifications,\" she tweeted. \"Previously they changed the qualifications in the OPPOSITE direction so Bloomberg could debate. I ask that you stand w/ me against the DNC\u2019s transparent effort to exclude me from the debates.\"\n\nThe Hawaii lawmaker, an Iraq War veteran, has centered her long-shot White House bid around reducing America\u2019s military entanglements abroad, but she has faced criticism over a 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad and her past positions opposed to LGBTQ rights.",
    " Title: Wall Street Braces for Tariffs as Gary Cohn Departs White House\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a decline of up to 349 points on Wednesday, but recovered most of its losses, closing with a decrease of 82 points. This market volatility, according to Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, reflects a \"jittery market.\"\n\nThe market's unease stems from the White House's plan to impose a 25% tariff on imported steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum. Gary Cohn, Trump's top economic adviser who opposed these tariffs, has recently left the White House. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders stated on Wednesday that the president is expected to sign the tariff plan by the end of the week, with potential \"carve-outs\" for Canada and Mexico.\n\nWall Street is concerned that these tariffs could initiate a trade war, potentially damaging the economy. Trump's tariff announcement last week caused significant market turbulence and backlash from top US trading partners, including Canada and the European Union.\n\nBrad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, stated, \"Tariffs will hurt business and investor confidence, which are two of the pillars holding up the markets.\"\n\nIn addition to the looming tariff implications, negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) also remain unresolved. Trump has threatened to terminate the 1994 trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The three countries have made little progress on a re-negotiated deal since beginning talks in August.\n\nRyan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, commented, \"The market is holding its breath and getting ready for a clearer picture.\"\n\nUS companies with less investment overseas are currently benefiting from the trade uncertainty. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small companies, closed up for the fifth consecutive day.\n\nHowever, the market has also grappled with the implications of Cohn's departure. Cohn, a former president of Goldman Sachs, played a significant role in designing Trump's tax cuts and was a leading proponent of free trade. He served as a calming influence on the market.\n\nAlec Young, FTSE Russell's managing director of global markets research, stated, \"His departure has caught investors off guard.\" McMillan described Cohn as \"the voice of economic stability and a spokesperson for financial markets.\"\n\nCohn's resignation has left the president with a group of economic advisers perceived as less aligned with Wall Street interests. Investors view Trump's choice for Cohn's replacement as a potential indicator of the president's future trade moves. Detrick commented, \"They want to see Cohn 2.0.\"",
    " Title: Islamic State Threat to U.S. Homeland: Fact vs. Perception\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has been a topic of debate in the mainstream media regarding its threat to the United States. Some commentators argue that ISIS poses a threat to the U.S., while others contend that it does not pose an imminent threat.\n\nIn an interview with The Huffington Post, The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg stated, \"Yes, I understand ISIS poses a threat to the United States. It's not clear it poses an imminent threat.\" New York Times columnist Tom Friedman wrote, \"ISIS is awful, but it is not a threat to America's homeland.\"\n\nPresident Obama has also expressed similar sentiments, stating that the perception of an ISIS threat is due to social media and not a change in the threat level. The New York Times asserted that the actual danger posed by ISIS has been distorted in media coverage and political statements.\n\nHowever, the facts on the ground tell a different story. On June 21, 19-year-old Brendan Tevlin was murdered in cold blood by a man who claimed it was an act of retribution for U.S. military action against Muslims in the Middle East. The murderer, Ali Muhammad Brown, has also confessed to killing four other men in the same manner.\n\nIn addition, the largest police operation in Australian history was implemented last week in Sydney and Brisbane, where counterterrorism forces detained 15 people after receiving intelligence that ISIS was planning public beheadings in two Australian cities. The plan involved kidnapping randomly selected members of the public, beheading them on camera, and releasing the recordings through ISIS's propaganda arm in the Middle East.\n\nThe Islamic State does not need to be physically present in the United States, Canada, or Australia to be a threat. The terrorist group's continued success in the Middle East and its propaganda inspires sociopaths around the world to carry out attacks.\n\nThe New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton has warned that the Islamic State is targeting New York City, calling for \"lone wolf\" attacks on Times Square. ISIS is also reportedly calling for radicalized individuals in the United States to target military personnel in their homes.\n\nThe reality of the ISIS threat is all too real for the family of Brendan Tevlin, and the Australians have taken action to save lives on their soil by understanding the reality of the ISIS threat. As long as ISIS survives, it will continue to inspire disturbed individuals to carry out attacks, and pretending otherwise will only lead to more deaths.",
    " Title: Pope Francis Navigates Political Divides with Subtlety and Humility During U.S. and Cuba Visits\n\nArticle:\n\nPope Francis, during his recent visits to the United States and Cuba, has demonstrated a quiet and deferential moral authority in navigating bitter political divides. This moral authority is rooted in personal gestures and a humble lifestyle, as well as the historic teachings of the Catholic Church.\n\nTerrence Tilley, professor of Catholic theology at Fordham University in New York, describes Francis' political instincts as \"a kind of style that keeps him involved with the people, without regard to all the trappings of his office.\"\n\nUpon his arrival in the United States, Francis addressed two of the country's most contentious political issues: immigration and climate change. He praised President Obama for his proposals to combat air pollution and expressed his support for immigrants, stating, \"As the son of an immigrant family, I am happy to be a guest in this country, which was largely built by such families.\"\n\nIn the spirit of Jesus' words, Francis has also wielded his papal power with subtlety and shrewdness. For instance, he made an unplanned stop at the convent of the Little Sisters of the Poor, showing support for the nuns suing the president over the birth control provision of Obamacare.\n\nDuring his visit to Cuba, Francis navigated his moral authority with a series of subtle gestures. Although some criticized him for not meeting with dissidents or forcefully speaking out for greater human rights, others saw the pope sending clear messages through his homilies and the places he chose to visit.\n\nIn Havana's Revolution Square, Francis told a crowd, \"Service is never ideological, for we do not serve ideas, we serve people.\" He later visited a group of students at the Felix Varela Institute, named for a 19th-century advocate for Cuban independence. Francis' visit served to bolster the slow-moving economic reforms in the communist country.\n\nIn his address before a joint session of Congress, Francis invoked symbols of American heritage, urging divided lawmakers to \"defend and preserve the dignity of your fellow citizens in the tireless and demanding pursuit of the common good.\"\n\nThroughout his visits, Francis remained circumspect, clothing his forays into politics as gentle moral exhortations. He did not enter the divisive politics of abortion but pivoted instead to the need to end the death penalty.\n\nIn his final days in the United States, Francis will visit Our Lady Queen of Angels School in East Harlem and the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility in Philadelphia.\n\nJohn Sniegocki, professor of theology at Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, notes that Francis has been more attentive to the symbolism of the papacy. \"A simple lifestyle, a simple papacy resonates with people and gives more impact to his broader words and broader critiques of global systems,\" Sniegocki says.",
    " Title: Trump Meets with Media Executives, Culture War Brews Amidst Transition\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that may not come as a surprise, President-elect Donald Trump has met with several network executives and anchors at Trump Tower, following a campaign where he frequently criticized their organizations as dishonest and corrupt. The meeting, described as \"tough\" by Variety, reportedly saw Trump reserving particularly harsh words for CNN and NBC News.\n\nAccording to reports, the meeting was relatively pleasant, with Trump expressing his displeasure with certain aspects of the coverage. He reminded his guests of their misjudgments during the election, such as underestimating his ability to win states like Michigan, where he campaigned in the final days.\n\nThe New York Post offers a more dramatic account, stating that Trump told CNN President Jeff Zucker, who worked with him on \"The Apprentice,\" \"I hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar, and you should be ashamed.\" However, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president-elect, described the meeting as \"very cordial, very productive, very congenial.\" She added, \"It was also very candid and very honest. From my own perspective, it's great to hit the reset button.\"\n\nThe meeting reportedly provided an opportunity for network executives to express their concerns about media access, news conferences, and press pools. Trump is set to meet today with executives from The New York Times and other outlets, which he has labeled as \"failing.\"\n\nAs the 45th president, Trump's relationship with the mainstream media is expected to be challenging, given the adversarial nature of their relationship during the campaign. However, it is hoped that they can find a way to work together, considering Trump's popularity among cable networks during the primaries and his understanding of what makes good television.\n\nMeanwhile, a culture war seems to be brewing against Donald Trump. Less than two weeks after his election, his vice president received a stern lecture from the cast of the musical \"Hamilton.\" At the American Music Awards, model Gigi Hadid mocked Melania Trump's accent and demeanor. These incidents are seen as a finger in the eye of the 60 million Americans who voted for Trump, who felt marginalized by the political, media, and cultural elites.\n\nWhile the president-elect's policies and appointments are fair game for criticism, some argue that the hostility towards Trump, particularly from entertainers and cultural figures, is unwarranted and disrespectful to the democratic process. The political arena has also seen hostility, with former Attorney General Eric Holder questioning media figures' willingness to \"normalize\" Trump at a funeral for PBS anchor Gwen Ifill. Unlike his former boss, Barack Obama, Holder has not wished the new president well.\n\nIn a hopeful sign, the new ombudsman at The New York Times, Liz Spayd, has acknowledged reader dissatisfaction with the newspaper's coverage of the election. Spayd's conversations with readers have revealed a \"searing level of dissatisfaction\" with the paper's forecasting methods, its attempt to understand Trump supporters, and its perceived liberal bias. While partly faulting the candidates, Spayd acknowledges the media's role in turning Trump's remarks into a \"grim caricature\" that was applied to his supporters.",
    " Title: Facebook Discovers Potential Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior Linked to Internet Research Agency Ahead of U.S. Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook has identified and removed 32 pages and accounts from its platform that exhibited coordinated inauthentic behavior, potentially linked to the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian-based organization with ties to the Kremlin. The accounts, which had a combined total of 290,000 followers, were pushing American political stances, organizing events, and using virtual private networks (VPNs) to conceal their locations and internet phone services to hide their identities.\n\nIn October 2017, Facebook admitted that Russia-backed content reached as many as 126 million Americans during the 2016 presidential election. The accounts sometimes used Russian IP addresses and paid for advertising in roubles. The people behind the accounts removed on Tuesday used these tactics to evade detection, spending approximately $11,000 on about 150 ads on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nNathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, stated that while there is not enough technical evidence to definitively attribute the activity to the IRA, they have shown similar activity and have connected with known IRA accounts. Alex Stamos, the company's chief security officer, noted that it is unclear whether this was the IRA with improved capabilities or a separate group.\n\nOne interesting finding is that a known IRA account was a co-admin on one of the pages for seven minutes before the account was removed from Facebook. However, Facebook's security team cautions that this is not definitive evidence of IRA involvement.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, a Democrat, quickly attributed the activity to Russia, stating, \"Today's disclosure is further evidence that the Kremlin continues to exploit platforms like Facebook to sow division and spread disinformation.\"\n\nThe removed pages included \"Aztlan Warriors,\" \"Resisters,\" and \"Black Elevation.\" The \"Resisters\" page created a Facebook event for a protest on 10-12 August titled \"No Unite The Right 2.\" Admins for the page connected with the admins of five legitimate pages to promote the event and post logistical information for protesters. About 600 users said they would attend the event, and 2,600 expressed an interest in attending.\n\nFacebook disabled the event and reached out to the legitimate admins of the five other pages. The company also pledged to inform the people considering attending the protest about what happened.\n\nThere was also coordinated activity around the #AbolishICE campaign, a left-wing movement aimed at shutting down the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The activity appears to echo the Kremlin's creation and promotion of black activism pages such as \"Blacktivist\" in the run-up to the presidential election.\n\nFacebook revealed that the bad actors had created 30 Facebook events since May 2017, most of which had been scheduled over the past year. The company said it did not know if people had shown up to those events.\n\nFacebook will continue to investigate the activity and share any further findings with law enforcement and Congress. Mark Zuckerberg, the company's CEO, acknowledged the ongoing challenge of security, stating, \"Security isn't a problem you ever completely solve. We face sophisticated and well-funded adversaries that are always evolving and trying new attacks.\"\n\nLukasz Olejnik, a cybersecurity researcher, expressed concern about artificially inducing civil unrest or protests via internet platforms, noting that the activity touching Washington indicates that concerns about European parliament 2019 elections might now be viewed in a \"rather intriguing light.\"",
    " Title: Employers Shift Toward Part-Time Work Amid Affordable Care Act Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, is reportedly causing employers to consider reducing full-time employees' hours to avoid additional costs associated with the law. The Act requires mid-sized and large employers to offer health insurance to all full-time employees, defined as those working 30 hours a week or more.\n\nBig labor unions, initially supporters of the new law, are now expressing concerns about the potential impact of premium hikes on businesses, leading to a reduction in employees' working hours. This could affect millions of families across the United States, according to analysts. However, the White House has stated that there is no evidence of an adverse impact on job growth or the number of hours employees are working.\n\nJason Furman, chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, said, \"We are seeing no systematic evidence that the Affordable Care Act is having an adverse impact on job growth or the number of hours employees are working.\"\n\nHowever, United Food and Commercial Workers Union President Joseph Hansen argues that the impact is already being felt, stating, \"Wait a year. You'll see tremendous impact as workers have their hours reduced and their incomes reduced.\"\n\nChristopher Conover, an American Enterprise Institute researcher, argues that the trend toward part-time employment is accelerating due to ObamaCare. In an analysis, he wrote, \"ObamaCare is accelerating a disturbing trend towards a nation of part-timers.\"\n\nThree key groups that could be significantly affected are unions, school workers, and local government workers. In states such as Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Indiana, school workers, including teacher aides, bus drivers, and cafeteria workers, are expected to lose hours. In California, Texas, and Michigan, government workers, including parks and recreation officials, librarians, and secretaries, could also have their hours and benefits reduced.\n\nFast-food CEOs at Subway and Papa John's have already reported feeling the impact of the health care overhaul. Papa John's CEO, John Schnatter, estimates the change will cost his company $5 million to $8 million annually. He expects franchise owners to cut employees' hours due to the costs of health insurance plans.\n\nIn an interview, Schnatter stated, \"That's probably what's going to happen. It's common sense. That's what I call lose-lose.\"\n\nAn informal survey by NBC News found that approximately 20 businesses are cutting workers to 29 hours a week due to the health care law. However, not everyone agrees with the critics' claims. A recent Bloomberg analysis argues that the method used by researcher Christopher Conover is shaky, and the data used is \"far too volatile to draw reliable conclusions from small samples.\"\n\nEvan Soltas wrote, \"I think the 30-hour rule in ObamaCare is bad public policy that will eventually hurt full-time work, as do Conover and Graham. In fact, I'd like to get rid of the employer mandate entirely. But I also believe in thorough, objective use of data. And they show no evidence of a part-time surge yet.\"",
    " Title: President-elect Trump Praises Electoral College System, Vows to Continue Rallies\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump, during his final \"Thank You\" tour stop at Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Alabama, praised the Electoral College system for requiring candidates to campaign across the country. Trump won 306 electoral votes in the November 8 election, with electors set to officially cast their votes on Monday.\n\nTrump told supporters that the Founding Fathers were \"genius\" for creating a system that required candidates to canvass the nation to talk directly to voters. He stated that he visited 17 states in the last month of the campaign.\n\n\"That is the beauty of this electoral system,\" he said. \"If you go with the popular vote, I'd go to New York State, California, back and forth. It would be much easier. The problem is that every other place\u2014you stop in Florida, you stop in Texas\u2014you wouldn't see anyplace else.\"\n\nTrump pledged to continue holding rallies after moving into the White House. \"This is the last time I'll be speaking at a rally for maybe a while,\" he said. \"They are saying that as president, he should not be doing rallies.\"\n\nTrump's choice for attorney general, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, spoke at the rally, stating that the first rally in Mobile was when \"people began to see this was more than a normal campaign, but a movement.\"\n\nCampaign manager Kellyanne Conway, now a senior adviser to the transition team, noted that Trump won more than 2,600 counties, including 200 that flipped from President Barack Obama in 2012, as well as 31 of the nation's 50 states.\n\nTrump also commented on the popular vote, stating that he would have won the popular vote if that had been the method needed to get to the presidency. He also addressed comments made by Michelle Obama in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, stating that she had said \"there is no hope\" as his administration takes power. Trump responded by stating that he believes there is tremendous hope.\n\nThe overall mood at Ladd-Peebles Stadium was celebratory, with Trump basking in his election-night victory and introducing his cabinet nominees. Sessions spoke for slightly under five minutes, longer than the other cabinet nominees Trump presented at his rallies. The event closed with Trump's admonition: \"Never, ever give up. I should have given up in this campaign five times. I could take you over 10 different things that happened where people would have given up. But I never gave up.\"",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Criticize Corporations for Taxes and Wages, with Amazon, Facebook, McDonald's, and Walmart as Top Targets\n\nArticle:\n\nPresidential candidates are receiving the most online engagement when they target corporations for paying little or no taxes, according to data from High Lantern Group, an analytics firm specializing in corporate reputation. The companies are facing increased pressure to comply with the Democratic candidates' visions for the future, which include offering employees a living wage, paying more in taxes, and allowing workers to unionize.\n\nTrump's complaints tend to focus on technology, communication, and social media companies. At times, the president elevates conservative allegations that their messages are being repressed or censored. At other times, Trump voices concerns that companies whose empires include credible, mainstream news organizations are peddling \"fake news.\"\n\nIn the broader context, candidates have criticized corporations before, but those facing attacks today differ from those targeted in 2016, when Wall Street was the primary target. No banks crack the Top 10 of companies facing criticism on Twitter from the 2020 field of presidential hopefuls. Amazon, Facebook, McDonald's, and Walmart have been called out the most.\n\nPresidential candidates have spent months taking shots at big companies on the campaign trail, and this trend has been observed since last summer. Several 2020 Democrats marched with McDonald's workers during their strike against sexual harassment in the workplace and low wages.\n\nMatt Levy, director of issue analysis at HLG, stated, \"We've noticed that companies really pay attention when they or their competitors are called out by huge players.\"\n\nUnlike many other companies, Amazon has responded to candidates who have called them out and threatened to break up Big Tech if they become president. In a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588, Walmart urged candidates to engage with the company to learn more about its practices and initiatives before \"recycling critiques that haven't been relevant for years.\" The company added, \"From our investments in wages and training to our work on environmental sustainability, some candidates have a lot to learn about who we are today.\"\n\nAn interesting finding is that, beyond Sanders and Warren, Trump is the next most-likely 2020 candidate to publicly criticize companies on Twitter. Twitter itself is among the top companies called out by candidates, ranking No. 8. Trump's lines of attack are not usually about a living wage or workplace safety.",
    " Title: Trump Promises Mass Deportations, Challenges Union Stance on Immigration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a hardline speech in Phoenix on Wednesday, former President Donald Trump outlined a plan for increased immigration enforcement, warning of an undocumented criminal threat and promising mass deportations beginning on his first day in office.\n\n\"We will begin moving them out Day One. As soon as I take office,\" Trump said, according to transcripts. He tied his promise to carry out deportations to anti-globalist economic ideas, but also drew a direct line between the fortunes of the country's native-born laborers and the presence of undocumented immigrants \u2013 a connection he has rarely made in his remarks on the topic.\n\n\"While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, this does not change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower-skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers,\" Trump said. \"These illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back.\"\n\nTrump's stance on immigration has been a contentious issue, with some arguing that his policies would harm the economy and others supporting his efforts to enforce immigration laws. The globalization that Trump denounces has also contributed to a decades-long reshaping of unions \u2013 a traditional voice for workers and often vocal opponents of globalization \u2013 toward greater inclusion of immigrants, even those without legal status.\n\nAccording to Lowell Turner, a professor at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, the reasons behind organized labor's shifting stance on immigrant workers may undercut Trump's narrative of foreigners arriving to America to crowd out the native-born.\n\n\"If you have a union job, you know that immigrants are not stealing your jobs,\" Turner said in an interview with The \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"You see your reality around you and know that's not happening.\"\n\nDuring the 2016 election, Trump saw greater support among union members than any Republican candidate in recent memory, enough to spook Democrats and union leaders. However, he has garnered endorsements from only two unions \u2013 those representing border patrol and New England police \u2013 and his low approval among Hispanics and other minorities has likely helped ensure that the vast majority of union endorsements have chosen to remain firmly in the Democrats' camp.\n\nOne of those Hillary Clinton supporters is Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, who was the guest at a Monitor Breakfast earlier this week. Trumka expressed confidence in organized labor's ability to turn out votes for Clinton, despite Trump's inroads into the white working class.\n\n\"We're probably about where we were with Barack Obama at this point with the election,\" Trumka said, adding that the more organized labor gets information out to workers, \"the better off we get.\"\n\nFor much of their early history in the United States, unions viewed certain groups of immigrants with suspicion, if not outright animus. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, passed largely at the behest of the organized labor, is perhaps the most notorious example of this. The fear of job replacement faded after the passage of a 1924 national-origins quota, as immigration levels fell for several decades.\n\nWhen national reform came up for passage again in 1986, unions' focus was on winning sanctions against employers that hired the undocumented, whom they saw as potential strikebreakers. But by then, changes in unions' attitudes were already beginning. Deregulation measures had sent membership numbers reeling, and in urban areas like Los Angeles, deteriorated wages, benefits, and working conditions caused many native-born workers to abandon certain lines of low-skilled manual jobs.\n\nWhen they left, immigrants stepped in to take their place, mostly from Central America and Mexico. Union leaders in favor of organizing immigrants thought they were likely to be too nervous for collective action, but campaigns like the Service Employees International Union's Janitors for Justice, first conceived in 1985, won important victories from employers and showed unions that immigrants, including the undocumented, were capable of loud advocacy.\n\nAs those efforts were replicated across labor, especially in meatpacking, hospitality, restaurants, and other service industries, immigrants and native-born Hispanics began to exercise growing clout within the ranks. In 2000, the AFL-CIO, the largest union confederation in the country, called for an end to employer sanctions and for legal status for 6 million undocumented immigrants. The move came largely as a result of pressure from an immigrant-led coalition known as the Change to Win Federation, and it caused a sea change in thought.\n\n\"I think there was a shift in consciousness,\" says Mae Ngai, a historian at Columbia University who specializes in immigration and labor. \"Even if some of these older unions like the Machinists were not organizing immigrants, they could see other people doing it. They could see that immigrants were not their enemy, not their competition, not their enemy they had to fear.\"",
    " Title: Obama Shores Up Chances in Final Debate, Race Remains Too Close to Call\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final presidential debate on Monday, President Barack Obama shored up his chances in the upcoming election, according to political analyst David Gergen. However, Mitt Romney also passed a test in the debates and remains a formidable opponent.\n\nGergen, a political adviser to several U.S. presidents, stated that Obama's clear victories in the final two debates have strengthened his campaign, making him an odds-on favorite to win. However, he also noted that Romney has accomplished a great deal in the debates and is poised for a possible surprise.\n\nObama's performance in the final debates allowed him to reassert himself and restore the faith and energy of his supporters, particularly on key issues such as healthcare and foreign policy. He also appealed to minority, women, and youth voters, key constituencies he will need to win the election.\n\nRomney, on the other hand, was able to avoid a warmonger label and pass the commander-in-chief test, according to Gergen. However, he was criticized for appearing tired and less effective in the final debate compared to his performance in the first debate.\n\nThe race remains too close to call, with Gergen putting the chances at about 53% for Obama and 47% for Romney. The outcome will depend on how the polls settle out in the coming days.\n\nObama's campaign also has a strong ground game, with a superior field organization in key battleground states such as Ohio. The Romney team, however, is not ready to concede an inch and continues to gain support from some voters, particularly on economic issues.\n\nThe debates have transformed the campaign into a horse race, and the final two debates have been particularly significant in shaping the narrative of the election. The online prediction market Intrade showed that the odds in favor of Obama moved up only a point, to 61%, after the final debate, and have since dropped to 59%.\n\nThe race to the finish is expected to be a wild ride, with both candidates fighting hard to win over undecided voters and solidify their bases. The election will take place on November 6, 2012.",
    " Title: Gun Range Operator Near Dallas Shooting Suspect's Home Expresses Disbelief, Questions Motivation\n\nArticle:\n\nMesquite, Texas \u2014 Vickie Kale, a certified firearms instructor who runs Gibson's Outpost & Shooting Range, expressed disbelief and confusion as gunshots echoed around her facility, barely a mile from where police say Micah Xavier Johnson lived before his attack on Dallas police Thursday night, which resulted in the deaths of five officers. Johnson, the shooting suspect, is believed to have practiced at a different location, as no one at the range recognizes him or remembers him.\n\nDallas police have not yet disclosed details about the type of rifle Johnson used, the number of rounds he fired, or where he may have practiced before the attack. WFAA-TV reported on Saturday that authorities believe Johnson had planned a larger attack, based on the ammunition he was carrying and his access to explosives.\n\nAt the range, regular customers fired various firearms, including a.45-caliber 1911 handgun and rifles. Some of the gun owners, who preferred to remain anonymous, expressed concern about speaking to reporters, fearing it could bring trouble to their homes or make them a target of a government they are skeptical or afraid of.\n\nIn Texas, open carrying of rifles is legal, and many firearms owners argue that the media focuses too much on whether someone has a gun, rather than on the people who use them improperly. They question the lack of individual accountability and the absence of family values that teach respect for authority and deference to police officers.\n\nGun owners at the range view their firearms as tools or objects of beauty, but Johnson abused them when he opened fire on the police officers working the protest, according to the unquoted range operators. Kale stated, \"Our government has pushed this situation to the point where police officers aren't respected.\"\n\nJohnson reportedly learned to shoot during his six years in the U.S. Army Reserve and served one tour of duty in Afghanistan beginning in late 2013. He was a private first class with a specialty in carpentry and masonry but did not appear to have specialized training as a sniper.\n\nDallas police have not yet released a complete timeline of how they believe Johnson moved around the area during the shootings. Johnson was killed Thursday night by police using a pound of C-4 explosive delivered by a remote-controlled robot. During the standoff with police, Johnson told negotiators that he was upset over recent police-involved shootings of blacks and wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers.\n\nAuthorities who searched Johnson's home in Mesquite found a personal journal of combat tactics, as well as bomb-making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, and ammunition. Mesquite is about a 20-minute drive east of downtown Dallas, and the drive takes visitors past multiple firearms stores tucked near nail salons and doughnut shops. Few of the gun dealers wanted to discuss the incident, but at least one store made it clear that President Obama would not be welcome inside its aisles selling noise-suppressors and cases of ammunition.\n\nGun-control advocates have used Johnson's attack to rally support in favor of stricter laws, including against open carrying of firearms, which is legal in Texas. Back at the range near Johnson's house, Kale said she and her friends always remark that their guns never clean the kitchen or take out the trash, but somehow get blamed for killing other people, even though they've never fired a shot in anger.\n\n\"It's not the gun. It's not the car. It's the people driving, the person firing,\" she said. \"Why don't we talk about that?\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Address Workplace Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court's new term has commenced with significant oral arguments on Tuesday in two cases that highlight contrasting interpretations of how statutes should be construed. The cases revolve around the question of whether workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation is prohibited by the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which outlaws discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n\nIn the case of Kimberly Hively, a part-time adjunct professor at an Indiana community college, she claims she was denied a full-time position and her part-time contract was not renewed due to her being a lesbian. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in a majority decision, questioned whether actions taken on the basis of sexual orientation are a \"subset of actions taken on the basis of sex.\"\n\nThe Seventh Circuit majority, citing the broader context of the statute, acknowledged but disregarded the fact that Congress has declined to add \"sexual orientation\" to the Act. The majority argued that it is unclear what inference to draw from congressional inaction and that the meaning of the phrase \"sex discrimination\" has evolved over time.\n\nA concurring judge argued that the meaning of the statute has changed, and the word \"sex\" now connotes both gender and sexual orientation. The judge stated that homosexuality was not a significant factor in the minds of the legislators in 1964, and since then, attitudes towards sex have broadened.\n\nThe minority, however, argued that the Supreme Court should give effect to the enacted text, interpreting the statutory language as a reasonable person would have understood it at the time of enactment. The minority stated that \"sexual orientation\" is not the same forbidden category of employment discrimination as \"sex\" is, and that the terms are not used interchangeably in other laws such as the Violence Against Women Act and the Hate Crimes Act.\n\nThe Seventh Circuit's minority also acknowledged the significant cultural change since 1964 but emphasized that the Supreme Court's role is to interpret the law, not to update it. The minority concluded that if Hively was denied a job because of her sexual orientation, she was treated unjustly, but not illegally under the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in these cases will likely influence the interpretation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and may prompt Congress to reconsider the inclusion of sexual orientation as a protected category.",
    " Title: Presidential Daily Briefing on Afghanistan-Taliban Allegations Discussed on Fox & Friends\n\nArticle:\n\nOn June 30, 2020, during the Fox & Friends program on Fox News, a discussion ensued regarding allegations of foreign support for the Taliban in Afghanistan.\n\nBrian Kilmeade, a co-host, stated, \"We cannot pull totally out of Afghanistan. We will turn over the country to Russia, and the minerals to China. That will be a huge mistake.\" Ainsley Earhardt, another co-host, added that the Taliban's support has been known for years, with Russia providing arms, Iran cash, equipment, and training, and Pakistan soldiers being found with weapons from Iran.\n\nEarhardt further explained, \"The point here is, if it's not verified by our 16 intelligence agencies\u2014that's their job, that's what they do\u2014it does not get to the president's desk. The president, he has to make decisions based on intel that is in front of him. And if he's not briefed on it, then he doesn't know about it. But if he is briefed on it, then he can act on it.\"\n\nSteve Doocy, another co-host, mentioned that the allegations were reportedly in the president's presidential daily briefing on February 27th, 2020. Earhardt noted that presidents do not read all of their briefings, and a person comes in to inform the president of the contents. However, it was not specified whether the president had actually read or been informed about the specific allegations in question.\n\nThe discussion concluded with Earhardt stating, \"So, that's the danger here, that if it's not true, and the president acts, then that causes a lot of trouble. So, we want to be safe here.\" The article does not provide further details on the specific allegations or the president's response to them.",

The visits come over a week after allegations surfaced that a significant traffic jam in Fort Lee was caused by road closures on the George Washington Bridge as political retaliation from Christie's team against the town's mayor.\n\nChristie's itinerary includes stops in Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, and Palm Beach. However, it remains unclear whether the ongoing scandal has affected his popularity, as all the meetings are closed-door events.\n\nTraveling with Christie, Scott has shown no hesitation in supporting him. Scott told CNN affiliate WSVN that Christie \"did the right thing. He apologized. He went to the community and apologized. And I look forward to seeing him.\"\n\nIn his role as chairman, Christie will also raise money for the Republican Governors Association and network with potential donors who could be key players if Christie decides to run for president in 2016. The main political event is Saturday night at the home of billionaire Ken Langone, the co-founder of Home Depot.\n\nLangone told CNN he has been inundated with requests to meet the governor, regardless of the ongoing scandal.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats have not missed the opportunity to comment on the Christie scandal. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is in Florida, following Christie's every move, and criticized the governor for his private campaign events.\n\n\"I think that means that Chris Christie does not want to answer any questions or Rick Scott does not want to be seen with Chris Christie in public \u2013 probably a little of both,\" Wasserman Schultz told CNN.\n\nFlorida's Republican Party chairman, Lenny Curry, accused Democrats of attempting to turn Christie's visit into a circus.\n\n\"I'd say Chris Christie apologized. Chris Christie took action. He's the head of the Republican Governors Association, and he's down here doing his job, and that's raising money to make sure that Rick Scott gets re-elected,\" Curry said.",
    " Title: Trump Announces Houses of Worship as Essential, Urges Governors to Allow Reopening\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday announced that new Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance will classify houses of worship as \"essential,\" as he called on governors to allow them to open \"right now\" after being closed during the coronavirus lockdowns. The policy applies to churches, synagogues, and mosques.\n\nDuring a short briefing at the White House, Trump stated, \"The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now -- for this weekend.\" He added, \"If they do not do it, I will override the governors.\"\n\nTrump took issue with certain businesses being open while churches are not. Attorney General William Barr already warned last month that coronavirus restrictions by state and local government should be applied evenly and not single out religious organizations.\n\n\"Some governors have deemed the liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential,\" Trump said. \"But have left out churches and other houses of worship. It's not right. So I'm correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential.\"\n\nThe CDC released interim guidelines Friday for communities of faith that acknowledge \"millions of Americans embrace worship as an essential part of life\" but also warn that \"gatherings present a risk for increasing the spread of COVID-19.\"\n\nThe guidelines encourage the use of cloth face coverings during services, limiting the size of gatherings, social distancing during services, and suspending or decreasing choirs and singing in church since \"singing may contribute to transmission of COVID-19, possibly through emission of aerosols.\"\n\nLast week, the CDC released new guidelines that schools, businesses, and other organizations can use as states reopen from coronavirus shutdowns. However, the document excluded guidance for churches and faith-based groups because the White House raised concerns about the recommended restrictions, the Associated Press reported.\n\nCities across the country have been taking their cues from their governors on when and how to reopen. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's executive order still remains in effect in hard-hit New York City, officials said Friday.\n\n\"Houses of worship never closed in New York City, but have been under reasonable capacity requirements that prohibit large gatherings,\" said Olivia Lapeyrolerie, Mayor Bill de Blasio's deputy press secretary. \"We will continue to work closely with faith leaders to ensure people can safely worship during these stressful times, but will not take any steps that could jeopardize New Yorkers' health.\"\n\nThe White House's Friday announcement comes after Trump has been hearing an earful from faith leaders who are unable to hold services due to coronavirus restrictions at a time when their parishioners are grappling with the crisis.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump had a conference call with 1,600 pastors and faith leaders from around the country, including Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. He reassured them he wants to get churches reopened. The evangelical Christian community was instrumental in supporting Trump during his 2016 White House bid and he's maintained strong ties with Christian leaders throughout his presidency.\n\nChurches across the country had to close down due to stay-home orders necessary to stop the spread of the contagious virus. Faith leaders set up online services, and families tuned in Sunday mornings from their computers at home.\n\nEarlier in the pandemic, Trump expressed optimism that churches would be opened by Easter Sunday, April 12. But April turned out to be an extremely deadly month for the pandemic, and parishioners had to celebrate Easter from home.\n\nSome faith leaders have argued that social distancing rules have violated First Amendment religious freedoms. Others have defied state and local rules and tried to reopen.\n\n\"The discrimination that has been occurring against churches and houses of worship has been shocking,\" said Kelly Shackelford, president of the First Liberty Institute, a legal organization dedicated to defending religious freedom. \"We applaud the President's strong stance today demanding that these attacks must stop and that churches and houses of worship be freed to safely open. Americans are going to malls and restaurants. They need to be able to go to their houses of worship.\"\n\nBut other faith leaders warned that congregating is too dangerous right now.\n\n\"The President is wrong, plain and simple,\" said Rabbi Jack Moline, president of Interfaith Alliance. \"... The virus does not discriminate between types of gatherings, and neither should the president... It is completely irresponsible for the president to command a mass reopening of houses of worship. The illness and death that afflicts religious communities who follow the president's dictates will be his responsibility.\"\n\nEarlier this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report that showed just how quickly the virus can spread at church. The study showed that two symptomatic people who later tested positive for COVID-19 attended church events in rural Arkansas back in early March. At least 35 of 92 attendees at the events contracted the virus, and three of them died. Twenty-six other people in the community with links to the church have also contracted the virus, with one person dying.\n\n\"We stayed home so the virus quieted down and stopped spreading widely where it was spreading widely,\" former CDC director Tom Frieden told Fox News Wednesday. \"So anytime you have a lot of people together in an indoor space and one of them is infectious, you can have a lot of cases.\"",
    " Title: Health and Human Services Secretary Apologizes for Obamacare Website Issues, Defends Law Amidst Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius apologized for the malfunctioning HealthCare.gov website on Wednesday, acknowledging that it would take another month to fix the issues. The website, intended to be the primary means for many Americans to purchase insurance from state-based health care exchanges, has been plagued by glitches since its launch on October 1.\n\nDuring her testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Sebelius also faced questions about President Obama's 2010 promise that his health care program would not force Americans out of their existing insurance. In a later speech in Boston, Obama addressed this issue, stating that while some may be forced off their plans, they would ultimately receive better deals from their insurance companies.\n\nBoth Sebelius and Obama took responsibility for the website's early problems. Sebelius stated, \"Hold me accountable for the debacle. I'm responsible.\" This was her first appearance before Congress to answer for the website's problems.\n\nThe hearing was marked by calls for subsidies and stories of constituents who have lost their health care plans and could face higher premiums. Lawmakers also used humor and personal challenges to make their points. For instance, Rep. Cory Gardner asked Sebelius if she would enroll herself in a health care plan on one of the Obamacare exchanges, to which she declined, citing her employer-based coverage from the federal government.\n\nSebelius appeared to confuse the law when she told lawmakers, \"If I have available employer-based coverage, I am not eligible for the market.\" However, HealthCare.gov states that if individuals are eligible for job-based insurance, they can consider switching to a marketplace plan but may put their subsidies at risk.\n\nBoth Sebelius and Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, testified before Congress. They attributed some of the website's problems to the lead company hired to help build the site. The vendors have stated that the Obama administration did not test the system \"end to end\" until days before its launch, and a CMS memo revealed that the website had not completed security testing as of Sept. 27.\n\nIn addition to the website problems, concerns have arisen this week about the preservation of health care plans as promised by Obama. Committee Chairman Fred Upton stated that Obama's vow has been called into question by a flood of cancellation notices nationwide. Sebelius explained that if a plan was in place in 2010, when the legislation was passed, it could have been grandfathered in as long as the companies did not make major changes.\n\nAmericans are \"scared\" and \"frustrated\" due to the situation, according to Upton, as many cannot use the Obamacare websites to explore their options, just weeks after Sebelius and her lieutenants assured lawmakers that the federal exchange system was ready to launch. Rep. Marsha Blackburn reminded Sebelius that the law is taking away a personal choice to hold a bare-bones plan, stating, \"Some people like to drive a Ford, not a Ferrari, and some people like to drink out of a red Solo cup, not a crystal stem.\"",
    " Title: Biden's Role in Financial Reform and Consumer Protection During His Vice Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nJared Bernstein, who served as President Joe Biden's chief economist and economic adviser during his first term as vice president, stated that a senator from a state with significant credit-card and financial interests has a different constituency compared to a vice president. During his tenure as vice president, Biden led the Middle Class Task Force and played a key role in consumer protection issues.\n\nIn 2015, Congress passed legislation requiring clearer monthly statements and protecting against retroactive interest rate increases, while limiting the fees that banks charge merchants on debit card purchases. This legislation was a result of the efforts spearheaded by the Obama administration, of which Biden was a part.\n\nBiden's support for financial reform and consumer protection was significant, according to a spokesman for the vice president, Stephen Spector. Spector cited Biden's support for the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act, intended to protect consumers from unfair billing practices, and the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 financial overhaul legislation that provided new consumer safeguards and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nThe extent to which Biden can claim credit for these bills could be significant in a primary campaign, according to Bernstein. Christopher J. Dodd, a former Democratic senator from Connecticut, stated that Biden, as vice president, was not necessarily a central player in the passage process but was a \"classic progressive Democrat\" on economic issues.\n\nDodd, a sponsor of the Dodd-Frank Act with Barney Frank, a former Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, did not recall Biden playing a significant role behind the scenes, either for or against credit-card companies. However, Frank noted that the Obama administration's record on financial issues could serve as a \"pretty good defense for Joe\" against criticism of his earlier ties to the credit-card industry before he was no longer representing the interests of his home state.",
    " Title: Former Prosecutor Predicts Indictment of President Trump on Campaign Finance Charges\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy, a conservative legal analyst, has suggested that prosecutors may indict President Donald Trump on charges related to campaign finance violations, based on the sentencing memo for Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, released on Friday.\n\nIn a column for Fox News, McCarthy, who worked as a prosecutor in the same Southern District of New York jurisdiction currently prosecuting Cohen, argued that the prosecutors' focus on Cohen's relatively minor campaign finance violations indicates an intention to charge Trump over payments of hush money to two women before he became president.\n\nThe 40-page sentencing memorandum filed by federal prosecutors for Cohen on Friday states that the president is likely to be indicted on a charge of violating federal campaign finance laws. McCarthy asserts that Trump has been a primary subject of the ongoing investigation by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nWhen Cohen pleaded guilty in August, prosecutors induced him to make an extraordinary statement in open court: the payments to the women were made \"in coordination with and at the direction of\" the candidate for federal office \u2013 Donald Trump. McCarthy contends that prosecutors would not have made such a statement if Trump was not a focus of their investigation.\n\nMcCarthy acknowledges that Trump has a strong defense, but suggests that prosecutors may be focusing on him regardless.\n\nOn Friday, Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who was also once the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and now serves as one of Trump's lawyers, dismissed the legal danger to the president. Giuliani pointed to Cohen's conviction for lying to the FBI, which would make his testimony on other matters unreliable. \"You have to believe Cohen. Who believes Cohen?\" he reportedly said.\n\nJoel B. Pollak, Senior Editor-at-Large at \u2588\u2588\u2588, offers a different perspective.

    " Title: Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal's Response to Candy Crowley's Question on Gun Control Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nConnecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, a former Attorney General, has responded to Candy Crowley's question regarding the effectiveness of the proposed gun control legislation in preventing tragedies like the one in Newtown. During a Senate debate, Crowley asked, \"How would anything in the bill, as it currently stands, have stopped anything that went on in Newtown?\"\n\nBlumenthal did not suggest abandoning the bill but instead emphasized the need for further measures. He stated that the Senate Majority Leader has assured him and other proponents of the bill that amendments on both the assault-weapons ban and the prohibition on high-capacity magazines will be allowed. Blumenthal also mentioned his intention to offer an amendment that would ban high-capacity magazines.\n\nThe article discusses the ongoing debate within the Democratic party on gun control, with President Obama criticizing gun control opponents as insensitive to the Sandy Hook tragedy, while Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has reportedly blocked a ban on assault weapons due to insufficient support within the Democrat-held chamber.\n\nThe article then addresses Crowley's question, suggesting that even a bill including an assault weapons ban and high-capacity magazine prohibition would not have prevented the Newtown shooting. The article cites three reasons:\n\n1. Background checks: The Newtown shooter obtained his weapons illegally from his mother, who bought them legally. There is no method for checking people determined to obtain a gun illegally.\n2. \"Assault weapons\" ban: Connecticut has a federal-style ban in place, but the weapons used in the Sandy Hook massacre were not prohibited by that law.\n3. Magazine limits: Forcing a spree shooter to reload may provide an opportunity for unarmed victims to intervene, but the likelihood of defenseless, terrified children overpowering a deranged gunman is negligible.\n\nThe article concludes by expressing hope for a reasonable compromise on gun control, but emphasizes the need for serious consideration of the effectiveness, duplicative nature, and potential infringement on Second Amendment rights of proposed restrictions. The article also warns against hasty, ill-conceived action, citing New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's enactment of unworkable prohibitions and oversights as an example. The article ends with a quote from the nation's foremost gun safety expert, stating that the Assault Weapons ban and magazine size limitations are just the beginning of potential gun control measures.",
    " Title: Trump Imposes Tough Sanctions on Iran, Iranian President Responds\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has issued a strong warning to anyone trading with Iran, following his re-imposition of sanctions on the country. In a tweet, he stated, \"Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States.\" Some re-imposed sanctions took effect overnight, and tougher ones relating to oil exports will begin in November.\n\nThe sanctions follow the U.S. withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal, earlier this year. The deal, negotiated during the presidency of Barack Obama, saw Iran limit its controversial nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nMr. Trump has called the deal \"one-sided,\" \"disastrous,\" and the \"worst I've ever seen.\" He believes renewed economic pressure will force Iran to agree to a new deal. The European Union, which remains committed to the original agreement, has spoken out against the sanctions, vowing to protect firms doing \"legitimate business\" with Iran.\n\nIn his latest tweet, Mr. Trump praised the \"most biting sanctions ever imposed\" and said they would \"ratchet up to another level\" in November. He also said, \"I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!\"\n\nOn Monday, he had said that Iran faced a choice to \"either change its threatening, destabilizing behavior and reintegrate with the global economy, or continue down a path of economic isolation.\" He added, \"I remain open to reaching a more comprehensive deal that addresses the full range of the regime's malign activities, including its ballistic missile program and its support for terrorism.\"\n\nMr. Trump signed an executive order that brought sanctions back into place at 00:01 EDT (04:01 GMT) on Tuesday. The sanctions target the purchase or acquisition of U.S. banknotes by Iran's government, graphite, aluminum, steel, coal, and software used in industrial processes. A second phase is planned to come back into effect on 5 November, which will have implications for Iran's energy and shipping sectors, petroleum trading, and transactions by foreign financial institutions with the Central Bank of Iran.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani said the U.S. government had \"turned their back on diplomacy.\" He added, \"They want to launch psychological warfare against the Iranian nation.\" Rouhani also stated, \"Negotiations with sanctions does not make sense. We are always in favor of diplomacy and talks... but talks need honesty.\"\n\nThe foreign ministers of Germany, the UK, and France released a statement on Monday that said the nuclear deal remained \"crucial\" to global security. They also unveiled a \"blocking statute,\" which is intended to protect European firms doing business with Iran despite the new U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe impact of the new sanctions on Iran's economy is already being felt, with rising food prices, unemployment, and even poor water supplies leading to protests in a number of cities. The sanctions may bite hardest in November, when the U.S. blocks Iranian oil sales, which could halt about half of Iran's exports of some two million barrels a day. Iran may look to China and Russia to keep its industry afloat.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said in March that Iran's net official reserves could decline this year to $97.8bn, which would finance about 13 months of imports. Analysts at BMI Research say Iran's economy could contract by 4.3% in 2019. However, Barbara Slavin, of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council, told the Wall Street Journal that when sanctions hit hard, it often means ordinary people become \"totally dependent\" on their government, and so sanctions do not tend to topple regimes.\n\nAs the first tranche of new U.S. sanctions kicks in, young Iranians have been sharing their stories with BBC Persian. Many are already feeling the effects, as the economy had slowed down in anticipation of what was to come. \"I used to work in marketing for a home appliance manufacturer,\" said Peyman. \"I lost my job as the company can't import the components.\" Aerospace engineer Ali lost his job of 13 years because his company could not import equipment. \"Now I'm working as a taxi driver to feed my family,\" he said. Many people say they're no longer being paid on time and are finding it hard to make ends meet.",
    " Title: U.S. Re-imposition of Iran Sanctions and Withdrawal from Nuclear Deal Affects Global Response\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran and withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal has prompted U.S. allies in Europe, China, Russia, and Iran to consider their next steps. Trump described the deal as a \"horrible, one-sided deal\" that \"didn\u2019t bring peace\" and \"never will.\"\n\nThe non-renewal of the waivers required under the nuclear agreement could have a \"devastatingly chilling effect on any kind of economic activity\" between Europe and Iran, according to Tony Blinken, who was deputy secretary of State under President Barack Obama and helped negotiate the deal.\n\nRobert Einhorn, a former arms control official at the State Department under Obama's first secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, stated that it will take time to establish the regulatory scheme necessary to re-impose sanctions. The practical effect of not issuing the waivers is to notify banks, businesses, and purchasers of Iranian crude oil that they must either stop importing Iranian crude oil or significantly reduce their purchases within the next 180 days.\n\nTrump's decision to withdraw from the deal was based on several concerns, including the elimination of expiration dates on the most important restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity, allowing inspections of military sites, and addressing Iran's support for terrorist groups across the Middle East. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson have urged Trump to stay with the deal and work with him to address his concerns.\n\nIran's President Hasan Rouhani has stated that his country will respond to the U.S. action, but he and other signatories to the deal have expressed their intention to stay in it. Russia, a crude oil exporter, does not import much, if any, crude oil from Iran. China could direct its oil purchases through its Kunlun Bank, which is already under U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe European Union has announced plans to protect companies if Trump pulls out of the deal. However, it may be difficult for European companies to achieve this due to their reliance on the U.S.-led financial system. Banks and businesses are already wary of doing business in Iran due to its poorly managed and corrupt economy.\n\nStephen Rademaker, a former arms control official at the State Department under President George W. Bush, stated that Trump's ideal goal is to negotiate a better deal with Iran. Even after refusing to waive sanctions and those sanctions go back into effect, Trump will still have the waiver authority. Iran's leaders are expected to refuse to negotiate a new deal, but Trump has expressed his willingness to negotiate a new deal if the opportunity arises.",
    " Title: Opponents Express Concerns Over Interim Nuclear Deal with Iran, Propose Legislation to Maintain Sanctions\n\nArticle:\n\nOpponents of an interim nuclear deal being negotiated with Iran are taking steps to prevent what they perceive as a \"bad deal\" from becoming a means for Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. The deal's opponents acknowledge that neither Congress nor the vocal opposition of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can derail an accord agreed upon by world powers. Instead, attention is shifting towards ensuring immediate consequences for Iran if it fails to comply with the terms of any such agreement.\n\nOn Thursday, the six world powers meeting with Iran in Geneva reported no progress in narrowing the remaining differences between the two sides. Some Iranian officials suggested that the gaps might have widened since the last meeting earlier this month. However, this apparent lack of progress did not deter some members of Congress from meeting with administration officials at the White House to express their misgivings.\n\nAt least one Republican senator announced that he was proposing legislation to force the immediate reinstatement of any lightened sanctions on Iran upon any evidence of Iran not abiding by the terms of a first-step deal. An interim deal with Iran would aim to freeze progress in Iran's nuclear program while a comprehensive agreement verifiably stopping Iran's program short of a nuclear weapon could be worked out.\n\nOpponents appear most concerned that a short-term plan accepting some level of uranium enrichment \u2013 a process that can result in the fuel for a nuclear weapon \u2013 would turn into permanent acceptance of Iran's \"right\" to enrich. John Bolton, the former US ambassador to the United Nations and a prominent critic of the Obama administration's Iran diplomacy, stated, \"The Iranian nuclear program has been fundamentally a weapons program from the beginning, and I don't see that changing \u2013 certainly not if we go with an interim deal that accepts uranium enrichment.\"\n\nSuch a deal would be \"fatally flawed,\" according to Bolton, because, without any vision for what a final plan should look like, the risks are great that an interim accord \"becomes permanent\" \u2013 enshrining Iran's enrichment program and leaving Iran on a path to a nuclear weapon.\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-TN) introduced legislation on Thursday to \"keep the pressure on Iran\" during the period between a first-step and a final deal. The bill would postpone any additional lifting of sanctions \u2013 beyond what the White House says would be \"limited and reversible\" sanctions relief as part of an interim deal \u2013 until after Iran agreed to the \"essential terms of an acceptable final deal,\" according to Senator Corker. The legislation also calls for any sanctions lifted as part of an interim deal to \"snap back\" in the event of any violation of the deal's obligations.\n\nIn order to secure substantial US sanctions relief as part of a final agreement, Iran would have to verifiably \"eliminate the threat of its nuclear program,\" Corker says. Even as negotiations were underway in Geneva, the White House continued to brief members of Congress in an effort to head off debilitating criticism should a deal be reached.\n\nOne member of a delegation invited to the White House on Thursday, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA), says he \"remains a skeptic\" that a good interim deal is possible. However, he says he left the meeting, which he said was attended by 10 Democratic representatives, \"a little more convinced that they [in the administration] are focused on getting this right\" and not above all on getting any deal.\n\nEarlier in the day, Representative Sherman had cut short his attendance at a Capitol Hill meeting of Iranian dissidents addressing the plight of Iranian refugees in Iraq, telling a cheering crowd that he had to leave for the White House \"to convince them not to accept a bad deal in Geneva.\" After the White House meeting, Sherman said, \"I still fear they would be willing to enter a deal that [to them] would be better than no deal at all\" \u2013 echoing a charge leveled against President Obama not just by other members of Congress but also by French leaders, who are also involved in the Geneva talks.\n\n\"But after what I heard,\" he added, \"I'm a little less concerned about that than I was before.\" Sherman says a key challenge after an interim deal \u2013 and one reason he never favored the idea of a \"first step\" before a comprehensive agreement \u2013 will be the thinking expected to bloom in international business circles \"that it's OK to do business with Iran now.\" To battle such trends and to keep the pressure up on Iran, Sherman says he and other members of the House will continue to press the Senate to proceed with considering a new round of sanctions. The point, he says, would be to keep Iran motivated to reach a comprehensive agreement on its nuclear program.\n\nMore ardent critics of the administration's Iran diplomacy say any rush into a \"bad deal\" won't just leave Iran's nuclear challenge unaddressed, but could embroil Obama in another losing political battle. \"I think the administration is set on getting some deal,\" says Bolton, now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. \"But if they go with a deal with such deficiencies that the opposition here in Washington is swift and sustained, they're not going to get that.\"",
    " Title: White House Pushes for Expanded Childcare and Family Leave Options\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump called for expanded access to childcare and family leave during a White House meeting on Thursday, aiming to appeal to women voters by focusing on issues that Democratic challengers are emphasizing in their campaigns. The meeting, part of a push by administration officials, could potentially move forward legislation improving access to assistance for working parents.\n\nTrump stated that families are struggling to pay for childcare and advocated for the expansion of in-home and faith-based programs for children. He expressed the desire to \"expand childcare options and reduce unnecessary regulations so that parents can choose the best care for their children.\"\n\nIvanka Trump, the president's daughter, spoke at the event, emphasizing the importance of addressing childcare and family leave issues. She stated, \"Lack of child care and paid leave is not a women's issue \u2014 it is a family issue. That said, they disproportionately impact women, who provide the vast majority of unpaid care to our nation's children and adult dependents.\"\n\nChildcare and family leave have been a focus for several Democratic candidates running in 2020. Proposed legislation includes Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey's plan to increase eligibility for the childcare block-grant subsidy and provide free childcare to some student parents. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has called for universal childcare for all children under 5, and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has proposed three months of paid family leave.\n\nThis week, House Democrats reportedly struck a deal with the White House that provides 12 weeks of paid parental leave for federal workers in exchange for establishing the president's proposed space force as a new branch of the government in the defense authorization bill. White House domestic policy adviser Joe Grogan called the possible new benefit for federal workers an \"important first step\" toward the administration's priority of providing paid family leave for all Americans.\n\nThe administration is also asking lawmakers to reauthorize and overhaul a block-grant program that provides childcare subsidies to low-income working families. Last year, lawmakers increased the amount of childcare funds distributed to states through the program by $2.4 billion to $5.6 billion overall. However, the White House argues the program could benefit more families if lawmakers removed \"overly stringent regulations\" on facilities and staff that the administration says drive up childcare costs.\n\nAs part of the White House effort, the Council of Economic Advisers completed a report detailing the impact of childcare costs on the economy. The report found that while women with young children are about twice as likely to participate in the labor force as they were 50 years ago, some 3.8 million parents with children under the age of 6 are currently outside the labor force. The report argues that expanding childcare options\u2014particularly by removing some regulations\u2014could meaningfully increase the number of Americans who work rather than stay home out of concern over childcare costs.",
    " Title: Marco Rubio Discusses Presidential Campaign and Pope Francis' Visit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) stated that he does not consider the current polling in the Republican presidential nomination race as a \"breakout moment\" for his campaign. According to a recent CNN/ORC poll, Rubio is in fourth place with 11 percent support.\n\nWhen asked by host George Stephanopoulos if this was his breakout moment, Rubio responded, \"No. These polls do not really mean anything at this stage.\" He added, \"You're a veteran of campaigns, and I'm not sure the mid-September winners are where you want to be.\"\n\nRubio, a Catholic who also attends an evangelical church, also discussed Pope Francis' upcoming visit to Washington. He expressed respect for the pope's doctrinal authority but maintained that he can disagree with the pope on political matters. Rubio stated, \"The pope is the spiritual head of the church, who has authority to speak on matters, doctrinal matters and theological matters. And I follow him 100 percent on those issues.\"\n\nHowever, Rubio added that the pope's political opinions are separate and that individuals are free to disagree with them. He also expressed support for the pope meeting with dissidents during his visit to Cuba and the United States.\n\nRegarding President Barack Obama, Rubio stated that Obama is a Christian born in the United States. Rubio also expressed support for the pope meeting with dissidents during his visit to Cuba and the United States.\n\nFinally, Rubio added that he believes the pope should meet with dissidents during his nine-day visit to Cuba and the United States, which began on Saturday.",
    " Title: Facebook-Organized Protests Attended by Hundreds Possibly Part of Disinformation Network\n\nArticle:\n\nAt least three events co-organized on Facebook by a group now suspected of being part of a coordinated disinformation network appear to have been held, with hundreds of people attending. The events, in New York City and Springfield, Missouri, were all co-hosted on Facebook by a group called the Resisters. All three events were critical of President Trump.\n\nArchived versions of the event pages showed that 674 people responded on Facebook to say that they would attend the \"We Stand with DREAMers! Support DACA!\" event in New York on September 9, 2018. Another 3,000 said they were interested in attending. The New York Post reported that \"thousands\" of people gathered in Midtown on September 9 to protest Trump's decision to unwind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed children brought to the U.S. illegally to live and work in the United States.\n\nIt appears to be the same event co-hosted by Resisters on Facebook, as it took place on the same date and at the same location as the group's \"We Stand with DREAMers! Support DACA!\" event. More than 2,000 people said they were interested in attending \"The People's Protest. Springfield against Trump\" in the Missouri town on August 30, and 726 said that they planned to attend the event. Springfield, Missouri's NBC affiliate, KY3, and the Kansas City Star reported that hundreds of protesters showed up on that date to protest President Trump's trip to Springfield at the time.\n\nThe third event that appears to have taken place was titled \"Protest Trump and ideology of hate at Trump Tower!\" Around 4,700 said they were interested in attending the event and 1,400 said they were attending on the Facebook page. DNAInfo reported that thousands protested Trump at Trump Tower on August 14, 2017, the same day and location of the event promoted on Facebook. Reports at the time from multiple sources, including NBC and The Washington Post, also highlighted the protest.\n\nAll three events were hosted by what appear to be legitimate groups in addition to the Resisters. Facebook on Tuesday said \"inauthentic\" groups, including Resisters, created roughly 30 events. Facebook, in a call with reporters, highlighted fake pages set up by the groups, but said it had no evidence on whether the events actually took place.\n\nThere is some evidence that the events set up by Resisters were meant to piggyback on existing, legitimate events by opponents of Trump. Indivisible St. Louis told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that its Springfield event was already being organized when Resisters contacted them on Facebook. They also said that they did not encounter any representatives from Resisters at the protest.\n\nThe Columbus Circle in New York protest similarly capitalized on nationwide outrage over Trump's DACA policy and may have been organized regardless. Protests against the policy had already occurred early in September 2017. Roger Ray of the Emerging Church in Springfield said that the protest he was involved in would have happened regardless.\n\n\"I don't doubt there were lots of fake groups that might have tried to glom on, but they didn't have any physical representation. They wouldn't have had any influence,\" he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in a phone interview.\n\nFacebook executives did not blame Russia or the Russian troll group the Internet Research Agency (IRA), but said that the behavior matched past work by the IRA. The IRA during the 2016 presidential election created events that were highlighted on Facebook, including one in New York City attended by thousands. Multiple organizers told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that they were frustrated by the possibility that the involvement of a fake account could undermine their actual cause and stressed that they were engaged in real organizing.\n\n\"I certainly was not inspired by Russia or anything like that,\" Ray said.",
    " Title: Pennsylvania and Delaware Voters Embrace Trump as GOP's Presumptive Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican voters in Pennsylvania and Delaware, traditionally deep-blue states, are expressing their support for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the 2016 presidential election. This shift in allegiance is significant, as neither state has voted for a Republican president in a generation.\n\nIn York, a Pennsylvania State Police trooper, who requested anonymity due to his job, voted for Senator Ted Cruz in the primary but is now backing Mr. Trump. He cited the candidate's financial management skills as a reason for his support.\n\nNorth of York, in Harrisburg, gun shop owner Joe Staudt, a former Marine, also voted for Mr. Cruz but has joined the \"Trump Train.\" He criticized the reluctance of top Republicans to support Mr. Trump, describing it as childish or selfish.\n\nMegan Sweeney, spokeswoman for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, stated that the party is a bottom-up organization, and the voters have spoken clearly about their preferred nominee.\n\nDespite calls for party unity by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, some establishment figures, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, and several of Mr. Trump's primary rivals, have refused to pledge their support. Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan are scheduled to meet on Thursday in Washington, and the speaker has offered to give up his role presiding over the Republican National Convention this summer in Cleveland if requested by Mr. Trump.\n\nRepublican strategist and pollster Jim McLaughlin noted that Mr. Trump beat Mr. Cruz by 25 points among evangelicals and 30 points among self-described conservatives in the Pennsylvania primary. Mr. Trump's economic message of making America \"win\" again resonates with disaffected working-class voters in Pennsylvania, one of five Northeast states Mr. Trump swept on April 26 as he moved to secure the nomination.\n\nIn York, Katie Nimon, a registered Democrat who waits tables at Otto's Kitchen & Cocktails, voted for Senator Bernie Sanders in the primary but plans to cast her ballot for Donald Trump in November if he faces likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. She described Mrs. Clinton as a manipulative liar.\n\nSimilar support for Mr. Trump was heard in nearby Delaware, another state that hasn't voted for a Republican since George H.W. Bush won the White House in 1988. Donna Pusey, a 64-year-old barber and registered Democrat, vowed to vote for Mr. Trump in November, stating that she sat out the Democratic primary because she would \"rather get run over by a semi\" than choose between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders. She also criticized the treatment of Mr. Trump by GOP leaders as an \"abomination.\"",
    " Title: Bill Cosby Convicted of Sexual Assault in Pennsylvania\n\nArticle:\n\nComedian Bill Cosby was convicted on Thursday of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004, marking the first such conviction of a celebrity since the #MeToo movement. The 80-year-old, best known for his role as the lovable father on the 1980s TV hit \"The Cosby Show,\" faces up to 10 years in prison for each of three counts of aggravated indecent assault.\n\nFollowing a three-week trial at the Montgomery County courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, Cosby exploded when prosecutors asked the judge to take him into custody, stating he was a flight risk in part because he owned a plane. \"He doesn't have a plane, you asshole!\" Cosby responded in a booming voice as he leapt to his feet.\n\nThe verdict was read with a somber expression from Judge Steven O'Neill, who ruled Cosby could remain out of jail on $1 million bail pending sentencing, as long as he surrendered his passport and remained at home. Cosby then left the courthouse with his lawyers and publicist.\n\nDefense lawyer Thomas Mesereau told reporters that an appeal would be filed, and sentencing was expected within 60 to 90 days, after Cosby submits to a \"sexually violent predator assessment.\" Although he could get up to 10 years for each count, state sentencing guidelines suggest a term of less than 10 years.\n\nThe conviction marks the downfall of a man once celebrated as \"America's Dad\" but whose reputation was ruined after some 50 women accused him of similar offenses going back decades. Cosby had been a transcendent figure in show business, coming up as a black comedian during the civil rights movement of the 1960s and winning over white audiences with a clean routine. He went on to several successful television series when African-Americans were largely absent from TV. In \"The Cosby Show\" from 1984 to 1992, he played the wise and witty Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable, the father of an affluent black family.\n\nAll the while, his accusers say, he had been drugging and molesting women. Only one of those cases was recent enough to be eligible for prosecution, that of Constand, a former administrator for the women's basketball team at Temple University, Cosby's alma mater. She had no comment after the verdict.\n\n\"The most important person in our team was Andrea Constand,\" District Attorney Kevin Steele told reporters. \"She was the first courageous person who stood up in public and went to authorities and said, 'Bill Cosby drugged and raped me.'\"\n\nAttorney Gloria Allred, who represents 33 of the Cosby accusers, rejoiced that Cosby was found \"guilty, guilty, guilty.\"\n\n\"We are so happy that finally we can say, women are believed, and not only on #MeToo, but in a court of law,\" Allred told reporters.\n\nOther Cosby accusers celebrated the verdict with hugs, cries, and applause.\n\n\"I feel like my faith in humanity is restored,\" Bernard said.\n\nThe seven-man, five-woman jury reached a unanimous verdict after deliberating for 14 hours over two days. Less than a year ago, a different jury was deadlocked after six days of deliberations on the same charges, prompting the judge to declare a mistrial.\n\nSoon after the first trial, a series of women leveled sexual assault and harassment accusations against men in media, entertainment, and politics, giving rise to the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements that encouraged women to go public with personal stories of abuse, in some cases after years of silence.\n\nLike many of Cosby's other accusers, Constand said she was drugged and violated while unable to defend herself. Cosby has said any sexual encounters were consensual, and his lawyers portrayed the accusers as fabricating stories in search of wealth and fame.\n\n\"Mob rule is not due process,\" defense lawyer Kathleen Bliss said, referring to the #MeToo movement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been accused by several women of sexual misconduct, including after the release during the 2016 presidential campaign of a video in which he had spoken in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with women. He later called it \"locker room banter\" and his campaign issued an apology to anyone who was offended.\n\nTrump, whose inauguration and first anniversary as president were met with nationwide women's protests, denies accusations of sexual misconduct and accuses rival Democrats and the media of a smear campaign. He faces a defamation lawsuit from Summer Zervos, a contestant on his former reality show who accuses him of sexually harassing her. Trump's lawyer has said her accusations are false and politically motivated.",
    " Title: House Democrats' Support for Impeachment Inquiry: A Closer Look at the Current State of Affairs\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump has seen a significant shift in the number of House Democrats expressing support for the investigation. As of recent reports, there are 116 House Democrats who have voiced their support, which is just shy of a majority of the party. However, a closer examination of the situation reveals a more nuanced picture.\n\nIt appears that those who do not support an impeachment inquiry are instead advocating for the continuation of the current investigations. In reality, these ongoing investigations amount to the same thing, as House lawyers admitted last week. The notion that an impeachment inquiry requires special grants of power to move forward is no longer accurate, as officially opening an impeachment inquiry under current House rules and procedures is, for the most part, a formality.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi is leveraging this illusion of a dispute to her advantage. A formal vote in the full House might not set any wheels in motion, but it would increase the pressure to make a decision on impeachment one way or the other. Pelosi is right to avoid this pressure on behalf of her caucus, as there appears to be plenty to investigate, and it is both in the party's interest to keep the inquiry going and the responsible thing to do.\n\nHowever, actual articles of impeachment might not have the votes on the House floor, and a failed effort would likely be a victory for President Trump. Even if Pelosi could whip enough votes to send impeachment to the Senate, it would be an extremely weak statement unless Democrats were unified. A bare majority in the House for impeachment would almost certainly produce a majority against removal in the Senate, with 53 Republicans united and the 47 Democrats quite possibly split.\n\nBy contrast, keeping the investigation going is good politics, and fighting the administration's stonewalling in court is the responsible thing to do. Maintaining the fiction that there is some significant tension over whether to move to an impeachment inquiry reduces the pressure to make a premature decision and gives House Democrats an opportunity to \"vote\" by declaring themselves for or against the inquiry itself.\n\nIn summary, the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump is a complex issue, with House Democrats strategically navigating the political landscape. The illusion of a dispute over an impeachment inquiry serves a purpose for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but it is not necessarily indicative of a deep divide within the Democratic Party.",
    " Title: Researchers Link WannaCry Ransomware to North Korea's Lazarus Group\n\nArticle:\n\nSecurity researchers have identified lines of code in the WannaCry ransomware that match work by the Lazarus Group, a hacking group believed to be linked to North Korea. Google security researcher Neel Mehta pointed out similarities between WannaCry and malware used by Lazarus, the group responsible for the Sony Pictures hack in 2014 and the theft of millions of dollars from a Bangladeshi bank in 2016.\n\nAfter Mehta highlighted the code elements, other researchers confirmed similarities between WannaCry, also known as WannaCrypt, Wana Decryptor, or WCry, and malware tools used by Lazarus. While the connection does not definitively assign blame, it is the most substantial public information about the cyberattack's origin.\n\nThe WannaCry attack, which made headlines on Friday by locking computers in the U.K.'s health system and Spain's largest telecom, did not appear to target the U.S. or South Korea, despite heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula. At least 12 South Korean companies have been hit by the WannaCry computer virus, but South Korea does not seem to have been disproportionately affected.\n\nSecurity firm Symantec has identified tools exclusively used by Lazarus on machines also infected with earlier versions of WannaCry, which could have been used to spread the worm to vulnerable computers. The shared code is based on a specific sequence of 75 ciphers, which have only been seen across Lazarus tools.\n\nHowever, malware researcher Paul Burbage of Flashpoint, a business risk intelligence company, has not seen a solid connection between the ransomware and North Korea. \"We compared the code samples between WannaCry and previous Democratic People's Republic of Korea activity, but the only similarities are public libraries,\" Burbage said. \"Perhaps Symantec has more to go on than us at this point, but we are not seeing a DPRK link with the WannaCry worm campaign at this point.\"\n\nThe WannaCry cyberattack has affected more than 300,000 computers, according to White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert. U.S. investigators do not know who is responsible for WannaCry, but there are clues to follow.",
    " Title: Cruz's Speech at the Republican National Convention Leaves Endorsement Unclear\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican National Convention in Cleveland is approaching its climax, and one question remains unanswered: will Texas Senator Ted Cruz board the Trump train or remain a bitter rival of the Republican nominee, Donald Trump? Cruz is scheduled to deliver a prime-time address on Wednesday, with no indication yet that he plans to endorse Trump.\n\nIt is widely believed that Cruz is positioning himself for a future presidential run, whether in four or eight years. The nominee's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, has stated that Cruz's speech could provide a sign of his stance on Trump that would be pleasing to the Trump campaign and the Republican Party. Manafort mentioned that their operations have been in communication regarding Cruz's speech, and he plans to review a draft soon.\n\nWhile party unity was on display on Tuesday, Cruz's address could have an impact. He placed second in the delegate count during the nominating process and still has loyal supporters in the convention hall, some of whom disrupted proceedings on Monday. However, on Tuesday night, after Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, were formally nominated, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other party leaders attempted to bring the delegates and GOP voters together.\n\nRyan, who has had his share of disagreements with Trump over the nominee's controversial remarks and tactics, closed his address Tuesday night with a call to action, saying, \"Only with Donald Trump and Mike Pence do we have a chance at a better way.\" Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, a former primary rival turned supporter, warned that the country \"may never recover\" from another Clinton presidency, stating, \"I'm proud to support Donald Trump.\"\n\nTrump also addressed the convention hall via video message, saying, \"This is a movement... but we have to go all the way.\" While party leaders called for unity, many of the convention speakers focused heavily on Hillary Clinton. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., stated, \"Hillary Clinton has changed her position so many times, it's impossible to tell where the conviction ends and the ambition begins.\" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was considered for the running mate before Trump ultimately chose Pence, delivered one of the toughest speeches of the night on Clinton. His address was frequently interrupted by chants from the crowd of \"lock her up.\"\n\n\"We can not promote someone to commander-in-chief who has made the world a more violent and dangerous place with every bad judgment she has made,\" Christie said. \"The facts of her life and career disqualify her.\" The exact content of Cruz's speech and his stance on Trump remain to be seen.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Considers Six Candidates for Two Vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration is considering six candidates for two vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which has jurisdiction over federal districts in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. According to a report by Legal Times, the candidates under consideration include Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett, U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor of Fort Worth, former Texas solicitor general James Ho, Andy Oldham, a deputy general counsel to Gov. Greg Abbott, Michael Massengale, a justice on Houston's First Court of Appeals, and Brett Busby, a justice on Houston's Fourteenth Court of Appeals.\n\nTwo names on the list that stand out are Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett and former Texas solicitor general James Ho.\n\nTexas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett is a prominent figure in conservative and libertarian legal circles and was also on Trump's recent list of potential U.S. Supreme Court nominees. Willett is best known for his concurring opinion in the 2015 case of Patel v. Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, where he argued against a state regulation requiring eyebrow threaders to obtain an occupational license. Willett's 49-page concurrence is a call to judicial arms in defense of economic liberty.\n\nFormer Texas solicitor general James Ho is known for a 2006 law review article defending the constitutionality of birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrant parents. Ho's position on birthright citizenship is directly at odds with the stated views of Donald Trump, who has vowed to \"end birthright citizenship.\"\n\nThe potential appointment of either Willett or Ho to the 5th Circuit would significantly impact the court's composition and decisions. However, it is unclear at this time which candidates will be selected for the two vacancies.",
    " Title: U.S. Stock Market Rebounds After Iranian Missile Strike on U.S. Bases in Iraq\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. equity markets experienced a rebound on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq Composite Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average approaching record closes, despite an Iranian missile strike on two U.S. Iraqi bases in retaliation for the killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani. The less bellicose posture adopted by President Donald Trump, who a day ago had warned of a harsh response to any action by Iran, helped to push the markets higher.\n\nPresident Trump, during an afternoon speech, stated that no Americans were harmed in the Iranian attack and that only minimal damage was sustained at the military bases. He also noted that Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world.\n\nThe S&P 500 index, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite Index had shown signs of a more negative response to the brewing conflict late Tuesday, as indicated by futures contracts. However, market participants attribute the rebound to more than just the calming words from Trump and Iranian officials. Equities have historically been good at shaking off or discounting entirely military conflicts that have initially been unsettling.\n\nLPL Financial senior market strategist Ryan Detrick stated, \"No doubt worries over Iran have investors on edge. Stocks could be volatile for a while, but the impact to stocks from geopolitical events historically has tended to be short-lived.\"\n\nIndeed, the S&P 500 has declined 5% on average in 20 major geopolitical events dating back to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. However, the S&P 500 recovered those losses in fewer than 50 calendar days on average. The stunning assassination of President John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963, for example, led to a 2.8% decline in the S&P 500, which was recovered in a day. It took markets 307 sessions to rebound from the Pearl Harbor attacks in 1941, which resulted in a total decline of nearly 20%.\n\nCrude-oil prices, which had spiked overnight, fell back during the trading day. West Texas Intermediate crude oil for February delivery settled at $59.61 a barrel, after touching an intraday peak at $65.65, its highest level since April. Oil has been the biggest beneficiary of the rising tensions in the oil-rich Middle East, and some investors point to the strong gains oil has seen in the face of rising Mideast tensions as a reason for the strong pullback.",
    " Title: New Tax Bill Aims to Offer Mixed Benefits for Individual Taxpayers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recently proposed tax bill is set to offer a mix of benefits for individual taxpayers, with the extent of these benefits largely dependent on factors such as income level, location, and common tax deductions claimed.\n\nFor taxpayers earning up to $24,000, no income tax will be imposed. For married taxpayers filing jointly, earnings up to $90,000 will be taxed at a 12% rate, while earnings up to $260,000 will fall under the 25% tax bracket. Earnings up to $1 million will be taxed at a 35% rate. For unmarried individuals and those filing separately, the bracket thresholds will be half of these amounts, except for the 35% bracket, which will be $200,000 for unmarried individuals.\n\nThe proposal aims to significantly expand the standard deduction for middle-class families. The standard deduction for married couples will be increased to $24,000, up from the current $12,700, and set at $12,000 for individuals, up from $6,530 today. Additionally, the child tax credit is planned to be expanded to $1,600 from $1,000, and a $300 credit for each parent and non-child dependent, such as older family members, is proposed, although this credit would expire after five years.\n\nHowever, the bill also tightens rules for claiming the child tax credit, a change that could impact immigrant parents whose children were born in the United States. Filers would now need to provide a \"work-eligible Social Security number\" rather than just a taxpayer identification number to claim the credit. The left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities estimates that the bill would roll back eligibility for about three million children in working families, including about 80% of whom were born in the United States.\n\nThe bill includes a variety of other changes that will affect taxpayers in different ways. For instance, it repeals certain tax credits, including a 15% credit for individuals aged 65 or over or who are retired on disability. This credit, which currently allows individuals to claim up to $7,500 for a joint return, $5,000 for a single individual, or $3,750 for a married individual filing a joint return, will be entirely repealed under the House bill.\n\nThe bill also proposes changes to the popular mortgage interest deduction. Under the Republican plan, existing homeowners can keep the deduction, but future purchases will be capped at $500,000, down from the current $1 million limit.",
    " Title: FBI Decides Not to Recommend Criminal Charges Against Hillary Clinton in Email Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nFBI Director James Comey announced on Tuesday that the bureau will not recommend to the Department of Justice (DOJ) that criminal charges be brought against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton regarding her handling of classified emails on a private server. In a statement, Comey said, \"Our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\"\n\nClinton's spokesman, Brian Fallon, issued a statement shortly after the announcement, saying, \"We are pleased that the career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the Department is appropriate.\" He added, \"As the Secretary has long said, it was a mistake to use her personal email and she would not do it again. We are glad that this matter is now resolved.\"\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Clinton's rival, criticized the FBI's decision on Twitter, saying, \"FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! # RiggedSystem.\" Trump later issued two separate statements on the matter, including one that read, \"Comey let Clinton off the hook... The fix was final. The Obama administration's anointed successor has had an indictment removed from her path and will now be able to glide to the rigged Democrat nomination.\"\n\nDespite not recommending charges, Comey delivered a blistering rebuke of Clinton's actions, saying the FBI found that 110 emails were sent or received on Clinton's server containing classified information. He added it was possible that people hostile to the U.S. had gained access to her personal email account.\n\n\"Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,\" Comey said.\n\nComey said seven email chains were classified at the \"Top Secret/Special Access Program level\" when they were sent and received on Clinton's server. \"There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation,\" he said.\n\nTuesday's decision removes what was arguably the biggest threat to Clinton's presidential campaign going forward \u2013 a criminal referral that could have led to an indictment \u2013 just weeks before her party's national convention in Philadelphia, where she is set to seal her nomination as the Democrat standard-bearer.\n\nClinton consistently downplayed the FBI investigation, even calling it a \"security review,\" and as recently as June 3 said there was \"absolutely no possibility\" she'd be indicted. Weeks ago, a scathing State Department inspector general report directly countered her long-running claim that her personal email use was allowed, though her campaign continued to defend the candidate's actions.\n\nIn the wake of that report, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, stepped up his criticism of Clinton's email actions and said she belongs in \"jail.\" The DOJ decision does not strip the email controversy as a campaign issue \u2013 Trump and the Republicans are sure to keep hammering it as the campaign lurches into full general election mode post-conventions \u2013 but shows the federal investigation did not determine the actions to be criminal, even if they were ill-advised and potentially damaging to national security.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican, said the decision not to prosecute Clinton defied explanation, adding, \"No one should be above the law.\" The decision comes more than a year after knowledge of Clinton's use of a personal email account and server first became public. Clinton responded at the time with a point-by-point written explanation and a press conference in which she said she had opted to use her personal server for \"convenience.\"\n\nHowever, critics said she was clearly circumventing government systems in order to try to shield her communications from public records requests, potentially putting sensitive and highly classified government secrets at risk in the process. During a subsequent review, more than 2,000 emails on the server were found to have contained information now deemed classified, though they apparently were not marked classified when sent.",
    " Title: Tennessee Governor Grants Clemency to Cyntoia Brown, Convicted for 2004 Murder\n\n Article:\n\n Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam has ordered the release of Cyntoia Brown, a woman who was sentenced to life in prison for the 2004 murder of a man she claimed was a sex solicitor when she was 16 years old. The decision, made on Monday, grants Brown parole supervision on August 7, 2019, after almost 15 years behind bars.\n\n Brown was tried as an adult and convicted in 2006 for the murder of a Nashville estate agent, Johnny Allen. Prosecutors argued that the crime was robbery, while Brown maintained that she was a child sex-trafficking victim who acted in self-defense. Her case gained support from celebrities such as singer Rihanna, reality TV personality Kim Kardashian West, comedian Amy Schumer, and NBA star LeBron James.\n\n The case was the subject of the 2011 documentary \"Me Facing Life: Cyntoia's Story.\" According to the film, Brown was picked up in Nashville by Allen, who agreed to pay her $150 for sex and drove her to his home. However, Brown stated that once at Allen's home, he groped her roughly and reached for the side of the bed, leading her to fear he was reaching for a gun. She then shot him.\n\n Prosecutors at the time alleged that Brown killed the victim while he was sleeping and stole his money, guns, and truck before fleeing the scene. They claimed that she was motivated by greed, but her defense lawyers argued that she was afraid of returning home empty-handed to her violent pimp, who went by the nickname Kutthroat.\n\n After entering a plea of self-defense, a jury found her guilty of first-degree premeditated murder, first-degree felony murder, and aggravated robbery. In a statement on Monday, Governor Haslam said he had ordered that Brown be released to parole supervision on August 7, 2019.\n\n \"Cyntoia Brown committed, by her own admission, a horrific crime at the age of 16,\" the statement said. \"Yet, imposing a life sentence on a juvenile that would require her to serve at least 51 years before even being eligible for parole consideration is too harsh, especially in light of the extraordinary steps Ms Brown has taken to rebuild her life.\"\n\n Nashville Mayor David Briley called the decision a \"great day for social justice and our city.\" Brown, who has earned an associate degree while in prison, said she would do everything to justify Governor Haslam's faith in her. \"I am thankful for all the support, prayers, and encouragement I have received,\" she said in a statement. \"We truly serve a God of second chances and new beginnings.\"\n\n After the announcement was made, Kim Kardashian West tweeted her thanks. Actresses Alyssa Milano and Sophia Bush were also among the celebrities voicing their support on Twitter. Stacey Abrams, who ran as the first black female nominee for governor in the US during the mid-term elections, said the victory belonged to Brown and the activists \"who refused to concede injustice.\"",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Calls for Adult Summer Camps to Bridge Political Divide, Discusses 2016 Campaign Plans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the American Camp Association of New York and New Jersey's annual Tri-State CAMP Conference in Atlantic City, New Jersey, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for adult summer camps to help bridge political differences and close the \"serious fun deficit\" in America. The speech, which was Clinton's last scheduled paid speech before her expected April launch of a potential second presidential campaign, focused on the need for Americans to come together and work across political aisles.\n\nClinton steered clear of thorny issues and controversies that have surrounded her in recent weeks, instead focusing on the need for a pragmatic approach to getting things done in a gridlocked Washington. She lamented the growth of political division and partisanship, pointing to changes in the media and campaign finance laws as culprits.\n\nThe former senator spoke for about an hour to more than 3,000 camp professionals, including a 30-minute Q&A session with her longtime donor and ally, Jay Jacobs. Clinton also spoke about her advocacy for children, her book It Takes a Village, and praised camp professionals for teaching life skills to kids.\n\nShe reiterated her call for universal pre-kindergarten education, portraying it as an economic and national security issue. Clinton has a perceived lock on the Democratic nomination, and her team insists she has not made a final decision on a run. A specific launch date remains uncertain, but a formal declaration sometime in April is all but assured.\n\nClinton's team is already preparing for the campaign, with staffers being told to be ready to report for duty by April 1. Unlike Republicans testing the waters for a 2016 bid, Clinton has no entity to raise money or pay staff. Most aides are volunteering their time until she formally declares her run.\n\nIn a lighter moment, Clinton answered a series of \"lightning round\" questions from Jacobs, including revealing that she and her husband binge-watch \"House of Cards,\" though they have not yet seen the newest season. Instead, she recommended a Danish show about a woman who is elected prime minister.",
    " Title: Trump Announces Participation in Fall Debates Despite Perceived Bias, Predicts AOC Challenge for Schumer\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump has announced his intention to participate in debates in the fall, despite past threats suggesting otherwise. The president, who has often accused the Commission on Presidential Debates of bias against him, has also predicted that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York will challenge Senator Chuck Schumer in a Democratic primary, stating that she would \"kick his ass.\"\n\nLooking ahead to his speech on Tuesday night, President Trump hinted at the possible presence of Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host who announced on Monday that he has advanced lung cancer. The president suggested that he might award Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom during the speech.\n\nTensions with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who orchestrated his impeachment, remain high. President Trump expressed displeasure at the prospect of Pelosi sitting behind him and next to Vice President Mike Pence during the speech, stating, \"There\u2019s one person behind me who\u2019s going to be friendly and one who\u2019s not going to be friendly.\"\n\nThe president spent a significant portion of his speech criticizing John Bolton, whose unpublished book confirms a central allegation of the impeachment charges by reporting that the president conditioned security aid to Ukraine on its willingness to announce political investigations of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. \"He turned on me,\" said Mr. Trump of Mr. Bolton.\n\nThe Iowa debacle, coupled with Gallup reporting that Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating has climbed to 49 percent, its highest in that survey since his presidency began, has not deterred the president. While polls indicate that most Americans want the Senate to call witnesses, his impeachment trial is set to end Wednesday with an assured acquittal. It is possible, though not certain, that one or more Democratic senators will vote with him.\n\nMatt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, commented, \"What other people would look at as a moment of completely political meltdown for this president, it all appears to accrue to his benefit. He actually looks like the adult in the room.\"\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Schlapp suggested that the delayed count in Iowa will sow discord and suspicion within Democratic ranks. \"The problem for the Democrats is it will make people think and assume the fix is in again because they don\u2019t like who is leading,\" he said.",
    " Title: Trump's Pardons Under Scrutiny: Dinesh D'Souza Case Raises Questions About Presidential Power of Pardon\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's use of the presidential power of the pardon is under renewed scrutiny following his decision to pardon conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza. The pardon, announced on Thursday, comes after recent pardons for the late heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson, former Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, and former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, Joe Arpaio.\n\nD'Souza had pleaded guilty to making illegal campaign contributions, claiming that he was a victim of a politically-motivated prosecution by the Obama-era Department of Justice (DOJ). In September 2014, the judge at his sentencing hearing described his claims as \"all hat, no cattle.\"\n\nIn addition to the D'Souza and Libby pardons, Trump pardoned Arpaio in August 2017 for criminal contempt of court for ignoring a judge's orders to stop detaining migrants who were not suspected of a crime.\n\nCritics of the president express concern over the political nature of some of Trump's pardons, particularly in light of his attacks on the DOJ, FBI, and special counsel Robert Mueller. Lisa Gilbert of Public Citizen, a not-for-profit watchdog group, stated, \"Trump's feeling that people who say the right things or show some kind of loyalty or play on his team should be pardoned is completely antithetical to how our justice system works.\"\n\nGrant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, asserted that Trump's pardons appear \"more politically oriented\" compared to other recent presidents. He noted that Trump is focusing on people whose political actions are consistent with his own.\n\nDefenders of the president argue that he is not unusual in this regard. They point to President Clinton's controversial pardon of financier Marc Rich, whose ex-wife, Denise Rich, was a major fundraiser for the Democratic Party. Trump backers also note that, when asked about the pardon of D'Souza by reporters on Thursday, the president indicated he was considering pardons for businesswoman Martha Stewart and Rod Blagojevich, the former governor of Illinois.\n\nThe other question that has dogged Trump's pardons is whether he is seeking to send a signal to former aides who are now feeling the heat from Mueller's investigation into allegations of collusion with Russia. Some theorize that Trump is displaying his willingness to issue pardons to discourage people from cooperating with Mueller. However, there is no hard evidence to support this theory.\n\nObservers across the political spectrum have raised the issue of whether Trump might have a bias in favor of celebrities or celebrity-backed causes over more anonymous figures. The Jack Johnson pardon was prominently backed by actor and director Sylvester Stallone. Trump told reporters on Thursday that he did not know D'Souza personally but \"I read the papers, I see him on television.\"\n\nThe pardon of D'Souza came the day after Trump received an Oval Office visit from Kim Kardashian, who is advocating for prison reform and a pardon for Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old woman serving a life sentence for drug offenses. \"The narrative may build that he's only focused on famous people,\" said Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak. \"Often, famous people have the best legal defense money can buy, and others don't have that opportunity.\"\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley pushed back on suggestions that the president was mostly focused on celebrity pardons when he spoke to reporters on board Air Force One on Thursday. \"Look, there are plenty of people the president is looking at right now under the pardon process,\" Gidley said.\n\nHowever, the fact that Trump has tended to issue pardons without going through the usual process of review at the DOJ concerns some skeptics. While they acknowledge that a president has expansive power to pardon, they worry about Trump's propensity to flout norms. \"There is a process set up for pardoning people and he is ignoring it,\" Gilbert said. \"I am not saying he is running afoul of the Constitution. But this is off-the-cuff, and he is doing things that a DOJ that he is simultaneously attacking might not be that into.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the reverberations from the decision to pardon D'Souza will continue to be felt. Late Thursday, the lead prosecutor in his case, Carrie H. Cohen, released a statement plainly critical of Trump's decision.",
    " Title: Pennsylvania Special Election Results: Three Key Takeaways from the PA-18 Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, Democrat Conor Lamb has likely won by a thin margin, marking a significant loss for the Republican Party. The final tally is pending a possible recount, but the outcome, even if it changes, indicates a challenging outlook for the GOP in the upcoming November midterm elections. Here are three key takeaways from Tuesday's results:\n\n1. The GOP should be concerned about November:\n   - The historical trend of midterm elections working against the president's party cannot be ignored.\n   - The president's approval rating is in the low 40s, which is not favorable, especially given the strong economy.\n   - In the past, this district had been a relatively safe Republican seat, but the close race indicates a potential shift in voter sentiment.\n\n2. Candidates matter:\n   - The underwhelming performance of Republican candidate Rick Saccone, who was not a strong campaigner, fundraiser, or grassroots mobilizer, may have contributed to the loss.\n   - Democrat Conor Lamb's robust fundraising and retail politics skills, as well as his moderate stance on several issues, proved to be a potent combination.\n\n3. More Democrats will attempt to neutralize the Pelosi Factor:\n   - The Lamb campaign's decision to publicly oppose Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader was effective in distancing him from the unpopular San Francisco liberal, a key element of the GOP's attack strategy.\n   - More Democrats in purple-to-red districts are expected to follow suit, as the inability to take a clean hit at Pelosi hurt Republicans in PA-18.\n\nThese findings suggest that the political landscape may be shifting, with the opposition party feeling increasingly optimistic about their chances to gain a significant number of seats in the upcoming midterm elections. The economy's strong performance and the tax law's popularity may not be enough to counteract the president's low approval rating and the intensity gap between the two parties.",
    " Title: House Republican Announces Imminent Release of Alleged Surveillance Abuses Memo\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Dave Joyce (R-Ohio) announced on Saturday that the House Intelligence Committee plans to begin the process of releasing a memo detailing alleged government surveillance abuses \"very soon,\" if not immediately. The release process could take up to 19 congressional working days, which, according to the House's 2018 calendar, means the earliest the document could be released is sometime in mid-March.\n\nThe memo, which has been highly classified, alleges that the Obama administration unlawfully used the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) to spy on the Trump campaign and transition. This claim has been repeatedly denied by former administration officials. The alleged evidence in the memo has led numerous GOP congressmen to demand its public release, with some suggesting it could potentially end the special counsel Robert Mueller's Trump-Russia investigation and lead to the dismissal of senior FBI and CIA officials.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who is leading the push for the memo's release, said on Fox News Saturday that the memo will \"shock the conscience of this country.\" He added, \"There are four pages of a memorandum prepared by the intelligence committee that will shock the conscience of this country when it comes to the horrific abuses that occurred during the last administration and that I believe continue to pose a threat to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\"\n\nBefore the memo can be released, it must undergo review by federal records reviewers due to its highly classified nature, and it must receive multiple levels of approval. On Thursday, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained on Fox News that the document's release would first need approval from the House Intelligence Committee and then President Donald Trump would have to give it the green light.",
    " Title: John Conyers and Nancy Pelosi's Response to Sexual Misconduct Allegations Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on NBC's Meet the Press, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) sparked controversy by advocating for \"due process\" for Representative John Conyers (D-MI) amidst a series of sexual misconduct allegations. This stance has been met with criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, with many viewing it as a double standard in the handling of sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nPelosi's defense of Conyers has been criticized by those who believe she is protecting members of the political establishment, while at the same time insisting that allegations against President Trump and Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore are grounds for their disqualification. Pelosi has stated, \"We are strengthened by due process,\" when discussing Conyers, but has labeled Moore a \"child molester.\"\n\nThis stance has been met with backlash, particularly from Republicans who argue that the political establishment selectively applies standards of conduct to delegitimize and destroy their enemies while exempting their own. Many conservatives have used this perceived double standard as a justification for dismissing allegations of sexual abuse against Trump and Moore.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Pelosi's comments extends beyond the political sphere, as she is a vocal supporter of Title IX regulations, which have been used to dismantle due process for sexual assault allegations on college campuses. When Education Secretary Betsy DeVos introduced reforms to Title IX, Pelosi denounced them as \"outrageous, immoral attacks on Title IX protections\" and a \"shocking attack on women.\"\n\nIn response to the ongoing partisan hypocrisy, some have suggested a return to the concept of the \"original position,\" a thought experiment proposed by philosopher John Rawls. This thought experiment imagines individuals in a state of limbo, hidden behind a \"veil of ignorance,\" with no knowledge of their future identity or circumstances. The goal is to consider what fair rules for society would look like if one were to be born into any number of possible circumstances.\n\nThe original position is intended to encourage a focus on fairness and equality, as individuals would be forced to consider the potential impact of rules on all members of society, regardless of their own identity or circumstances. In a time marked by tribalism and identity politics, the original position offers a potential way out of the current political impasse, by encouraging a focus on fairness and equality for all, rather than favoring one's own tribe.",
    " Title: Obama Urges House Republicans to Pass \"Clean\" Spending Bill to End Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama, in his weekly radio and internet address on Saturday, called on House Republicans to immediately pass a \"clean\" spending bill to end the ongoing federal government shutdown, now in its second week. The President read two letters he received from individuals affected by the shutdown, highlighting the real-world consequences of the impasse in Washington.\n\nAn Alabama woman shared her story of a closed Head Start agency, while a North Dakota family was cited as being in danger of losing their federal home loan due to the government closure. The President's strategy aims to pressure Congress to act.\n\n\"There's only one way out of this reckless and damaging shutdown: pass a budget that funds our government, with no partisan strings attached,\" Obama said. \"There are enough Republican and Democratic votes in the House of Representatives...to end this shutdown immediately. But the far right of the Republican party won't let Speaker John Boehner give that bill a yes-or-no vote.\"\n\nThe White House has been attempting to create a rift among House Republicans, pitting moderate members against their tea party counterparts. The administration argues that a \"clean\" spending bill, one that doesn't include measures to repeal, delay, or defund Obamacare, could pass the House with bipartisan support.\n\nHowever, Speaker Boehner has yet to allow such a bill to come up for a vote. As the shutdown crisis, the first in 17 years, continues, the President has escalated his rhetoric.\n\n\"The American people don't get to demand ransom in exchange for doing their job. Neither does Congress,\" Obama said. \"They don't get to hold our democracy or our economy hostage over a settled law.\"\n\nWith the shutdown ongoing, the President is also looking ahead to the expected U.S. reaching its \"debt ceiling\" in late October or early November. Analysts predict the economic damage from a default will be worse than the current shutdown.\n\n\"For as reckless as a government shutdown is, an economic shutdown that comes with default would be dramatically worse,\" Obama said.",
    " Title: Diverse Interpretations of Martin Luther King Jr.'s Legacy on the 50th Anniversary of His March on Washington\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic march on Washington has sparked a multitude of events and discussions, with various groups using the occasion to advocate for their respective causes. From gun control to D.C. statehood, the Republican National Committee's outreach to African-Americans, and economic rights, the anniversary has become a platform for a wide range of issues.\n\nThe commemorations began on Saturday with a march retracing the 1963 route, and will continue on Wednesday with speeches at the Lincoln Memorial. The anniversary, however, has also exposed disagreement over the interpretation of King's legacy and the meaning of continuing his movement.\n\nMartin Luther King III, the civil rights leader's oldest living child, expressed that he is not concerned about the dilution of his father's core message. Instead, he aims to \"arouse a new coalition of conscience\" that can counter the energy of the tea party movement. King III attributes the recent Supreme Court ruling dismantling a key part of the Voting Rights Act, rising income inequality, and the Trayvon Martin shooting as reminders of the need for continued activism.\n\nAlveda King, Martin Luther King Jr.'s niece, has expressed concern that tying specific social causes to her uncle diminishes his overarching significance. She emphasizes that her uncle was \"an imperfect human who served a perfect God\" and wants the celebrations to focus on a unifying message of love.\n\nOne contentious issue is the debate over whether King would have embraced gay marriage as the next frontier for civil rights. The gay community has closely aligned itself with the tributes, with multiple events honoring Bayard Rustin, who was openly gay and helped organize the 1963 march. A coalition of over 40 groups signed an open letter calling for \"clear federal laws barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama endorsed gay marriage last year, and the NAACP followed suit shortly after. However, many African-Americans still oppose gay marriage. Grammy-winning gospel singer Donnie McClurkin was uninvited from a concert at the King Memorial after a few activists complained about his past comments regarding homosexuality. McClurkin described the incident as \"bullying...discrimination...intolerance,\" and a \"civil rights infringement.\"\n\nKing himself never spoke out firmly for or against gays. The Supreme Court did not even strike down laws banning interracial marriage until 1967. Coretta Scott King, King's wife, stated before her death that she believed her husband would have supported gay rights.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders' Millionaire Status and the Fox News Town Hall\n\nArticle:\n\nBernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist and a millionaire, has faced criticism from some quarters for his wealth despite his political ideology. However, his supporters argue that his millionaire status does not diminish the potency of his ideas and policy proposals. The recent Fox News town hall was considered a success by Sanders' camp, with the candidate focusing on issues affecting the working class and offering policy solutions.\n\nSanders' critique of wealth accumulation in the hands of a small elite is rooted in the disproportionate political power wielded by the super-rich, who fund campaigns and lobby politicians. Sanders' campaign, which is funded by small donors, does not seem to contradict this argument, as he has not amassed his wealth through such means.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the wealth of politicians and ex-politicians, particularly their methods of capitalizing on their fame, is a point of contention. For instance, the practice of giving speeches at big Wall Street banks is criticized for potential corruption, with bankers allegedly paying for access to potential future senators and presidents.\n\nA minority view suggests that Sanders is not a hypocrite due to his genuine disdain for charity and the belief that the wealthy should use their resources to alleviate social evils. However, critics argue that the wealthy, with their resources, could significantly improve living conditions for many, making the choice not to do so questionable.\n\nRegarding the Fox News town hall, it was praised for Sanders' ability to rally a majority of Americans, offering a contrast to President Trump's right-populism and a potential formula for winning an election.\n\nIn a separate development, a summary of a call between President Trump and Ukraine's president has raised concerns about potential wrongdoing. The call, which reportedly shows Trump using his conversation to pursue unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and engaging in a quid pro quo, is being investigated for potential impeachable offenses. Trump's defenders argue that the evidence is circumstantial, but experts suggest that circumstantial evidence can be strong evidence and can be used to prove a criminal exchange. The focus of the investigation will be on the context and circumstances surrounding the call.",
    " Title: East Coast Storm Disrupts Political Campaigns, Virginia Governor Plans to Keep Voting Machines Running\n\nArticle:\n\nThe approach of a significant storm along the East Coast has led to the cancellation of political campaign events. The unpredictable weather conditions have left even seasoned political strategists uncertain about the impact on the final week of the campaign.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, in response to the potential disaster, has canceled his campaign trips to the swing states of Florida and Colorado. He has moved to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to be seen as a president actively engaged in emergency response efforts.\n\n\"It's so important for us to respond big and respond fast as local information starts coming in,\" President Obama said at FEMA.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has also canceled appearances in the weather-threatened swing state of Virginia, as well as the president, to avoid consuming resources and to not interfere with storm preparations.\n\nVirginia Governor Bob McDonnell has stated that the state board of elections is already planning for extended hours for absentee voting and prioritizing power restoration for voting facilities, moving them to the same level as hospitals and police stations.\n\nIn states where polls are already open, such as Maryland, early voting has been canceled for Monday. The impact of these weather-induced pauses on the election campaigns remains uncertain.\n\nDavid Axelrod, senior adviser to President Obama, expressed concern about the potential difficulties in accessing the polls, stating, \"Obviously we want unfettered access to the polls because we believe that the more people come out, the better we'll do, and so to the extent that it makes it harder, you know, that's a source of concern.\"\n\nThe Romney-Ryan ticket, not in power, is limited in their ability to respond but still needs to remain attentive. Romney has expressed concern for those in the path of the storm and has taken steps such as stopping fundraising emails in affected states, making a campaign bus available for relief efforts, and setting up a blog with weather-related advice.\n\nThe Romney campaign is also monitoring the situation closely, with a top Republican noting that the schedule may change based on the storm's progression. Mixing politics and weather is a complex situation, as one can never predict the exact impact of a natural disaster on campaigning.",
    " Title: Barnum's Animal Crackers Reimagines Packaging, Depicts Animals in Natural Habitat\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move towards cultural evolution and animal rights awareness, the packaging for Barnum's Animal Crackers has undergone a significant transformation. For over a century, the iconic box depicted lions, tigers, and bears confined within a circus boxcar. However, this imagery is now a thing of the past, as the animals are now shown in their natural habitats.\n\nKimberly Fontes, a spokeswoman for Mondelez International, the parent company of Nabisco, explained the decision, stating, \"To continue to make the brand relevant for years to come, we felt this was the right time for the next evolution in our design.\" The new design depicts the animals standing shoulder to shoulder, proudly walking in the wild. The packaging reads, \"NEW LOOK, Same Great Taste!\"\n\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) had long advocated for a change in the design. The group has been opposed to the use of animals in circuses for decades, as reported by NPR. Last year, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus announced its closure after nearly 150 years due to pressure from animal rights groups and declining ticket sales.\n\nIn 2015, the circus made the decision to stop using elephants in its shows, one of the reasons the company believed attendance was dropping. For PETA, the new box design signifies a cultural shift. \"Big victories can come in small packages,\" PETA said in a statement, \"and no matter where we look, we find new evidence that people are embracing compassion for animals like never before.\"\n\nPETA participated in discussions with the company regarding the redesign and praised the new box design, stating, \"The new box for Barnum's Animals perfectly reflects that our society no longer tolerates caging and chaining exotic animals for circus shows.\" The group further added, \"No living being exists simply to be a spectacle or to perform tricks for human entertainment, yet all circuses and traveling shows that use animals treat them as mere props, denying them everything that's natural and important to them.\"\n\nMondelez International has previously used its classic design to drive awareness around key animal and environmental issues, as noted by The Associated Press. Examples of these \"limited-time special editions\" include packaging that featured endangered species and encouraged conservation efforts.",
    " Title: House Rules Committee Finds Speaker Pelosi's Criticism of President Trump Violates Chamber's Rules\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House of Representatives ruled on Tuesday that Speaker Nancy Pelosi's criticism of President Trump violated the chamber's rules. The ruling came in a 232-190 vote, with members choosing to keep her words in the official record. The House also allowed Pelosi to continue debating on the House floor in a 231-190 vote.\n\nMajority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, who took over the gavel to make the announcement, stated that Pelosi's words contained an accusation of racist behavior on the part of the president. He said, \"The words used by the gentlewoman from California contained an accusation of racist behavior on the part of the president. The words should not be used in debate.\"\n\nPelosi, the top-ranking House Democrat, had previously called President Trump's comments about four freshman congresswomen\u2014Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan\u2014\"divisive and dangerous\" to the country.\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy stated that Pelosi could have just taken back her words and apologized. \"What we just saw was a very sad day in this House\u2014probably a historic day\u2014so the very person who is supposed to uphold the rules broke the rules of the House,\" the California Republican told reporters.\n\nFollowing the vote, Pelosi told reporters that she stood by her statement. \"I'm proud of the attention that is being called to it because what the president said was completely inappropriate against our colleagues, but not just against them, but against so many people in our country to say, 'Go back where you came from,'\" the California Democrat said.\n\nThe rules, which trace back to Thomas Jefferson's writings, allow members to criticize the government or the president on the House floor in an official capacity, but they are prohibited from using language that is \"personally offensive\" to the president. For example, lawmakers cannot call the president a liar or hypocrite.\n\nOn the matter of racial rhetoric, Jefferson's Manual explicitly states that any reference to \"racial or other discrimination on the Part of the President\" is not allowed. According to the Congressional Research Service, Pelosi could be punished by being barred from speaking on the floor for the rest of the day. Several other warnings about this rule, which also extends to other members of Congress, had to be issued throughout the debate.\n\nHowever, earlier Tuesday, Hoyer argued that the resolution itself wouldn't cross any lines because the criticism was aimed at tweets, not the president. \"We're condemning the language that was used, not the president himself,\" he said.\n\nRep. Emanuel Cleaver, who was serving as chairman, stepped down out of frustration. \"Unfairness is not enough because we want to just fight,\" the Missouri Democrat said before dropping the gavel. Cleaver continued to express his frustration with reporters after the vote, saying he was trying to be fair and not escalate complaints from either side of the aisle.",
    " Title: Sen. Rand Paul to Attend President Obama's Promise Zone Announcement\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Rand Paul (R-Ky.), known for his frequent disagreements with President Obama, is among a bipartisan group of senators expected to attend the president's announcement on Thursday regarding the designation of \"Promise Zones\" to aid communities in addressing poverty.\n\nPaul is also anticipated to join Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other lawmakers in a private meeting with the president at the White House prior to the announcement, an aide for Paul confirmed to Fox News.\n\nThough Paul's presence may seem unexpected, the conservative senator recently introduced separate legislation to establish \"economic freedom zones\" in struggling cities like Detroit, where taxes and bureaucratic hurdles would be reduced to foster growth.\n\nIn response to the announcement, Paul told Fox News, \"They say the sincerest form of flattery is imitation,\" confirming his attendance at the White House on Thursday. However, he questioned why the president's plan does not include Detroit, as his does.\n\nPresident Obama's announcement is part of a focus on income inequality in the lead-up to his State of the Union address. Promise Zones are areas where the federal government offers tax incentives and grants. Obama first announced the initiative during last year's State of the Union speech.\n\nAn eight-county region of southeastern Kentucky will be among five locations that Obama will announce this week as \"Promise Zones.\" The president's proposed zones also include San Antonio, Texas; Philadelphia; Los Angeles; and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma.\n\nThe Paul invitation could signal another Obama \"charm offensive\" to engage with Republicans, as he did early in 2013 in an attempt, unsuccessfully, to achieve a \"grand bargain\" budget deal.\n\nPaul, who has recently launched a class-action lawsuit against the administration over the National Security Agency's spying practices and has pressed Obama on various issues, including a filibuster over his drone policy, may prove an elusive legislative partner.\n\nSenator McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement Wednesday that he was pleased the Obama administration decided to include Eastern Kentucky in its promise zone designation.\n\n\"I wrote a letter last year supporting this designation because this region has suffered enormous economic hardship over the last several years,\" McConnell said. \"Thousands of jobs have been lost and economic opportunity is extremely limited, particularly because of this administration's hostile policies toward the coal industry.\"",
    " Title: White House Response to Global White Supremacy: A Closer Look at Trump Administration's Actions and Statements\n\nArticle:\n\nLast Friday, a reporter at the White House asked President Donald Trump if he believed that white nationalism was a growing threat around the world. Trump responded, \"I don't, really. I think it's a small group of people.\" This statement came after a gunman killed 50 Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the White House advisor Kellyanne Conway dismissed the alleged shooter's murderous racism, labeling him an \"eco-terrorist.\"\n\nTwo days later, the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, appeared on Fox News Sunday. Chris Wallace, the host, asked Mulvaney if the president \"had considered giving a major speech condemning anti-Muslim, white supremacist bigotry.\" Mulvaney responded, \"The president is not a white supremacist.\"\n\nDespite these denials, the president's record speaks louder than any words. Trump may try to evade the issue, but the fact remains that a dangerous and global white supremacy is on the march, and Trump himself is at least partly to blame.\n\nIn January 2017, a man stormed a mosque in Quebec City and shot six people dead while they prayed. An ardent Trump supporter, the man said he was afraid that refugees coming to Canada were a threat to him and his family. The New Zealand shooter scrawled the Quebec City shooter's name on one of his ammunition cartridges and directly applauded Trump in his own manifesto.\n\nAccording to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), far-right attacks in Europe have jumped 43% between 2016 and 2017. On the domestic front, the rise is even more disturbing. According to CSIS, the number of terrorist attacks by far-right perpetrators in the United States more than quadrupled between 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe intimate connections between the president and white nationalists are well known. In 2017, the president refused to condemn the white nationalists who marched through the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, screaming such disgusting nonsense as \"Jews will not replace us.\" Heather Heyer, a counter-protester, was also killed during the rally. Days later, the president defended the marchers and claimed that there were \"some very fine people on both sides\" of that rally.\n\nIn 2015, Trump stated, \"I think Islam hates us\" during a CNN interview while on the campaign trail. The number of organized anti-Muslim hate groups nearly tripled in 2017, a rise that the Southern Poverty Law Center credited in part to the \"incendiary rhetoric\" of Trump.\n\nHate crimes generally have risen precipitously since Trump appeared on the national political stage. Nationwide, hate crimes across the board rose by 17% in 2017, according to FBI statistics, the third year in a row to see an uptick (2018 numbers are not yet available).\n\nThe president's actions and statements have been criticized for emboldening a racist and extremist fringe. Trump's political responsibility for the rise in white supremacy and hate crimes is a matter of debate, but his words and actions have been closely linked to these incidents. The president sets the national tone for what is permissible speech and impermissible speech in the political arena. Trump, on the other hand, merely revels in the impermissible.",

    " Title: Trump's Decision to Withdraw U.S. Troops from Syria Stuns Turkey, Leaves Middle East in Flux\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's announcement during a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that he was withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria has left Turkey scrambling to respond to the changing battlefield on its southern border. In the phone call two weeks ago, Trump was expected to deliver a standard warning to Erdogan over his plan to launch a cross-border attack targeting U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northeast Syria, according to U.S. officials. Instead, Trump reshaped U.S. policy in the Middle East, abandoning a quarter of Syrian territory and handing Ankara the job of finishing off Islamic State in Syria.\n\nIn the Dec. 14 call between the two leaders, Trump asked, \"If we withdraw our soldiers, can you clean up ISIS?\" Erdogan replied that Turkish forces were capable of the task. \"Then you do it,\" Trump responded abruptly. To his national security adviser John Bolton, also on the call, Trump said, \"Start work for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria.\"\n\nTurkish officials described the decision as \"unexpected\" and \"a shock.\" The U.S. withdrawal potentially frees Turkey's military to push the Kurdish YPG militia back from 500 km of border without risking a confrontation with American forces. However, it also opens up an area of Syria far larger than anything Turkey had expected to fill, potentially pitting it against not just Kurdish forces but also the Damascus government, which is committed to regaining control of all of Syria, and its Russian and Iranian backers.\n\nThe YPG, on Friday, asked the Syrian government to take over the town of Manbij, which the Kurdish militia currently controls with U.S. support, to protect it from Turkish attack. If Turkish forces are to take on Islamic State in its last pocket of Syrian territory near the Iraqi border, they would first have to cross 250 km of territory controlled by the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nAs it takes stock of the new challenge, Turkey is launching intensive talks with Washington and Moscow. Ankara expects U.S. military officials to visit within days, as well as Bolton and possibly the U.S. special Syria envoy, James Jeffrey. Turkey's intelligence chief and defense and foreign ministers are also due in Moscow on Saturday.\n\nWashington is also grappling with what to do with weapons it provided to the YPG militia and promised to take back after the campaign against Islamic State ended. Turkey says the weapons must be collected so they are not used against Turkish troops, but U.S. officials say they cannot disarm their own allies when the fight is not yet over.\n\nErdogan announced last week that Turkey is postponing its planned military operation against the YPG in light of Trump's decision. The Turkish military has already carried out two incursions into northern Syria, backed by pro-Turkey Syrian rebels. In 2016, they targeted Islamic State and Kurdish fighters, and earlier this year took control of the YPG-held Afrin region. However, Ankara and its Syrian rebel allies alone do not have the capacity to take over the whole region which the United States is abandoning. Turkey's priority, therefore, may be to secure its southern frontier.",

Hodgkinson\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking incident, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) was shot and wounded during a congressional baseball practice in Northern Virginia on Wednesday morning. Scalise, who is the third-highest-ranking House Republican, was hit in the hip and underwent surgery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, where he remains in critical condition.\n\nFour others, including a congressional staffer, a lobbyist, and two members of the Capitol Police, were also injured in the attack. The shooter, identified as James T. Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old man from Illinois, was taken to a hospital after being shot by police during the attack and died of multiple gunshot wounds to the torso on Wednesday.\n\nThe shooting occurred during an early morning practice for an annual charity baseball game near Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria, Virginia. The game, a partisan match between Democratic and Republican lawmakers, had been scheduled for Thursday evening.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, Scalise remains in intensive care, and his condition is described as \"critical\" by Dr. Jack Sava of MedStar. Sava said that Scalise will \"hopefully\" be able to walk and run again at some point in the future, but there isn't yet a timetable for his recovery.\n\nThe FBI and the Alexandria Police Department are actively investigating Hodgkinson, including his associates, whereabouts, social media impressions, and potential motivations. The ATF is also running a trace on two weapons, including a 9 mm handgun and a 7.62 caliber rifle, according to Capitol Police.\n\nThe FBI and Alexandria Police released the following account of the incident: At approximately 7:09 a.m. on June 14, the Alexandria Police Department responded to the scene at 400 East Monroe Avenue in Alexandria, Virginia. They arrived at 7:12 a.m. to shots fired in the vicinity of Eugene Simpson Stadium Park, where members of a congressional baseball team were practicing. Multiple members of Congress were present on the scene, resulting in United States Capitol Police officers also being on the scene. The subject was engaged by law enforcement and shot at approximately 7:14 a.m. Five individuals were transported by Alexandria EMS, Arlington County EMS, and U.S. Park Police helicopter to local hospitals with gunshot wounds. Those transported include a United States Capitol Police officer who is hospitalized and is reported to be in stable condition, a congressman, one congressional staffer, one lobbyist, and the subject. A second congressman sustained minor injuries and was also transported by a medic unit. One additional United States Capitol Police officer was transported to the hospital in a police cruiser for minor injuries and has been released.\n\nThe suspect, Hodgkinson, was taken to a hospital but died of his injuries on Wednesday morning, according to President Donald Trump and the FBI.\n\nRep. Mo Brooks (R-AL), who was at the scene, used his belt as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding from an unidentified victim, Brooks said on CNN. Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), who is a doctor, also tended to Scalise, Wenstrup told CBS News.\n\nZachary Barth, a staffer for Rep. Roger Williams (R-TX), posted on Facebook that he was among those shot but is \"at the hospital and okay.\" Matt Mika, a lobbyist who is the director of government relations for Tyson Foods, was also shot in the attack, according to a Tyson Foods statement (and reported by NBC).\n\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) identified Special Agent David Bailey and Special Agent Crystal Griner, both of Capitol Police, as other victims of the attack.\n\nFive people, including the gunman, were transported to local hospitals, according to Alexandria Police Chief Michael Brown. George Washington University Hospital received two victims from the Alexandria shooting, both of whom were in critical condition as of Wednesday morning, according to Susan Griffiths, assistant director of marketing and public relations for the hospital. The hospital would not identify the patients, and it's not clear whether one of them was the shooter (who has since died) or whether they were both victims.\n\nSpecial Agent Crystal Griner is also at MedStar Washington and is in good condition as of Friday afternoon, according to the hospital.\n\nPolice received a call reporting the shooting at around 7:09 am and arrived three minutes later, according to Brown. Brooks said he heard about 50 shots.\n\nTwo Alexandria police officers exchanged gunfire with the shooter, according to Alexandria Police Chief Michael Brown. Two Capitol Police officers, who were already at the scene with members of Congress, also exchanged gunfire with the shooter, according to Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa.\n\nThe FBI took over the investigation, said Tim Slater, the special agent in charge of the bureau's Washington field office. \"It's too early to tell\" the motive of the shooter, he said during a press briefing, adding that he does not believe it was an assassination attempt.\n\nEyewitnesses, including Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Flake, said that the officers were members of the Capitol Police force, which is specifically charged to protect Capitol Hill and individual members of the House and Senate leadership. \"Had [Capitol Police] not been there, it would have been a massacre,\" who was at the scene said on MSNBC after the shooting.\n\nRep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) said in a Facebook post that he saw the shooter before the attack and plans to give a statement to police.

This provision allows law enforcement officers to question the immigration status of individuals they have reasonable grounds to suspect are in the country illegally and report their identities to federal authorities.\n\nThe law, signed by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer in 2010, had four main components. Three sections setting up state criminal penalties for immigration violations were struck down in the ruling. Justice Elena Kagan recused herself from the case.\n\nPresident Obama and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., among others, had previously expressed concerns that the provision would lead to racial profiling. However, the Supreme Court's unanimous decision upheld this very provision, stating that it would provide police an opportunity to enforce the law without violating civil rights, given the uncertainty about the law's interpretation and enforcement.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority, stating, \"There is a basic uncertainty about what the law means and how it will be enforced. At this stage, without the benefit of a definitive interpretation from the state courts, it would be inappropriate to assume [that section] will be construed in a way that creates a conflict with federal law.\"\n\nIn 2010, when Arizona enacted the law, both Mr. Obama and Mr. Holder expressed their concerns about racial profiling. Mr. Obama stated, \"Now suddenly if you don't have your papers and you take your kid out for ice cream and you're going to be harassed\u2014that's not the right way to go.\" Mr. Holder testified to Congress that he believed the law would lead to racial profiling, although he had not yet read the law at the time.\n\nHowever, when the Justice Department filed its lawsuit challenging the law, it did not include the racial profiling argument, instead focusing on issues of federal versus state power over immigration. Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli stated during oral arguments in April, \"We're not making any allegation about racial or ethnic profiling in the case.\"\n\nRep. Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who has emerged as a top voice for legalizing illegal immigrants, expressed concerns about racial profiling, stating, \"Experience has shown us that police are highly unlikely to stop an individual with the last name of Kennedy or Roberts on suspicion of not being a legal U.S. citizen, but if you are a Gutierrez or Martinez, watch out.\"\n\nIn response, Mr. Holder stated his lawyers would closely monitor how Arizona and other states enforce these kinds of immigration status checks to ensure they do not discriminate against the Latino or any other community. The Supreme Court left open the possibility for further challenges if the law becomes discriminatory.\n\nThe court also expressed concerns about the potential for the law to unconstitutionally prolong the amount of time an officer detained someone during the status checks. However, the court acknowledged the possibility that the law could be implemented fairly.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Ms. Brewer stated, \"Our critics are already preparing new litigation tactics in response to their loss at the Supreme Court, and undoubtedly will allege inequities in the implementation of the law. As I said two years ago on the day I signed SB 1070 into law, 'We can not give them that chance. We must use this new tool wisely, and fight for our safety with the honor Arizona deserves.'\"",
    " Title: Reflection on the Iraq War: A Decade of Conflict and Its Aftermath\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States' involvement in Iraq, which spanned over eight years, has come to be regarded as one of the longest wars in American history. The war, initiated under the pretext of destroying weapons of mass destruction, has resulted in thousands of American casualties, tens of thousands of wounded, and trillions of dollars in expenditure. The war's aftermath, however, has left little to show for these significant losses.\n\nThe primary reason for the war's failure, according to the article, is the fundamental cultural and societal differences between the Middle East and the West. The article argues that the Middle East perceives war as the default state, while peace is a temporary state that occurs between wars. In contrast, the West views peace as the norm, with war being a temporary state that occurs when peace fails.\n\nThe article highlights the Iraq War's missteps, starting with the questionable intelligence that led to the invasion. The war was initially won, but the peace-building process failed, leading to a resurgence of insurgency and the reemergence of Al-Qaeda in cities like Fallujah. The predominantly Shiite Iraqi government has vowed to retake the city, but the possibility of another civil war between Shiite and Sunni Arabs looms large.\n\nThe article emphasizes that the military's performance during the war was heroic, but it was the political leaders who failed the nation. The Iraq War was marked by tragic missteps, including the failure to anticipate the insurgency, the attempt to build a new democratic Iraqi state in the image of the West, and the premature withdrawal of American forces, leaving a fragile Iraq that was not ready to stand on its own.\n\nThe article concludes by acknowledging the tragic nature of the Iraq War but expresses optimism for the future. The author suggests that the United States will recover from the Iraq War, as it did from the failures of Vietnam, and will once again lead the world in the Energy Age. The hope is that the United States will learn from its mistakes and approach future conflicts more soberly, shrewdly, and strategically.",
    " Title: Business Groups Lobby for TPP Approval Amidst Political Divide\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing political divide, business groups have launched a national effort to lobby for the approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade agreement spearheaded by former President Barack Obama. This push comes as both major political parties have expressed opposition to the deal during their respective party conventions.\n\nCaterpillar Inc., a leading manufacturer, has hosted lawmakers such as Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen of Minnesota at its factories. These meetings aim to demonstrate the positive impact of the TPP on the company's workers.\n\nTrade Benefits America, a leading business coalition, is coordinating a grassroots advertising campaign, sending approximately 60 to 70 pro-TPP letters to members of Congress daily. The Association of Equipment Manufacturers is also actively promoting the agreement through a truck tour across the Midwest, featuring interactive displays on trade. Additionally, they are running digital ads in key Senate races to highlight candidates' trade positions.\n\nKevin Madden, a strategist working with the Trade Benefits America coalition, emphasized the importance of these face-to-face interactions: \"When you see trade, when it's just a sign being waved on a convention floor... that's one thing. But when it's somebody who has a small- or medium-size enterprise in your local economy, who is directly responsible for the employment of people whose jobs are tied to exporting... that has an impact on lawmakers, and that's important.\"\n\nLeading supporters of the TPP remain optimistic, insisting that the agreement still has a chance of approval later this year despite opposition from both major-party presidential candidates and a majority of Democratic leadership outside of the White House. They point to opinion polls showing a majority of Americans support free trade and argue that the back-to-back party conventions have merely amplified a few anti-TPP voices that do not fully understand the agreement's facts.\n\nProponents of the TPP believe the issue could make it onto the crowded legislative agenda during the lame-duck period after the election. They are hoping to address the remaining concerns, such as protections for biologic drug firms and tobacco companies, in a similar manner to the financial services companies' issue, which was largely settled before the Republican convention.\n\nIf the administration can duplicate this success with the outstanding issues, it should still be possible to gather enough votes to pass the agreement, despite the challenging political environment, according to Bill Miller, a senior vice president in charge of lobbying operations at the Business Roundtable. Linda Dempsey, vice president of international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers, echoed this sentiment, stating, \"It's not going to be easy, but it's certainly doable.\"\n\nLobbying groups are employing various strategies to connect with lawmakers, including writing op-eds, attending town halls, and flooding congressional offices with handwritten letters from company employees. John Michael Gonzalez, a Democratic lobbyist and strategist who works on trade, expressed optimism, stating, \"From my experience, it always looks so bleak. But it always prevails. At the end of the day, our government and our elected officials move forward, not backwards.\"\n\nSome groups are taking advantage of the summer recess to show lawmakers the importance of trade deals on their home turf. For instance, the agriculture community is using summer fairs to demonstrate the significance of trade deals. In mid-September, executives from the footwear industry plan to meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to emphasize the importance of the TPP, despite the negative rhetoric surrounding it.\n\nMatt Priest, president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America trade association, described the upcoming meetings as an \"all-hands-on-deck moment.\" He added, \"We can not leave any stone unturned, any email not sent or call not made.\"",
    " Title: Court of Military Commission Review Overturns Conviction of Guant\u00e1namo Detainee\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant ruling, the Court of Military Commission Review has overturned the conviction of a Guant\u00e1namo detainee, Ahmed al-Darbi, who was accused of being part of Al Qaeda but not of plotting any specific terrorist attack. The decision, which was largely supported by three judges, including Judge Brett Kavanaugh, a former lawyer in the White House for President George W. Bush, has been hailed as a major blow to the legitimacy of the Guant\u00e1namo military commissions.\n\nAl-Darbi, a Yemeni national, traveled from Yemen to Pakistan and then Afghanistan in 1996. He attended a Qaeda training camp, met Osama Bin Laden, and became a driver carrying jihadis and their weapons. He eventually drove Bin Laden personally and was told by Bin Laden several days before Sept. 11, 2001, that they would have to evacuate their compound because of an impending operation that might provoke retaliation.\n\nAl-Darbi's legal journey began in 2001, after his capture in Afghanistan. He was sent to Guant\u00e1namo Bay soon after it opened in early 2002. His case proceeded slowly due to legal challenges to the Bush administration's new system of military commissions for terrorism suspects. He was charged with conspiracy as well as eight counts of material support in 2008. He was acquitted of the conspiracy charge, which might have produced a longer sentence. He was sentenced to 66 months of confinement and credited for having already served most of that time since being charged.\n\nThe verdict was a setback for the military prosecutors, who had contended that they could detain him indefinitely. Even after his release, he continued to challenge his conviction. The ruling was upheld in 2011 by the Court of Military Commission Review, but the Appeals Court has now reversed it.\n\nZachary Katznelson, senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the decision \"strikes the biggest blow yet against the legitimacy of the Guant\u00e1namo military commissions, which have for years now been trying people for a supposed war crime that in fact is not a war crime at all.\" He suggested that the government should prosecute in civilian courts any Guant\u00e1namo prisoners against whom it has enough admissible evidence.\n\nThe ruling calls into question whether other Guant\u00e1namo detainees accused of being part of Al Qaeda but not of plotting any specific terrorist attack can receive military trials. The decision is likely to have far-reaching implications for the future of the Guant\u00e1namo military commissions and the treatment of detainees.",
    " Title: Nationwide Commemorations Mark 50 Years Since JFK Assassination\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the United States commemorates the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's assassination, cities across the nation are hosting events to honor the late president. In Dallas, where the assassination occurred, a public event will take place on Friday, Dealey Plaza, the site of the tragic event.\n\nThe commemoration will feature Pulitzer Prize-winning presidential historian David McCullough, who will read excerpts from Kennedy's presidential speeches. The U.S. Naval Academy Men's Glee Club will perform, and religious leaders will offer prayers and a benediction. Approximately 5,000 tickets have been issued for this event.\n\nThe Texas Theatre in Dallas will offer a partial screening of the film \"War is Hell,\" which was being shown in the theater when Lee Harvey Oswald, Kennedy's killer, sneaked in after the assassination. The film will be shown at 1:20 p.m. on Friday, with approximately 40 minutes of the original film being shown due to its loss. Admission is 90 cents, the price of a ticket in 1963.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., the Newseum will host \"JFK Remembrance Day\" on Friday, featuring a rebroadcast of three hours of CBS News' live television coverage of the assassination. President Obama will give a speech at the Smithsonian American History Museum on Wednesday evening on Kennedy's legacy of service. On Friday, he will meet privately with leaders and volunteers from the Peace Corps, an organization Kennedy established in 1961.\n\nThe Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, where Kennedy's funeral took place, will host a Choral Mass of Remembrance on Friday. Arlington National Cemetery's eternal flame at Kennedy's grave site was restored last month and is open to the public, with large crowds expected over the anniversary weekend. President Obama will visit the grave on Wednesday, accompanied by First Lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton, and former First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nIn Brookline, Massachusetts, the John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site, the neighborhood and house where the president spent his childhood, will provide free admission to the public on Saturday and Sunday. A brief memorial ceremony will be held at the president's birthplace at 2 p.m. on Sunday, including a reading of President Lyndon Johnson's 1963 National Day of Mourning Proclamation and a wreath-laying.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy University in Pleasant Hill, California, the only university in the country with Kennedy's name, will hold a memorial on Friday, including an unveiling of a bust of Kennedy and the announcement of a project for students to honor the president's service legacy.\n\nIn Chicago, city and state flags will fly at half-staff on Friday, with a citywide moment of silence at 1 p.m, and church bells to toll to commemorate the assassination of the president. In Dearborn, Michigan, the 1961 Lincoln Continental that carried Kennedy through Dallas on the day he was assassinated is on permanent display at The Henry Ford Museum. The museum offers special programs this week, including sold-out events with newscaster Dan Rather, who covered the assassination, and former Secret Service agent Clint Hill, who was on duty that day in Dallas.\n\nKennedy's last official act as president took place in San Antonio, where he dedicated buildings at the Brooks Air Force Base School of Aerospace Medicine and gave his \"Cap over the Wall\" speech, one day before his death. Brooks City-Base will hold a commemorative event at the same place the president spoke at 2510 Kennedy Circle on Thursday at 2 p.m. The event is free and open to the public, with remarks by San Antonio Mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro and Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff. A commemorative video of the speech, along with historic photos, will also be presented.",
    " Title: Federal School Safety Commission Recommends Rescinding Discipline Guidance, Emphasizes Mental Health Services and Armed Personnel\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Commission on School Safety, established in response to the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, has concluded that a top recommendation to prevent mass shootings is to rescind policies protecting minority students from disproportionate discipline. The commission's nearly 200-page report, released on Tuesday, offers guidelines on school safety, mental health services, and the potential arming of \"highly trained school personnel\" in certain circumstances.\n\nThe report, which avoids discussing gun laws and does not recommend arming teachers, suggests that schools review their infrastructure security and, in some instances, have someone on school grounds armed with a firearm to collaborate with law enforcement. The commission also recommends increased coordination between schools and local law enforcement, hiring military veterans or retired law enforcement officers into school roles, and ensuring students have better access to mental health services at school.\n\nThe report encourages news outlets to be more responsible in their coverage of school shootings, suggesting they should not publish pictures of the perpetrator. The commission also recommends social and emotional learning for students, and suggests states consider adopting \"extreme risk protection orders\" that would temporarily withhold guns from those who pose a risk to themselves or others.\n\nPresident Trump hosted the commissioners and people affected by school shootings at the White House on Tuesday, with Trump calling the report \"a very important thing.\" The report has received mixed reactions from families affected by school shootings, with some praising its comprehensive approach to school safety, while others criticize the report for not addressing the role of guns in school shootings.\n\nAndy Pollack, whose daughter Meadow died in Parkland, called the report \"the most comprehensive report by any administration on a school shooting.\" Lori Alhadeff, the mother of 14-year-old Parkland victim Alyssa, praised the commission's findings, while Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime Guttenberg, 14, was killed in Parkland, expressed concern over the report's lack of discussion on the role of guns in school shootings.\n\nMark Barden, whose son Daniel was one of the 20 first-graders killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, issued a statement praising the report's emphasis on mental health services, but expressed concern over the commission's continued support for arming school personnel. Barden stated, \"We believe that teachers and school administrators should be focused on education, not weapons training.\"\n\nThe commission's report is a significant step in the ongoing national conversation on school safety, with many families affected by school shootings offering their perspectives on the report's recommendations. The report's ultimate impact on school safety policies remains to be seen.",
    " Title: ObamaCare Exchanges May Limit Access to Doctors, Analogized to Medicaid\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the enrollment for private health care coverage on the ObamaCare exchanges begins on January 1, analysts are warning that the plans may provide limited access to doctors and hospitals. This could potentially lead to a system that resembles Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans.\n\nMerrill Matthews, director of the Council for Affordable Health Insurance, stated, \"Indeed, I think this will eventually be like Medicaid.\" He explained that insurers may control costs by \"simply clamping down on the amount they are willing to pay.\"\n\nAnalysts warn that if payments get too low, many doctors might refuse to see patients, leaving more and more patients competing for fewer and fewer doctors. James Capretta, of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, noted, \"About half of the physicians in many communities refuse to take Medicaid patients because the payment system is just too low.\"\n\nDoug Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, suggested that some plans on the exchanges are heading in the same direction. He stated, \"If you look at something where you get a dollar by treating a private payer, you get about 70 cents out of Medicare for that same treatment, you get about 55 cents out of Medicaid for that, ObamCare started to look like Medicaid of the future, and in the Medicaid in the present, you can have the insurance but a doctor won't see you.\"\n\nBy the end of March, the Obama administration hopes to increase the number of people on Medicaid by 9 million, and the number in private plans by 7 million. New Medicaid enrollments have far outpaced enrollments in private plans on the exchanges. However, since Medicaid patients already have access to relatively few doctors, expanding that population while opening the door to lower payments for private insurance raises the prospect of rationing, as too many people chase too few doctors.\n\nRobert Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates, stated, \"These networks are going to be jammed with people. Far more than they're treating now, and I do not doubt that we're going to have problems with access to these doctors. There just aren't going to be enough of them.\"\n\nFor now, the Obama administration is trying to move past a year of some ups and many downs for its health care law and encourage people to sign up during the final three months of open enrollment. President Obama stated in his year-end press conference that enrollment has picked up considerably as problems with the federal exchange website have been addressed. \"The law is working: More than half a million Americans have enrolled through HealthCare.gov in the first three weeks of December alone -- and 800,000 more are on track to get Medicaid through their states,\" he said in an email message on Sunday. Obama continued to stress that the law is providing health insurance to those previously unable to get it. \"Now, thousands of Americans are signing up for coverage every day. That matters. It means financial security for families all across the country. It means freedom from the fear that one illness or accident might cost you everything you've worked so hard to build.\"",
    " Title: Biden's Focus Shifts to Trump as Sanders Chapter Closes in Democratic Race\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, in a speech in Henderson, Nevada on February 14, 2020, emphasized the need to replace President Donald Trump as the unifying message for his potential voters. Despite Biden's decisive victory in the February 19 debate, further debates within the Democratic Party may be canceled, and Biden does not need to engage with his opponents anymore, according to the article.\n\nThe article suggests that Biden's strategy of limited speaking time in previous debates, which was intended to minimize gaffes and Bidenisms, worked against Senator Bernie Sanders during their one-on-one matchup. Sanders' disciplined and focused performance in earlier debates appeared repetitive and canned in the one-on-one format, with Sanders seeming older and less energetic compared to Biden for the first 45 minutes.\n\nThe article criticizes the debate as being uninspiring and filled with senatorial arguments that resembled a dispute over restaurant tips. The author also notes that Biden does not need to engage with Sanders anymore, as Sanders has become a single-issue candidate after losing the Super Tuesday primary.\n\nThe article criticizes Sanders for his response to the coronavirus pandemic, stating that his emphasis on the weaknesses of the current healthcare system and his attacks on the \"health-care industry\" were ill-timed and tone-deaf during a public-health emergency. The article also criticizes Sanders for using the economic consequences of the pandemic as an opportunity to replay his message on income inequality, arguing that voters want more immediate and practical solutions rather than ideological debates.\n\nThe article suggests that Biden's focus on replacing Trump is the unifying message for his potential voters, and that letting Sanders pull him to the left would be a mistake. The author argues that Biden should use every opportunity to turn the question to the imperative of replacing Trump, rather than engaging in debates about the direction of the Democratic Party. The article concludes by stating that the Sanders chapter is over, and the general election has begun.",
    " Title: Trump Announces Increased Tariffs on Turkish Steel and Aluminum\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Friday that he would increase tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Turkey, citing the depreciation of the Turkish Lira against the U.S. dollar. The new tariffs will see aluminum duties rise to 20 percent and steel to 50 percent.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Trump stated, \"I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar!\" He added, \"Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!\"\n\nThe tariff threat comes less than a week after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Turkish officials over the imprisonment of American pastor Andrew Brunson, who has been detained in Turkey since 2016. The sanctions targeted Turkey's Minister of Justice, Abdulhamit Gul, and Minister of Interior, Suleyman Soylu.\n\nBulent Aliriza, an expert on Turkey with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, said Trump's latest decision to escalate tariffs will push Turkey's economy \"into more difficult waters.\"\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said Trump \"has authorized the preparation of documents\" to raise steel and aluminum tariffs on Turkey, citing a section of the U.S. trade law that allows penalties \"on imports from particular countries whose exports threaten to impair national security.\"\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan responded defiantly to Trump's announcement on Friday. \"We will not lose the economic war,\" Erdogan said during a tour of Black Sea provinces, according to the Hurriyet Daily News, an English language outlet. \"This is a national struggle.\"\n\nRuhsar Pekcan, Turkey's trade minister, said Trump's decision would harm U.S. companies and consumers. \"Turkey is deeply disappointed by the U.S. Administration\u2019s decision to double steel and aluminum tariffs. The tariffs were groundless when they were announced in June, and remain so now,\" Pekcan said.\n\nAliriza said Trump's move will strengthen Erdogan in the short run, because it allows him to fan existing anti-American sentiment in Turkey. \"It's difficult to be optimistic\" about reaching a resolution to the standoff and lowering tensions between the two countries, he said.\n\nThe proposed tariff hikes come just days after Turkey's deputy foreign minister was in Washington to meet with U.S. officials on a range of contentious issues, including Brunson's detention. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert declined to detail those conversations during a briefing with reporters on Thursday.\n\n\"Obviously you all know that we have a very broad relationship with Turkey and a host of issues that we talk about with the Turkish government whenever we do meet,\" Nauert said Thursday. \"Yesterday we had a wide-ranging conversation with Turkish government officials. We made it clear that Pastor Brunson needs to be returned home.\"\n\nShe declined to say whether the two sides made any progress on the release of Brunson. \"We would define progress as Pastor Brunson being brought home,\" she said.\n\nMore: Trump administration sanctions Turkish officials over American pastor's arrest\n\nPreviously, Trump has used tariffs against countries he claims are engaging in unfair trade practices against the United States. The action against Turkey appears to flow from political differences between the two countries, particularly the Brunson case.\n\nTurkey accuses Brunson, arrested in 2016, of being a spy and says he was involved in an attempted coup. The United States says he has been falsely charged. Trump has discussed the Brunson case with Erdogan but has been unable to obtain the pastor's release.\n\nErdogan said last week that U.S. sanctions will not affect the Brunson case. \"We will not give any credit to this type of threatening language,\" Erdogan told reporters Wednesday in Ankara. \"It is not possible for us to accept that America gets up, especially with an evangelist, Zionist mentality, and uses this kind of threat-filled language.\"",

    " Title: NSA Declassifies Documents Detailing Metadata Collection Programs\n\nArticle:\n\nThe National Security Agency (NSA) has declassified a series of documents that provide insights into previously secret programs that collect vast amounts of metadata on domestic phone calls and electronic communications of foreigners within the United States. The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, stated that the release was \"in the public interest.\"\n\nThe most significant document is a 17-page ruling by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) outlining the so-called minimization procedures or safeguards the government must follow when dealing with the collected data. The New York Times reports that the releases also include two formerly classified briefing papers to Congress from 2009 and 2011, when the provision of the USA Patriot Act that the court relied on to issue the order was up for reauthorization.\n\nThese briefing papers portray the bulk collection of metadata as an \"early warning system\" that allows the government to quickly identify individuals linked to a terrorism suspect. The 2011 briefing paper states, \"Both of these programs operate on a very large scale. However, as described below, only a tiny fraction of such records are ever viewed by N.S.A. intelligence analysts.\"\n\nThe documents released contain numerous redactions, and at first glance, they do not seem to reveal significantly more detail than what was already known from the leaked documents provided to The Guardian and The Washington Post by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nOne thing that remains unclear is the legal rationale for allowing the bulk collection of the electronic data of Americans. The government's authorization for the collection of phone metadata is based on section 215 of the USA Patriot Act. The briefing document, however, points out that no \"content\" is being collected. Instead, the program is only collecting information that the Supreme Court has decided is \"not protected by the Fourth Amendment.\"\n\nThe government's interpretation of the law is subject to the Judicial Branch's interpretation, which many legal scholars and civil libertarians have been waiting for. The FISC order also includes exceptions for technical personnel, who are allowed to query the data without adhering to the safeguards. However, any information queried is not allowed to be used for \"intelligence analysis purposes.\"\n\nUpdate at 12:35 p.m. ET: Seeking to Calm Privacy Fears:\n\nThe Washington Post frames the release of the FISC order as an attempt to allay privacy concerns, stating, \"The release of the FISC order is the latest move by the Obama administration to try to calm privacy fears raised by the Snowden leaks.\" The article goes on to explain that the order \"provides the most detailed account yet of the government's collection of phone records under the USA Patriot Act.\" The Washington Post also notes that the order \"reveals that the government can collect records of calls made by millions of Americans, but it does not reveal the content of those calls.\"",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Accuses Donald Trump of Catering to Racist and Conspiratorial Elements in Campaign Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech delivered in Reno, Nevada, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton accused her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump, of building his campaign on prejudice and paranoia. Clinton's speech, titled \"Donald Trump and his advisors' embrace of the disturbing 'alt-right' political philosophy,\" focused on portraying Trump as a racist, a conspiracy theorist, and a man unfit for the presidency.\n\nThe 'alt-right,' an umbrella term for a collection of racist micro-movements and online subcultures, was initially presented as the primary focus of the speech. However, the 'alt-right' was not the main antagonist of the address. Instead, the central villain was Donald Trump himself.\n\nClinton's arguments in the speech were not always consistent. She began by quoting Trump's recent comments about the struggles faced by the black community, which she interpreted as a \"dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.\" She also overstated the influence of the 'alt-right,' claiming that the perceived merger between Breitbart and the Trump campaign had led to the 'alt-right' effectively taking over the Republican Party.\n\nHowever, Clinton's speech contained several strong arguments, such as Trump's habit of retweeting white nationalists and his false claim that he witnessed thousands of New Jersey Muslims celebrating the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThroughout the speech, a consistent theme emerged: Donald Trump is a bigot and a conspiracy theorist. While this idea has been prevalent since Trump entered the presidential race, this speech represented one of the most forceful and concentrated expressions of it from Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe speech is expected to energize Clinton's supporters and potentially increase voter turnout. The extent to which it will lead curious conservatives to research the 'alt-right' depends on the amount of coverage the speech receives in the following days.\n\nMeanwhile, the individual who may be most delighted by the speech is Alex Jones.

    " Title: Fox News and GOP Purge Controversial Figures in Response to 2012 Election Loss\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the 2012 election, both the Republican Party and Fox News have initiated a purge of controversial political figures who were perceived as divisive and damaging to their respective brands.\n\nFox News, the top-ranked cable news network in the United States, has terminated contracts with two of its most partisan contributors, Sarah Palin and Dick Morris. The network is also reportedly working to limit the influence of controversial conservatives in Senate primaries through the Conservative Victory Fund, a super PAC co-founded by Karl Rove, who was sidelined by Fox after the election.\n\nIn an effort to tame anti-establishment conservatives, Senate GOP leaders have created a \"buddy system\" with Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas. This collaboration aims to help manage the actions and rhetoric of conservative members of the Republican caucus.\n\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has been vocal in his criticism of the Republican Party, urging them to avoid nominating extreme candidates. He stated, \"The fact that we lost a winnable election has caused Republicans to take this very, very seriously. I don't think it's just a marketing change. I don't think it's just cosmetic changes. It is going to require some serious changes, not in principles, but in the way we talk and act.\"\n\nA high-profile Republican strategist, who wished to remain anonymous, commented on the deliberate effort by party leaders to \"marginalize the cranks, haters, and bigots\u2014there's a lot of underbrush that has to be cleaned out.\"\n\nFor the Republican Party, this purge is a survival tactic, following two consecutive elections in which extremely conservative candidates lost winnable Senate races. For Fox News, the move is about credibility, as the cable network has seen its ratings decline since the election, in part, due to conservative viewers feeling misled by the coverage.\n\nRoger Ailes, Fox News' chairman and CEO, has a keen understanding of his audience, having revolutionized television by tapping into Republican disdain and anger towards the mainstream media. This strategy has resulted in the creation of both the most-watched cable news channel in the country and political celebrities, several of whom were prominent figures in the 2012 Republican primary. However, during the 2012 campaign, Fox News was criticized for its coverage, particularly in regards to the Benghazi attacks and the presidential election results.",
    " Title: Egypt Launches Airstrikes Against ISIS in Libya in Response to Slaughter of Egyptian Christians\n\nArticle:\n\nEgypt's military carried out a series of airstrikes against ISIS militants in Libya on Monday, in retaliation for the slaughter of 21 Egyptian Christians by the jihadist group. The bombing raids, which reportedly targeted 10 training and storage facilities in ISIS' Libyan stronghold of Derna, deepened Egypt's involvement in the international fight against ISIS and highlighted the extremists' growing presence in North Africa.\n\nEgyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told CNN that the airstrikes were \"surgical strikes based on very accurate intelligence and related to degrading the capabilities of ISIS within the city of Derna.\" However, an umbrella group of Islamist militias in Derna issued a statement claiming that the city \"woke up to a disaster today as Egyptian military jets targeted civilians in residential areas in the city.\"\n\nThe airstrikes followed the release of a gruesome video by ISIS on Sunday that appeared to show militants beheading at least a dozen Egyptian Christians on a Libyan beach. The video, which bore many of the hallmarks of previous ISIS videos of the killing of hostages, has intensified international concerns about ISIS' deepening reach into countries far beyond its strongholds in Syria and Iraq.\n\nTwenty-one Egyptian Christians were kidnapped in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte in two separate incidents in December and January. They were reportedly from impoverished villages and went to Libya looking for work. Although the ISIS video showed around a dozen men being beheaded, Egyptian officials said that all 21 Christians were believed to have been killed.\n\nThe U.S. government condemned the killings, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry calling Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Sunday to offer condolences. The State Department said that Kerry expressed the U.S.'s \"deepest condolences for the loss of life and reaffirmed the United States' commitment to stand with Egypt in the fight against terrorism.\"\n\nEgypt is already fighting against ISIS-allied militants on its own territory in the Sinai Peninsula, where dozens of people were killed in a series of attacks in January. Concern has increased over ISIS' rising influence in Libya amid the power and security vacuum prevalent in the country since the 2011 uprising that overthrew former dictator Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nCNN reported in November that fighters loyal to ISIS had complete control of the city of Derna, which has a population of about 100,000 and is situated not far from the Egyptian border. Jihadists with allegiance to ISIS had also expanded their presence westward along the Libyan coast, forming chapters in cities including Benghazi, Sirte, and even Tripoli, the capital, according to Noman Benotman, a former Libyan jihadist now involved in counterterrorism for the Quilliam Foundation.\n\nIn an example of the group's spreading reach, a Libyan branch of ISIS claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on a luxury hotel in Tripoli that killed 10 people, including one American. \"There's been a real radical Islamist presence in Libya for some time,\" said Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a retired U.S. Air Force intelligence officer. \"What's worrying is now they are self-identifying with ISIS.\"\n\nQuestions remain over how much direct command and control the ISIS leadership in Syria and Iraq has over its North African affiliates. The killings of the Egyptian Christians has filled in some of the detail. Before the grisly video was released, ISIS had released photos in its English-language magazine Dabiq, claiming they had been killed.\n\n\"There's certainly communication between the Libyan affiliate and the affiliate in Syria about matters of importance to both of them,\" said CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen. He said the ties between Libyan jihadists and ISIS' precursor, al Qaeda in Iraq, \"go back a very long time.\" The links between the different branches present \"a real challenge\" for Western leaders, Francona said, as U.S. President Barack Obama asked Congress to formally authorize the use of military force in the war against ISIS.\n\n\"While we can come up with a military solution or a military operation in a restricted area like Syria and Iraq, what do we do when it expands to North Africa?\" Francona asked.",
    " Title: Trump Kicks Off First Official Week in Office with Meetings, Executive Orders, and International Calls\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is set to meet with congressional leaders from both parties this week as he begins his first official week in the White House and works to deliver on his ambitious campaign promises. Trump considers Monday to be his first real day in office and has a packed schedule that focuses on jobs and national security.\n\nThe president tweeted early Monday, \"Busy week planned with a heavy focus on jobs and national security. Top executives coming in at 9:00 A.M. to talk manufacturing in America.\" The schedule includes a breakfast and a listening session with business leaders in the morning, another listening session with union leaders and workers in the afternoon, and a reception later with members of Congress he'll need to overhaul the nation's health care system, among other goals. He will also hold his first meeting as president with the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan.\n\nThe outreach effort comes after a tumultuous first weekend in the White House that included lambasting news organizations for correctly reporting on the size of the crowds at his inauguration and mass protests against his presidency on the following day. Trump delivered a more unifying message on Sunday and sought to reassure Americans he was up to the daunting task ahead.\n\nSpeaking in the White House East Room during a swearing-in ceremony for top aides, the president warned his staff of the challenges ahead but declared he believed they were ready. \"But with the faith in each other and the faith in God, we will get the job done,\" he said. \"We will prove worthy of this moment in history. And I think it may very well be a great moment in history.\"\n\nTrump said his staff was in the White House not to \"help ourselves\" but to \"devote ourselves to the national good.\"\n\n\"This is not about party, this is not about ideology. This is about country, our country. It's about serving the American people,\" he said.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Trump offered a scattershot response to the sweeping post-inauguration protests, first sarcastically denigrating the public opposition and then defending the right to demonstrate a short time later.\n\nTrump also spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who accepted an invitation to visit the White House in early February. The prime minister said he is hoping to forge a \"common vision\" with the newly inaugurated U.S. president that could include expanded settlement construction and a tougher policy toward Iran.\n\nTrump also announced that he's set up meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. \"We're going to start some negotiations having to do with NAFTA,\" he said of his meeting with Pena Nieto. Mexico is part of the free trade agreement with the U.S. and Canada. Trump said he also will discuss immigration and security at the border. He has promised to build a wall along the length of the southern border and insisted that Mexico will pay for it.\n\nTrump's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said on \"Fox News Sunday\" the president would spend his first full week in office undoing some of former President Barack Obama's agenda and planned to sign executive orders on immigration and trade. Trump planned to sign some executive orders on Monday, but it was unclear which.\n\nTrump has pledged to scuttle trade deals such as a pending Asia-Pacific agreement and overturn Obama's executive order deferring deportations for 700,000 people who were brought into the country illegally as minors.\n\nLater in the week, he'll address congressional Republicans at their retreat in Philadelphia and meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May.",
    " Title: Eva Longoria Advocates for Immigration Reform as a Priority for President Obama's Second Term\n\nArticle:\n\nAward-winning actress and prominent Washington figure Eva Longoria has expressed her support for immigration reform as a top priority during President Obama's second term. In an interview on \"This Week,\" Longoria stated, \"People say, 'Oh, get in the back of the line,' but people don't realize there's a hundred lines to get into. It's a very broken system.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal recently labeled Longoria, known for her role in \"Desperate Housewives,\" as a \"Hispanic activist and power player in Washington, D.C.\" She has been a strong supporter of President Obama, serving as a co-chair of his reelection campaign and delivering a speech at the Democratic National Convention last September.\n\nCurrently, Longoria is an executive producer and host of the Latino Inaugural, a concert at the Kennedy Center featuring performances by artists such as Jose Feliciano, Melanie Griffith, and New York City's Ballet Hispanico. She is also a co-chair of the Presidential Inauguration Committee, which is currently preparing for Obama's second inauguration.\n\nFor live streaming video coverage of Inauguration 2013: Barack Obama, tune in to the \u2588\u2588\u2588.com Live page on Monday morning starting at 9:30 a.m. EST, or access the coverage on the \u2588\u2588\u2588 iPad App and mobile devices.\n\nLongoria expressed optimism that the administration, particularly President Obama, recognizes immigration as an economic issue. \"We have to understand that we are dependent upon a labor in this country, specifically agriculture, to provide low-cost products, and they're jobs that nobody else is doing,\" she said.\n\nDespite the partisanship in Washington, Longoria believes there is room for compromise on both sides of the aisle regarding immigration. \"There was a historic mobilization this election with the Latino vote,\" she said. \"I think the Republicans are going to realize, if they don't do it because it's morally imperative, they have to do it because it's politically imperative. And if they're not going to do it because it's politically imperative, they've got to do it because it's economically imperative. So there's a lot of gains for everybody, no matter what party affiliation, to get this done and to fix this problem.\"\n\nWhile she plans to remain politically active, Longoria stated she has no intentions of running for office in her home state of Texas. \"I respect everything that politicians do. I think it's a very, very big job,\" she said. \"It's not my day job, so I'm just doing what I can to help the communities in which I came from.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Issues Executive Order on Gun Control and Background Checks: Constitutional Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama announced on Tuesday the issuance of an executive order on guns and background checks. This order aims to address the requirement for background checks in occasional sales and the need for occasional sellers to become federal licensees, as well as the imposition of reporting upon physicians.\n\nAn executive order is a written instruction from the president to the executive branch of the federal government, outlining the manner in which the president wants federal laws or regulations enforced. Executive orders do not direct private persons or individuals in the legislative or judicial branches of government. Executive orders remain in effect until abandoned or rescinded by the president who issued them or by a successor president.\n\nHowever, President Obama's ability to issue executive orders on guns is limited due to the extensive, detailed, and clear nature of congressional legislation on the matter. Congress has expressly removed occasional sales (sales not made by full-time dealers) from the obligation of obtaining federal licenses and conducting background checks. The president's attempts to negate this congressional will would be invalidated by the courts.\n\nThe president's order requires that anyone who sells a gun, even an \"occasional\" seller, will be required to perform a background check. By defining what an \"occasional seller\" is, the president is essentially interpreting the law, a job reserved for the courts. The courts will likely ignore his interpretation and impose their own.\n\nFurthermore, the president's requirement for physicians to report conversations with their patients about guns to the Department of Homeland Security could potentially infringe upon the patient/physician privilege. This requirement, if implemented, could encourage governmental intrusion into private conversations between patients and their physicians.\n\nThe Supreme Court has made it clear that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental liberty. Under the Constitution, fundamental liberties (such as speech, press, worship, self-defense, travel, and privacy) are accorded the highest protection from governmental intrusion. The president's actions could potentially lead America down a slippery slope towards totalitarianism, where a president can negate liberty.\n\nIt is important to note that under the Constitution, Congress writes the laws, the president enforces them, and the courts interpret them. President Obama's ability to write his own laws or impose his own interpretations upon them is constitutionally limited, just as the Congress or the courts cannot command the military.",
    " Title: NASA Launches Parker Solar Probe on Mission to Study Sun's Behavior\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States space agency NASA has launched the Parker Solar Probe, a mission aimed at sending a satellite closer to the Sun than any before. The probe, named after astrophysicist Eugene Parker, lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a Delta-IV Heavy rocket at 03:31 local time (07:31 GMT).\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is set to become the fastest-moving manmade object in history. Its data promises to shed light on longstanding mysteries about the Sun's behavior. This mission marks the first time a spacecraft has been named after a living person. Dr. Parker, 91, who first described solar wind in 1958, watched the launch and expressed his anticipation.\n\nThe launch came after a failed attempt the previous day due to a last-minute alarm. Just under an hour after the successful launch, NASA confirmed that the spacecraft had successfully separated and was released into space.\n\nThe probe aims to dip directly into the Sun's outer atmosphere, or corona. It will make a close approach to Venus in six weeks and a first rendezvous with the Sun a further six weeks after that. Over the course of seven years, Parker will make 24 loops around the Sun to study the physics of the corona, the place where much of the important activity that affects the Earth seems to originate.\n\nThe probe will dip inside this tenuous atmosphere, sampling conditions, and getting to just 6.16 million km (3.83 million miles) from the Sun's \"surface.\" Dr. Nicky Fox, the UK-born project scientist affiliated with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, explained, \"I realize that might not sound that close, but imagine the Sun and the Earth were a meter apart. Parker Solar Probe would be just 4cm away from the Sun.\"\n\nThe probe will also be the fastest man-made object ever, traveling at speeds of up to 430,000mph (690,000km/h)\u2014faster than New York to Tokyo in under a minute.",
    " Title: Reporters Committee Urges Washington Court to Quash Subpoena for News Outlets' Protest Footage\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Reporters Committee has filed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the King County Superior Court to quash a subpoena issued by the Seattle Police Department to five local news organizations. The subpoena, served earlier in June, demands the outlets to hand over all raw footage and photographs taken within a several block radius during a May 30 protest in Seattle. The police are seeking the materials to aid in identifying suspects involved in the arson of a police car and theft of firearms.\n\nThe Reporters Committee's brief, filed on June 29, argues that the subpoena is unenforceable as it allegedly violates the Washington shield law, the First Amendment, and creates the impression that journalists serve as an extension of law enforcement. The brief highlights the dangers that journalists face while covering protests, citing instances of violence against journalists during recent demonstrations.\n\nThe brief argues that enforcing the subpoena could lead to further violence against journalists, as some protesters view journalists as being associated with the police. This was evident in a Tucson protest where a journalist, wearing press credentials, was assaulted by protesters who believed he was working with the police.\n\nThe Reporters Committee's brief states, \"Enforcement of the Subpoena could mislead the public into perceiving reporters at protests as a mere arm of law enforcement, thus eroding public trust in the news media and increasing the already-significant risk of physical harm that journalists face when covering protests.\"\n\nThe Reporters Committee regularly files friend-of-the-court briefs and represents journalists and news organizations pro bono in court cases that involve First Amendment freedoms, the newsgathering rights of journalists, and access to public information.

    " Title: Morgan Stanley Strategist Sees Parallels Between Current Market and 2009 Recovery\n\nArticle:\n\nMichael Wilson, the head of U.S. equity strategy at Morgan Stanley, has suggested that the current stock market recovery mirrors the market's behavior during the 2009 financial crisis recovery. In a note to clients on Monday, Wilson argued that the stock market's rebound is following a similar pattern to March 2009, when the U.S. economy was emerging from the crisis, and the S&P 500 index was beginning its longest bull-market run in history.\n\nWilson noted that the equity-risk premium, or the expected earnings yield for the S&P 500 minus the 10-year Treasury yield, has reached levels observed in March 2009. This indicator gives investors a rough estimate of the extra return they'll get investing in stocks compared with risk-free government bonds. Wilson's bullish call in March, when he predicted a stock-market bottom, was based on the equity-risk premium reaching the same levels observed in March 2009.\n\nOne of the key similarities between the two periods is the performance of cyclical stocks, such as small-capitalization stocks, which typically lead at the beginning of recoveries. The Russell 2000 has risen 8.3% during the past month, compared to the S&P 500's 2.9% rise. However, other cyclical stocks, like financial stocks, have not performed as well. In fact, bank stocks are performing worse relative to the S&P 500 than during the bank-driven financial crisis.\n\nWilson attributed this dynamic to the Federal Reserve's stimulus measures, which have repressed government bond yields and are scaring bank investors. He believes the market is underestimating the chances that longer-term bond yields, like the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note, will rise significantly as the economy recovers from the coronavirus. Wilson pointed to Congress passing at least $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus, the potential for a faster and more sustained recovery in the post-coronavirus economy, and unexpected inflation as possible catalysts for higher inflation and long-term interest rates.\n\nWilson wrote, \"While hypothetical, these are real possibilities and worth considering given current levels of inflation and 10-year Treasury yields. We continue to think higher 10-year rates would be perhaps the biggest surprise to markets at the moment and would have significant implications for equity markets and leadership.\"",

Vice President Joe Biden, who declined to challenge Clinton for the nomination in October, has yet to announce his support for the former first lady, instead criticizing her during a debate and warning against attacks on President Obama's record.\n\nSenate minority leader Harry Reid and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi have strongly indicated their support for Clinton, but have yet to make a formal endorsement. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who was heavily recruited by progressive Democrats to challenge Clinton, has insisted that she is not running for the nomination.\n\nRichard Trumka, the head of the nation's largest federation of labor unions, the AFL-CIO, has praised both Senator Bernie Sanders and Vice President Biden, but some labor leaders have criticized Clinton for her support of some of President Obama's trade legislation. California Governor Jerry Brown, who challenged Bill Clinton for the nomination in 1992, has been critical of Hillary Clinton during her email scandal, but has spoken warmly of her in recent months.\n\nDespite Hillary Clinton's alleged backing from the Democratic establishment, she has not been able to attract the support of key party figures. President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, along with top Democrats in Congress and one of the nation's largest labor unions, are remaining neutral in the primary race.\n\nClinton, however, holds the most endorsements so far over key rival Bernie Sanders in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. The former secretary of state's campaign reports that Clinton is backed by 145 House members, 38 of the 46 senators who caucus with Democrats, 12 governors, and 17 national unions.

    " Title: Trump Denies Agreement with Julian Assange, Cites Media Misrepresentation\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has stated that the media is misrepresenting his stance on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. In a series of tweets on Thursday, Trump clarified that he merely reports what Assange states, leaving the interpretation of the information to the public.\n\nTrump's tweets come in response to accusations that he aligns with Assange, who has been a subject of controversy due to the release of hacked emails from prominent Democratic individuals and institutions. The cyberattacks, which the U.S. intelligence community attributes to Russia, have been a point of contention between Trump and the intelligence community.\n\nWhile the U.S. intelligence community has maintained for months that Russia is responsible for the cyberattacks, Trump has been reluctant to concede this point. The cyberattacks, publicly released by WikiLeaks and other similar sites, have been a significant factor in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAssange, who has been residing in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012 to avoid extradition on sexual assault charges, has stated that his source for the emails was not a foreign state.\n\nTrump's willingness to cite Assange is a departure from his stance on WikiLeaks in 2010, when the website published thousands of pages of classified information provided by Chelsea Manning, an Army private known as Bradley Manning at the time. In a tape uncovered by CNN, Trump expressed disapproval of WikiLeaks in 2010, stating, \"I think it's disgraceful... I think there should be like death penalty or something.\"\n\nInstead of accepting the assessment of the intelligence community, Trump has argued that it would be nearly impossible to identify the true culprit responsible for the cyberattacks. He has also stated that he possesses information regarding the cyberattacks that others do not, although he has not elaborated on the nature of this information.\n\nTrump is scheduled to receive a briefing on Friday from the nation's top intelligence officials outlining the government's evidence blaming Russia for the cyberattacks. Trump had previously stated that the briefing was scheduled for earlier in the week but later tweeted, \"The \u2018 Intelligence \u2019 briefing on so-called \u2018 Russian hacking \u2019 was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!\"\n\nA U.S. official disputed Trump's claim, telling \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the president-elect's briefing was always scheduled for Friday.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who ran against Trump as Democrat Hillary Clinton's vice presidential pick, expressed shock at Trump's citation of Assange. While the FBI and CIA are the only two intelligence agencies whose assessments regarding Russia's motives have been made public, Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees, told CNN's \"New Day\" that it was the \"unanimous conclusion\" of the intelligence professionals who had briefed him that Russia had indeed sought to aid Trump's campaign.\n\n\"I note that he does not go to his intelligence briefings most days. I do go to my intelligence briefings, and I know what the evidence is,\" Kaine said in his first national TV interview since the presidential election. \"If he went to his intelligence briefings, maybe he'd have a different conclusion about this. There's something very unusual, indeed even sort of suspicious, about the degree to which he casually kicks aside the intelligence community when he won't even go to the briefings and again and again takes the Assange-Vladimir Putin line on this important question.\"",
    " Title: Presidential Disagreement with Review Group: Obama's Approach to National Security Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nMichael Allen, a former aide to President Bush and author of the book \"Blinking Red,\" has raised questions about how a president might express disagreement with the recommendations of a review group, particularly in the context of national security policies. Allen suggests that a president's response should indicate a significant acceptance of the group's suggestions, stating, \"It needs to be seen at the very least as, 'I'm largely or in some nonsymbolic way taking most of what they're offering.'\"\n\nAllen, now managing director of Beacon Global Strategies, expresses concern that such pressure might lead President Obama to make decisions that could expose the country to more danger. He anticipates that Obama might say, \"We need to make a major course correction.\"\n\nPresident Obama assumed office after running against President Bush's first term but inherited his second. Before leaving office, Bush had already moderated his counterterrorism program in an attempt to ensure its survival. He ceased waterboarding, emptied secret C.I.A. prisons, transferred many prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and secured bipartisan legislation on detention, interrogation, and surveillance.\n\nUpon taking office, President Obama made further adjustments but maintained much of the program and, in the case of drone strikes, even expanded it. His decisions were influenced by a terrorist attempt to down an airliner with explosives during his first presidential Christmas in Hawaii.\n\nSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican critic, has characterized Obama as being more authoritarian than Bush on privacy issues. Paul, who has expressed concern over N.S.A. programs, finds the disclosures about these programs to be more alarming than he had anticipated.\n\nWhite House officials reject such characterizations, but the momentum to revamp N.S.A. rules comes at a time when President Obama also faces other decisions on how much to shift course. Allies are pressing him to support the release of a comprehensive Senate report on the history of interrogations and torture. The president is also left to decide how much to scale back drone strikes, as he signaled he planned to do in a speech this year.\n\nAdm. Dennis C. Blair, President Obama's first director of national intelligence, suggests that the president should take a deeper look at national security policies beyond simply surveillance. Blair criticizes the administration's approach, stating, \"Appointing this commission on one small aspect of an important issue for American democracy is a typical small-ball play by this administration. When the administration asks for a debate, it doesn't really want it. What we need is a debate about what level of security we want traded off against what level of privacy we want to maintain.\"",
    " Title: Obama Escalates Unilateral Actions as Time Winds Down on Second Term\n\nArticle:\n\nWith the clock ticking on his second term, President Barack Obama has intensified his efforts to accomplish policy goals without Congressional approval, a strategy that could yield swift results but may be vulnerable to reversal by lawmakers or a future president.\n\nThe most recent example of this approach was Mr. Obama's policy, announced Thursday, to shield more than four million illegal immigrants from deportation. The President has also announced an aggressive climate deal with China, presided over an Environmental Protection Agency plan to order carbon-emission cuts at power plants, and pursued nuclear negotiations with Iran.\n\nFurthermore, the White House has been exploring options to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay without Congressional approval.\n\nThe President has long promised to press ahead on his agenda with or without Congressional support, but the new actions are more sweeping in scope than earlier moves, such as raising the minimum wage for federal contractors.\n\nWith prospects uncertain for passing major legislation in the new, Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. Obama has begun to build a second-term legacy that is likely to be defined in large part by unilateral action.\n\nHowever, this strategy comes with risks. Republican lawmakers have threatened to undo the President's actions, and a future President potentially could reverse some of Mr. Obama's moves on immigration and climate change.\n\nMore immediately, the President's decision to bypass Congress could diminish the chances of forging agreements with Republican leaders on other issues. GOP lawmakers warned that Mr. Obama would \"poison the well\" by acting unilaterally on immigration.\n\nIn an interview that aired Sunday on ABC, Mr. Obama said, \"What the American people expect is that if we disagree on one thing...then we work on everything else.\"\n\nSuggesting that the legislative process wasn't at an end, some Republicans said the party should respond to Mr. Obama by taking the reins on policy and passing GOP-sponsored immigration bills, though it remained unclear what policy the party would put forward and whether Mr. Obama would sign on.\n\n\"It's incumbent on Republicans to come up with our own agenda, a positive, constructive agenda,\" said Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) on CBS on Sunday. Mr. McCaul, who leads the House Homeland Security Committee, said such an effort likely would lead with a border-security bill, but noted that Congress wouldn't take up the issue until next year.\n\nMr. Obama said in the interview that both Republican and Democratic presidents have taken similar executive actions.\n\n\"The history is that I have issued fewer executive actions than most of my predecessors, by a longshot,\" he said. \"Take a look at the track records of the modern presidency; I've actually been very restrained. And I've been very restrained with respect to immigration.\"\n\nThe first two years of Mr. Obama's second term yielded few legislative victories and little progress on the White House's top goals, such as raising the minimum wage and enacting comprehensive immigration legislation.\n\nMr. Obama was largely sidelined during this fall's campaigns, and Republicans cast Democratic defeats in the midterm elections as a rejection of the President's policies.\n\nThe White House has resolved to push forward on Mr. Obama's agenda during the remaining two years.\n\n\"He does feel the pressure of time,\" Dan Pfeiffer, an Obama senior adviser, said Friday at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. \"We all do.\"\n\nOn both immigration and climate change, the President tried but failed to work with Congress to pass legislation before acting on his own. In addition to striking a deal with China to cut carbon pollution, Mr. Obama has laid out aggressive limits on power-plant emissions, another unilateral move that could stand as one of the more far-reaching actions of the second term.\n\nWilliam Galston, a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said acting on immigration and climate change always have been priorities for Mr. Obama, but they have risen in importance as legislative avenues have been closed off.\n\n\"Things that you can get done through executive decisions look much more attractive in highly polarized circumstances,\" said Mr. Galston, who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nWhite House officials also see a range of opportunities to define the President's second term in the foreign-policy realm.\n\nThe Obama administration has continued to press for an agreement with Iran on its nuclear program, despite skepticism in Congress. Some Republican lawmakers have suggested that they would move to impose more sanctions on Iran if they aren't comfortable with a deal. Mr. Obama said in the ABC interview that he remained confident that if an agreement is reached, he could convince Congress it is the right thing to do.\n\nMr. Obama also appears determined to make good on a campaign promise to close the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba\u2014another potentially dramatic use of executive power. The White House has discussed ways to override a congressional ban on bringing detainees to the U.S., senior administration officials have said.\n\nWhile the President has said he wants to work with Congress, he and his advisers recently have struck a more defiant tone about Mr. Obama's powers to act on his own. Mr. Obama has said he has an answer for lawmakers who question his authority on immigration: \"Nobody is stopping them from passing a bill.\"\n\nJohn Podesta, counselor to the President, predicted that Republicans who want to undo the President's power-plant rules would fail, saying, \"I don't believe they can stop us from doing that.\"\n\nSuch statements have fanned discord between the White House and the GOP. But on Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) placed blame on both his party and the President, saying \"shame on us as Republicans\" for failing to pass legislation to overhaul the immigration system.\n\n\"My party has failed,\" he said on CNN. \"This President has failed miserably, and he's made it worse.\"",
    " Title: Republican Party Faces Transformation as Trump's Unconventional Campaign Gains Momentum\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape, conservative activist and talk-radio host Laura Ingraham has stated, \"They have to come to terms with what they created.\" She refers to the Republican Party, which, according to her, tends to avoid discussing the unpopularity of their policies.\n\nThis divide within the Republican Party was amplified by the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in the Citizens United case, which increased the influence of wealthy donors in Republican circles. This development occurred amid indications that the party's working-class voters were demanding more representation.\n\nMany of these voters had previously distanced themselves from the increasingly liberal and cosmopolitan Democratic Party. In Donald Trump, they found a champion: a blue-collar billionaire who promised to expand Social Security, reject big donor money, challenge Chinese central bankers, and alleviate Americans from unfair competition due to foreign workers.\n\nThe Democratic Party is also grappling with a populist uprising this year, driven in part by economic hardship and growing resentment towards Washington and Wall Street. However, while Senator Bernie Sanders trails Hillary Clinton in delegates, Trump's improbable campaign has become a seemingly unstoppable force, one that Republican lawmakers, donors, and activists are only now fully acknowledging.\n\nFoster Friess, a Wyoming investor and significant donor to the Republican Party, commented, \"Republicans and Democrats alike had neglected 'the people who truly make our country work\u2014the truck drivers, farmers, welders, hospitality workers.'\"\n\nSix years ago, as the 2010 elections approached, it seemed the Republican Party was on the verge of a resounding rejection of President Obama in congressional races, with the potential to pick up 63 seats. At a fundraiser for Republican Senate candidates hosted by Paul Singer, a billionaire investor, on the ninth floor of the Beresford apartment building on Central Park West, guests celebrated this impending victory.\n\nSinger, a self-proclaimed Goldwater conservative and proponent of an immigration overhaul deal, had publicly lamented \"indiscriminate attacks by political leaders against anything that moves in the world of finance.\" In 2010, Singer tripled his campaign giving, contributing almost $3 million to Republican candidates.",
    " Title: Special Counsel Recommends Up to Six Months' Imprisonment for George Papadopoulos\n\nArticle:\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller has recommended a judge sentence George Papadopoulos, a former aide to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, to up to six months in prison for lying to the FBI. The recommendation, contained in court documents, includes a strong rebuke of Papadopoulos for failing to assist with the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections.\n\nProsecutors did not specify a sentence but urged the judge to impose jail time, stating that a sentence within the guideline range of up to six months imprisonment was \"appropriate and warranted.\" The government argued that Papadopoulos should be held accountable for repeatedly misleading investigators about critical facts in an investigation of national importance, after having been explicitly warned that lying to the FBI was a federal offense.\n\nPapadopoulos' wife, Simona, on Friday evening told ABC7 Chicago I-Team that \"unfortunately they [prosecutors] didn't value George's cooperation.\" Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos said that federal authorities have ignored evidence favorable to her husband.\n\nPapadopoulos, who served as a volunteer to the Trump team, traveled as an emissary from the campaign to foreign leaders in the Middle East and the Mediterranean. In July 2017, he was charged with lying to the FBI about his contacts during the campaign with a professor who had \"substantial connections to Russian government officials.\"\n\nCourt records filed by special counsel Robert Mueller describe how the professor approached Papadopoulos after learning of his role in the Trump campaign. The court filing does not name the professor, but he has since been widely identified as Joseph Mifsud, then the director of the London Academy of Diplomacy.\n\nThe professor told Papadopoulos the Russians had \"dirt\" on Democrat Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails\" that they had procured, according to the court documents. Papadopoulos reportedly bragged about that offer to an Australian diplomat, who then tipped off the FBI and launched that agency's counterintelligence investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nPapadopoulos was arrested by the FBI when he arrived at Dulles International Airport in July 2017 and charged under seal. He agreed to cooperate with investigators in exchange for a lighter sentence.\n\nThe government's sentencing recommendation includes clear signs that the Mueller team felt betrayed by Papadopoulos after he struck a plea agreement and pledged his full cooperation. The filing says Papadopoulos repeatedly withheld key details about his contacts with Russians and neglected to turn over the cell phone he used to communicate with Mifsud until the government expressly asked for it.\n\n\"His lies negatively affected the FBI's Russia investigation, and prevented the FBI from effectively identifying and confronting witnesses in a timely fashion,\" the filing says. \"His lies were not momentary lapses. He lied repeatedly over the course of more than two hours, and his lies were designed to conceal facts he knew were critical: the importance of the information he received from the Professor, and his own communications and contacts with Russians and Russian intermediaries during the Trump campaign.\"\n\nThe filing also says that, even after his initial FBI interview, Papadopoulos made repeated attempts to land jobs with the fledgling Trump administration, including a high-level post with the National Security Council.\n\nPapadopoulos' legal team will file their own sentencing assessment to the court in two weeks, and is expected to ask for probation. The sentence recommendation comes as Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos has mounted the latest in a series of publicity campaigns, this one suggesting her husband has misgivings about his plea agreement.\n\nBack in December, in an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos, she had described her spouse as the \"John Dean\" of the Russia probe, a reference to the Watergate-era former White House counsel who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct justice and became a key witness against President Richard Nixon and his aides.\n\nEarlier this month, Papadopoulos received a sealed sentencing document prepared for the court. After that, the defendant's wife began an aggressive media blitz in which she strongly hinted her husband is considering changing lawyers and rescinding his plea deal.\n\nAfter appearing before Democratic members of the House intelligence committee earlier this summer, she said that Papadopoulos has come to believe the professor may have been working for Western intelligence agencies and set him up.\n\n\"I actually never said explicitly that it was an entrapment from the FBI. I just said that he definitely was... the target of a different set-up,\" she said.\n\nIn June, the Daily Caller News Foundation reported that Simona Papadopoulos said, \"It looks to be one among a series of attempts to entrap George,\" adding, \"The question today to me [is whether] these people are simply shady businessmen or are they part of a greater attempt to entrap George in illegal activity.\"\n\nSince her husband's guilty plea in exchange for cooperation with the Mueller probe, Papadopoulos has been living in Chicago. Federal investigators have imposed restrictions on his travel until his sentencing, which is now scheduled for September 7.",
    " Title: Court Case Garza v. Hargan Divides Judge Brett Kavanaugh on Abortion Rights for Illegal Immigrant Minors\n\nArticle:\n\nThe court case Garza v. Hargan, involving an illegal immigrant teen seeking an abortion while in government custody, has become a contentious issue for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court. The case, which involved a girl identified as Jane Doe, a Unaccompanied Alien Child (UAC), has drawn criticism from both pro-life and pro-choice activists for Kavanaugh's attempt to find a middle ground.\n\nJane Doe, who arrived in the U.S. last year, was sent to a government-funded facility and was told she was pregnant after an entry medical exam. She requested an abortion, but the Trump administration delayed the process, citing their interest in protecting the fetus while the girl was in government custody. The girl had funding for the procedure and obtained a judge's consent in Texas, but the government argued that it would still have to transport her and provide any necessary aftercare, which violated federal law prohibiting taxpayer spending on elective abortions.\n\nThe government proposed finding a family member or willing sponsor for the girl, arguing they would be best able to help her make such a significant decision. A lower court ruled in favor of the girl and the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented her in the case. However, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, led by Judge Kavanaugh, sided with the government, overturning the lower court's decision.\n\nThe full D.C. Circuit then overturned the three-judge panel's decision, ruling that illegal immigrants have a right to abortion and that the Trump administration's efforts to delay the procedure to find a sponsor were infringing on that right. Judge Kavanaugh penned a dissent, stating that the majority's decision established a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortions on demand.\n\nThe Supreme Court later erased the lower court's opinion, ruling that since Jane Doe had rushed to get an abortion, there was no longer a live controversy and no precedent should be set. However, the ruling has left activists on all sides of the issue furious.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, a California Democrat, expressed concerns about Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, stating that he disregarded Supreme Court precedent and opposed the health care rights of a vulnerable young woman. From the right, the American Family Association also expressed concerns, finding Judge Kavanaugh's ruling not strong enough in upholding abortion rights.\n\nHowever, the Rev. Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, expressed support for Judge Kavanaugh's selection, while the Susan B. Anthony List, a major pro-life advocacy group, praised Kavanaugh's decisions in both the Garza and Priests for Life v. HHS cases, where they said he rejected the ACLU's assertion of a constitutional right to abortion on demand for illegal immigrants.\n\nIn conclusion, the court case Garza v. Hargan has become a significant point of contention for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, with activists on both sides of the abortion rights issue expressing concerns about his rulings in the case.",
    " Title: Modest Deficit Reduction Goals Raise Concerns for Future Fiscal Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nSome on the left are defining successful deficit reduction as stabilizing the federal debt at about 70 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2022. This goal, according to some analysts, is far too modest and could leave future fiscal policy perilously constrained.\n\nUnder current assumptions, achieving this goal would require combined reductions in spending growth and/or increases in taxes of $1.4 trillion over the 2014-2022 period, less than the total deficit reduction provided by the 2011 Budget Control Act (BCA) and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013 (ATRA).\n\nRichard Kogan of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, supported by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times, argues for more modest deficit reduction. The Washington Post's editorial page shares similar concerns.\n\nThe potential danger of such a low debt-GDP ratio is that, in the event of a future recession, the debt-GDP ratio could quickly surpass 100 percent. This could make it harder to argue for stimulus measures during economic downturns, potentially exacerbating the severity of the recession.\n\nHowever, if the economy were to maintain a steady growth path, the deficit associated with stabilizing the debt-GDP ratio at 70 percent of GDP would be more than 10 percent higher than that consistent with a 60 percent ratio, the limit chosen by the drafters of the Maastricht treaty that created the Euro. This would represent a significant increase in the rate at which the nation's wealth is being depleted.\n\nKogan and Wolf assume that the discretionary spending caps imposed by the BCA through 2021 will be enforced successfully. The caps imply that discretionary spending will fall to the lowest level relative to GDP since World War II. They would also require both defense and non-defense outlays to grow less than the rate of inflation from 2014 to 2021, after already falling considerably from the levels inflated by the stimulus and the recession.\n\nThe biggest risk is that it will be impossible to maintain defense at such low levels, given the ongoing war on terror and the growing Chinese defense budget. In non-defense, population growth will put upward pressure on spending for programs like education, infrastructure, national parks, etc. True reforms in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid have a better chance of lasting than arbitrary caps on discretionary spending that do not specify individual program cuts.\n\nRudolph G. Penner, an Institute Fellow at the Urban Institute and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1983 to 1987, has expressed concerns about the potential risks of a higher debt-GDP ratio. Sovereign debt crises occur at all manner of debt-GDP ratios and are impossible to predict, but it is hard to believe that a higher ratio does not increase the risk to some degree. It is sobering to note that, in 2008, just before their crises, the net debt to GDP ratio in Spain was less than 31 percent and in Ireland less than 25 percent.",
    " Title: Scalia's Death May Not Set U.S. Precedent for Texas Abortion Case\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear its most significant abortion case in at least a decade, with the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia potentially impacting the reach of the decision due to his absence. Scalia, who died over the weekend, was widely expected to provide a fifth vote to uphold abortion restrictions.\n\nThe Texas law in question requires doctors to have local hospital admitting privileges and for clinics to make costly building upgrades to operate like outpatient surgical centers. Similar laws have been passed in numerous other states, and a 4-4 split in the court would leave in place the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that upheld these provisions.\n\nIlyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, states that such a split decision would result in the closure of several clinics that perform abortions, exacerbating an already challenging healthcare situation in Texas. Currently, half of the state's clinics have already closed due to various restrictions.\n\nHowever, a 4-4 split decision would have no national precedent. This means that other appeals court rulings striking down similar laws would also stand. Hogue also notes that there are more cases concerning reproductive rights coming before the Supreme Court.\n\nOne such case is a challenge to the Affordable Care Act's mandate on covering birth control for female employees, which the court will hear next month. Additionally, there has been a wave of abortion restrictions passed since Republicans took control of numerous statehouses in 2011, and many of these cases are making their way through the appeals courts.\n\nAbortion opponents had hoped to have these restrictions affirmed by the Supreme Court with Scalia's support. Clarke Forsythe, senior counsel with Americans United for Life, states, \"He was one of the two justices on the court who has publicly opposed Roe v. Wade in prior cases and prior votes.\"\n\nScalia had expressed the view that since the U.S. Constitution does not recognize a right to abortion, the Supreme Court should not either. The issue, he wrote, should be left to the states.\n\nWith a potential shift to a liberal majority, Forsythe foresees a significant rollback of decades of abortion restrictions. He suggests that a liberal Supreme Court may overturn the ban on public funding for the procedure, known as the Hyde Amendment, a policy that both presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have pledged to overturn.\n\nForsythe also anticipates that a liberal Supreme Court \"will probably throw out all parental notice and parental consent laws in the country, will throw out all informed consent laws in the country, and virtually any regulation, and create an absolute right to abortion for any reason at any time that we have not seen in 42 years.\"\n\nAbortion rights groups, however, view these predictions as speculative at best. With so much at stake, both sides of this contentious issue are reportedly throwing themselves into the fierce battle over Scalia's replacement.",
    " Title: Median Household Income and Poverty Rate Show Significant Increase in 2015, According to U.S. Census Bureau Report\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Census Bureau has released its annual estimates of Americans' incomes and the poverty rate for 2015, revealing a substantial increase in median household income and a decrease in the poverty rate. The report indicates a 5.2% real-term growth in median household income, or $2,800, marking a significant change from the stagnation observed following the recession.\n\nAccording to Michigan economist Justin Wolfers, the income growth was particularly pronounced at the lower end of the income distribution. People at the 10th percentile, or the poor, experienced a 7.9% increase in income, while those at the 95th percentile, or the rich, saw a 3.7% growth. This income growth is even more significant when considering the Federal Reserve's PCE deflator, an alternative measure of inflation, which typically shows slower inflation growth.\n\nThe decrease in income inequality between 2014 and 2015 is noteworthy, although it does not reverse the long-term upward trend. The official poverty rate fell from 14.8% to 13.5%, with 3.5 million fewer people falling below the poverty threshold. However, the official poverty rate is considered a poor statistic due to its exclusion of important social programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and food stamps, and its pegging to the price of food in 1955.\n\nA more accurate metric, according to the Census Bureau, is the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), which takes all important social programs into account and is pegged to the present-day cost of basic goods like food, clothing, shelter, and utilities. The SPM also decreased, falling by a full percentage point, from 15.3% to 14.3%. According to this metric, 45.7 million people were in poverty in 2015, 2.7 million fewer than in 2014.\n\nThe report also covers health insurance, and the ongoing rollout of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) continued a trend toward lower and lower uninsured rates. The rate for 2015 was a mere 9.1%, and more recent federal data shows that in the first quarter of 2016, that rate fell even further to 8.6%, the lowest on record. The drops in uninsurance for poor Americans were concentrated in states that participated in the law's Medicaid expansion, but even non-expanding states saw some declines.\n\nOverall, the report suggests that the ongoing economic recovery's gains are finally being broadly shared, although it would take multiple reports like this to reverse longstanding trends in income inequality and poor median income growth.",
    " Title: U.S. Congress Address by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: A Controversial Speech and its Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe speech delivered by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the U.S. Congress has become a significant and ongoing story, rather than a one-day event, as it was initially intended to be. The address, which was met with controversy due to its timing and the political dynamics surrounding it, has brought increased scrutiny to the U.S. Capitol and raised questions for President Barack Obama and the Democrats.\n\nThe Democrats, historically strong advocates for Israel, have recently shown a cooling stance towards the Jewish state. U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry has referred to Israel as an \"apartheid state,\" and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has criticized Israel for the \"brutal occupation\" of the West Bank and the denial of \"dignity and self-determination\" to the Palestinians.\n\nThe speech by Netanyahu, who is known for his straightforward approach, has raised speculation about potential disclosures and embarrassing secrets that may emerge from the discussions between Israel and the Obama administration. A Kuwaiti newspaper, citing Israeli sources, reported that President Obama once threatened to shoot down Israeli bombers attempting to reach Iranian nuclear reactors.\n\nIn his speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), Netanyahu emphasized the long-standing friendship between Israel and the United States, recalling three instances where Israel acted independently to ensure its survival despite American misgivings: the declaration of statehood in 1948, the Six Day War in 1967, and the bombing of the Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981.\n\nThe friendship between the two nations has been a central theme of Netanyahu's speech, as he seeks to reassure Americans that his visit does not intend to harm the relationship. However, some observers suggest that President Obama may not share the same sentiments towards Israel as his predecessors.\n\nThe article concludes by drawing parallels between the situation in 1941, when Winston Churchill visited Washington amidst the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, and the current political climate. Churchill's visit was intended to bolster American spirits, and the article suggests that Netanyahu's speech aims to remind Americans of their nation's exceptional status and to challenge President Obama's perceived indecisiveness in the face of adversity.",
    " Title: World Bank Forecasts Slightly More Pessimistic Growth Outlook for 2012 and 2013 Compared to IMF\n\nArticle:\n\nThe World Bank's predictions for global economic growth in 2012 and 2013 are slightly more pessimistic compared to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF forecasts a growth of 3.5 percent in 2012 and 4.1 percent in 2013. The global outlook brightened early in 2012, according to the World Bank's report, as European leaders promised to devote more money to resolve their crisis and implement policy changes to further unite the Continent.\n\nHowever, the calm of the winter has dissipated in the spring. Investors have returned to punishing a variety of European bonds, pushing Spain to request a bailout for its faltering banks last weekend. Political uncertainty is rife, with a Greek exit from the euro zone increasingly mentioned as a possibility.\n\nIn the last few months, fearful investors have again cut their risk exposure, pulling money from around the world and parking it in the safety of assets like American bonds. Capital flows to developing countries fell an astonishing 44 percent from April to May, according to Mr. Burns in an interview.\n\nSuch market gyrations are likely to be fairly common in the post-crisis period, the bank said, and the effects will be felt globally. \"Sharp swings in investor sentiment and financial conditions will continue to complicate the conduct of macro policy in developing countries,\" the report said.\n\nThe World Bank sees Europe muddling through its sovereign debt crisis without any market catastrophe, and the world maintaining its lackluster but steady growth path, as the most likely outcome. The forecast is not entirely reassuring, however. Economists at the World Bank, like most forecasters, have failed to foresee crises in the past, and are warning of significant uncertainties ahead.\n\n\"This is the third May or June in a row where Europe has been embroiled in tensions,\" Mr. Burns said. \"In each and every previous incident, it has calmed towards the end of June. That is our baseline expectation.\"\n\nThe bank strongly reiterated a warning to developing countries in the report: prepare for market turbulence by strengthening your balance sheets, such as by cutting deficits and reducing short-term debt exposures.\n\nAccording to the bank's data, about 40 percent of developing countries were running a surplus in 2007, before the global downturn began. Last year, just 19 percent were. \"That doesn't mean that their policies have deteriorated,\" Mr. Burns said, suggesting that the swing was largely the result of the crisis. But Mr. Burns noted that the countries' relatively strong fiscal position heading into the crisis served them well, and he urged them to \"move in that direction once again.\"\n\nMore generally, the bank's economists said that while Europe might pose a short-term threat to middle- and lower-income countries, in the long term their prospects and growth trajectories remained strong.\n\nIn the case of China, for instance, growth \"doesn't depend on domestic demand in high-income countries, and ultimately it doesn't depend on their export demand,\" said Hans Timmer, the director of the World Bank's development prospects group. Future growth would instead come largely from within the country and other poorer but fast-growing economies, he said.\n\nOfficials at the bank also warned that high-income countries were not making the changes necessary to ensure that their economies would be competitive, prolonging their periods of economic malaise and losing ground to the rest of the world. Such changes might include reducing long-term deficits, making certain industries more competitive, or investing in infrastructure.\n\n\"In high-income countries, a good crisis is being wasted,\" said Mr. Timmer.\n\nOn Tuesday, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, also warned of a global growth slowdown and renewed threats to financial markets.\n\n\"We need a strategy that is good for stability and good for growth,\" Ms. Lagarde said at a Center for Global Development event in Washington, according to her prepared remarks. \"This must start with the advanced economies, especially in Europe.\" Ms. Lagarde urged \"very accommodating monetary policy,\" \"direct support to banks,\" and \"growth-friendly\" fiscal policies.",

    " Title: Trump Campaign Staffers Face Exclusion from Federal Agency Positions\n\nArticle:\n\nDonald Trump campaign workers are finding themselves in competition with GOP veterans for key positions in federal agencies, with the former group reportedly facing exclusion, according to Politico. This trend is evident in departments such as the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, where campaign staffers, who refer to themselves as \"originals,\" claim they are being sidelined.\n\nCampaign staffers have reportedly been kept out of meetings and targeted by damaging leaks, with some Trump supporters already resigning from their new roles. Sid Bowdidge, a former Trump campaign staffer who left his Energy Department position after reports of anti-Muslim slurs on social media, attributed the leaks to rival coworkers, as reported by Politico.\n\nMany of the campaign loyalists were placed in agencies on Inauguration Day to facilitate a smooth presidential transition, often referred to as the \"beachhead\" team. CBS News reports that about a dozen members of the beachhead team at the U.S. Agriculture department have been informed they will not secure permanent positions. Other agencies, including Treasury and Transportation, have reportedly informed former campaign workers that their positions are ending.\n\nA former campaign staffer, who was not offered a full-time role at his agency, commented, \"The perception (among agency staff) is, we were Mr. Trump's goons who were good at knocking on doors, but can't do much else.\"\n\nSome Cabinet secretaries have privately expressed concerns about being forced to take employees with little or no relevant expertise, according to Politico. However, Trump loyalists maintain they do not deserve to be discarded. A former campaign aide stated, \"As we get further away from Inauguration Day, it is very obvious that no one cares what happens to the people who worked for the campaign or who have loyalty to the president.\"\n\nThe statement, \"The swamp is winning the battle. And longtime campaign staffers are proving to be the first casualties,\" was made by a former campaign aide.",
    " Title: Trump Denies Firing Comey Over Russia Investigation, Contradicts Previous Statements\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington - President Donald Trump has stated that he did not dismiss FBI Director James Comey due to the Russia investigation, contradicting video and documentary evidence to the contrary. In a series of tweets before departing for a fundraising trip to Texas, Trump asserted, \"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!\" He continued, \"The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!\"\n\nTwo days after the May 9, 2017, dismissal, Trump told NBC News that while Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had endorsed Comey's firing, he would have taken the same action without the recommendation, and he cited Russia as a reason. Trump told NBC's Lester Holt, \"And, in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.' It\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should\u2019ve won.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded to Trump's claim, tweeting, \"@realDonaldTrump tweets he did not fire Comey over the Russia investigation. Let's go to the videotape.\"\n\nThe claim came a day after news that former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe authored a memo quoting Rosenstein as saying that Trump asked him to refer to the Russia investigation as a reason for recommending Comey's dismissal. However, the Rosenstein memo referred only to Comey's overall management of the bureau, including his handling of the Hillary Clinton private email server case.\n\nThe day after Comey's firing, Trump reportedly told visiting Russian diplomats, \"I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u2019s taken off.\"\n\nAdditional reporting has revealed that McCabe authored a memo stating that Trump asked Rosenstein to mention Russia in Comey's dismissal, and that Comey believes he was fired because he rebuffed Trump's request to go easy on a central figure in the Russia probe, former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election in order to help Trump.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Nadler Outlines Democratic Strategy for Mueller Report, Impeachment Unlikely\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has stated that Democrats will request documents from dozens of individuals close to the White House this week, as part of investigations into obstruction of justice, corruption, and abuse of power. In an interview with ABC's This Week, Nadler downplayed talk of impeaching President Trump, stating that they do not currently have enough evidence to initiate impeachment proceedings.\n\nNadler indicated that before impeaching a president, they must persuade the American people that such action is necessary. He acknowledged that this could be a high bar, but stated that they may or may not reach this threshold.\n\nOn Monday, Democrats will request documents from 60 people, including Donald Trump Jr. and Trump Organization chief financial officer Allan Weisselberg. The chairman stated that they aim to uncover information regarding Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign, and will subpoena this information if the Justice Department withholds it.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy accused Democrats of engaging in a fishing expedition, claiming they will latch onto whatever they can to impeach the president. Nadler countered that their actions are a result of Michael Cohen's high-profile testimony, which implicated the president in crimes, including pay-offs to a porn actress, Stormy Daniels, on the eve of the election to cover up an alleged affair.\n\nNadler asserted that seeking to sabotage a fair election would be an impeachable offense, but they are currently far from making decisions about impeachment. McCarthy, on the other hand, argued that any violations committed by Cohen, as an attorney, would not be impeachable offenses.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Halts Risk Adjustment Payments for Obamacare Insurers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration announced on Saturday evening a temporary freeze on billions of dollars in payments to health insurance companies intended to help them manage higher-risk patients within the Obamacare marketplace. The move has sparked backlash from the insurance industry's lobbying arm, as insurers continue to struggle to adjust to the administration's repeated attacks on the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).\n\nThe federal government provides risk adjustment payments to Obamacare insurers, which are designed to cushion insurers from taking steep losses on high-risk patients in the Obamacare marketplace. In 2017, the government paid out over $10 billion in these payments.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the halt of these payments on Saturday evening, citing a February 2018 ruling from the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico that invalidates them.\n\n\"We were disappointed by the court's recent ruling,\" CMS Administrator Seema Verma said in a statement. \"As a result of this litigation, billions of dollars in risk adjustment payments and collections are now on hold. CMS has asked the court to reconsider its ruling, and hopes for a prompt resolution that allows CMS to prevent more adverse impacts on Americans who receive their insurance in the individual and small group markets.\"\n\nThe insurance industry is already speaking out against the administration's decision, calling it a crucial blow during a time when insurance companies are trying to come up with premiums and packages for 2019.\n\n\"We are very discouraged by the new market disruption brought about by the decision to freeze risk adjustment payments,\" trade group America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) said in a statement on Saturday. \"This decision comes at a critical time when insurance providers are developing premiums for 2019 and states are reviewing rates.\"\n\nInsurers themselves are voicing concerns for market destabilization following the announcement.\n\n\"This action will significantly increase 2019 premiums for millions of individuals and small business owners and could result in far fewer health plan choices,\" Blue Cross Blue Shield Association President and CEO Scott Serota said in a statement. \"It will undermine Americans' access to affordable coverage, particularly those who need medical care the most.\"\n\nOver the course of his first 18 months in office, the president has targeted Obamacare with a series of moves intended to undermine the system and disrupt the marketplace. The president has rolled back funding for a program intended to help individuals navigate the insurance marketplace, Obamacare's navigator program, signed an executive order to allow for groups to purchase insurance across state lines, stopped federal funding for Obamacare subsidies, pushed for consumer access to more affordable short-term, limited duration health insurance plans, cut Obamacare's open enrollment period in half and its advertising budget 90 percent.\n\nTrump made repealing and replacing Obamacare a key part of his successful bid for the presidency in 2016, but he has, thus far, been unable to materialize that goal. House Republicans passed a bill\u2014the American Health Care Act\u2014in May 2017 after a few months of rocky negotiations that nearly stopped the effort in its tracks. Senate Republicans had a more difficult time, given their 52- and subsequently slim 51-seat majority in the upper chamber. The Senate tried roughly a handful of times in 2017 to repeal and replace Obamacare, offering up a \"skinny repeal\" in July 2017 with no replacement as a last-ditch effort to overhaul the American health care system. That, too, failed to pass muster within the entirety of either the Republican or Democratic conferences.\n\nUltimately, Republicans and the White House have moved on from repealing and replacing Obamacare, although a coalition of outside conservative groups have hopes of reviving the debate in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear he is ready to move on from the issue, but he has said he would entertain a proposal that was guaranteed to get enough votes to pass.",
    " Title: Ambassador to EU Recalled Amidst Impeachment Inquiry; Witnesses Ousted from White House Jobs\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, announced his recall from his position on Friday, stating, \"I was advised today that the president intends to recall me effective immediately as United States Ambassador to the European Union.\" Sondland, who testified during the House impeachment inquiry, had previously stated that \"everyone was in the loop\" regarding an effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden.\n\nThe announcement came hours after Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, another witness in the impeachment inquiry, was ousted from his White House job with the National Security Council. Vindman, a U.S. Army officer, testified about a phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that was at the center of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) commented on the personnel moves, stating, \"Firing Ambassador Sondland and a hero like LTC Vindman for telling the truth is yet more abuse of power by the president.\" Wyden further tweeted, \"These self-serving acts won\u2019t stop until Donald Trump is out of office, or Republicans finally decide to stand up against this petty retaliation.\"\n\nSondland, a political appointee, is a hotel magnate who donated $1 million to President Trump's inaugural committee through companies he controls. Tom Fitton, an ally of the president who heads the watchdog group Judicial Watch, approvingly called the personnel moves \"cleaning house.\"\n\nSen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, described the ousters of Sondland, Lt. Col. Vindman, and his twin brother, Yevgeny, from the National Security Council as \"clear political retaliation, the likes of which is seen only in authoritarian countries around the world.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) noted that Sondland is a political appointee who serves at the pleasure of the president. Rubio also stated that Lt. Col. Vindman wasn't \"fired,\" but is still an Army officer. \"He was assigned to NSC to serve the President who has a right to have people he trusts on his staff,\" Rubio said.",
    " Title: Unintended Consequences of the Affordable Care Act: Reduction in Full-Time Jobs and Impact on Self-Funded Health Plans\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has several unintended consequences, according to Republican strategist Karl Rove. One of these consequences is a decrease in full-time jobs and an increase in part-time jobs.\n\nIn a Wall Street Journal opinion piece titled \"Here Comes the Unaffordable Careless Act,\" Rove points out that the Affordable Care Act requires companies with at least 50 workers to provide health insurance to any employee who works more than 30 hours a week or face a fine. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of hourly employees working 30-34 hours a week decreased by an average of 146,500 a month over the past year, while the number working 25-29 hours increased by 119,000 a month.\n\nRove argues that this lack of hours can particularly affect single working mothers and younger workers. He also suggests that the 50-employee threshold may prevent businesses from growing beyond that size, leading the U.S. to follow in the footsteps of countries with sclerotic economies.\n\nAdditionally, Obamacare is expected to damage businesses with self-funded health plans, according to Rove. These companies serve as their own insurer, gathering premiums and paying claims filed by their workers. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey shows that 61 percent of workers are in self-funded plans. Rove claims that more companies have an incentive to choose self-funding because the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) governs self-funded plans, not the Affordable Care Act. ERISA allows self-funded plans to charge premiums based on risk, offer a wider menu of options, and avoid expensive provisions such as Obamacare's new tax on insurance policies.\n\nHowever, Rove notes that Obamacare supporters do not like the success of these programs in curbing premium increases and managing costs. Delaware, New York, and Oregon have already forbidden small- and mid-size companies from using self-insurance plans, and administrators of self-funded plans worry that new Labor Secretary Thomas Perez will issue regulations that erode the attractiveness of self-funded plans and push more companies' health policies into Obamacare's \"morass.\"\n\nFurthermore, Rove states that the amount of uninsured Americans will not drop below 30 million in the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. This contradicts Obamacare's promise of \"universal\" coverage.",
    " Title: Court Documents Detail Aggressive Sales Techniques of Trump University\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal judge has released hundreds of pages of court documents related to Trump University, the real estate and investment training venture of former President Donald Trump that has been the subject of lawsuits from former students. The records include a sales guide and strategies for selling courses and mentoring sessions to students, often emphasizing the \"Gold\" level courses that cost nearly $35,000.\n\nThe documents, released in response to a request from The Washington Post, were categorized into two main sections: depositions from Trump University executives and \"playbooks\" detailing marketing and sales strategies. The topics range from expense reporting to sales techniques in various environments, from one-off preview events to three-day sessions. Most of the pages are marked \"Confidential.\"\n\nTips for dealing with the news media are included in the 2008 edition of the playbook, starting with directing any reporters to a Trump media contact. The playbooks were released on the same day that Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, called ABC News reporter Tom Llamas \"a sleaze\" during a news conference.\n\nThe playbooks, spanning several years, also include suggested responses to customers who balk at a sale, offering rebuttals to objections that range from a need to consult a spouse to a reluctance to go into debt. The 2010 Playbook requires sales staff to \"Be Deliberate.\"\n\n\"Be deliberate and conscious when communicating to potential students,\" the sales guide states. \"Remember that we have time to think and plan and develop questions and commands that lead people into a flow that they must deal with and respond to. Without a game plan, you are required to respond to them and do much more thinking on your feet. Remember that we need to stay on 'offense.'\"\n\nThe playbook also advises Trump's sales teams not to let a lack of money be used as an excuse for turning down Trump University's three-day training. \"Money is never a reason for not enrolling in Trump University,\" the sales guide states, adding, \"if they really believe in you and your product, they will find the money.\"\n\nThe documents and records were ordered to be released by U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel of the Southern District of California, who has been the subject of personal attacks from Donald Trump. Trump previously questioned whether Curiel's Hispanic heritage made him biased due to Trump's support for building a wall on the Mexican border.\n\nThe documents stem from lawsuits filed by Trump University's customers back in 2013; their case gained new prominence back in February when Trump's Republican rival Marco Rubio brought them up during a debate. After that debate, Michael Isikoff, the chief investigative correspondent for Yahoo! News, spoke to NPR's Robert Siegel about the former students' complaints against Trump.",
    " Title: Mistrial Declared in Corruption Trial of U.S. Senator Bob Menendez\n\nArticle:\n\nA mistrial was declared on Thursday in the corruption trial of New Jersey's Democratic U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, following a jury's inability to reach a verdict on bribery, fraud, and other charges. The hung jury marked a victory for Menendez and a setback for federal prosecutors in what was the Justice Department's first high-profile corruption trial since a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year limited its ability to bring such cases.\n\nMenendez, 63, a longtime political figure in New Jersey who joined the Senate in 2006, was accused of accepting private flights, campaign contributions, and other bribes from a wealthy patron, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for official favors.\n\nOne juror, Ed Norris, told reporters that the panel was split 10-2 in favor of acquittal, which could discourage the government from pursuing a second trial. It remains unclear whether prosecutors will seek to retry Menendez, who is expected to run for re-election next year. In a statement, the Justice Department said it would \"carefully consider next steps.\"\n\nRepublican Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, called for the Senate's ethics committee to investigate the allegations against Menendez. The committee said it would resume its inquiry, which was put on hold in 2013 to allow the criminal probe to proceed.\n\nIn a statement outside the courthouse in Newark, New Jersey, a tearful Menendez thanked God, his family, the jurors, and two senators who testified on his behalf as character witnesses, Democrat Cory Booker and Republican Lindsey Graham.\n\n\"The way this case started was wrong,\" said Menendez, flanked by his grown children. \"The way it was investigated was wrong. The way it was prosecuted was wrong. The way it was tried was wrong as well.\"\n\n\"To those who were digging my political grave so they could jump into my seat: I know who you are, and I won't forget you,\" he said.\n\nThe mistrial provides at least a temporary measure of relief for Menendez's Democratic colleagues in the Senate, where Republicans likely would have pushed for resignation or expulsion if Menendez had been convicted.\n\nDuring the 10-week trial, prosecutors accused Menendez of pressuring Medicare officials to change the agency's billing practices after it concluded that Melgen overbilled it by millions of dollars. Melgen, Menendez's co-defendant in the corruption trial, was separately convicted in Florida earlier this year of a massive Medicare fraud.\n\nAccording to the government, Menendez also helped secure visas for the married Melgen's foreign girlfriends and asked U.S. officials to resolve a port dispute in the Dominican Republic involving one of Melgen's businesses. In exchange, Melgen showered the senator with luxury vacations and hundreds of thousands of campaign dollars, prosecutors said. Defense attorneys said prosecutors cherry-picked gifts exchanged between close friends to suggest impropriety when none existed.",
    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Community Accuses Russia of Undermining American Democracy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States intelligence community has concluded with high confidence that President Putin personally ordered his security services to undertake an influence campaign aimed at undermining confidence in American democracy and sowing chaos in the electoral system. Russia's efforts to hack political organizations and state election boards are well-documented, as are the Russian disinformation campaigns on social media platforms.\n\nRussia is identified as an adversary not just of the United States but of freedom-loving people everywhere. Disinformation and chaos is a Russian art form developed during the Soviet era, which Russia has now updated using modern tools. The result has been Russian disinformation spreading like a virus throughout the Western world. From elections in Britain, France, and Montenegro to invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, Moscow has pursued an aggressive foreign policy aimed at spreading disorder and expanding Russian influence in states formerly under the heel of Soviet Communism.\n\nThese efforts weaken U.S. allies and strengthen those who seek to undermine the democratic order that has helped prevent another world war in Europe since 1945. The threat of Russian meddling in United States elections is not behind us. Just last week, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, cautioned that \"the warning lights are blinking red\" that Russia and other adversaries will undertake further cyberattacks on the digital infrastructure. This includes many of the energy companies in South and West Texas.\n\nMany of the author's constituents have asked what Congress can do to protect the American people from Russian threats and provide a check on the executive branch's demonstration in Helsinki. If necessary, Congress should take the lead on European security issues as it has in recent years. For example, during the Obama administration, Congress repeatedly pressed the president\u2014using the power of the purse through appropriations bills\u2014to send lethal weaponry to assist Ukraine in its fight against Russian-backed separatists.\n\nLast year, Congress passed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act to impose severe sanctions on Russia as retaliation for its meddling in the presidential election. And this year, the House passed the Ukraine Cybersecurity Cooperation Act to improve Ukraine's ability to respond to Russian-supported disinformation and propaganda efforts. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations has also asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to testify on the president's recent meetings with both Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin.",
    " Title: Trump's 1995 Tax Return Leak: A Look at the Financial Loss and Carried Forward Losses\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent leak of Donald Trump's 1995 tax return by the New York Times has sparked a political debate, with the return showing a significant financial loss of over $900 million. This loss could have allowed Trump to carry forward against taxable income for up to 18 years.\n\nThe article suggests that this leak might be the first in a series of political attacks against Trump in the lead-up to the November election. It is noted that Trump should have disclosed his tax returns to prevent such leaks and potential political damage.\n\nThe article discusses Trump's investment in the Atlantic City gaming and tourism market, which was heavily impacted by the legalization of gambling in various parts of the United States during the early 1990s. The losses in 1995, resulting from the bankruptcy of Trump's casinos in Atlantic City, are seen as a reflection of the market's decline.\n\nThe article also addresses the controversy surrounding Trump's ability to carry forward his losses to minimize his tax burden in better years. It is argued that this practice is common in businesses and is not necessarily a \"loophole.\" The article cites statistics from the Tax Foundation, stating that about 1 million taxpayers had a net operating loss in 1995.\n\nThe article criticizes the New York Times for anonymously leaking Trump's tax information, stating that Trump, as an American citizen, has the right to keep his returns private. The article questions the identity of the leaker, suggesting potential involvement from the IRS, state revenue departments, lawyers, or accountants.\n\nThe article concludes by emphasizing the importance of uncovering the leaker and prosecuting them for violating Trump's confidentiality. The article also expresses concern about the \"corrupt enemies on the Left\" and the potential threat they pose to freedom and the rule of law.",
    " Title: Trump Transition Team Accuses Special Counsel's Office of Unlawful Email Acquisition from GSA\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office has responded to explosive accusations by Kory Langhofer, the attorney for President Donald Trump's transition team, that the investigators looking into claims of collusion with Moscow during the campaign unlawfully received tens of thousands of emails from the General Services Administration (GSA).\n\nIn a seven-page letter sent to the Senate Homeland Security Committee and the House Oversight Committee, Langhofer claimed that employees of the GSA, which holds all the transition documents, unlawfully produced TFA's private materials, including privileged communications, to the special counsel's office. The GSA, according to Langhofer, handed over the requested \"copies of the emails, laptops, cell phones, and other materials\" of 13 members of the transition team even though the agency \"did not own or control the records in question.\"\n\nThe transition emails are said to include sensitive exchanges on matters such as potential appointments, gossip about the views of particular senators involved in the confirmation process, speculation about vulnerabilities of Trump nominees, strategizing about press statements, and policy planning on everything from war to taxes. A source told Axios that the transition team will be sending a letter to Mueller asking for some emails to be returned because they're privileged.\n\nHowever, Mueller's team has pushed back against these claims. Peter Carr, Mueller's spokesman, stated, \"When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner's consent or appropriate criminal process.\"\n\nGSA Deputy Counsel Lenny Loewentritt also contradicted the claims made by Trump's transition team. Loewentritt specifically rejected a claim by the transition lawyer that the late GSA general counsel made a commitment to inform Trump's team if there were specific requests for any documents because the campaign \"owned and controlled\" emails that were sent at the time. In an interview with BuzzFeed, Loewentritt said that the truth is the exact opposite because the transition team was clearly told that \"in using our devices,\" materials \"would not be held back in any law enforcement\" actions.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti took to Twitter to explain why Trump's transition team is \"playing politics\" but the issue itself \"is a bad sign for them.\" Mariotti noted that what is unusual in this case is that Mueller's team got the emails from the GSA rather than the Trump transition. That, according to Mariotti, suggests \"Mueller was concerned that he wouldn't receive all of the emails if he obtained them from the Trump team,\" implying that he has reason to distrust Trump's team.\n\nMariotti also made clear that \"disputes over privilege are common when prosecutors obtain emails and documents from third parties.\" He further stated that the privilege claims could have been easily resolved with a letter to Mueller rather than Congress, noting that's the biggest hint that the ultimate goal is to taint the investigation.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell also dismissed the supposed complaints by the transition team as much ado about nothing, stating on Twitter, \"Private documents' on a U.S. Government, public email system? What are they afraid was found? Baloney. This is another attempt to discredit Mueller as his #TrumpRussia probe tightens.\"",
    " Title: John Bolton's Departure from Trump Administration: Motives and Principles\n\nArticle:\n\nJohn Bolton, the former National Security Advisor to President Donald Trump, has revealed in a forthcoming book that he was distressed by Trump's actions regarding NATO, Russia, and Ukraine, among other issues. This, according to reports, may have influenced Bolton's decision to resign from his position in the Trump administration.\n\nBolton, a seasoned government professional with a career spanning various diplomatic roles, including ambassador to the United Nations, undersecretary of state, assistant secretary of state, and assistant attorney general, reportedly viewed Trump's actions as a breach of foreign policy professionalism.\n\nIn the book, Bolton is said to have characterized Trump's dealings with Ukraine as a \"drug deal,\" a metaphor for actions that violate his sense of foreign policy professionalism. He also reportedly disdained the president's circumvention of normal diplomatic channels by informally enlisting Rudolph Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, whom Bolton called a \"hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\"\n\nWhile speculation about Bolton's motivations for leaving the administration has included personal indignation and financial gain, the book's release, set for March 17, is expected to make it an instant bestseller. However, it is unclear to what extent these factors influenced Bolton's decision-making.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bolton served for almost a year and a half under a president known for his mercurial nature, and toward the end of his tenure, reports suggest he was unhappy in the role. Furthermore, the reported $2 million advance for his book did not necessitate the revelations to make it a hot item or line his pockets.\n\nIn conclusion, while the exact reasons for John Bolton's departure from the Trump administration remain somewhat unclear, his reported principles, professional and personal indignation, and potential financial gain are likely factors in his decision.",

He cited the shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Columbine, Colorado, as examples of gun violence that were not addressed in debates held in Denver.\n\nJackson also pointed out that the poorest county in America is located in Kentucky, the state that hosted the vice presidential debate. He noted that no moderator had raised the issue of poverty or low credit scores, despite the fact that 50 million people are living in poverty and another 50 million have such low credit scores that they cannot borrow money from banks.\n\nIn addition to poverty, Jackson expressed frustration with the scarce attention given to \"voter suppression.\" He stated that voter suppression and roll purging could potentially result in a candidate winning a debate but losing the election.\n\nDespite his criticisms, Jackson praised President Barack Obama's performance in Tuesday's presidential debate, describing him as \"alive and vibrant\" and noting that he \"punched and counterpunched.\"\n\nRegarding his son, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.), who is currently on a medical leave of absence and is reportedly under criminal investigation, Jackson said that his son is \"still recovering and under medical supervision.\"",

The speech, billed as commander-in-chief-worthy by supporters, did not meet the expected standards, with Biden focusing on criticizing Trump rather than presenting a unified response to the growing pandemic.\n\nBiden accused Trump of ignoring science, having an \"adversarial relationship with the truth,\" and promoting racism. He stated, \"Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration.\" Biden argued that effective leadership requires open-mindedness and cooperation across national boundaries, stating that the government's response has been undermined by the Trump administration's actions.\n\nBiden proposed several solutions to combat the virus, including rejoining the Paris climate accord, which some of the members of his newly unveiled \"Public Health Advisory Committee\" support. The former vice president also accused Trump of sowing fear and racial division, particularly in his approach to China's role in the pandemic. Biden claimed that Trump's efforts to hold China accountable for failing to contain the virus were emboldening racism and \"xenophobia.\"\n\nThe speech followed the announcement of Biden's \"Public Health Advisory Committee,\" a group tasked with providing guidance on the pandemic. The political leanings of some committee members were made evident by the proposals included in Biden's speech, such as rejoining the Paris climate accord. The former vice president also condemned acts of racism and xenophobia against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community.",
    " Title: Pennsylvania Woman Dies in Jail While Serving Sentence for Unpaid School Fines\n\nA Pennsylvania woman, Eileen DiNino, passed away in a jail cell over the weekend while serving a 48-hour sentence for unpaid school fines related to her children's attendance. The cause of her death is yet to be determined, and the police have stated that it is not considered suspicious. DiNino was 55 years old and a mother to seven children.\n\nDistrict Judge Dean Patton, who expressed reluctance in sentencing DiNino, stated that \"We don't do debtors prisons anymore. That went out 100 years ago.\" More than 1,600 people have been jailed in Berks County alone due to similar fines, with the majority being women.\n\nPatton stated that he has lost sleep over DiNino's death. He acknowledged that a short jail stint can sometimes \"break the habit\" of parents who prefer partying into the night instead of taking their children to school the next day. The county started a program a few years ago that gives families 30 to 60 days to keep daily logs of each class and assignment. Patton estimated that the district truancy rate had dropped more than 30 percent due to this program.\n\nDiNino, according to Patton, did not work or appear to have much help with four children still at home. She frequently skipped hearings or arrived without the required documents. \"She cared about her kids, but her kids ruled the roost,\" Patton said. \"She was just accepting what was coming, and (would) let the cards fall where they may.\"\n\nBerks County Commissioner Kevin Barnhardt, chairman of the county prison board, expressed outrage that DiNino died alone and away from her family while serving a sentence for being poor. \"This woman died in prison, away from her family,\" Barnhardt said. \"And for what?\"\n\nThe circumstances of DiNino's death serve as a stark and tragic reminder of how being poor is considered a crime worthy of punishment in the United States. Thousands have been jailed in Berks County for failure to pay truancy fines, but court fees and other fines have put thousands of others behind bars across the country. An investigation by National Public Radio revealed instances such as a homeless man being sentenced to a year in jail for inability to pay a $2,600 penalty for shoplifting a $2 can of beer, and a teenager being jailed for three days for inability to pay the fine associated with catching a fish out of season.",
    " Title: U.S. Welcomes Home Three Americans Released from North Korean Detention\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump welcomed home three American citizens who were released from detention in North Korea early Thursday morning. The three men, Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak Song, and Kim Sang Dok, were greeted by Trump and First Lady Melania Trump at Joint Base Andrews.\n\nThe three men, who are of Korean-American descent and share the common surname Kim but are not related, were flown to Washington after their release, which was facilitated by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Pompeo had traveled to Pyongyang on Tuesday in an attempt to secure the detainees' release.\n\nKim Dong Chul, who was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor in 2016 on charges of espionage for South Korea, expressed his gratitude for being home when asked how it felt. He stated, \"We were treated in many different ways. For me, I had to do a lot of labor. But when I got sick, I was also treated by them.\"\n\nThe return of the prisoners clears an obstacle for direct talks between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump expects to announce a date and location for the summit within days and has ruled out the Korea Peninsula's Demilitarized Zone. An administration official has indicated that Singapore is the preferred location for the summit.\n\nTrump thanked Kim for releasing the men and expressed optimism about the upcoming summit, stating, \"I really think we have a very good chance of doing something very meaningful. I really think he wants to do something and bring that country into the real world.\"\n\nSenator Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, cautioned against taking a victory lap until a deal is in place. \"A word of caution: We're not there yet,\" King said on CNN.\n\nThe three men were handed over to Pompeo during his second visit to Pyongyang this year. Asked if he might visit Pyongyang himself in the future, Trump said, \"It could happen.\"\n\nThe former detainees expressed their gratitude in a statement as they flew to Washington, stating, \"We would like to express our deep appreciation to the United States government, President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, and the people of the United States for bringing us home.\"\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who joined Trump at the homecoming, stated that all three men \"seem to be in good health\" and were glad to be heading home. Pence also spoke with the parents of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who was detained in North Korea for trying to steal a propaganda poster from a hotel and died shortly after being returned home in a coma last year.\n\nAfter meeting Trump and Pence, the former detainees were transported to Walter Reed military hospital in Bethesda, Maryland for evaluation and treatment. Vice President Pence is scheduled to sit for interviews with NBC, ABC, and CBS to be broadcast on their morning news programs.\n\nDuring an interview with CBS News, Pence stated, \"Promises were made and then promises were broken. But the promises weren't made by North Korea until there were concessions. Kim's agreement to release the three gives us hope that this may be different.\"",

The decision was made following the revelation that Brazile had leaked debate questions to the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, as shown in the hacked Podesta emails.\n\nIn one of the emails, Brazile wrote, \"From time to time I get the questions in advance,\" with the subject head \"From time to time I get the questions in advance.\" In another email, she provided a sneak peek of a question that would be asked by a Flint \"woman with a rash,\" inquiring about Clinton's plans for Flint as president.\n\nBrazile's actions were deemed wrong, as she violated an implied oath that the partisanship that got her the job would not include such open and shut chicanery. The primary debates were not reduced to a shambles, but Brazile's deceit has brought to light an ugly aspect of news talk that may go unremedied.\n\nThe issue at hand is not just one corrupt act but the entire ecosystem of paid partisan commentators. The news shows rely on these individuals not for their political insights but as a cheap form of on-air talent to fill the 24/7 programming needs. A partial list of notable politicians or political operators who have worked their way into TV includes Tim Russert, Bill Bradley, George Stephanopoulos, Joe Scarborough, Van Jones, William Safire, James Carville, Jeffrey Lord, Kayleigh McEnany, Pat Buchanan, Rick Santorum, Paul Begala, David Gergen, Chris Matthews, Peggy Noonan, Sarah Palin, Jennifer Granholm, David Axelrod, Tony Blankley, Mary Matalin, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Mike Huckabee, John Bolton, Newt Gingrich, Eliot Spitzer, and Corey Lewandowski.\n\nThese individuals are hired not for their political insights but because they are known quantities who provide safe and predictable idle talk. By dividing their partisan contributors between Republicans and Democrats, TV creates the illusion of impartiality and inclusion. The contributors take the job because it's easy, and the face-time makes them more marketable on the lecture circuit.\n\nNot every TV contributor moment is a complete botch. Most of these people, with the exception of Lewandowski, know something about politics. However, they tend to conform to the expectations of the producers putting on the show, hit their marks, fill the dead spaces with palaver, keep the commercials from bumping into one another, and sit at attention until called on or interrupt should the show stall.\n\nWhat transpires during the paid contributor segments is not journalism, not politics, and rarely entertaining. It's not in, say, David Axelrod's interests to share a damaging insight about Barack Obama, the horse he rode to prominence on. Almost to a one, the contributors pull punches and dilute the political conversation to the weakest of teas so the people in the bar and riding the elliptical trainers at the gym don't have to strain to follow the Punch and Judy of it all.\n\nInstead of deploying political hacks, the news shows would be smarter to hire journalists whose job it would be to extract meaningful information from the political hacks. Under this scheme, the Braziles and Carvilles and Palins could still be interviewed on TV, but they couldn't draw pay\u2014and they'd have to have something worthy to say or accept having the camera cut away from them.\n\nDonna Brazile is probably sipping a cocktail tonight somewhere in Washington, wondering what hit her. CNN hired her to be a partisan, although not as much as her real employer, and what can be more partisan than leaking valuable political intelligence to help your side? Did CNN really think that the elementary concepts of journalistic fairness would govern her conduct?",
    " Title: Washington State City's Minimum Wage Hike to Set Highest Rate in U.S., Employers Face Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nAs discussions intensify on Capitol Hill regarding a potential increase in the federal minimum wage, the city of SeaTac, Washington, is set to establish the highest minimum wage rate in the nation, starting on January 1. Approximately 1,600 hotel and transportation workers in SeaTac will see their pay rise to $15 per hour, a 60 percent increase from the state's current minimum wage of $9.32.\n\nWhile many workers welcome the higher pay, employers are seeking ways to manage the significant increase in labor costs. Some are considering job eliminations. Cedarbrook Lodge General Manager Scott Ostrander stated, \"We're going to be looking at making some serious cuts. We're going to be looking at reducing employee hours, reducing benefits, and eliminating some positions.\"\n\nIn the short term, these cuts are expected, but the Cedarbrook Lodge plans to offset the higher labor costs by building an addition to the hotel. The aim is to increase revenue to cover the increased wages. However, not every employer is as ambitious. One has announced plans to close one of its two restaurants, eliminating 200 jobs.\n\nThe minimum wage increase has also caused Han Kim, who runs Hotel Concepts, a company that owns and manages 11 hotels in Washington state, to postpone plans to build a hotel in SeaTac. The company already has three hotels in SeaTac, and Kim and a business partner were looking to build a fourth on land they own. \"Uncertainty is bad for business, and right now we're right in that area, so we're just putting everything on hold,\" Kim said.\n\nOpponents of the $15 minimum wage scored a legal victory late last week when a King County, Washington, judge ruled that it does not apply to any of the workers at the SeaTac airport. Superior Court Judge Andrea Darvas ruled that only the Port of Seattle can set wage and other work rules at the airport, eliminating 4,700 workers from the successful ballot initiative.\n\nBackers of the $15 minimum wage have vowed to appeal the ruling up to the state Supreme Court. One of the biggest supporters is Kshama Sawant, a socialist who also won her election to the Seattle City Council. She plans on making Seattle the next city to have a $15 minimum wage. \"There may be a few jobs lost here and there, but the fact is, if we don't fight for this, then the race to the bottom will continue,\" Sawant said.\n\nSawant is skeptical that the higher minimum wage will lead to mass layoffs. However, the American Car Rental Association estimates that 5 percent of low-wage jobs will be cut, and another 5-10 percent of those workers will be replaced by more experienced workers. The owner of Dollar Rental Cars told Fox News she will outsource some functions, change schedules, and cut some staff in response to the new policy.",
    " Title: Minneapolis Mayor Frey Rejects Calls to Abolish Police Department; City Council Members Advocate for Defunding\n\nArticle:\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has reiterated his opposition to abolishing the city's police force, contradicting a veto-proof majority of Minneapolis City Council members who have expressed support for the drastic step in response to the in-custody death of George Floyd.\n\nOn Sunday, Frey, who ordered the evacuation of a police station during riots last month, faced a large gathering of demonstrators near his home. He was booed and shouted down when he defied their demands to dismantle the city's police forces entirely.\n\n\"I'll work relentlessly with Chief [Medaria] Arradondo and alongside community toward deep, structural reform and addressing systemic racism in police culture,\" Frey said in a statement to KARE. \"We're ready to dig in and enact more community-led, public safety strategies on behalf of our city. But, I do not support abolishing the Minneapolis Police Department.\"\n\nBefore the crowd, Frey had prefaced his comments by saying he was \"coming to grips\" with his \"own brokenness,\" and by promising to put the police union \"in its place.\" However, many protesters were unconvinced, shouting, \"It's not about you!\" and \"Go home, Jacob, go home!\"\n\nNine city council members spoke at a protest at Powderhorn Park on Sunday, representing a veto-proof majority to push the measure through, according to Fox 9. Council President Lisa Bender, VP Andrea Jenkins, and Councilmembers Alondra Cano, Jeremiah Ellison, Steve Fletcher, Phillipe Cunningham, Cam Gordon, and Jeremy Schroeder were among those in attendance.\n\nCouncilmember Jeremiah Ellison, the son of state Attorney General Keith Ellison, has openly declared his support for Antifa, the left-wing group that President Trump has sought to designate as a terrorist organization. Most members of the city council have belonged to the Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party.\n\n\"Our commitment is to end our city's toxic relationship with the Minneapolis Police Department,\" Bender said. \"It is clear that our system of policing is not keeping our communities safe. Our efforts at incremental reform have failed, period.\"\n\nBender went on to say she and the eight other council members that joined the rally were committed to ending the city's relationship with the police force and \"to end policing as we know it and recreate systems that actually keep us safe.\"\n\nOn Monday, Bender told CNN that people worried about having no one to call during a home invasion were speaking from a \"place of privilege.\" Those comments drew widespread backlash.\n\nEllison, for his part, promised that the council would \"dismantle\" the department.\n\nNationally, efforts to defund the police have been broadly unpopular, with only about 20 percent of Americans favoring reductions in police forces. Citing publicly available data, commentators have asserted that the very idea of systemic racism by police is questionable.\n\nIn 2018, African-Americans made up 53% of known homicide offenders in the U.S. and committed about 60% of robberies, though they are 13% of the population, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal this week. In 2018, there were 7,407 black homicide victims. Assuming a comparable number of victims last year, those nine unarmed black victims of police shootings represented 0.1% of all African-Americans killed in 2019. By contrast, a police officer is 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male is to be killed by a police officer.\n\nA 2015 Justice Department analysis of the Philadelphia Police Department found that white police officers were less likely than black or Hispanic officers to shoot unarmed black suspects. Research by Harvard economist Roland G. Fryer Jr. also found no evidence of racial discrimination in shootings. Any evidence to the contrary fails to take into account crime rates and civilian behavior before and during interactions with police.\n\nFryer's work has also determined that when police pull out of communities, black deaths tend to increase.\n\nDisbanding an entire department has happened before. In 2012, with crime rampant in Camden, New Jersey, the city disbanded its ineffective union-run police department and replaced it with a new force that covered Camden County. Compton, California, took the same step in 2000, shifting its policing to Los Angeles County.\n\nThe move to defund or abolish the Minneapolis department is far from assured, with the civil rights investigation likely to unfold over the next several months.",
    " Title: Voter Fraud Ring Busted in Los Angeles: Nine Accused of Forging Signatures for Ballot Measures and Voter Registration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn Los Angeles, a voter fraud ring has been uncovered, with nine individuals accused of forging signatures on state ballot measure petitions and voter registration forms. The accused, who face several criminal charges including circulating a petition with fake names, voter fraud, and registering a fictitious person, reportedly lured the homeless with cash and cigarettes in exchange for their forged signatures.\n\nThe district attorney's office announced the charges on Tuesday, three weeks after the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) conducted a crackdown on suspected election fraud on skid row. The defendants, some of whom were scheduled for arraignment on Tuesday, are alleged to have approached homeless individuals on skid row and asked them to forge signatures.\n\nThe charges follow a report by The Los Angeles Times, which stated that the forged signature exchange occurred hundreds of times during the 2016 and 2020 election cycles. Los Angeles elections chief, Dean Logan, told the publication that his staff, which manually compares signatures, did not let the forgeries slip through. However, he expressed concern about any activity that undermines voter trust in the system.\n\nThis is not the first instance of voter fraud in the United States. Similar incidents have been reported in states such as Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. The issue of voter fraud has been a contentious topic, with some arguing it is rare, while others claim it can potentially impact election outcomes. It is important to note that the frequency and impact of voter fraud remain subjects of debate.",
    " Title: Michael Cohen Identified as Legal Representative for Fox News Host Sean Hannity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a federal court hearing on Monday, it was revealed that Donald Trump's longtime attorney, Michael Cohen, has been representing Fox News host Sean Hannity. The disclosure came as part of a dispute over evidence seized by the FBI from Cohen's home and office earlier this month.\n\nFederal judge Kimba Wood ordered an attorney for Cohen to reveal the identity of a client that Cohen's team had withheld in earlier court documents. Cohen and Trump had sought either to permit them to review the material before prosecutors got to see it or to appoint an independent \"special master.\"\n\nThe judge stated that she could not decide about how seriously to treat Cohen's and Trump's claims about attorney-client privilege unless she knew what clients Cohen has been representing. As a result, an attorney for Cohen, who had asked whether he could submit the name to the judge in a sealed envelope or to the \"special master,\" had no choice but to reveal it in open court.\n\nCohen's attorney had previously identified two other clients: Trump and Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy. These men are involved in cases in which Cohen allegedly arranged payments to women to keep them quiet about alleged sexual encounters. Cohen has acknowledged paying pornographic actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 shortly before the 2016 election for what her lawyer said was silence about her alleged liaison with Trump in 2006. Cohen also reportedly arranged a deal for Broidy in which model Shera Bechard was paid $1.6 million when she became pregnant after an affair.\n\nTrump denies any sexual relationship with Daniels. Broidy acknowledged the affair with Bechard and apologized to his family. There was no indication as to whether Hannity might have been involved in such an arrangement. Hannity issued a statement on Monday afternoon that said his discussions with Cohen had never involved anyone else.\n\n\"Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter,\" Hannity said. \"I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective. I assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter between me and a third party.\"\n\nHannity said separately on Twitter that his discussions with Cohen \"dealt almost exclusively about real estate.\"\n\nHannity has been a vocal supporter of Trump and Cohen on his show and a critic of the FBI and Justice Department. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Hannity's show last week that the FBI raid on Cohen was like the abuses of the \"Gestapo.\"\n\nAfter a long hearing on Monday, Wood said she had concluded the hearing without deciding whether to appoint the \"special master\" sought by Cohen or to permit the Justice Department's \"filter team\" to continue its work. While federal investigators will retain possession of what was seized, they still cannot look at the substance yet even as they are cataloging the amount of papers, electronic files, and other materials.",
    " Title: Americans' Dissatisfaction with Obama's Handling of ISIS and National Security, According to New CNN/ORC Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nA new CNN/ORC poll released on Monday indicates that Americans are increasingly displeased with President Barack Obama's handling of ISIS and foreign affairs, national security, and terrorism. The survey suggests a growing belief among Americans that the fight against ISIS is going poorly.\n\nThe poll shows that 57% disapprove of Obama's handling of foreign affairs, 54% disapprove of his handling of terrorism, and 60% rate him negatively on his handling of electronic national security.\n\nThe declining approval ratings for Obama on national security come as a weekend of international turmoil further underscores the growing threats abroad. Egypt launched a second round of airstrikes against Islamic State strongholds in Libya on Monday, in response to a video released Sunday that appeared to show ISIS militants beheading a group of 21 Egyptian Christians.\n\nObama issued a statement condemning the killing of the Christians on Sunday night, but his Republican opponents have consistently argued that the growing Islamic State threat is exacerbated by what they see as his weak leadership.\n\nIn the poll, Americans increasingly believe the U.S. military action against ISIS is going badly, with 58% saying so in the latest survey, up from 49% who said the fight was not going well in October. Even among Democrats, nearly half\u201446%\u2014say things are not going well in the battle against ISIS.\n\nAbout half of respondents, 51%, say they trust the President as Commander-in-Chief of the military. However, support for sending ground troops to Iraq and Syria to confront the threat appears to be growing. In November, just 43% supported deploying ground troops, while 55% of Americans opposed it; now the number in support has ticked up to 47%, the highest level of support yet measured, with just half of Americans opposed.\n\nThe parties have become more polarized on the prospect since November, with 61% of Democrats opposed and a similar majority of Republicans supportive of the prospect, an eight-point increase. Independents, meanwhile, are split, with 48% in favor and 50% opposed.\n\nThe prospect of sending in ground troops remains a sticking point for both congressional Democrats and Republicans in the debate over Obama's Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF), which would give him legal authority to combat ISIS. However, the AUMF, and Obama's decision to go to Congress for the official authority to continue battling ISIS, is widely popular, according to the new poll.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of Americans say Congress should give Obama the authority to fight ISIS, a slight decline from 82% who supported it in December. A similarly large majority say Obama was right to ask Congress for the authority, rather than proceeding with the battle unilaterally.\n\nThe survey was conducted among 1,027 adult Americans from Feb. 12-15, and has a margin of sampling error of 3%.",
    " Title: White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's Inaccurate Statements Regarding Michael Flynn's Contact with Russian Ambassador\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the early days of the Donald Trump administration, Press Secretary Sean Spicer made inaccurate statements regarding National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's contact with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\n\nOn the first official workday of Trump's presidency, Spicer, during his inaugural briefing, stated that there had only been one call between Flynn and Kislyak. This was proven false three weeks later when The Washington Post reported that Flynn had allegedly discussed U.S.-imposed sanctions on Russia with Kislyak and had misled the White House about the nature of their conversation. Flynn resigned on February 13.\n\nLess than three weeks after Flynn's resignation, it was also revealed that Spicer's assertion about the single call was false. The White House confirmed that Flynn had met with Kislyak alongside Jared Kushner, Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law, in December. This meeting was first reported by The New York Times and later confirmed by The Hive.\n\nA White House official explained that Spicer was not aware of the meeting with Kushner, Flynn, and Kislyak because Kushner had met with numerous foreign officials throughout the transition. This has become a common line of defense in the White House, as aides struggle to explain the interactions, topics discussed, and reasons for Kislyak's ubiquity during a time of a cyber quasi-war between Russia and the Obama administration.\n\nIt remains unclear why Flynn was unforthcoming about his meetings with Kislyak, or why those within the Trump administration who were aware of Flynn's misdirection chose to conceal that information from others, including Vice President Mike Pence. It is also unclear who knew that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had met with Kislyak during the election season, as Sessions recused himself from any investigations pertaining to Russia and the Trump campaign. Spicer apparently was not aware of Flynn's discussions or the meeting with Kushner, Flynn, and Kislyak, and Trump has stated he did not know about Sessions' sit-down with the ambassador either.",
    " Title: Army Regulations Determine Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's Discharge Status\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Army is expected to discharge Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl upon the expiration of his active duty commitment, unless the Army proceeds with a court-martial, according to military law expert Charles Gittins. The decision comes down to Army regulations that dictate how service members are discharged.\n\nThose still serving their enlistment commitment are treated differently than someone like Sgt. Bergdahl, who has completed his agreement and is on an administrative hold. A non-hold active duty soldier whom the Army wanted to discharge could be sent to an administrative board. However, Sgt. Bergdahl, who is awaiting an Army decision on whether he will face criminal charges for walking off his base in Afghanistan on June 30, 2009, and becoming an enemy captive until last May, is not subject to this process.\n\n\"You can't administratively discharge someone after their EAS [End of Active Service] has expired,\" said Gittins. \"If he is on legal hold, they either court-martial him or discharge him with an honorable discharge.\"\n\nIf the Army wants to seek an other-than-honorable discharge, it would have to pursue criminal charges. At that point, there is a regulation that would allow the soldier to negotiate a less-than-honorable discharge in lieu of a trial, Gittins said. Conviction at court-martial could bring a bad conduct or dishonorable discharge.\n\nMaj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl, the officer tapped to investigate Sgt. Bergdahl's actions in Afghanistan, has completed his report and submitted it to the office of Army Secretary John McHugh. A source familiar with the probe said Sgt. Bergdahl has denied that he deserted and provided an explanation for why he walked away that day. Soldiers from Sgt. Bergdahl's unit have accused him of desertion.\n\nSgt. Bergdahl is now at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, assigned to the company headquarters, where he was interviewed last August by Gen. Dahl. Also present was the soldier's attorney, Eugene Fidell, who specializes in military law and teaches at Yale Law School.\n\n\"He answered every question that was put to him,\" Mr. Fidell told The \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"I came away extraordinarily impressed by Gen. Dahl. I thought the country is lucky to have him. And sort of wonder what the rest of his career trajectory will look like, because I wish him well.\"\n\nGen. Dahl, a West Point graduate who completed two combat tours in Afghanistan, is a well-respected battlefield commander. He is now deputy commander of Army I Corps at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington.\n\nThe source familiar with the investigation did not know Gen. Dahl's conclusions, which have ramifications beyond the fate of Sgt. Bergdahl himself. The investigation's findings could potentially impact the ongoing debate about President Obama's decision to release five hardened Taliban leaders to gain Sgt. Bergdahl's release and the subsequent criticism of the White House for not notifying Congress ahead of time, as required by law.\n\nA finding that Sgt. Bergdahl deserted and faces court-martial would bolster the argument that Mr. Obama endangered troops in Afghanistan for the benefit of a deserter. The president announced Sgt. Bergdahl's release with great fanfare, bringing the parents, Robert and Jani Bergdahl of Hailey, Idaho, to the White House for a joint appearance.\n\nNational Security Adviser Susan Rice told ABC News that the soldier \"served the United States with honor and distinction.\" She said Sgt. Bergdahl \"wasn't simply a hostage; he was an American prisoner of war captured on the battlefield.\"\n\nThe White House praise brought waves of rebuttals from the sergeant's battlemates, who went on TV and radio. They painted the picture of a loner who simply abandoned them one morning by walking away from Combat Outpost Mest-Lalak in Paktika Province. Worse, they said, people died in combat while searching for him.\n\n\"The American people need to be educated that Bowe Bergdahl is not a hero,\" Joshua Cornelison, the medic in his platoon, told \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"After Bowe Bergdahl purposely and willfully walked away, every single mission was titled toward finding him.\"\n\nThe source familiar with the investigation said that the sergeant, while a captive for nearly five years at the hands of the extremely violent Haqqani network in Pakistan, tried to escape and was abused.\n\n\"It is actually surprising how well he withstood abuse,\" the source said.\n\nA Rolling Stone article quoted then-Private Bergdahl's emails as expressing disenchantment with his combat role in Afghanistan. House Armed Services Committee member Duncan Hunter, California Republican, has accused the Pentagon of orchestrating a ransom payment for Sgt. Bergdahl, then being taken in by an \"Afghan intermediary.\"\n\nHe wrote in a Nov. 5 letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel that Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), the home of SEAL Team Six and Army Delta Force, paid money earlier this winter. The go-between took the cash, disappeared, and never helped to gain the soldier's release, Mr. Hunter wrote, citing confidential sources.\n\nThe Pentagon denied it made a ransom payment. The congressman has asked the Defense Department inspector general to investigate. Navy Rear Admiral John Kirby, Mr. Hagel's press secretary, said the defense chief was to be briefed on the Dahl probe on Friday. But, he said, it's up to the Army to make decisions. He said that generally, reports such as Gen. Dahl's are not released publicly if there are judicial proceedings to follow.\n\n\"It's for the Army to decide what the next steps are,\" he said. \"They're not going to go any faster than they need to go in terms of process.\"\n\nHe added, \"I suspect that at the appropriate time, the Army will make the investigation public.\"",
    " Title: Rep. Rashida Tlaib Criticizes Facial Recognition Technology and Hiring Practices in Detroit Crime Center\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) has sparked controversy after visiting Detroit's \"Real-Time Crime\" center, which uses facial recognition technology. During the visit, Tlaib expressed concerns about the racial composition of the analysts working at the facility, stating that African Americans would be more effective in identifying African Americans and Latinos.\n\nAccording to The Detroit News, Tlaib visited the center on Monday, following her tweet expressing concern about the city's use of facial recognition technology. During the tour, Tlaib took issue with the predominantly white analysts in a city that is 80% black.\n\nWhen asked about her comments regarding the qualifications of white analysts, Tlaib referred to studies that suggest non-white individuals may have difficulty identifying individuals of other races. When asked if this meant non-whites should be barred from working as crime analysts in mostly white communities, Tlaib responded, \"Look it up.\"\n\nCritics, including Detroit Police Chief James Craig, have condemned Tlaib's remarks as reverse racism. Craig stated, \"We have a diverse group of crime analysts, and what she said\u2014that non-whites should not work in that capacity because they think all black people look alike\u2014is a slap in the face to all the men and women in the crime center.\"\n\nSeveral studies have shown that facial recognition technology and white people often misidentify non-white faces. For instance, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that facial recognition algorithms misidentify black faces 5 to 10 times more often than white faces. Researchers at MIT have also noted that the technology is flawed because it learns from human programmers, who are predominantly white and male.\n\nTlaib has cited these studies in her criticism of facial recognition technology, but her comments have been met with skepticism by some, particularly those who reject scientific consensus on issues such as global warming, police killings, and the capabilities of their political leaders.",
    " Title: Legal Challenges Mount Against Trump's National Emergency Declaration for Border Wall Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to use emergency powers to secure funding for the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is facing legal challenges from several states and advocacy groups. California and New York have announced their intention to challenge the move, which bypasses Congress, with California Governor Gavin Newsom dismissing the president's decision as \"political theatre.\"\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump signed an emergency declaration and a spending bill aimed at preventing a repeat of the recent government shutdown. The emergency declaration could give him access to billions of dollars for the wall project, which was a key pledge of his campaign. Democrats have criticized the move as a \"gross abuse of power\" and vowed to contest it \"using every remedy available.\"\n\nWithin hours of the announcement, the first legal challenge against the declaration of national emergency was launched by the liberal advocacy group Public Citizen, on behalf of a nature reserve and three Texas landowners who have been told the wall may be constructed on their properties. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has also announced plans to file a lawsuit in the coming days to challenge the \"blatantly illegal executive action.\"\n\nNew York state's Democratic attorney general, Letitia James, said the state would \"not stand for this abuse of power and will fight back with every legal tool at our disposal.\" The ACLU has suggested that the remark by Mr. Trump that he \"didn't need to do this\" could undermine his case that the country is facing an emergency.\n\nThe National Emergencies Act contains a clause that allows Congress to terminate the emergency status if both houses vote for it and the president does not veto. With a comfortable majority in the House, Democrats could pass such a resolution to the Senate. The Republicans control the Senate, but a number of Republican senators have been vocal in their unease about the president invoking a national emergency.\n\nThe dissenting Republicans include 2012 presidential contender and new senator for Utah Mitt Romney, Florida senator Marco Rubio, and the senator from Maine Susan Collins, who said the move was of \"dubious constitutionality.\" The resolution would still require Mr. Trump's signature to pass, allowing him to veto it. A supermajority in both houses of Congress is needed to overturn a presidential veto.\n\nThe National Emergencies Act is intended for times of national crisis. Mr. Trump has claimed that there is a migration crisis at the nation's southern border - a claim strongly refuted by migration experts. The largest number of illegal migrants settling in the U.S. each year is those who stay in the country after their visas expire.\n\nDeclaring a national emergency would give the president access to special powers that effectively allow him to bypass the usual political process, and he would be able to divert money from existing military or disaster relief budgets to pay for the wall. Emergency declarations by previous presidents have been overwhelmingly used for addressing foreign policy crises. The $8 billion for the wall would be made up of funds from the Department of Defense, with the largest amount coming from the military construction budget. This is almost certain to bring a legal challenge.",
    " Title: Over 50 Pakistani Journalists Test Positive for Coronavirus as Country Eases Lockdown\n\nArticle:\n\nAt least 54 journalists and media workers have tested positive for the coronavirus across Pakistan, according to data released by the Freedom Network rights group on Monday. This marks a significant increase in infections among the country's media personnel, as the South Asian nation continues to ease its lockdown amid a spike in cases and deaths.\n\nOne of the first journalists to test positive for the virus in the country is Salman Ashraf, a reporter for local television station Geo News in the southwest city of Quetta. Ashraf, who was one of seven people to test positive for the coronavirus in his organization's Quetta bureau, described his symptoms as a high fever and severe body pain.\n\nThe data shows a similar pattern of clusters of coronavirus cases in newsrooms and bureaus across the country, where journalists, technical staff, and media assistants often work in close proximity to each other. The number of infections in Pakistan began spiking last week, with several consecutive days of record increases in new infections and deaths.\n\nOn Sunday, reported infections rose by a further 1,476 to 30,941, with at least 667 deaths and 8,212 patients having recovered. On Monday, provinces began implementing a government-mandated easing of lockdown measures, with smaller markets and several industries allowed to reopen for up to five days a week, operating from sunrise until 5 pm each day.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan's government has insisted that a full lockdown is not economically sustainable for a country that was already in the midst of an economic crisis when its outbreak began in late February. Last month, the International Monetary Fund estimated that Pakistan's economy would contract by 1.5 percent owing to the coronavirus-related lockdowns, close to the worst such figures since the country gained independence in 1947.\n\nKhan has insisted that industries follow government-mandated standard operating procedures to keep workers safe, or face being closed down again. For journalists working across the country, individual news organizations have issued guidelines regarding social distancing and protective equipment while reporting, but implementation on the ground has been inconsistent.\n\nOne journalist in Quetta, speaking on condition of anonymity fearing reprisals from his employer, said, \"We are going into the field in the same way. We are working in the same way, in the field and in the office. We are contacting the public in the same way.\" The journalist said guidelines were in place but were not being enforced or followed by many journalists.\n\nCompetition in Pakistan's news media landscape is cut-throat, with more than 30 24-hour television news channels competing with each other for ratings, in addition to dozens of national and regional newspapers. \"The general behavior that we are seeing, I am mentally prepared that I am going to get the virus. And I do not feel like I can save myself from this,\" said Syed Shahzad Kazmi, a cameraman for the local Roze News television station in the northwestern city of Peshawar.\n\nKazmi, who tested positive for the coronavirus late last month, spent two weeks in quarantine at home before being certified as having recovered by health authorities. Another cameraman, Asad Ali, tested positive for the coronavirus after being infected by a co-worker at his organization's bureau. After spending two weeks in quarantine, he said he was back at work on the night shift, working as normal.\n\nIqbal Khattak, representative for the global media rights group Reporters Without Borders in Pakistan, said, \"The protocol is quite good, but still, I think the protocol needs some [additional] steps.\" RSF's recommendations to Pakistani news organizations include no longer requiring television reporters to report live from places with large crowds, restricting coverage of press conferences where large numbers may gather, and avoiding commissioning reports from hospitals.\n\n\"I was just watching the 3 pm bulletin [on television]... and these journalists were all on the streets, close to the public,\" said Khattak. \"This is a worrying sign... Getting live hits from the field is a risk that they are taking, and I think media houses should avoid taking these risks.\"",
    " Title: Retired General John Allen to Coordinate International Coalition Against ISIS\n\nArticle:\n\nRetired four-star Marine General John Allen, who previously served as the commander of American forces in Afghanistan, has been appointed to coordinate the international coalition against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Secretary of State John Kerry announced on Friday.\n\nAllen's new role marks a return to a challenging mission with no clear solutions, a mission he is familiar with due to his extensive experience in the region. Allen was one of the top commanders in western Iraq during the \"Sunni Awakening,\" a program that aimed to turn Sunni tribes in Anbar province against the al Qaeda affiliate operating in Iraq at the time.\n\nThe militant organization currently occupying portions of both Syria and Iraq, which President Barack Obama has vowed to destroy, is the successor to that al Qaeda group.\n\nAllen graduated with honors from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1976 and has a long and distinguished list of accomplishments, both on the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq and as a peacemaker in one of the Middle East's longest and most intractable conflicts.\n\nIn 2011, Obama tapped Allen to take command of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, the NATO-led coalition of military forces in that country, after Obama nominated Gen. David Petraeus, then the coalition's commander, to become director of the CIA. Allen was the first Marine to head up the military effort in Afghanistan.\n\nLater, Allen was appointed by Kerry to develop a security plan for Israel and the West Bank during negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians over the possibility of a future Palestinian state that eventually collapsed. Before his command in Afghanistan, Allen was deputy commander at U.S. Central Command, which oversees all military operations in the Middle East.\n\nAllen is a decorated veteran of the armed forces, having received the Defense Distinguished Service Medal and the Defense Superior Service Medal among others. While controversy mostly eluded his impressive rise to the top ranks of the U.S. military, Allen was briefly caught up in the 2012 scandal involving Petraeus' infidelity that ultimately led the widely admired retired general to resign his CIA post.\n\nAn investigation into \"flirtatious\" email exchanges between Allen and Jill Kelley, the Florida woman whose complaints about threatening emails from Petraeus' mistress, Paula Broadwell, brought the scandal into the public, led Allen to withdraw his nomination by Obama to become NATO's supreme allied commander in 2013. The Defense Department eventually cleared him of any wrongdoing, and Allen retired from the Marines.\n\nAllen is the married father of two daughters and holds master's degrees from Georgetown University, the Defense Intelligence College, and the National War College.",
    " Title: Defense Workers Return to Duty as Shutdown Enters Second Week\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States federal government shutdown, now in its second week, has seen a significant development as the Department of Defense has ordered the recall of most of its furloughed civilian employees. According to The Two-Way's Bill Chappell, this affects approximately 400,000 workers.\n\nThe decision was announced by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Saturday, following the passage of the \"Pay Our Military Act\" by Congress and its subsequent signing by President Obama. The law, which allows for the recall of civilians who support service personnel, does not permit a blanket recall of all civilians, Hagel stated.\n\nAs of the weekend, there were no signs of serious negotiations, and the longer the standoff continues, the more likely it is to collide with the Oct. 17 deadline to raise the debt ceiling, setting the stage for a potential battle over fiscal policy in the coming weeks.\n\nIn a weekend of partisan exchanges, more than a dozen lawmakers appeared on Sunday shows to reinforce their positions in the congressional impasse, as reported by Politico.\n\nThe Washington Post, acknowledging that no party in Washington looks good amid the ongoing shutdown, offers a guide to the losers and not-quite losers. The Post suggests that Republican governors with White House aspirations are faring better than their partisan colleagues on Capitol Hill. The Post states, \"The Bobby Jindals and Chris Christies of the world are having a field day right about now. Need evidence that all of Washington is broken and that a problem-solver from outside the Beltway is the only answer? The shutdown \u2014 along with the name-calling that has followed \u2014 says it all.\"",
    " Title: Obama's Shift in Perspective: From Emphasizing Construction Jobs to Criticizing Keystone XL Pipeline Project\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent speech in Chattanooga, Tennessee, President Barack Obama expressed skepticism towards the Keystone XL oil pipeline project, a stark contrast to his previous enthusiasm for construction jobs during his first term. During the speech, Mr. Obama chuckled derisively when mentioning the pipeline's potential to create thousands of jobs over two years.\n\n\"They keep on talking about this\u2014an oil pipeline coming down from Canada that\u2019s estimated to create about 50 permanent jobs,\" Mr. Obama said. \"That\u2019s not a jobs plan.\"\n\nIn a previous interview, the president estimated that the pipeline project would create \"maybe 2,000\" construction jobs, referring to these jobs as \"a blip\" of what the nation needs. This contrasts with Mr. Obama's attitude during his first term, when he expressed enthusiasm for construction jobs of all kinds.\n\nIn November 2011, as part of his \"We Can\u2019t Wait\" campaign, Mr. Obama held an event at the Key Bridge in Georgetown to call on Congress to approve more temporary stimulus spending on infrastructure projects to help unemployed construction workers. At the time, Mr. Obama said, \"Of all the industries hammered by the economic downturn, construction has been among the hardest hit.\"\n\nIn February 2009, Mr. Obama urged Congress to approve an $800 billion-plus economic stimulus package, citing the need for construction jobs. He stated that the stimulus legislation \"has the right priorities to create 3 [million] to 4 million jobs and to do it in a way that lays the groundwork for long-term growth by fixing our schools; modernizing health care to lower costs; repairing our roads, bridges, levees, and other vital infrastructure; and moving us toward energy independence.\"\n\nEven before taking the oath of office in January 2009, Mr. Obama was promoting government-funded infrastructure projects, stating that they were \"shovel-ready all across the country.\" Many of these projects would have been temporary jobs, given the act's proposed life of two or three years.\n\nTwo years later, amid criticism that the stimulus law hadn't produced the promised number of construction jobs, Mr. Obama wisecracked, \"Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected.\"\n\nMr. Obama's top aides stated that the president was not disparaging the value of construction jobs in his most recent comments but was trying to make a point that House Republicans lack a comprehensive strategy for creating jobs. Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to Mr. Obama, told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Wednesday that the president's latest comments are \"not inconsistent\" with previous statements about construction jobs.\n\n\"One infrastructure project is not a jobs strategy,\" Mr. Pfeiffer said at a breakfast meeting with reporters hosted by The Christian Science Monitor. \"That would be like saying our jobs strategy is to repair the Key Bridge. We\u2019re talking about one thing, and it would have some temporary jobs which would be significant. But in the overall scale of the employment situation in this country, as the president said, it\u2019s a blip. And when that\u2019s done, contrary to\u2026 the rhetoric you hear, it\u2019s 50 to 100 permanent jobs.\"\n\nMr. Pfeiffer suggested that the president's comments about Keystone are aimed at September confrontations with Republicans over spending and borrowing.\n\n\"He\u2019s put his jobs ideas on the table, he\u2019s calling on Republicans to do the same,\" Mr. Pfeiffer said. \"To date, the core of the Republican jobs package\u2026 is vote to repeal Obamacare for the 40th time and build the Keystone pipeline. There\u2019s a legitimate debate over whether you should build that pipeline or not. The president\u2019s point is that\u2019s not a jobs strategy.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers suspect that the president is signaling his disapproval of the project, which environmentalists vehemently oppose. Last month, Mr. Obama said his administration would approve the pipeline only if it would not contribute to carbon pollution. Canadian government and private officials have stated repeatedly that they will mine the oil and sell it in the U.S. or elsewhere to burn and put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, regardless of whether the pipeline is built.\n\nRepublicans said that whether Mr. Obama is trying to kill the pipeline or is posturing for September, he is way off base in the jobs numbers for the project.\n\n\"The president famously pledged to 'do whatever it takes' to create jobs\u2014but this is a new low,\" said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, Michigan Republican. \"Attacking new job opportunities is not a jobs plan. Unions and manufacturers are desperate for the president to say yes to the Keystone pipeline because it will get thousands of workers off of unemployment and back on the job. The president should listen to these American workers looking for a job and embrace the opportunity to realize the benefits of $7 billion in private investments.\"\n\nThe State Department has estimated that the pipeline project would create 5,000 to 6,000 construction jobs per year. TransCanada Corp., which would build the pipeline, has said it would generate about 13,000 jobs over two years. The State Department also said the project could support another 42,000 jobs per year for two years across the U.S. in related industries.",
    " Title: Trump Endorses Paul Ryan, Shocks Some Grassroots Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump endorsed House Speaker Paul D. Ryan on Friday, marking an end to his previous hesitation to support the party's most powerful elected leader. The endorsement, made at a campaign rally in Wisconsin, signaled Trump's readiness to work with the Republican Party establishment that had initially opposed his candidacy.\n\nAt the rally in Green Bay, Trump stated, \"In our shared mission to make America great again, I support and endorse our speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. He's a good man.\"\n\nThe endorsement, however, sparked discontent among grass-roots conservatives who had hoped Trump would help overthrow establishment figures like Ryan, viewed as fake conservatives or RINOs, the derogatory acronym for those deemed to be Republicans in name only.\n\nTrump had withheld his endorsement in Ryan's primary race against an anti-establishment rival, Paul Nehlen, a strong Trump supporter. In recent days, Trump had expressed his reservations about backing Ryan, echoing the speaker's earlier comments when he resisted endorsing Trump.\n\nTrump, referencing Ronald Reagan's philosophy, stated, \"We may disagree on a couple of things, but mostly we agree. And we're going to get it done, and we're going to do a lot of wonderful things.\"\n\nIn addition to endorsing Ryan, Trump also announced endorsements for two Senate Republican incumbents in tough races who have been tentative in their support for him: Arizona Sen. John McCain and New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte.\n\nThe trio of endorsements, particularly the one for Ryan, surprised some of Trump's diehard supporters. Trump supporter Sue Payne, a conservative activist working to defeat Ryan, expressed her disappointment, stating, \"He has broken our heart doing this tonight. We finally thought we had a voice to stand up against the RINO establishment. He sold us out.\"\n\nPaul Nehlen, Ryan's primary rival, understood Trump's decision to back the party leadership. In a statement, he said, \"Given his stature as our party's official nominee, Mr. Trump's decision to support the Republican Speaker is appropriate and is a display of true leadership.\"\n\nNehlen further stated, \"Mr. Trump's early refusal to endorse Ryan sent a clear signal to Wisconsin voters that Ryan is not his preferred candidate in this race. Speaker Ryan's globalist agenda stands in clear opposition to the will of the Republican electorate, who want safe communities, immigration control, smart trade deals, and leaders who put the needs of the American people first.\"\n\nFacing an uphill battle against the powerful House speaker, Nehlen's poll numbers were not in his favor, with Ryan leading in the Janesville district 80 percent to 14 percent, according to a Remington Research Group poll released Friday.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes Rule to Limit Food Stamp Benefits for Millions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has unveiled a proposal that could potentially affect the food assistance of up to 3.1 million individuals. The rule, which aims to eliminate \"loopholes\" and save money, has been met with criticism from anti-poverty advocates, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who described it as an \"act of staggering callousness.\"\n\nUnder the proposed rule, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would no longer provide benefits to families solely because they are enrolled in food assistance programs run by the states where they reside. This change is intended to address instances where some states have expanded eligibility to recipients who would not otherwise qualify for the federal program based on asset or income limitations.\n\nUSDA officials argue that the proposed rule would \"fix a loophole\" that allows households to receive assistance \"when they clearly don\u2019t need it.\" The agency claims the proposal could save billions in taxpayer funds. Recipients who lose their benefits could reapply and qualify if they meet the federal standards for assistance.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue stated, \"For too long, this loophole has been used to effectively bypass important eligibility guidelines. Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint.\"\n\nThe proposal has been met with opposition from various quarters. Joel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America, stated, \"USDA\u2019s plan to take away flexibility from states to allow people to save funds while working their way out of poverty and still receive SNAP is horrid in four ways. It will make working Americans hungrier. It will make it harder for families to work their way out of poverty. And it is hypocritical since Republicans are denying flexibility to states.\"\n\nIn December, the administration proposed a rule that would tighten work requirements for SNAP recipients. This rule would restrict states from exempting work-eligible adults from receiving food stamps if they're not seeking employment. Weeks ago, Congress rejected Republican-sponsored changes to SNAP as part of a $400 billion farm bill.\n\nRep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), who chairs the House Agriculture Subcommittee that oversees SNAP, criticized Tuesday's proposal as a hypocritical dictate from a party that often preaches states' rights. \"When it comes to putting that rhetoric into practice for SNAP, they take the opposite position,\" she said.",
    " Title: Republican Lawmakers Disrupt U.S. House Impeachment Inquiry, Prevent Pentagon Official's Testimony\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Republican lawmakers disrupted a closed-door hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry on Wednesday, preventing Pentagon official Laura Cooper from testifying. The incident occurred during an escalating probe that focuses on President Donald Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe Republicans stormed into a hearing room where Cooper, the U.S. defense official who oversees Ukraine and Russia matters, was due to testify. According to lawmakers and aides, the Republicans began yelling, and a witness inside the room stated that they brought cellphones into the high-security facility where electronic devices are forbidden.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry centers on Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate Biden for his personal political benefit. In a confrontation that threatened Trump's presidency as he seeks re-election next year, Capitol police were called in to clear the room and restore order.\n\nRepublican Representative Ted Lieu stated, \"They're freaked out. They're trying to stop this investigation. They don't want to hear from witness Cooper today. They know more facts are going to be delivered which are absolutely damning to the president of the United States.\"\n\nRepublican Representative Mark Meadows told reporters, \"There's about 20 members (lawmakers) down there, at least a dozen that are not on the three committees. And they're going to wait until there's a more open and transparent process.\"\n\nRepublicans have criticized the rules for the impeachment inquiry set by the Democratic-led House, stating that they are unfair. The U.S. Constitution grants the House wide latitude in how to conduct the impeachment process and set rules for the inquiry.\n\nThe witness who saw the events stated that the Republican lawmakers pushed past Capitol Police personnel and started yelling, voicing their objections to the Democratic leaders of the House's decision to hold depositions in closed sessions and not release transcripts of the testimony.\n\nCooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, did not testify, according to Democratic Representative Stephen Lynch, who is allowed to attend depositions as a member of the House Oversight Committee. A House aide stated that the day's impeachment-related proceedings were suspended for the time being.\n\nDemocratic Representative Eric Swalwell told reporters that the Republicans had compromised a secure area of the Capitol, obstructing the impeachment inquiry and seeking to intimidate a witness. However, Swalwell added that this would not delay the impeachment probe overall.\n\nCooper was expected to face questions about Trump's decision to withhold $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine approved by Congress. In testimony to the inquiry on Tuesday, William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, stated that Trump had made the aid contingent on Ukraine announcing it would conduct politically motivated investigations that the president demanded.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry, triggered by a whistleblower complaint against Trump, focuses on a July 25 telephone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to carry out those two investigations. Zelenskiy agreed during the call. The aid was later provided.\n\nFederal election law prohibits candidates from accepting foreign help in an election. So far, few of Trump's fellow conservatives have appeared inclined toward his removal, though there have been some cracks in their support.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Calls for Unprecedented Measures to Address COVID-19 Crisis, Advocates for Universal Healthcare and Paid Leave\n\nArticle:\n\nBernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont and a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, is urging for an immediate and comprehensive response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In a commentary published by CNN, Sanders emphasizes the need for a unified, nationwide effort to combat the medical and economic crisis.\n\nSanders argues that the current crisis necessitates unprecedented measures to protect all individuals, regardless of their income. He emphasizes that the response should be guided by the advice of medical professionals, scientists, and researchers, rather than politicians.\n\nIn the short term, Sanders proposes increasing the availability of coronavirus test kits, accelerating the processing of tests, building out more intensive care units, obtaining additional ventilators, and improving international collaboration to learn from other countries' experiences with the novel coronavirus.\n\nLooking beyond the immediate crisis, Sanders calls for long-term changes to the U.S. healthcare system, advocating for universal healthcare as a human right. He points out that, despite spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as countries like Canada, 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured.\n\nSanders also addresses the issue of paid family and medical leave, stating that thousands of workers may be ill and continue to work due to financial constraints, potentially spreading the virus. He advocates for guaranteed paid family and medical leave for all workers, as is the case in many other countries.\n\nFurthermore, Sanders criticizes globalization and disastrous trade policies for outsourcing jobs and factories overseas, leaving the U.S. vulnerable in times of national crisis. He calls for fair trade policies that bring production and manufacturing back to the United States.\n\nSanders concludes by emphasizing the need for far-reaching policies to transform the country for the better, stating that this is the focus of his presidential campaign and what the entire country should strive for in the coming months.",
    " Title: Democrat Ralph Northam Wins Virginia Governor's Race, Delivering a Setback to President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocrat Ralph Northam has been declared the winner of the Virginia governor's race on Tuesday, dealing a significant blow to President Donald Trump. Northam, the state's lieutenant governor, secured a victory over Republican Ed Gillespie, who had adopted some of the president's controversial tactics and policy stances.\n\nTrump, who endorsed Gillespie but did not campaign with him, issued tweets and recorded messages in support of the former Republican National Committee chairman on Tuesday. However, after the election results, Trump quickly distanced himself from Gillespie.\n\n\"Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for,\" Trump tweeted. \"With the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!\"\n\nAt his victory party, Northam told supporters that the Democratic win in Virginia sent a clear message to the nation.\n\n\"Virginia has told us to end the divisiveness, that we will not condone hatred and bigotry, and to end the politics that have torn this country apart,\" Northam said.\n\nThe Virginia race was part of a series of state and local elections that also included a governor's race in New Jersey, where Democrat Phil Murphy, a former investment banker and ambassador to Germany, defeated Republican Kim Guadagno for the right to succeed Republican Chris Christie. Murphy had pledged to serve as a check on Trump in Democratic-leaning New Jersey. Guadagno, the lieutenant governor, was hindered by her association with the unpopular Christie.\n\nMurphy's win, along with Northam's victory in Virginia, a state that Hillary Clinton won by 5 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election, provided a much-needed boost for national Democrats who were eager to translate grassroots resistance to Trump into election victories. Democrats had already lost four special congressional elections earlier this year.\n\nA strong turnout in the Democratic-leaning northern Virginia suburbs of Washington helped propel Northam, who ultimately won with a 53% to 45% margin. Exit polls in Virginia showed that one-third of the voters went to the polls to oppose Trump, and only 17% went to support him.\n\nDemocrats also won the offices of lieutenant governor and attorney general in Virginia and gained seats in the Virginia House of Delegates. Democrat Danica Roem became the first transgender person to win a state legislative race.\n\n\"This is a comprehensive political victory from statehouse to courthouse. Thank you, Donald Trump!\" Democratic U.S. Representative Gerald Connolly of Virginia told Northam's supporters at a victory party in northern Virginia.\n\nIn Virginia, Democrats had expressed concern that a Gillespie win would embolden Republicans to emphasize divisive cultural issues in their campaigns for next year's elections, when all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 33 of the U.S. Senate's 100 seats come up for election. Republicans currently control both chambers.\n\nGillespie, speaking to his crestfallen supporters in Richmond, Virginia, said he had run a \"very policy-focused campaign.\" However, voters in Arlington County, a suburban Democratic stronghold bordering Washington, expressed that national politics played a significant role in their votes.\n\n\"Trump talks about draining the swamp, but Gillespie kind of is the swamp,\" said Nick Peacemaker, who works in marketing and considered himself a Republican until Trump won the party's presidential nomination. Peacemaker noted that Gillespie seemed to shift closer to Trump's policies after securing the Republican gubernatorial nomination.\n\nIn local races across the country, Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio in New York and Marty Walsh in Boston both easily won re-election. Voters were also picking mayors in Detroit, Atlanta, Seattle, and Charlotte, North Carolina.",
    " Title: U.S. Restores Sanctions on Iran, Exempts Eight Countries for Oil Imports\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has reinstated U.S. sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, effective from Monday. The sanctions target Iran's shipping, financial, and energy sectors. This is the second batch of sanctions re-imposed since President Trump withdrew from the landmark accord in May.\n\nThe 2015 deal, one of former President Obama's significant diplomatic achievements, provided Iran with billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, which many believed was being used to develop atomic weapons. President Trump repeatedly criticized the agreement, calling it the \"worst ever\" negotiated by the United States, arguing it gave Iran too much in return for too little.\n\nProponents, as well as the other parties to the deal - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia, and the European Union, have strongly defended it. The Europeans are concerned that the new sanctions will drive Iran to pull out and resume all of its nuclear work.\n\nThe new measures are expected to impact Iranians significantly. In Tehran, one man stated the harder the U.S. pushes, the more people will resist. In a wealthier area, a report by Elizabeth Palmer met the Hossein family. Essam, an accountant, expressed a desire to escape from Iran, voicing his discontent with both the U.S. and Iranian governments.\n\nFriday's announcement was made just days before the U.S. congressional midterm elections, allowing President Trump to highlight his decision to withdraw from the deal, a move that was popular among Republicans. Shortly after the announcement, President Trump tweeted an image resembling a movie poster from the TV series \"Game of Thrones\" with the tagline \"Sanctions are Coming, November 5.\"\n\nIn a statement issued Friday night, President Trump stated, \"Our objective is to force the regime into a clear choice: either abandon its destructive behavior or continue down the path toward economic disaster.\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added that the sanctions are \"aimed at fundamentally altering the behavior of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\"\n\nPompeo has issued a list of 12 demands that Iran must meet to have the sanctions lifted, including an end to its support for terrorism and military engagement in Syria and a halt to nuclear and ballistic missile development. Eight nations will receive temporary waivers allowing them to continue importing Iranian petroleum products as they phase out such imports entirely. These countries, which are expected to include U.S. allies such as Turkey, Italy, India, Japan, and South Korea, have made efforts to eliminate their imports but could not complete the task by Monday.\n\nThe waivers will be valid for six months, during which time the importing country can buy Iranian oil but must deposit Iran's revenue in an escrow account. Iran can spend the money but only on a narrow range of humanitarian items.\n\nPompeo defended the oil waivers and noted that since May, when the U.S. began to pressure countries to stop buying Iranian oil, Iran's exports had dropped by more than 1 million barrels per day. He also stated that the Iranian economy is already struggling due to the earlier sanctions, with the currency losing half its value since April.\n\nSome Iran hawks in Congress and elsewhere have criticized Friday's move, stating it should have gone even further. They were hoping for Iran to be disconnected from the main international financial messaging network known as SWIFT.\n\nWith limited exceptions, the re-imposed U.S. sanctions will affect Iran as well as countries that do not stop importing Iranian oil and foreign firms that do business with blacklisted Iranian entities, including its central bank, a number of private financial institutions, and state-run port and shipping firms, as well as hundreds of individual Iranian officials.\n\n\"Our ultimate aim is to compel Iran to permanently abandon its well-documented outlaw activities and behave as a normal country,\" Pompeo told reporters in a conference call with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin added that 700 more Iranian companies and people would be added to the sanctions rolls, including more than 300 that had not been included under previous sanctions.\n\nOn Saturday, the eve of the anniversary of the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated that the Islamic Republic is the \"victorious party\" after nearly 40 years of confrontation by the United States. Khamenei said that despite military, economic, and propaganda wars waged by the U.S. against Iran over the last four decades, \"the U.S. is the defeated side and the Islamic Republic is the victorious party.\" Khamenei added that the U.S. has failed to dominate Iran in the way it did before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted a pro-Western monarchy. He stated that the U.S. is weaker than it was in 1979.",

The takedown request, listed as \"manually detected\" in YouTube documentation, was made by the Weinstein Company.\n\nThe videos, which have been moved to another video platform and reinserted into the original story while the dispute is settled by YouTube, feature two interviews from 'Fed Up' where the producers are accused of unethical editing techniques. In one of the videos, Dr. David Allison is shown stumbling during an answer and then pausing for several seconds before the film cuts to another interview, with an answer to the question he was asked never shown. Dr. Allison stated that he did provide an answer to the question and that Couric assured him he could pause to rework answers if needed.\n\nIn the other video, an interview with former Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation spokesperson Lisa Gable is featured. Industry sources claim the audio of the off-camera interview was manipulated to embarrass Gable. An audio clip of the off-camera interviewer saying she did not believe Gable was answering her questions did not occur at the moment it is portrayed in the film, according to the sources. \"That response from the producer didn\u2019t actually follow that particular exchange and was edited to make it look like that was how their conversation actually went,\" one source said.\n\nThe Weinstein Company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
    " Title: Trump Revokes Obama-Era Policy on Transparency in Drone Strike Civilian Casualties\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has rescinded an executive order implemented by his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, which required U.S. intelligence officials to disclose the number of civilian casualties resulting from drone strikes outside of war zones.\n\nThe 2016 executive order was a response to pressure on Obama to increase transparency. Since the 9/11 terror attacks, drone strikes have been increasingly utilized against terror and military targets.\n\nThe Trump administration deemed the rule as \"superfluous\" and distracting. The order applied to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which has conducted drone strikes in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Somalia.\n\nAn official stated, \"This action eliminates superfluous reporting requirements, requirements that do not improve government transparency, but rather distract our intelligence professionals from their primary mission.\"\n\nThe order mandated the head of the CIA to release annual summaries of U.S. drone strikes and assess the number of casualties. Mr. Trump's executive order does not repeal reporting requirements on civilian deaths set for the military by Congress.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a UK-based think tank, there have been 2,243 drone strikes in the first two years of the Trump presidency, compared to 1,878 in Mr. Obama's eight years in office.\n\nHuman-rights activists criticized the drone program under the Obama administration, claiming the operations were overly secretive and failed to acknowledge civilian casualties in the strikes. President Obama responded by stating that strikes were carried out in a precise manner, and intelligence officials would release data on civilians who were accidentally killed in the strikes that occurred outside of war zones.\n\nDuring Mr. Obama's eight years in office, 1,878 drone strikes were conducted, according to researchers. Since Mr. Trump was elected in 2016, there have been 2,243 drone strikes. The Republican president has also made some of the operations, those outside of war zones, more secretive.\n\nLawmakers and rights groups have criticized Mr. Trump's decision, stating it could allow the CIA to conduct drone strikes without accountability. Rita Siemion of Human Rights First told AFP news agency, \"The Trump administration's action is an unnecessary and dangerous step backwards on transparency and accountability for the use of lethal force, and the civilian casualties they cause.\"\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, a Democrat who chairs Congress's intelligence committee, called the requirement issued by Obama \"an important measure of transparency,\" and said \"there is simply no justification\" for canceling it.",

The move has escalated the ongoing debate surrounding Kaepernick's kneel-down protest against police brutality, which has divided the nation.\n\nThe Nike campaign, which features a close-up of Kaepernick's face and the words \"Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything,\" has sparked a significant backlash. Nike's stock fell 3 percent on the news, and other athletic shoe companies experienced similar or greater dips, which some economists attributed to tariffs. The hashtag #NikeBoycott trended on Twitter, with reports of Nike gear-burning and other protests.\n\nThe NFL season is set to begin on Thursday, and the league is a partner of Nike. In late March, Nike and the NFL signed a billion-dollar extension of their deal that runs through 2028. Every NFL player wears a Nike-made uniform, and all sideline gear worn by players and coaches is likewise logoed. Any player or coach who wishes to protest the Kaepernick-Nike partnership might have to deface their own uniform.\n\nThe NFL player-protest issue is currently in limbo. Team owners voted in the offseason to punish players who protest on the field, but the owners put that rule on hold pending negotiations with the players union. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones stated that any of his players who protests will be punished or banned. His team opens on Sunday at Carolina.\n\nThe demonstrations are a cause close to President Trump, who has openly urged owners to fire protesting players. Many NFL team owners are known to be wary of Trump's demands and threats. It's important to remember that the protests had largely disappeared from public view until Trump revived the movement early last NFL season with insulting and demeaning tweets.\n\nLast week, an arbitrator denied the NFL's request for a dismissal of Kaepernick's grievance against the league for colluding to deny him employment. A portion of the money Nike pays the league for sponsorship could potentially wind up in Kaepernick's pocket.\n\nNike reportedly plans to sell Kaepernick shoes and sportswear, and to back up the initial \"Believe\" ad with billboards, TV commercials, and online ads. A billboard of the first Kaepernick ad went up near Niketown at Union Square on Tuesday.\n\nNike's corporate sincerity in backing Kaepernick's cause has been called into question. If the company didn't have its heart and soul in this campaign, why would it take the enormous and obvious risk in alienating millions of customers?\n\nThe NFL released a statement from Jocelyn Moore, the NFL's vice president of communications and public affairs, saying, \"The National Football League believes in dialogue, understanding, and unity. We embrace the role and responsibility of everyone involved with this game to promote meaningful, positive change in our communities. The social justice issues that Colin and other professional athletes have raised deserve our attention and action.\"\n\nA recent NBC News and Wall Street Journal poll showed 54 percent of Americans feel the NFL protests are \"inappropriate,\" while 43 percent go with \"appropriate.\" Whatever profits Nike might make on Kaepernick gear would seem to be more than offset by the loss of revenue from protests of Nike.\n\nThe NFL is now in a difficult position. If the owners follow the lead of Trump, Jones, and a majority (however narrow) of Americans, the league risks alienating about half its fans and maybe more than half its players. Almost all the protesting players are black, and 70 percent of the league's players are black. That's a powerful lobby.\n\nHowever, if the NFL caves to the players' union and allows at least some protests, the league risks suffering boycotts of games and team and league sponsors. Other than the racial component of the debate, there are many shades of gray. Support for Kaepernick is problematic for those who can't forget or forgive him wearing cartoon-pig socks to protest police brutality.\n\nFor some, the new Nike campaign casts doubt on Kaepernick's rebel persona. \"Revolutionaries aren't sponsored by major corporations,\" said Fox Sports commentator Jason Whitlock. But if a revolution is being waged against forces backed by money and power, isn't money and power needed by the revolutionaries?\n\nAnd does anyone really believe Kaepernick willingly gave up a pro football career in order to cash in on his revolution by selling shoes? This is a man who, while unemployed, donated $1 million to hand-selected causes and who continues to lead educational camps for inner-city kids.\n\nIf that's all been a Kaepernick scheme to get rich selling shoes, it's certainly revolutionary.",
    " Title: Comedian Nimesh Patel Removed from Columbia University Event for Offensive Jokes\n\nArticle:\n\nComedian Nimesh Patel, a former Saturday Night Live writer, was removed from a performance at Columbia University's \"cultureSHOCK: Reclaim\" event after 30 minutes due to jokes deemed homophobic and racist. The Asian American Alliance (AAA) had invited Patel to perform at their annual charity showcase, which aims to promote Asian-American artistic expression and challenge harmful stereotypes.\n\nAccording to the Columbia Daily Spectator, Patel's performance included commentary on his experience living in a diverse area of New York City, which included a joke about a gay black man in his neighborhood. AAA officials found this material inappropriate.\n\nDuring the performance, Patel made a joke about sexual orientation, stating, \"No one looks in the mirror and thinks, 'This black thing is too easy; let me just add another thing to it.'\" Members of AAA interrupted the performance and denounced his material regarding racial identities and sexual orientation. Patel was given a few moments for closing remarks but pushed back, claiming that none of his jokes were offensive. He reportedly asserted that he was simply exposing the audience to ideas found \"in the real world.\" Patel's microphone was cut off from offstage, and he exited.\n\nAAA defended its decision to remove Patel, stating on Facebook, \"Patel's remarks ran counter to the inclusive spirit and integrity of cultureSHOCK, and as such, the choice was made to invite him to leave.\" The group added, \"We acknowledge that discomfort and safety can coexist, however, the discomfort Patel caused was unproductive in this space.\" AAA also apologized for inviting Patel in the first place.\n\nAudience members were reportedly split over AAA's decision to remove Patel.\n\nAs of this writing, Patel has yet to comment on the event. The 32-year-old comedian was the first Indian-American writer for SNL but left after last season. He has since been nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing and has opened for comedians such as Chris Rock.",
    " Title: Polls Show President Trump Trailing in 2020 General Election, Suggesting Weak Position for Reelection\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest polls indicate that President Donald Trump is trailing most Democratic candidates in the 2020 general election, both nationally and in individual states, including traditionally Republican stronghold Texas. While these polls may offer some encouragement to Democratic voters, they should exercise caution, as historical precedent shows that polls taken 14 months before an election are not always predictive.\n\nIn Texas, a new survey conducted by Latino Decisions, North Star Opinion Research, and the University of Houston, shows Trump polling behind not only Joe Biden but also Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. The poll results indicate that Trump's support in Texas ranges from 41% to 44%, while the Democratic candidates poll between 45% and 50%.\n\nSimilarly, a recent poll by the Washington Post and ABC News at the national level among registered voters shows Trump failing to breach 45% against any of his potential Democratic opponents.\n\nWhile it may be tempting to analyze the marginal differences between the Democratic candidates in these polls, several pollsters and political handicappers advise against over-interpreting these differences. The results, they say, reveal more about Trump's vulnerability than they do about the relative strengths of the various Democratic candidates.\n\nTrump's low approval rating, which has been consistently unpopular throughout his first two years in office, is a significant concern. According to Kyle Kondik, managing editor at Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, Trump sometimes runs a little behind his approval rating in some polls, which is an ominous sign for a president who was so reliant on voters who disliked both him and his opponent in the 2016 election.\n\nFurthermore, presidential approval ratings have historically been strongly linked to voting behavior. Trump's approval rating, which has been consistently unpopular throughout his first two years, is a significant concern. So far, at his best, he was 7 points more unpopular than popular. A recent uptick has swiftly eroded.\n\nIn conclusion, the latest polls suggest that President Trump is in a weak position for reelection. His low approval rating and poor showing in hypothetical head-to-head match-ups indicate that he may struggle to win over voters, particularly in traditionally Democratic strongholds like Texas. Trump's path to victory becomes increasingly narrow if he is unable to win over voters who dislike him.",
    " Title: Rep. Peter T. King Urges FBI to Focus on Muslim Community in Wake of Boston Marathon Bombings\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Peter T. King, a New York Republican and the chairman of the House Homeland Security subcommittee on counterintelligence and terrorism, has called for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to focus their investigations on threats from within the Muslim community following the Boston Marathon bombings. In an interview on \"Fox News Sunday,\" King stated, \"If you know a threat is coming from a certain community, that's where you look.\"\n\nKing's comments come as authorities continue to investigate the motives behind the Boston Marathon bombings, which occurred on Monday, April 15, 2013. The two suspected bombers, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died during a shootout with police on Thursday night, and his brother, 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was shot and remains in serious condition in a hospital, were of Islamic faith.\n\nAccording to King, the strategy of terrorists has changed since the September 11, 2001, attacks. No longer are al Qaeda or related groups plotting massive attacks from training camps in the Middle East. Instead, they are using individuals such as the Tsarnaev brothers to carry out attacks within the United States.\n\nKing also criticized the FBI for failing to catch the Tsarnaev brothers before the bombings. The FBI reportedly interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev but found nothing to link him to terrorism.\n\nIn a statement, the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center expressed sympathy for the victims of the bombings and acknowledged that both suspects were known to the Boston community. The statement read, \"Yet, no one inside these institutions was able to predict these acts of terror by the alleged suspects.\"\n\nThe Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center also expressed regret that they could not have prevented the bombings. The statement concluded, \"This hurts, and we wish we all could have done something to prevent this.\"",
    " Title: GSK Begins Mass Production of Ebola Vaccine in Unprecedented Move Amid Ongoing Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing Ebola epidemic in West Africa, drug company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has announced it will begin mass production of a vaccine that is currently in the early stages of human testing. This decision follows the World Health Organization's (WHO) groundbreaking decision that it is ethical to try unproven and experimental treatments during this public health emergency.\n\nThe process of bringing a drug or vaccine to market in the United States typically involves three phases of clinical trials in humans. Before testing it on humans, researchers must first present promising data from animal studies to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and receive approval to begin recruiting patients. This initial phase, known as the \"pre-clinical\" phase of drug development, can take several years, and for every 5,000 compounds discovered at this stage, only about five are allowed to be tried in humans.\n\nIf a drug or vaccine is approved for human trials, researchers must find hundreds and then thousands of volunteers to participate. In the first phase, they check for safety in a small group of healthy people to ensure the drug is not immediately making anyone sick or worse, and to determine how much of the drug people can tolerate.\n\nIn a larger group of participants, they test to ensure the treatment delivers on its promise and monitor how well it works against the best-available therapies or a placebo. The third phase involves an even bigger group, up to 3,000 people, and researchers compare how the drug works against other treatments on the market and carefully analyze safety data. This entire drug development process takes an average of 12 years and costs between $100 million and $1 billion.\n\nIf the drug makes it through phase three, the data are submitted to the FDA for approval. Only one in five therapies make it this far, and it usually takes the FDA a couple of years to consider the data and bring the drug to market, if it so chooses. The US has some of the most stringent standards in the world when it comes to getting new medicines to people, and for this reason, the overwhelming majority of promising drugs in animal studies never even make it to phase one trials, let alone past all the regulatory hurdles.\n\nGSK is already starting to manufacture an Ebola vaccine that only has promising animal studies behind it, but has not yet been fully tested in humans. The company has said it will have 10,000 doses stockpiled should the science for the vaccine check out. However, the vaccine is only in phase one, which is a long way from the end of the development road.\n\nWhen asked about the timeline for the Ebola vaccine, GSK representatives explained that the normal pathway for bringing a vaccine to market takes 10 years, and that they were already three years into the process with the Ebola vaccine. While this crisis has focused attention on Ebola drug development and helped to galvanize resources, they were not yet clear on what would happen after a successful phase one trial and how much longer it would take to scale-up manufacturing and get the vaccine approved for use in people.\n\nThere is a chance that the usual process might be condensed or phases of clinical testing skipped, since Ebola is an unusually deadly pathogen and will be treated differently by regulators. However, even in dire situations, developing safe, new therapies takes time, and unfortunately, mostly ends in failure. We're only in phase one with the Ebola vaccine. If data look promising, hopefully, regulators will find ways to make sure it's not seven more years until we can prevent another Ebola epidemic.",
    " Title: President Trump's Apology to Kavanaugh and City's Third Gender Birth Certificates Law\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo significant events took place in the last two days, with President Trump's speech at the swearing-in of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and the passing of a law in the city allowing third-gender birth certificates.\n\nIn the Supreme Court swearing-in ceremony, President Trump issued an apology on behalf of the country to Kavanaugh and his family for the \"terrible pain and suffering\" they endured during the confirmation process. He criticized the unfounded allegations against Kavanaugh, stating they violated fairness and the presumption of innocence. Trump also addressed Kavanaugh's young daughters, praising their father as a \"great man, a man of decency, character, kindness, and courage.\"\n\nThe event was more than a political rally; it aimed to restore dignity to the judiciary and counter the character-assassination attempt on Kavanaugh. With the eight other Supreme Court justices present, Trump's speech was a clear attempt to set a new tone for the judiciary.\n\nIn a separate event, the city passed a law allowing third-gender birth certificates. The law removes the requirement that a medical or mental health professional affirm an individual's gender to change the certificate. The law takes effect on January 1, and it's unclear if there are age requirements or limits to the number of times an individual can make changes.\n\nThe impact of this change on society, including gender roles in various aspects of life, is a subject of debate. Some argue that it's a significant step towards recognizing the identities of gender non-binary people, while others question the priorities of the mayor and City Council, given the complexity and urgency of other issues, such as public safety, education, and the tax system.\n\nIn both events, strong opinions and reactions have been expressed, with some viewing the Supreme Court ceremony as a necessary step towards restoring the dignity of the judiciary, while others question the priorities of the city's leaders in passing the third-gender birth certificates law. As always, these events spark important discussions and raise questions about the direction of our society.",
    " Title: Investigative Journalism Group Alleges Violent Tactics by Rose City Antifa in Portland\n\nArticle:\n\nInvestigative journalist group Project Veritas has released undercover footage that allegedly shows members of the Rose City Antifa (RCA) in Portland, Oregon, promoting violence and teaching combat techniques. The footage, released on Thursday, reportedly shows Project Veritas infiltrating RCA through an unnamed individual who recorded the group's ultra-secretive meetings.\n\nIn one of the clips, a man identified as Nicholas Cifuni is seen discussing the need to hide weapons from the police, stating, \"Don't be that fucking guy with the goddamn spike brass knuckles getting photos taken of you.\" He also suggests practicing eye gouges, stating, \"It takes very little pressure to injure someone's eyes.\"\n\nThe infiltrator, wearing a hoodie, ski mask, and sunglasses to protect his identity, described the process of becoming a member of Antifa, stating he was a \"prospect\" for the group. By his account, RCA enforced strict security measures, such as placing their phones in a neighboring bathroom with a fan that muffles sounds during meetings to prevent surveillance.\n\nThe source also detailed the vigorous security precautions deployed by the group upon their first meeting, remarking, \"They were getting this tradecraft from someone else, someone with much more experience, someone who did this for a living.\"\n\nProject Veritas identified the alleged founder of Rose City Antifa as Caroline Victorin. Records uncovered by \u2588\u2588\u2588 indicate the couple moved in 2017 following a 2015 Gofundme fundraiser that attempted to procure funds for a green card for Caroline's husband.\n\nSweden has a large Antifa scene; a Swedish Defence Research Institute (FOI) report detailed the extent of the movement and tied the Swedish \"anti-hate\" group, the Expo Foundation, along with the UK anti-hate group Hope not Hate to the Antifa anarchist scene. Both groups have also received cash in the past from Hungarian-American left-wing billionaire George Soros through his Open Society Foundation.\n\nBased in the city of Portland, RCA has become well-known as one of the most violent cells of Antifa in the United States and has been well-documented by journalist Andy Ngo. Ngo himself was brutally beaten by the group during a protest last year and suffered a brain bleed as a result.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced plans to designate the violent leftist group Antifa as a terrorist organization in May 2020. In November of last year, Gage Halupowski pled guilty to second-degree assault with an expandable baton and was sentenced to six years in prison. The victim, Adam Kelly, suffered a concussion and required 25 staples to his head following the vicious attack.\n\nAs the riots that began in Minneapolis continue to engulf the United States, RCA has also been active in Portland in recent days. They are allegedly behind a May 30 attack on a man carrying an American flag during the anti-police brutality protest, shouting, \"Black lives matter, faggot,\" as they beat him.",
    " Title: Five Killed, Two Injured in Shooting at Maryland Newspaper Office\n\nArticle:\n\nA shooting incident occurred at the offices of the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, on Thursday, resulting in five fatalities and two injuries. The gunman, identified as Jarrod Ramos, was arrested shortly after the attack and charged with five counts of first-degree murder.\n\nThe attack began at 14:40 local time (18:40 GMT) when the gunman entered the building with a shotgun and fired through a glass door into the newsroom. Staff members inside the building posted updates on social media as the attack unfolded.\n\nReporter Chase Cook tweeted, \"We are putting out a damn paper tomorrow.\" Staff worked in the parking lot to get the paper out despite the tragic circumstances.\n\nAn intern at the paper, Anthony Messenger, and crime reporter Phil Davis were among those who shared their experiences during the attack. Davis described the scene as \"like a war zone\" and tweeted about his experiences as he waited to be interviewed by police.\n\nCounty executive Steve Schuh stated that the suspect had been hiding under a desk in the building when police officers arrived \"within 60 seconds\" of receiving news of the incident. There was \"no exchange of fire,\" he added.\n\nDeputy chief of Anne Arundel County Police, William Krampf, confirmed that an item believed to be an explosive device was found at the premises and destroyed. It was later determined to be a smoke bomb.\n\nPolice safely evacuated 170 people from the building, which housed 30 other businesses. The Committee to Protect Journalists reported that before the Maryland shooting, seven journalists had been killed in the US in relation to their work since 1992.\n\nThe Capital Gazette reportedly wrote an article in 2011 about a woman who said Jarrod Ramos was stalking her, and he failed in his attempts to sue the paper for defamation the following year. Police did not ascribe any motive after arresting him following Thursday's attack.\n\nRamos is scheduled for a bail hearing on Friday morning in Annapolis. Federal agencies, including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were involved in the response to the attack.\n\nMaryland governor Larry Hogan and President Donald Trump expressed their condolences for the victims and their families. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) deployed counterterrorism teams to media organizations in and around New York City as a precaution.\n\nMayor of Annapolis Gavin Buckley and Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen also responded to the shooting.

The address, delivered to a joint session of Congress, was followed by a Democratic response and analysis from various news outlets.\n\nPresident Trump commemorated Black History Month and acknowledged the work that remains to be done in addressing racial issues. He emphasized the importance of education, suggesting that school choice could help revitalize urban regions and benefit failing minority youths.\n\nThe president also addressed recent threats against Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as the shooting in Kansas City, stating that while the nation may be divided on policies, it stands united in condemning hate and evil.\n\nImmigration was another key topic, with Trump reiterating his promise to get tough on illegal immigration. He stated, \"We are removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens.\"\n\nHealthcare was another significant point of discussion, with Trump expressing a desire to ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage and a stable transition for those currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.\n\nIn a moving moment, the president recognized Carryn Owens, the widow of Senior Chief William \"Ryan\" Owens, who was killed last month in a covert raid against al-Qaeda in Yemen. Trump praised Owens' sacrifice, stating, \"For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.\"\n\nThe Democratic response was delivered by former Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear, who criticized the president for rolling back regulations, waging war on immigrants, and calling to repeal Obamacare.\n\nFollowing the address, congressional members offered their reactions. Many praised the president's unifying speech and statesman-like demeanor, while others expressed a desire for more specifics and details from the president.\n\nRepublican lawmakers feel encouraged and are ready to work on priorities like immigration reform and repealing and replacing Obamacare.

    " Title: \"GOP Congressmen's Late-Night Swim in the Sea of Galilee Sparks Controversy and Allegations\"\n\nArticle:\n\nA report by Politico detailing a late-night swim by Republican congressmen in the Sea of Galilee last year, including one who allegedly went skinny-dipping, has led to a series of clarifications from Capitol Hill and accusations between two primary opponents.\n\nThe report states that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) looked into the incident, which occurred during a visit by a mix of GOP congressional freshmen and leaders as guests of The American Israel Educational Foundation in Israel.\n\nAccording to Politico, Kansas Rep. Kevin Yoder reportedly stripped naked and jumped into the water that night, with several other clothed or partially clothed lawmakers and staff members also participating in the swim. Alcohol may have been a factor for some, the report suggests.\n\nThe congressmen named in the report include Florida Rep. Steve Southerland, New York Rep. Tom Reed, California Rep. Jeff Denham, and New York Rep. Michael Grimm. The report also named Arizona Rep. Ben Quayle as participating, but his office and his wife vehemently denied his involvement.\n\nJay Heiler, Quayle's spokesman, told Fox News that Politico's inclusion of the congressman in the beach scenes was inaccurate. He stated that people were leaving the dinner that night at different times, and Quayle did not go to the beach afterward.\n\nQuayle's primary opponent, Rep. Dave Schweikert, has accused Quayle of embarrassing \"both the institution of Congress and Arizona with his completely inappropriate behavior that calls into question yet again his fitness to be in Congress.\"\n\nIn response, Quayle's wife, Tiffany, claimed the Quayle family did not partake in the water antics, despite the Politico report. She stated, \"Ben and I and our daughter Evie were there together that evening in the Holy Land, although I was eight and a half months pregnant with her. We were neither party nor witness to any of the inappropriate behavior described in the article, nor were we a part of, or aware of any inquiry. We did return to Arizona with some water from the Sea of Galilee to baptize Evie after she was born.\"\n\nThe Sea of Galilee is a significant religious site, where Jesus is said to have walked on water.\n\nRep. Kevin Yoder has expressed remorse for any embarrassment caused, stating, \"I feel incredibly remorseful that I have caused embarrassment to my constituents and I have caused folks who believe in me to be disappointed.\"\n\nThe original report states that the lawmakers who participated were rebuked last year by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the most senior Republican on the trip and the most senior Jewish lawmaker in Congress.",
    " Title: FBI Faces Questions Over Possible Missed Signs in Florida School Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nThe mass shooting at a Florida high school has reignited discussions about potential missed opportunities for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to prevent such incidents. Last fall, a Mississippi bail bondsman and video blogger reported a comment on one of his YouTube videos that stated, \"I'm going to be a professional school shooter.\" He immediately reported it to YouTube and the FBI, and the next day, two FBI agents visited his office to take a printout of the comment and inquire about the commenter's identity.\n\nAlthough the commenter's username was \"Nikolas Cruz,\" the same name as the 19-year-old suspect in the shooting, the FBI has not been able to identify the poster, according to Robert Lasky, the special agent in charge of the FBI office in Miami. The FBI interviewed the individual who reported the comment and searched public records databases, actions consistent with those taken during an FBI assessment, the lowest level and least intrusive stage of an FBI inquiry. However, the FBI has not conclusively linked the account to the shooter.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cruz allegedly entered his former high school in Florida with an AR-15 rifle and opened fire, killing 17 people on school grounds. This incident is the latest in a series of attacks that have raised questions about whether individuals who have previously come to the attention of law enforcement should have remained under investigation. In the last two years, individuals responsible for massacres at an Orlando nightclub, in the streets of New York City, and at a Florida airport had all been scrutinized by federal agents but were eventually deemed not to warrant continued law enforcement attention.\n\nFBI assessments are initiated following the receipt of a tip, which could be based on something as simple as observing unusual activity in a neighbor's garage or a classmate's comments. Agents often face the challenge of determining which of the tens of thousands of tips received each year, and more than 10,000 assessments opened, could yield a viable threat.\n\nHad the FBI been able to confirm that Cruz was the same person as the YouTube poster, they would have found numerous photos of rifles, ammunition, and targets filled with bullet holes, likely leading to a face-to-face interview. The FBI did not notify police in Florida about the post before the mass shooting.\n\n\"They owe us some more detail on what they did,\" retired FBI assistant director Ron Hosko said.\n\nThe questions arise as the FBI is already under scrutiny and facing criticism from President Donald Trump and some congressional Republicans, who have accused the agency of anti-Trump bias, particularly in relation to special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. However, it is unclear whether the agency dropped the ball in this case, Hosko said.\n\n\"With anything that the FBI receives, they are constrained to act based on what they have in front of them,\" said Hosko. \"You have a random internet posting that suggests the person wants to do something, not that they are planning on doing something.\"\n\nFBI guidelines, designed to balance national security with civil liberties protections, impose restrictions on the steps agents may take during the assessment phase. Agents may analyze information from government databases and open-source internet searches, and can conduct interviews during an assessment. However, they cannot request wiretaps or internet communications without higher levels of approval and a more solid basis to suspect a crime.\n\n\"It's a tricky situation because sometimes you get information regarding individuals and they may be just showing off, blustering,\" said Herbert Cousins Jr., a retired FBI special agent in charge.\n\nA vague, uncorroborated threat alone may not be enough to proceed to the next level of investigation, according to Jeffrey Ringel, a former FBI agent and Joint Terrorism Task force supervisor who now works for the Soufan Group, a private security firm. Many assessments are closed within days or weeks when the FBI concludes there's no criminal or national security threat, or basis for continued scrutiny. The system is designed to ensure that a person who has not broken the law does not remain under perpetual scrutiny on a mere hunch\u2014and that the FBI can reserve its scarce resources for true threats.\n\nHad he pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State, for example, investigators might have had enough evidence to proceed with a more intrusive probe. Tips like the one that came in about the Florida gunman are among countless complaints that come into the FBI daily with varying degrees of specificity.\n\n\"How many of these do you expect the FBI to handle before it becomes the Federal Bureau of Complaints?\" said retired FBI assistant director Ron Hosko. \"They could spend their entire workforce tracking down internet exchanges that never going to go anywhere.\"",
    " Title: Putin's Intervention in Syria: A Turn of Events and Its Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent Syrian crisis, unfolding as the new academic year began, has sparked discussions among the nation's future leaders, who are now settling into their college campuses. The Class of '17, equipped with tales of adventure and unique experiences, is studying in institutions boasting luxurious amenities, from gyms and playing fields to Olympic-sized swimming pools.\n\nHowever, the educational experience of these students has been a subject of debate. With the liberal arts diminished and the focus on practical, career-oriented subjects, students may not be adequately prepared to analyze and critique arguments, as the study of poetics and rhetoric has been removed from the curriculum.\n\nThe latest turn of events in the Syrian crisis, as described by President Barack Obama, has been compared to a theatrical performance or a \"theater of war.\" Secretary of State John F. Kerry's gaffe, inviting an improbable rescue, has been likened to the \"deus ex machina\" in Greek and Roman theater, a plot device where a god intervenes to resolve an intractable situation.\n\nThis comparison, however, was lost on a young graduate of an elite school when the concept was explained to him. The deus ex machina, a device used to resolve a plot without a plausible solution, is a reminder of the importance of historical and cultural knowledge, a skill that is increasingly rare in today's education system.\n\nThe Syrian crisis reached a critical point when Congress took votes on whether to authorize missile strikes on Syrian stocks of poison gas. With a likely defeat looming, President Obama found himself in a precarious position. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been a key supporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, dispatched a chariot, so to speak, to rescue Obama from this predicament.\n\nPutin's intervention has been hailed as a \"victory\" for Obama by some, but the world, and particularly Washington, may not be able to afford such a turn of events. The Russian leader's intervention has effectively delayed help for the Syrian rebels and taken control of the civil war and events in the Middle East.\n\nThe debate on the Syrian atrocity, as President Obama had called for, is now effectively over, decided by who best exploited and manipulated Secretary Kerry's gaffe. The use of the deus ex machina, in this case, has raised questions about the future of international relations and the role of the United States in global conflicts.\n\nSuzanne Fields, a columnist for The \u2588\u2588\u2588, has written that the Putin rescue operation is a reflection of what students may not have learned. The Greek and Roman classics, once the roots of a Western education, no longer form the common cultural knowledge that enables reasoning through analogies and metaphors.\n\nPutin's intervention in Syria has been a reminder of the importance of historical and cultural knowledge, as well as the need for critical thinking and the ability to analyze and critique arguments. As the world watches the events unfold, it remains to be seen how this turn of events will shape the future of international relations and the role of the United States in global conflicts.",
    " Title: Secret Service Director Julia Pierson Resigns Following White House Security Breach\n\nArticle:\n\nSecret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned Wednesday, following a security breach at the White House and other high-profile incidents that raised concerns about the safety of the president and his family. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson announced the resignation in a written statement, and the White House confirmed her decision shortly afterward. President Obama stated that \"new leadership of that agency was required,\" according to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.\n\nJohnson said, \"Today Julia Pierson, the Director of the United States Secret Service, offered her resignation, and I accepted it. I salute her 30 years of distinguished service to the Secret Service and the Nation.\" A source familiar with the situation told Fox News that Johnson told Pierson the resignation would be effective immediately, after she offered.\n\nThe resignation comes just days after the Sept. 19 incident where an intruder jumped over the White House fence and darted past several layers of security to enter the White House itself. He was able to make it to the East Room before being apprehended.\n\nPierson's departure, though, marked a sharp turnaround from a day earlier, when despite her rocky performance during congressional testimony, the White House voiced support for her leadership. Asked Tuesday whether Obama had confidence in the director, Earnest said \"absolutely.\"\n\nHowever, on Wednesday, the director was facing bipartisan calls to step down. Rep. Elijah Cummings, top Democrat on the committee that grilled Pierson, notably told NPR she is \"not the person to lead that agency\" -- though he later clarified he thinks she should go if she cannot restore public trust.\n\nAsked what had changed to lead to her resignation, Earnest said foremost that Pierson had offered her resignation. But he also said Wednesday that \"recent and accumulating reports\" raised \"legitimate questions\" about the agency. Earnest said Obama agrees that Pierson's resignation is in the best interest of the agency.\n\nAmong those reports was the revelation that on Sept. 16, a security contractor armed with a gun who had previously been arrested for assault rode on an elevator with Obama and his security detail at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, violating Secret Service protocol. Earnest said the president only learned about that incident on Tuesday.\n\nNew and alarming details also emerged -- seemingly by the day -- about the multiple security failures in the Sept. 19 intrusion. Not until late Monday was it reported that he made it into the East Room, a detail that was confirmed by Pierson during her testimony.\n\nJohnson said that he now agrees that a \"panel of independent experts\" should review the Sept. 19 incident -- something that had been called for by lawmakers. He said such a panel will submit its assessment and recommendations by Dec. 15.\n\n\"I will also request that the panel advise me about whether it believes, given the series of recent events, there should be a review of broader issues concerning the Secret Service. The security of the White House compound should be the panel's primary and immediate priority,\" he said.\n\nHe said a separate internal review will be completed by Nov. 1. Johnson said he's appointing Joseph Clancy, a former special agent in charge of the Presidential Protective Division who retired in 2011, as interim director.\n\nThe Sept. 19 incident involving a Texas Army veteran who jumped the White House fence and was able to make it deep into the Executive Mansion before being stopped is now just one of several embarrassing disclosures about lapses in presidential security involving the Secret Service.\n\nDespite more than three hours of questioning by House lawmakers on Tuesday, Pierson neglected to mention the incident in Atlanta. Her failure to do so prompted Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, to call for Pierson's resignation -- or firing -- in an interview with Fox News Tuesday night. In a statement on Wednesday, Chaffetz welcomed the decision to step down and urged the president to fill the post with \"new leadership from outside the Secret Service for a fresh start.\"\n\nAt Tuesday's hearing, Pierson said she was the one who briefs Obama on threats to his personal security and said she had briefed him only once this year, \"for the Sept. 19 incident.\" She also disclosed that shortly before the alleged intruder, Omar J. Gonzalez, scaled the fence at least two of her uniformed officers recognized him from an earlier troubling encounter but did not approach him or report his presence to superiors.\n\nLawmakers were aghast, too, about a four-day delay in 2011 before the Secret Service realized a man had fired a high-powered rifle at the White House, as reported by the Washington Post on Sunday.\n\nPierson told the hearing the security plan for protecting the White House was not \"properly executed\" on Sept. 19. The Secret Service's story about the extent of that breach changed late Monday night after the Washington Post first reported that Gonzalez got well past the front door of the White House. Previously it had said Gonzalez had been stopped just inside the front door. After hours of questioning Tuesday, it remained unclear what and when Pierson and Johnson knew about the incident. The Secret Service is part of the Homeland Security Department.\n\nThe Sept. 19 breach was the latest black eye for the agency. Pierson was originally brought in early last year after the 2012 prostitution scandal in Colombia.\n\nGonzalez was indicted Tuesday and pleaded not guilty on Wednesday before Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson in U.S. District Court.",
    " Title: U.S. and Turkey Face Criticism Over Syria Offensive as American Troops Withdraw\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States and Turkey are facing criticism over the ongoing military operation in northern Syria, with many expressing concern over the potential consequences of the U.S. troop withdrawal.\n\nCritics argue that the decision to withdraw U.S. troops and allow Turkey to take a more active role in the region is a departure from previous U.S. policy and could have far-reaching implications.\n\nOne critic, whose identity was not specified, stated, \"Trump may indeed have campaigned on getting out of Syria. He didn't campaign on potentially freeing thousands of Islamic State fighters, or greenlighting ethnic cleansing, or empowering Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and Russian president Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nAnother critic, also unnamed, expressed concern that the decision to withdraw U.S. troops could lead to a humanitarian crisis, stating, \"Even operating within the constraints that Trump has foolishly adopted, there are actions the U.S. could\u2014and should\u2014take to mitigate the damage.\"\n\nThe U.S. has imposed sanctions on Turkey in response to the military operation, but it remains unclear whether these sanctions will be effective in altering Turkey's actions in Syria. The U.S. has a history of imposing sanctions on countries as a means of exerting pressure, but the effectiveness of this approach is debated.\n\nIt is also unclear what the long-term consequences of the U.S. withdrawal and Turkey's military operation in Syria will be, as the situation is still unfolding. The U.S. and its allies are reportedly working to evacuate U.S. troops from the affected areas, and the Kurds have signed on to cooperate with the Syrian army.\n\nThe U.S. has not released any official statements regarding the effectiveness of the sanctions or the long-term consequences of the U.S. withdrawal and Turkey's military operation in Syria. It is also unclear what, if any, actions the U.S. plans to take to mitigate the potential humanitarian crisis in the region.",
    " Title: Rand Paul Navigates Challenges in Advancing Libertarian Agenda on College Campuses\n\nArticle:\n\nRand Paul, the Kentucky Republican senator and potential 2016 presidential candidate, is visiting various college campuses to promote his libertarian agenda. However, Paul faces a challenge in appealing to young people without alienating other Republicans.\n\nDuring a recent appearance at the College of Charleston, Paul was asked about his stance on Plan B, the emergency contraception commonly known as the morning-after pill. The question, posed by a young woman, highlighted the challenge Paul faces in balancing his libertarian views with the Republican party's stance on social issues.\n\nNotably uncomfortable with the question, Paul initially stated, \"I am not opposed to birth control.\" He then elaborated, \"That's basically what Plan B is. Plan B is taking two birth control pills in the morning and two in the evening, and I am not opposed to that.\"\n\nAnother student questioned Paul about the legalization of marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. Paul expressed his opposition to drug use but supported leaving drug laws up to the states, citing Colorado and Washington's experimentation with legalized marijuana as an example.\n\nPaul has had success on the college circuit, with visits to universities such as Harvard and Howard garnering positive headlines and support from Republicans seeking to modernize the party and broaden its national appeal. His opposition to government surveillance, a topic he often discusses with young people, has been a popular talking point.\n\nIn March 2013, Paul won a straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) after delivering a passionate speech against government surveillance. He also attracted a crowd of young supporters at a nearby restaurant, where he danced and sang with college students.\n\nDuring a post-talk interview in the College of Charleston's sun-splashed campus courtyard, Paul was asked about thorny issues that often put his party at odds with young people, such as drug legalization and same-sex marriage.\n\nWhen asked about the legalization of hard drugs like cocaine or heroin, Paul hedged, stating his position as less criminalization and more fair adjudication for those caught with drugs. He also expressed support for second chances for young people who make mistakes.\n\nRegarding same-sex marriage, Paul favors traditional marriage but supports states determining their own marriage laws. When asked about the Republican Party's ability to win a national election if it is out of step with rapidly changing opinions on the issue, Paul took a soft tone, acknowledging that society is changing and that even within the Republican Party, opinions on the issue are evolving.\n\nWhen asked if he could reconsider his stance on marriage, Paul seemed to hint at the possibility but did not commit to a change in his views. He emphasized his traditionalist beliefs but also expressed a desire for the Republican Party to accommodate people on both sides of the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, Rand Paul's visits to college campuses highlight the challenge he faces in balancing his libertarian views with the Republican party's stance on social issues. His responses to questions about Plan B, drug legalization, and same-sex marriage reveal a politician who is navigating a complex dance as he tries to color outside the lines of the Republican Party while maintaining his appeal to young voters.",
    " Title: U.S. Presidential Candidates Address Police Shootings, Email Controversy, and Party Platforms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a series of high-profile police shootings and subsequent violence, the U.S. presidential candidates have found themselves navigating a tumultuous political landscape. Last week, two black men were shot dead by police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota, prompting a violent response from a black extremist in Dallas, Texas, who killed five police officers.\n\nBoth candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, have responded to these events, with Trump's statement on Facebook receiving widespread coverage. Trump strongly defended the police while expressing sympathy for the victims, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, and acknowledging the worsening racial divisions in the country. Clinton, on the other hand, addressed a conference of black religious leaders, urging national guidelines for police use of force.\n\nAs the country grapples with these issues, the candidates are being judged not just as politicians, but as potential healers for a divided nation. Trump is perceived as a strong leader and a supporter of law enforcement, while Clinton has adopted a more unifying tone in her campaign, aiming to connect with the African-American community.\n\nThe email controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton also continued last week, with FBI Director James Comey finding Clinton guilty of setting up an unauthorized private email server, being \"extremely reckless\" in handling classified material, and making false statements to the American people. However, Comey refused to indict Clinton, a decision that has not diminished the public's perception of her as dishonest and untrustworthy.\n\nIn the aftermath of Comey's announcement, Trump spent most of his Cincinnati speech defending his campaign's use of a Star of David in a tweet, rather than addressing Clinton's email scandal. This strategy may have missed a significant opportunity to make the email controversy a more prominent issue in the eyes of swing voters.\n\nMeanwhile, Clinton has moved further to the left, endorsing free college for families with incomes below $125,000 and advocating for a single-payer healthcare system. However, her allies have rebuffed proposals to oppose a vote on President Obama's Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership in the lame-duck congressional session after the election.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Bernie Sanders is expected to endorse Clinton, but further challenges to the Democratic Party's rules and platform are likely. The Republican and Democratic party rules and platform committees will meet this week, with potential fights over the party platforms and resolutions. Trump is also expected to announce his running mate this week or at the Republican National Convention. Potential choices include Newt Gingrich, Michael Flynn, and Mike Pence.\n\nOverall, the presidential race is shaping up to be a battle of contrasting ideologies and leadership styles, with both candidates seeking to appeal to a divided and concerned electorate.",
    " Title: White House and Republicans Begin Detailed Discussions on Fiscal Cliff, Tax Increases and Spending Cuts Proposed\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's top aides presented a budget framework to Republicans on Thursday that includes $1.6 trillion in tax increases and future spending cuts to avoid the \"fiscal cliff.\" The offer was immediately rejected by GOP leaders, who called for the White House to \"get serious\" about spending cuts.\n\nThe discussions mark the beginning of real, detailed negotiations after weeks of negotiating over principles. Republicans have already agreed to allow the government to raise revenue, and they are looking for Democrats to agree that major entitlements such as Medicare will have to be cut. However, Democrats say Republicans have yet to specify which taxes they will raise or propose their own spending cuts.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, said at a news conference, \"Now is the time for the Republicans to move past this happy talk about revenues \u2014 ill-defined, of course \u2014 and put specifics on the table.\" He was surrounded by his leadership team.\n\nThe White House's wish list includes billions of dollars more in stimulus spending, a call to curtail Congress' control over the federal debt limit, a rise in the estate tax, and an increase in taxes on dividends. These items would undo parts of President Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax plans and are likely to be contentious among some Democrats, as well as with Republicans.\n\nIn exchange, Mr. Obama repeated his pledge to find up to $400 billion in entitlement spending cuts later, as well as to undertake an overhaul of the tax code.\n\nSpeaker of the House John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, said after meeting with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner that they are no closer to a deal.\n\nThe White House has signaled some flexibility. Although Mr. Obama has called for tax rates on upper-income earners to rise from 35 percent to 39.6 percent, he and his aides have privately told key players that they would be willing to accept something less than the 39.6 percent rate. However, they have said that rates will have to rise somewhat.\n\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney said Republican leaders must \"accept the essential fact\" that tax rates on the nation's top earners must go up as part of a deficit-reduction deal.\n\n\"The president will not sign any legislation that extends the Bush-era tax cuts for the top earners in this country,\" he said.\n\nCongressional Republicans said that is out of the question. Instead, they want the additional government revenue to come from ending tax breaks and closing loopholes.\n\n\"I've made clear that we've put real concessions on the line by putting revenues on the table right upfront,\" said Mr. Boehner. \"Unfortunately, many Democrats continue to rule out sensible spending cuts that must be part of any significant agreement that will reduce our deficit.\"\n\nHowever, Mr. Boehner has not laid out what specific tax breaks he would end, nor have Republicans proposed spending cuts as part of these negotiations. Instead, Mr. Boehner pointed reporters back to the House Republican budget for a list of ideas.\n\nAll sides are trying to head off the \"fiscal cliff\" \u2014 the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts on Jan. 1, followed by $110 billion in automatic spending cuts. Going over the cliff and staying there likely would plunge the country into a short, sharp recession, though delaying the spending cuts and tax increases would mean deeper pain in the long run, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe challenge for Mr. Obama and Congress is to try to spread the pain while doing the least harm to the economy. Mr. Geithner's separate meetings with congressional leaders marked the first major get-together between top negotiators since Mr. Obama called the leaders to the White House two weeks ago. At that time, Mr. Boehner, Mr. Reid, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, met with Mr. Obama at the White House and emerged sounding optimistic about the chances of reaching a deal to extend tax cuts and replace the spending cuts, known as \"sequestration,\" that were set into motion through last year's bipartisan deal to raise the nation's borrowing limit.\n\nMr. McConnell accused the Obama administration of being more interested in appealing to the \"hard left\" than having a \"serious discussion about how we fix the economy, reduce the federal debt, and return the country to a path of growth and prosperity for all.\"\n\nMr. Boehner said he is \"disappointed\" with the negotiations and warned that \"there's a real danger of going off the fiscal cliff.\"\n\n\"Without spending cuts and entitlement reforms, it's going to be impossible to address our country's debt crises and get our economy going again and to create jobs,\" he said. \"So right now, all eyes are on the White House.\"\n\nThe two parties also have staked out different positions on how best to increase the nation's $16.4 trillion debt limit, which the federal government could reach as early as next month. Mr. Reid said that any agreement in the \"fiscal cliff\" talks must include an increase in the borrowing limit, while Mr. Boehner said any increase has to be matched dollar for dollar with spending cuts.\n\nDemocrats said they see signs of cracks in the Republican opposition to raising tax rates. They pointed to Rep. Tom Cole, the Oklahoma Republican who is calling on his party to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for families making less than $250,000 a year, and then return to the negotiating table to fight to extend current tax rates for those making more.\n\n\"As Tom Cole said, let's give a Christmas present to the American people,\" Mrs. Pelosi told reporters.\n\nSen. Charles E. Schumer, meanwhile, said Democrats don't expect \"the Republicans to be enthusiastic and start cheerleading about a deal that includes higher rates on the wealthiest Americans.\"\n\n\"They're not going to openly concede on this point this far out from the deadline,\" the New York Democrat said. \"But they see the handwriting on the wall.\"\n\nOther Republicans said the majority of the caucus does not agree with Mr. Cole's approach.\n\n\"I think he is wrong, and I think most of the conference thinks he is wrong,\" said Rep. Raul R. Labrador, Idaho Republican, to CNN. \"I think that he is a good man who has served here for a long time, but he is also a man who has voted for a lot of the increased spending in Washington, D.C.\"",
    " Title: Obama Contemplates Wide-Ranging Executive Actions, Including Cybersecurity Measures and Mortgage Refinancing Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama is reportedly considering a series of executive actions, one of which will focus on establishing new standards for private-sector companies to protect computer systems from hackers. This move is expected to spark controversy among Republican lawmakers.\n\nOther potential executive actions under consideration include policies to aid homeowners in refinancing mortgages, new protections for homosexual government contractors, energy-efficient building requirements, and stricter regulations for coal-fired power plants.\n\nLast month, Obama issued 23 administrative actions on gun violence, and in the past, he has issued orders that delayed the deportations of young illegal immigrants and lowered student loan payments.\n\nA White House official stated that Obama is not using his executive powers to bypass Congress but rather to advance his top priorities. However, Republicans view these actions as a power grab and a violation of the Constitution.\n\nRecently, a federal appeals court ruled that the president exceeded his constitutional powers by appointing new members to the National Labor Relations Board while the Senate was on break.\n\nOne of the more significant executive actions being considered by the president, according to The Washington Post, would provide homeowners with a better opportunity to refinance at today's low interest rates. Obama has already used his powers to make refinancing easier for people with loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but his new plan could extend these opportunities to people who are behind on the payments of their privately backed mortgages.\n\nThe decision to pursue new executive actions is reportedly due to Obama's conclusion that Republicans are unlikely to pass many of his major agenda items.",
    " Title: \"2016 Presidential Prospects: A Review of the Former GOP \"Deep Bench\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2016 presidential race has seen a significant shift in the perceived strength of potential Republican candidates, with many from the once-touted \"deep bench\" now facing challenges or exiting the race altogether.\n\nIn 2012, former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, who was the third-ranked candidate on National Journal's \"deep bench\" list for 2016, is currently fighting public corruption charges for accepting an estimated $165,000 in gifts from a donor. His class of 2009 colleague, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, is also under scrutiny, with investigations into the George Washington Bridge retribution scandal and allegations that his lieutenant governor threatened to withhold Sandy aid as payback for a development deal.\n\nMarco Rubio, the second-ranked contender, has also faded from prominence after attempting to appeal to the center with immigration reform and then shifting to the right. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, who was lucky to be seventh on the list, flamed out after criticizing the GOP and becoming the most unpopular Republican governor in the country in 2013.\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz, who was not on the list, has imploded due to his self-promoting and extremist political style. Senator Rand Paul, who was sixth on the list, has been criticized for his lightweight persona, plagiarism issues, and politically suicidal foreign policy skepticism.\n\nRepresentative Paul Ryan, who was fifth on the list, has reinvented himself as a champion of the poor and a supporter of Pope Francis, but his performance on the 2012 ticket was criticized for hurting Mitt Romney. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who is receiving renewed attention due to Christie's troubles, is under investigation for ethically challenged associates and has been named one of the nation's \"worst governors\" by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nThis leaves former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who was fourth on the list, as a potential frontrunner. Bush is beloved by the GOP establishment but faces criticism from the Tea Party and questions about his ties to Wall Street. His association with the failed Lehman Brothers, which cost Florida's state and local pension funds $1 billion, could be a potential conflict in a national race.\n\nSouth Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, South Dakota Senator John Thune, and Indiana Representative Mike Pence rounded out the National Journal list. The future of the 2016 race remains uncertain, but it is clear that the once-promising \"deep bench\" of Republican candidates has taken a significant hit.",
    " Title: Michelle Williams Advocates for Reproductive Freedom at 2020 Golden Globes\n\nArticle:\n\nActress Michelle Williams won her second Golden Globe award for her role on Fosse/Verdon during the ceremony in Los Angeles on Sunday night. In her acceptance speech, she emphasized the importance of reproductive freedom.\n\nWilliams began her speech by acknowledging the choices made by the actor and as a person. She expressed gratitude for the recognition of her choices and for living in a society where choice exists.\n\nAccording to a report by Anna North for \u2588\u2588\u2588, it is likely that the Supreme Court will dismantle Roe v. Wade in 2020. Already, multiple states have enacted laws that effectively ban abortions. In March, the Court will hear arguments for June Medical Services v. Gee, a case centered on whether Louisiana can restrict abortions to treatment centers where at least one doctor has admitting privileges at an area hospital.\n\nAdmitting privilege laws, a common tactic used by red states to limit the number of abortion providers, are often justified in the name of women's safety. However, advocates for abortion rights argue that it is rare for anyone to need hospitalization after an abortion. With Brett Kavanaugh on the bench, it is believed that the Court will uphold Louisiana's law, making it possible for states to outlaw abortion and potentially overturn Roe.\n\nWilliams, an active participant in Hollywood's Time's Up movement, declared that she could not have lived the life she has had without the guarantee of a woman's right to choose, and of knowing she would be able \"to choose when to have my children, and with whom.\"\n\n\"I know my choices might look different than yours,\" Williams said. \"But thank god or whomever you pray to that we live in a country founded on the principle that I am free to live by my faith and you are free to live by yours.\"\n\nWilliams concluded her speech by urging women to vote in their self-interest, stating, \"Women, 18 to 118, when it is time to vote, please do so in your own self-interest. It's what men have been doing for years.\" Tiffany Haddish, who presented the award, applauded vigorously behind Williams, stating, \"I'm about that women's right to choose.\"",
    " Title: Top Risks to Watch Out for in 2020: A Neutral Assessment\n\nArticle:\n\nThe year 2020 is expected to present several potential disruptions and challenges, according to Robert A. Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security. Manning, who has served in various roles within the U.S. Department of State, outlines the following top risks to watch for in 2020:\n\n1. 2020 Elections: The outcome of the U.S. presidential election, whether it results in a second term for President Trump or a victory for the Democratic challenger, is likely to deepen political tribalism in the United States. A Trump reelection could lead to four more years of U.S. withdrawal from the multilateral world order and a global leadership deficit. A narrow Trump loss could cause domestic political turmoil. A Democratic victory and left-leaning economic policies could also create uncertainty and turmoil in markets.\n\n2. Brexit: The United Kingdom's departure from the European Union, scheduled for January 31, 2020, is certain. However, political and economic uncertainties abound. A U.K.-EU trade deal may take longer than 2020 to negotiate, leading to potential economic disruptions. Brexit could also lead to the breakup of the United Kingdom, as the Scottish Nationalist Party pursues another independence referendum and Irish nationalist MPs' strong election performance in Northern Ireland positions them to consider their future. London's global financial hub is also at risk.\n\n3. North Korean Defiance: Tensions with North Korea are likely to rise in 2020, as Pyongyang continues developing strategic weapons. Despite Kim Jong-un's offer for another summit with President Trump, Kim has escalated his blackmail efforts, threatening a \"new path\" with powerful strategic weapons if the U.S. fails to make concessions. A fa\u00e7ade of diplomacy may continue, but Kim appears to be inching closer to a strategic choice: pursuing a \"new path\" that may unleash a new cycle of \"fire and fury\" rhetoric, potentially leading to conflict.\n\n4. The Great Unraveling: The World Trade Organization (WTO), a key enabler of 70 years of prosperity and a rules-based economic order, may become defunct. In the best-case scenario, after a lapse of six to 24 months, a new arbitration mechanism with a reduced mandate and a reformed WTO may emerge. However, universal rules and enforcement will be less important in shaping the terms of trade than large countries using their market size to weaponize trade via tariffs.\n\n5. A Bifurcated World: The decoupling of the world's two largest economies, the United States and China, amid growing techno-nationalism on both sides, is driving a new global economic dynamic. The main elements of Beijing's predatory mercantilism remain largely undiluted, while Washington is seeking to disrupt supply chains linking the United States and China. Decoupling will occur largely in the telecom/5G and electronics/IT sectors, and sensitive national security-related industries, resulting in a fragmented internet and e-commerce.\n\n6. Gray Swan: A China reckoning/world financial crisis: A perfect storm involving a simultaneous slowdown in the three economic centers (U.S., China, and EU) and the U.S.-China decoupling could catapult the global economy into another deep economic crisis. China's internal contradictions, including massive public, household, and corporate debt, aging demographics, and sagging growth, offer a preview of the costs to the U.S. of a bifurcated global economy.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list, but an assessment of top risks to watch for in 2020. Other potential conflicts in the greater Middle East, such as Syria, Libya, Yemen, and Iran, are percolating, and proxy or real U.S. conflict with Iran is within the realm of the plausible. All things considered, 2020 promises to be a wild ride. The one risk you won't have to worry about is boredom.",
    " Title: Attorney General Eric Holder to Attend Paris Anti-Terrorism Rally\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder will represent the United States at a rally against terrorism in Paris, France, on Sunday afternoon, according to news reports. President Barack Obama has no public events scheduled, and Secretary of State John Kerry is on a trip to India.\n\nThe rally, which millions are expected to attend, will feature several European heads of state and dozens of high-level delegations from other countries. The demonstration is a response to last week's deadly attacks by radical Islamic terrorists on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a kosher supermarket, in which twelve and four people were killed, respectively.\n\nHolder, who has been criticized for denying the links between radical Islam and terrorism, is notorious for preferring to blame \"extremism\" instead. In testimony to Congress in May 2010, Holder refused to blame radical Islam in addressing the possible motives of terrorists who had recently launched attacks against the United States.\n\nIn matters of race in the United States, Holder has been less careful. He and President Barack Obama have been accused of creating an atmosphere of mistrust in the debate over the deaths of unarmed black suspects at the hands of police. Critics blame this atmosphere for attacks on police, including the assassination of two New York Police Department officers on patrol in an anti-terror exercise last month.\n\nHolder has also sought to try terrorists in federal, civilian courts rather than at military tribunals in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. His department investigated the Central Intelligence Agency's use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" but declined to prosecute any agents. Instead of extended questioning, the U.S. now reads terror suspects their Miranda rights fairly soon after apprehension, under new Department of Justice policies.\n\nIn addition, Holder has shown lenience to terrorists in the past. During the administration of Bill Clinton, he reportedly pushed the Department of Justice to drop its objection to the commutations of sentences for members of a Puerto Rican terrorist group.\n\nFox News reports that Holder will also be participating in meetings in Paris with international counterparts about stopping terror attacks. Holder will also be the featured guest on five major Sunday morning news programs, except for Fox News Sunday.\n\nPresident Obama is focused on his domestic agenda, and is preparing to continue a nationwide tour this week to preview his upcoming State of the Union address, which will be delivered to Congress the following week. It is possible that Obama has plans to attend the rally but has not announced them for security reasons. Typically, Obama plays golf on Sunday afternoons, declining to continue a personal golf moratorium that George W. Bush initiated in deference to the fact that U.S. troops are at war abroad. There are also two important NFL playoff games on television on Sunday.\n\nUpdate: AFP's live feed from the rally shows heads of state and foreign dignitaries marching through Paris.\n\nUpdate: Pressed by ABC News' George Stephanopoulos Sunday morning to answer whether the U.S. is at war with \"radical Islam,\" Holder again declined. \"I would say that we are at war with terrorists who commit these heinous acts and who use Islam. They use a corrupted version of Islam to justify their actions,\" he said on This Week with George Stephanopoulos.",
    " Title: \"David Limbaugh's Column: The Left's Inconsistent Response to the Pandemic\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a column published by \u2588\u2588\u2588.com, conservative writer, author, and attorney David Limbaugh criticizes the left's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, arguing that their positions are incoherent and morally repugnant. Limbaugh claims that while national Democratic leaders, left-wing media, and never-Trumpers have been more interested in criticizing President Donald Trump than addressing the pandemic, they have also been inconsistent in their positions on the virus.\n\nLimbaugh asserts that from the beginning, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, along with their medical team, have been conducting daily press briefings to inform the public about the virus and the government's efforts to slow its spread. However, the media has used these briefings to criticize Trump rather than to inform the public, according to Limbaugh.\n\nThe columnist cites an example of this criticism, referring to a question posed by Olivia Nuzzi of New York Magazine during a press briefing, asking Trump if he deserved to be reelected if more Americans died from the virus than in the entirety of the Vietnam War. Limbaugh also criticizes the media for excoriating Trump for every imaginable sin and every death, while exempting Democratic governors from any accountability for high case and death rates in their states.\n\nLimbaugh also criticizes Democratic leaders, including putative presidential nominee Joe Biden, for their one-dimensional thinking and lack of compassion for those financially devastated by the pandemic. He points to Biden's tweet, in which he stated that \"no one is expendable\" and \"no life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow,\" as an example of this one-dimensional thinking. Limbaugh argues that Biden's statement is a cheap shot at Trump and those who are trying to facilitate the reopening of the economy.\n\nLimbaugh also criticizes the Lincoln Project, a never-Trump group, for producing an ad that blames Trump for both the deaths caused by the virus and the economic devastation it has caused. Limbaugh argues that the Lincoln Project has absorbed the ideas and tactics of their progressive counterparts, including virtue signaling, the shameless advocacy of mutually contradictory positions, and consuming hatred for Donald J. Trump.\n\nLimbaugh concludes by stating that it is time for state governments to show faith in the American people and respect their prerogative to return to their lives while exercising responsible behavior to protect themselves and their neighbors. Limbaugh's latest book is \"Guilty by Reason of Insanity: Why the Democrats Must Not Win.\"",
    " Title: The Collapse of State- and Corporate-Sponsored Confederate Nostalgia: A Shift in Political Reaction to the Symbol of the Confederate Flag\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent removal of the Confederate flag from various statehouses and corporate entities marks a significant shift in the political reaction to the symbol of the Confederate flag. This change, which has been largely driven by generational replacement and increased political polarization, was not a predictable outcome based on past attempts to remove the flag from statehouses.\n\nThe Confederate flag has been a contentious symbol for many years, but it has not been a central topic of political discourse in the same way as issues such as Stand-your-ground laws, gun control, sentencing reform, and police brutality. The persistence of the flag in statehouses, despite numerous attempts to remove it, was thought to be a sign that the flag was not going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nOne reason for the current shift is the generational replacement of those who have a personal connection to the Civil War. The last Civil War general died in the 1930s, and the last witness to Abraham Lincoln's assassination died in the mid-1950s. As a result, the Confederacy is increasingly being relegated to history, even if its sympathizers persist. The youngest people who fought for Jim Crow as adults are now in their mid-70s, if they are still alive at all.\n\nAnother important factor in the removal of the flag is increased political polarization. In the South, the political parties have their roots in various groups, including \"Mountain Republicans,\" middle-class suburbanites, and former Democrats from the conservative, establishment factions. Lower-income, populist whites were swing voters who often voted Republican at the presidential level but formed coalitions with minority voters and urban liberals at the state level, keeping most Southern state legislatures in Democratic hands into the 2000s.\n\nWith the South becoming increasingly polarized, rural whites have begun voting Republican from the top of the ticket to the bottom. Democrats have either written off the region or looked to form coalitions of minorities, urban liberals, and suburbanites rather than of minorities, urban liberals, and poor whites. Because Democrats no longer see any electoral payoff in talking to people with Confederate flags in the back of their pickup trucks, they no longer have any incentive to make even weak gestures toward keeping the flag around.\n\nAt the same time, it is important to realize that most prominent Southern Republican politicians have roots in either the suburban or old establishment Democrat wings of the party. With rural whites now largely polarized into the Republican column, Southern Republicans no longer have to go hard after their votes. If anything, they need to watch their flanks in the suburbs and in the business wing of the party, and so it is now more natural for them to move against the flag.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent removal of the Confederate flag from various statehouses and corporate entities marks a significant shift in the political reaction to the symbol of the Confederate flag. This shift is largely driven by generational replacement and increased political polarization, which has made it less politically advantageous for either party to maintain the flag's presence in public spaces.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton to Highlight Depression-Era Upbringing in First Major Campaign Rally\n\nArticle:\n\nIn her first major rally of the 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton will focus on the formative influence of her mother, Dorothy Rodham, rather than her family's political legacy. The event, taking place on Saturday at Roosevelt Island in New York, is intended to provide Clinton with an opportunity to present a more comprehensive rationale for her candidacy and address criticisms that her campaign has not clearly articulated her reasons for seeking the presidency.\n\nClinton's aides have stated that she will draw on lessons learned from her mother, who was abandoned by her parents as a child and had to raise herself. By emphasizing her Rodham roots, Clinton aims to demonstrate that her personal history, rather than the Clinton political dynasty, is the driving force behind her career of advocating for children and families.\n\nJennifer Palmieri, the campaign's communications director, commented, \"She is a well-known figure, but when you're asking the American people to support you as president, even if it is for the second time, there is no skipping of steps. If you want to understand Hillary Clinton, and what has motivated her career of fighting for kids and families, her mother is a big part of the story.\"\n\nThe rally, steeped in symbolism of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, offers Clinton a platform to reset her candidacy and present a more expansive argument for her qualifications as a presidential candidate. The event follows a private dinner Clinton attended last week at the home of Sen. Dianne Feinstein in Washington, where several other Democratic women senators gathered for an intimate discussion about her campaign.",
    " Title: Michael Bloomberg's Controversial Presence in Selma's Civil Rights Commemoration\n\nArticle:\n\nMichael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and current Democratic presidential candidate, found himself in a contentious situation during the 55th anniversary of the 1965 civil rights march in Selma, Alabama, known as \"Bloody Sunday.\" Initially, Bloomberg declined an invitation to participate in the event, citing campaign commitments. However, he later changed his mind and attended the historic service at Brown Chapel and crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge with Rep. John Lewis.\n\nBloomberg's decision to attend the event was met with some resistance, particularly during his speech, when a dozen churchgoers in a center pew stood and turned their backs to him until he finished. Ryan P. Haygood, a former NAACP lawyer who directs the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, stated, \"Given what this sacred space means, I kept waiting for him to lean into it, to talk about what he presided over as mayor. When it became clear he wasn't going to atone, we decided to do something.\"\n\nThe silent protest against Bloomberg, led by Haygood and others, was a response to the former mayor's legacy of stop-and-frisk policing during his tenure in New York City. The protest, if it had continued, would have overshadowed the other candidates in attendance, including Pete Buttigieg, who suspended his campaign hours later.\n\nIn contrast to Bloomberg, former Vice President Joe Biden assumed a prominent position behind the altar during the service. Bloomberg's campaign had already spent an unprecedented amount of money in Alabama, aiming for the state's 52 pledged delegates. Despite this, he had managed to maintain a low profile, with a main office facing a statue of Rosa Parks and no significant local attention to his mayoral legacy.\n\nThe Alabama Democratic Council, the state Democratic Party's black caucus, endorsed Bloomberg last month. However, the endorsement and others like it may not significantly impact Biden's large advantage with black voters in Southern states. Some attendees, like Pam Foster, a Tuscaloosa Medical School professor, criticized the endorsement, stating, \"Reed and the ADC endorsed Bloomberg because he bought off a lot of people. [They want us] to forget that in New York, he ignored the African American community. I voted my conscience and voted Biden.\"\n\nNotably absent from the event was Bernie Sanders, the only candidate with an arrest record related to civil rights protest. Sanders has attended multiple civil rights events in Alabama over the years but has not opened an office or hired staff in Montgomery. In the 2016 Alabama primary, Sanders lost to Hillary Clinton by nearly 78 percent of the vote, reflecting a pattern of poor performance in Deep South communities. The reasons for Sanders' rejection by these communities are complex and not easily explained.\n\nHowever, there are enthusiastic black Sanders supporters in Alabama, albeit fewer in number as one moves away from university campuses. The Sanders campaign has always conceded the primary and never opened an office or hired a single staffer in Montgomery.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Consider Case on Passport Designation for Jerusalem-Born U.S. Citizens\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on Monday in a case that combines Middle East policy with the shared foreign policy roles of the president and Congress. The case, which revolves around the birthplace designation on U.S. passports for American citizens born in Jerusalem, will provide insight into the justices' thinking on the matter.\n\nThe U.S. has historically maintained that no country has sovereignty over Jerusalem until its status is negotiated in a Middle East peace deal. However, Israel's supporters in Congress have attempted to enforce a different policy, passing legislation that would move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and require the State Department to allow U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem to list Israel as their place of birth on their passports.\n\nThe Bush and Obama administrations both refused to comply with this mandate, contending that it unconstitutionally infringes on the president's foreign policy powers. The case in question, initially brought by Menachem Zivotofsky, born in Jerusalem 12 years ago to American parents who emigrated to Israel and now maintain dual citizenship, seeks to force the State Department to allow the Zivotofskys to list Israel as their son's place of birth on his passport.\n\nIn 2011, when the case first went to the Supreme Court, the justices did not issue a definitive ruling, instead opting to send the case back to the lower court for further action. Now, the case is back, and a look back at the 2011 argument offers some clues about the justices' thinking.\n\nDuring the 2011 argument, Nathan Lewin, the Zivotofskys' lawyer, argued that under the Constitution, foreign policy is a power shared by the president and Congress, but that Congress has the final say once it passes a statute, as it did in this case. However, Lewin faced a barrage of skeptical questions from the justices.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked, \"You say foreign relations is a shared power. So, if it is a shared power, why does Congress trump the executive?\" Justice Anthony Kennedy called Lewin's view a \"narrow and crabbed interpretation of the president's foreign affairs power.\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated, \"It seems to me you're not arguing for a co-equal congressional power, you're arguing for a superior congressional power. You're saying whatever Congress says, the president has to comply with.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts noted that listing Israel as the place of birth for someone born in Jerusalem could, according to the president, present serious foreign policy problems. However, Lewin rejected that premise. \"Congress has decided that saying Israel alone does not present a foreign policy issue,\" he said.\n\nRoberts countered, \"An American citizen born in Northern Ireland doesn't have this option just because he thinks that's part of Ireland.\" Arguing for the president's exclusive authority in this area, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli told the justices that Congress cannot supersede the president's power.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer questioned that proposition, declaring, \"There are very few cases I can ever think of where the court has said the president can act contrary to a statute.\" Verrilli replied that, as far back as President Washington, this has been one of those areas of presidential authority. The court, he argued, should give great deference to the president's judgment on a matter with such serious foreign policy implications. A passport, he observed, is not a communication by the passport holder; it's an official document communicating the position of the United States.\n\nPressed by Justice Elena Kagan, Verrilli said the source for the president's power is the provision of the Constitution giving the chief executive the power to receive and recognize foreign diplomats, a power used since the founding to recognize foreign governments. Justice Scalia did not think much of that provision as authority to rest a case on, musing, \"I mean, if you've got to cast about for something, I suppose, I do not know what else you'd land upon.\" It is there, Scalia acknowledges, \"but it does not say a whole lot.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in this case will provide insight into the balance of power between the president and Congress regarding foreign policy and the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. The justices' ruling will also have implications for the millions of American citizens born in Jerusalem.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders' Revolution: A Look at the Future of the Political Movement\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Senator Bernie Sanders prepares to return to his role in the United States Senate, his political revolution, as enshrined in the organization Our Revolution, is set to continue. The first step in this process came Wednesday night, with over 2,600 house parties across the country where Sanders' supporters gathered to watch his call to action via live-stream.\n\nSanders emphasized that real change does not come from the top but from the grassroots, urging supporters to elect like-minded candidates to office and to hold the Democratic Party accountable for implementing the most progressive party platform in history. During the Democratic primaries, Sanders won over 12 million votes and held hundreds of enthusiastic rallies.\n\nHowever, Our Revolution, a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, has faced organizational challenges. Sanders, as an elected official, is barred from playing a role in running the group due to its tax status, which allows for the acceptance of undisclosed and unlimited \"dark money.\" This has been a point of contention for some within the small staff of Our Revolution, who resigned over the weekend due to Sanders' decision to bring in his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, as president.\n\nDespite these organizational challenges, Sanders supporters remain hopeful. A group of 30 supporters gathered in a row house in Washington's Mount Pleasant neighborhood Wednesday night, expressing their continued support for Sanders and his agenda. They emphasized the importance of electing progressive candidates at all levels, from school boards to the US Senate, and implementing ballot measures in the states.\n\nMany of the attendees, such as Michael Pattis, a student at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, working in Washington for the summer, and Maggie Ellinger-Locke, a lawyer in Arlington, Virginia, expressed excitement about the \"down ticket\" races in November and the potential for implementing Sanders' agenda. Both Pattis and Ellinger-Locke indicated their preparedness to vote for Hillary Clinton in November, like most of those interviewed at the gathering.\n\nThe future of Our Revolution remains uncertain, and the precedent for such groups is not promising. However, some Sanders supporters have already made gains in local politics, such as Jane Kleeb, who recently won an upset victory in the race for chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party. Kleeb, an activist who originally opposed the Keystone XL pipeline, has set her sights on remaking a party that has failed for many cycles to win statewide office in deep red Nebraska.\n\n\"Our state party, for so many years, has not been progressive, and that has deflated the base,\" Kleeb said. \"Candidates somehow think they have to be more conservative to win. I'm a progressive Democrat, and I was able to bring this coalition of conservative folks together to defeat the pipeline.\"\n\n\"It's because they knew where I stood,\" she said. \"I was honest about that.\"",
    " Title: Majority of Americans Believe Mueller Investigation Was Politically Motivated, According to CBS News Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent CBS News poll, conducted between March 25 and March 26, has revealed that a majority of Americans now believe the special counsel's investigation into potential collusion between President Donald Trump and the Russian government was politically motivated. The poll found that 54% of respondents believe the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller was politically motivated, compared to 37% who believe it was justified.\n\nThe poll, which was previously conducted in January, showed a significant shift in public opinion, with 50% of respondents believing the investigation was justified at that time, and 45% saying it was politically motivated.\n\nInterestingly, the poll findings regarding the investigation's motivation were not the main focus of CBS's report on the poll. The headline used by the outlet was \"Mueller report: Majorities across party lines want full report released,\" and the article primarily focused on five different findings in the poll, with no separate mention of the investigation's motivation.\n\nThe poll also found that 34% of respondents feel the Mueller report, which found no collusion and not enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction, has cleared Trump, compared to 23% who think it hasn't cleared him. Another 36% think it's too soon to say whether the report cleared the president.\n\nPartisan differences were also evident in the poll. The CBS poll found that 66% of Democrats want members of their party in Congress to continue investigating the matter, while 50% of Democrats were \"disappointed\" in Mueller's findings. In contrast, 69% of Republicans were \"pleased\" with the findings.\n\nRegarding the investigation's fairness, 44% of respondents thought it was conducted fairly, while 10% thought it was conducted unfairly. Forty percent said it was too soon to say.\n\nCBS sent out four separate tweets about the poll on Wednesday, but the poll's findings regarding the investigation's motivation were not included in any of the tweets. The outlet's poll Twitter account did not include the chart about people thinking the investigation was politically motivated, but it did include all the other points brought up in the article. CBS's main Twitter account also made no mention of what poll respondents thought of the motivation behind the Mueller investigation.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Three Major Causes of Shorter Life Expectancy for Americans Compared to Peers in High-Income Countries\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association has shed light on the reasons behind the shorter life expectancy of Americans compared to their peers in high-income countries. The study, which analyzed data from 2012, found that three major causes of injury deaths - guns, drugs, and cars - account for a significant portion of the life expectancy gap.\n\nThe study compared the rates of these causes of injury death in the US with those in other high-income countries, including the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Japan, and eight others. The results showed that, on average, men and women in the other high-income countries can expect to live about 2.2 years longer than men and women in the US.\n\nAmong men, gun deaths accounted for 21% of the gap, drug overdoses accounted for 14%, and car crashes accounted for 13%. Among women, gun deaths accounted for 4%, drug overdoses accounted for 9%, and car crashes accounted for 6%.\n\nThe death rate for guns, drugs, and cars was much higher in the US than its developed peers, as this chart shows:\n\n![Life Expectancy Gap Chart](https://example.com/life-expectancy-gap-chart)\n\nThe study's authors, Andrew Fenelon, Li-Hui Chen, and Susan Baker, wrote that \"a substantial portion of this gap reflects just three causes of injury.\" They attributed the high rates of these causes to cultural factors and bad policy.\n\nWith guns, the research shows that America's unusually high levels of gun ownership lead to more gun violence. Other factors, such as socioeconomic issues, contribute to violence, but guns are the one issue that makes America unique relative to other developed countries in comparable socioeconomic circumstances.\n\nWith drugs, America is currently in the midst of a harrowing opioid and heroin epidemic that is killing tens of thousands of people each year. Academic analyses of the crisis have concluded that the US was too slow to respond to misleading advertising campaigns from opioid producers, in which they claimed that their drugs were safe and effective. Americans have suffered the consequences, getting addicted to and dying from opioid painkillers and heroin as pharmaceutical companies have massively profited.\n\nWith cars, by the 1960s, European policies began encouraging walking, cycling, and public transportation. The US, meanwhile, continued to encourage sprawl and driving. The result: Americans drive much more than their European peers, and are more likely to die in crashes as a result.\n\nEven with perfect policies, Americans' cultural preference for guns, drugs, and cars may remain strong for some time. However, better policies could push the US in the right direction and save lives.",
    " Title: Bill Clinton Warns Against Nationalism and Divisive Politics in Brookings Institute Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer U.S. President Bill Clinton delivered a keynote speech at the Brookings Institute, cautioning against a \"nation-state psychology\" that he believes will further divide the world. Clinton's comments, reported by Politico, come in the context of the rise of nationalist populism, though he did not explicitly mention the current U.S. administration or its key advisors.\n\nClinton argued that those advocating for the nation-state are, in fact, promoting a pan-national movement that institutionalizes separatism and division within borders worldwide. He attributed this phenomenon to an identity crisis resulting from the rapid pace of economic and social changes.\n\nThough not directly addressing the Trump administration, Clinton's comments can be interpreted as a rebuke of the Trump-ian form of nationalist populism, characterized by Trump's \"America First\" policy and the domestic interests-centric approach. Steve Bannon, Trump's chief counselor, has referred to himself as an \"economic nationalist,\" and, as the head of Breitbart, has stoked resentment towards immigrants and racial and religious minorities in the United States.\n\nSince Hillary Clinton's defeat in the November election, the Clinton family has emerged as vocal critics of the Trump administration. Daughter Chelsea Clinton has tweeted negatively about the administration, and Hillary Clinton has given several speeches since the election.\n\nIn his speech, Bill Clinton also drew parallels between the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 and the need for personal decency and trust in politics. Rabin, who embraced the Israeli-Palestinian peace process during his terms as Prime Minister, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994.\n\nClinton emphasized the importance of finding a way to bring personal decency and trust back to politics, stating, \"We have to find a way to bring simple, personal decency and trust back to our politics.\" He also highlighted the historical nature of the us-versus-them mentality, tracing it back to the early days of human civilization.\n\nClinton concluded his speech by advocating for negotiation and compromise, citing Rabin's model as a guide for resolving challenges in a way that promotes progress rather than leading to destruction. \"If you got that,\" Clinton said, \"the challenges we face can be resolved in a way to keep us going forward, instead of taking us to the edge of our destruction.\"",
    " Title: Big Tech Echoes Orwell's Big Brother: Censorship and Conformity in the Digital Age\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 1984, the year depicted in George Orwell's classic novel, one company, Microsoft, dominated the computer world. This historical moment was encapsulated in one of the most famous commercials in TV history, titled \"1984.\" The ad portrayed a dystopian future where a powerful leader, Big Brother, controlled the masses. Apple, with its groundbreaking product, the Macintosh computer, was presented as the device that would set people free.\n\nFast forward to today, and it appears we are experiencing a resurgence of Orwell's Big Brother, albeit with an important twist. Apple, Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, the giants of social media, are demanding conformity to their values. This reality is not depicted in an advertisement but in real-life events.\n\nA recent example is the presentation by Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, before a civil rights group, where he stated, \"We have one message for those who seek to push hate, division, and violence: You have no place on our platforms. You have no home here.\"\n\nThe implication is clear: these tech companies are becoming the Big Brother Orwell foresaw. Disagree with their values, and they will shut you down. This censorship is not limited to political ideologies; it extends to moral and social beliefs as well.\n\nMeghan Murphy, a Canadian feminist, was permanently banned from Twitter for refusing to refer to the transgendered by their preferred pronoun and for stating \"women are not men.\" Google, Facebook, and Twitter have also refused to carry political ads from Tennessee Republican candidate Marsha Blackburn, promoting her conservative views.\n\nMoreover, YouTube continues to restrict over 100 videos from PragerU, a conservative educational organization, finding them \"inappropriate for children.\" Titles such as \"Why Did America Fight the Korean War?\" are among those restricted.\n\nBroad-based studies by the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology and Northwestern University have confirmed what these examples suggest: bias against conservatives at Google and other Big Tech sites.\n\nThis bias, often referred to as \"shadow banning,\" may be even more pernicious. If you are on the left, you may be okay with this. But if you are not on the left, or even if you are and you revere the First Amendment, you should be concerned. We are advancing swiftly toward an Orwellian, 1984 world of stifling, one-way-of-thinking conformity. This time, it's not a fictional story; it's real.\n\nThe solution, according to many, is to return to the open market of ideas that served Big Tech so well for so long. Stop the censorship and let people make up their own minds. Otherwise, America, and the rest of what has been known as the Free World, will cease to be free.\n\nI'm Brent Bozell, founder of the Media Research Center.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates Devote Less Than 10 Minutes to Climate Crisis in Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the first Democratic presidential debate of the 2020 election cycle, less than 10 minutes were devoted to discussing the climate crisis, a matter that could potentially render large portions of the planet uninhabitable by the end of the century. The debate, which was marred by technical difficulties from NBC, lasted nearly an hour and a half.\n\nKate Aronoff, a writing fellow at In These Times who covers elections and the politics of climate change, criticized the limited time dedicated to the climate crisis. Aronoff, along with members of the Sunrise Movement, is pushing for a debate dedicated solely to the potential end of human civilization.\n\nThe debate's focus on the climate crisis was not only shorter than the time spent on the issue during the entirety of the 2016 debates, but it also pales in comparison to the urgency and gravity of the situation.\n\nThe debate, which took place on Wednesday, featured a total of 20 candidates, each of whom had the opportunity to address various issues. Among the candidates, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Juli\u00e1n Castro, and Beto O'Rourke were some of the most prominent figures.\n\nElizabeth Warren, who set a populist tone during the debate, argued that the American economy is great for those with money but not for everyone else. Warren also framed herself as a fighter who would go after big corporations, buttressing her positions with passion.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro, who was polling at just 1% before the debate, had a significant impact on the discourse. He demonstrated compassion and concern on racial justice issues, deep knowledge of immigration law, and a fighting spirit as he called attention to policy differences between him and others, especially fellow Texan Beto O'Rourke.\n\nCory Booker, who won Wednesday's debate, spent close to 11 minutes on stage and presented a progressive but not extreme image. Booker refused to buy into Medicare for All and acknowledged the \"need to check corporate consolidation\" without sounding like an anti-business crusade.\n\nBeto O'Rourke, who was the subject of criticism from Castro over immigration reform, was also a prominent figure in the debate.\n\nThe debate's focus on the climate crisis was a topic of concern for many, including climate activists who believe that the issue deserves more attention and time in the discourse. Aronoff, a climate activist, expressed her disappointment in the debate, stating that \"climate change is an existential threat and the future of my generation, and our entire civilization is at stake.\"\n\nThe debate's lack of focus on the climate crisis has sparked criticism from climate activists and those who believe that the issue deserves more attention and time in the discourse. The Sunrise Movement, a youth-led movement to stop climate change, is currently sitting in at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington DC, pushing the DNC to organize a debate dedicated solely to the potential end of human civilization.

    " Title: Supreme Court Declines ExxonMobil's Appeal in Massachusetts Climate Change Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from ExxonMobil regarding Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey's climate change investigation on Monday. Legal experts described the decision as a \"crushing blow\" to the oil giant.\n\nAfter the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled last April that the company must turn over documents requested by Healey, Exxon asked the Supreme Court to intervene, arguing Healey lacked jurisdiction to even bring the investigation.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision means Exxon is now out of options and out of time in its fight to keep these documents from public light, according to Carroll Muffett, president and chief executive of the Center for International Environmental Law.\n\nExxon is facing multiple climate lawsuits around the country. In the case of Massachusetts, like New York, the attorney general is investigating what Exxon knew about climate change and the effects of burning fossil fuels\u2014and whether it lied to the public and its investors about the risks.\n\nReports published in 2015 by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times revealed that the company was aware of the risks of burning fossil fuels as early as the 1970s, and yet continued to mislead investors.\n\n\"Courts have repeatedly rejected Exxon's attempts to stop the state attorneys general in New York and Massachusetts from investigating the company's historic knowledge about climate change and what it did with that information,\" Michael Burger, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nThe denial of Exxon's petition means Healey can proceed with her investigation, and that Exxon must respond to the attorney general's civil investigation demands\u2014the subpoena-like request for documents, including transcripts of investor calls, internal scientific research, copies of public relations or media communication plans, and communication with organizations that have a history of promoting climate science denial.\n\n\"These internal documents\u2014describing what the company knew and when it knew it\u2014are critical to any fraud case that may result,\" Sharon Eubanks, a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney who prosecuted and won the massive racketeering case against Big Tobacco, said. \"Without a doubt, ExxonMobil will bring further objections, but the [Court's] denial... is a crushing blow.\"\n\nHowever, Eubanks, who now works for the firm Bordas & Bordas, added that the Supreme Court's denial of Exxon's request does not set a precedent; it doesn't give an indication as to where different justices sit on the issue, it simply allows the investigation to proceed.\n\nThe mere fact that the investigation can move forward \"is a tremendous success,\" Alyssa Johl, legal counsel for the Center for Climate Integrity, said. \"Where it goes from here is to be determined\u2014it depends on what they [Exxon] disclose.\"\n\nLegal experts told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the Supreme Court's decision has wider implications beyond this particular case. In its efforts to fight the Massachusetts investigation, Exxon argued to the Supreme Court that it's an issue of jurisdiction. The company, which is headquartered in Texas, said that because it does not directly sell gasoline in Massachusetts, the attorney general does not have jurisdiction to investigate.\n\nIn essence, Exxon tried to argue that its service stations across the state are franchises, and not part of the company itself. And it was this argument that the Massachusetts court rejected earlier in 2018.\n\nTherefore, the Supreme Court's decision is \"basically affirming, for now, the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that the AG has jurisdiction over ExxonMobil,\" explained Eubanks.\n\nUpholding this decision not only means the case can proceed but hints that other states might be able to look to Massachusetts for inspiration down the road.\n\n\"The Massachusetts investigation poses an even bigger risk for the company because the pool of Exxon's potential victims includes not only the seven million citizens and consumers in Massachusetts but untold tens of millions more living in states with nearly identical consumer protection laws,\" Muffett said.\n\nStates with similar consumer protection laws to Massachusetts\u2014ones that are based on the Federal Trade Commission Act\u2014include California, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Ohio, Vermont, and Washington. There are additional states with laws modeled on the Unfair and Deceptive Trade Acts legislation but whose provisions share similar strengths to Massachusetts' law, Muffett explained, such as Illinois and New Jersey, as well as Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd as the Massachusetts attorney general's office lays out online, the impact of Exxon's action on consumers is at the heart of its investigation: \"Specifically, the investigation seeks information regarding whether Exxon may have misled consumers and/or investors with respect to the impact of fossil fuels on climate change, and climate change-driven risks to Exxon's business.\"\n\nWhile each state is unique, many states do often draw on Massachusetts' extensive body of jurisprudence interpreting its consumer protection laws. This makes for \"another aspect of the Massachusetts case that should be of serious concern for Exxon and its investors,\" Muffett said. \"Since the court was interpreting Exxon's standard franchise agreement, it's very likely that its reasoning would be persuasive if Exxon tries the same defense in any other state where that same standard agreement is in use.\"\n\n\"This is another reason,\" he said, \"why I think the significance of the Massachusetts AG's investigation has been grossly underestimated.\"",
    " Title: New Hampshire Primary Results Show Rejection of Political Establishment\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the New Hampshire Republican primary on Tuesday, Donald Trump emerged victorious with 34 percent of the vote, edging out John Kasich's 16 percent. Trump's slogan, \"Make America Great Again,\" resonated strongly with voters, demonstrating a significant support base.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton by 20 percentage points. Sanders' platform, which includes railing against the rigged economy, pledging to provide universal healthcare, and offering free college tuition, attracted a larger coalition of young voters than the one Barack Obama built in 2008.\n\nThe results of the primary elections suggest a rejection of the political establishment, as both Trump and Sanders have tapped into a sense of marginalization, disenfranchisement, and betrayal felt by a majority of Americans. This sentiment is shared by the 42 percent of Americans who identify as independent, feeling that the two major parties do not represent their values and positions.\n\nIn the Republican race, 46 percent of GOP voters reported feeling betrayed by their party's politicians. Trump won 32 percent of this group. Similarly, Sanders, who began the race upwards of 50 points behind Clinton, has garnered support from voters seeking an honest and trustworthy politician, despite his socialist ideology.\n\nTrust in American institutions has collapsed, with less than 20 percent of Americans trusting the government always or most of the time, according to a recent Pew survey. A CNN poll also showed that 60 percent of Americans believe the American Dream is unachievable today. Against this backdrop, it is no surprise that America is in revolt, with honesty and trustworthiness mattering more to voters than a candidate's experience or their ability to win in November.\n\nThe primary elections have shown a clear rejection of business as usual, and the path to the nomination for both Trump and Sanders is now more apparent. However, the full impact of this anti-establishment sentiment on the general election remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Fox Business Debate in Charleston: Candidates Prepare for a Fierce Battle\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Fox Business debate in Charleston, South Carolina, is not advertised as a boxing match, but it may resemble one by the end of the event on Thursday evening. The debate will likely see candidates exchanging sharp questions and responses, with the only uncertainty being the extent of the confrontations.\n\nMarco Rubio, Chris Christie, and Jeb Bush are expected to engage in a series of attacks, as each of them aims to establish themselves as the alternative to Donald Trump and Ted Cruz within the establishment. A poor showing in the upcoming Iowa and New Hampshire primaries could significantly impact their campaigns, and they have been ramping up their rhetoric and releasing harsh attack ads in preparation for the debate.\n\nTed Cruz, who previously sparred with Rubio over immigration and surveillance, will also participate in the debate. While Cruz has begun to question Trump's values, it is more likely that he will focus his attacks on Rubio and the other candidates.\n\nDonald Trump, historically, has been more reserved and focused on counterpunching. However, with recent polls showing him either slightly ahead of Cruz or running neck and neck, Trump may make references to his Canadian birth.\n\nThe middle-tier candidates have a significant stake in the debate, as they aim for a strong finish in the New Hampshire primary. The last Fox Business debate was relatively civil due to the backlash against the CNBC debate's perceived condescending and opinionated questions. However, the 2016 race is in a different phase, and these debates have become crucial winnowing events.\n\nRand Paul has publicly denounced his exclusion from the main stage and has announced that he will not attend the undercard debate. Mike Huckabee and Carly Fiorina, who were previously in prime-time debates, will participate in the early-evening faceoff in South Carolina. Christie moved from the undercard to the main stage, while Rand Paul has chosen to boycott the 6 p.m. debate. Time is running out for the candidates to make their mark.\n\nThe debates have a significant impact on the media coverage and public perception, with key sound bites being repeatedly replayed and pundits analyzing the winners and losers. Good debaters such as Rubio, Cruz, and Christie have benefited from this coverage, while poor performances have hurt candidates like Bush.\n\nThe upcoming debates in Charleston and Des Moines later this month are crucial, as some candidates could emerge bruised or worse. The debates serve as a final opportunity for candidates to make their case to voters before the primary elections.",
    " Title: NFL Teams Show Solidarity with Protesting Players, Defy Trump's Call for Disciplinary Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a show of solidarity with protesting players, NFL teams across the United States and in London staged various demonstrations during the U.S. national anthem before Sunday's games. This move was in response to President Donald Trump's call for owners to fire players who refuse to stand during the anthem.\n\nThe demonstrations, initiated last season by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, are intended to call attention to what the protesting players see as a pattern of racism in the treatment of African-Americans by U.S. police.\n\nIn Detroit, several members of the Lions knelt while singer Rico Lavelle dropped to one knee and pumped a fist in the air at the end of his performance of the \"Star-Spangled Banner.\" In Philadelphia, city police officers joined with Eagles and New York Giants players and Eagles team owner Jeffrey Lurie to link arms during the anthem in a sign of solidarity.\n\nWhile some Americans are sympathetic to the protesters, others see the refusal to stand as a sign of disrespect for the flag and for members of the military who have sacrificed or died in defending the country.\n\nTrump rekindled the controversy on Friday at an Alabama political rally, suggesting any protesting player was a \"son of a bitch\" and urging owners to dismiss them on the spot, reprising his reality-show catch phrase: \"You're fired.\"\n\nThe theme could play well with Trump's conservative base at a time when the Republican president is grappling with North Korea's nuclear threats, an investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and a healthcare struggle in Congress.\n\nHowever, Trump's stance appeared to galvanize players, teams, and the league to assert what they see as a right to express their political convictions freely. It also highlighted the deep political rift that Trump's election has exposed across many segments of American society.\n\nNew England Patriots Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Kraft, who has dined with Trump and whom the president considers a friend, criticized Trump on Sunday and defended players' right to protest.\n\n\"I am deeply disappointed by the tone of the comments made by the president on Friday,\" Kraft said in a statement. He said players had a \"right to peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner they feel is most impactful.\"\n\nDespite a strong rebuke of his remarks by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and the players' union on Saturday, the president did not back down on Sunday, calling on fans to boycott the league if it would not discipline protesting players.\n\n\"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Fire or suspend!\"\n\nIn another tweet, Trump, who spent the weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, said that the \"league should back\" fans who are upset about the protests.\n\nIn Chicago, Trump's feud was the main topic of conversation at the South Loop Club sports bar.\n\n\"This is a First Amendment issue and the president is supposed to uphold that right,\" said Sam Cunningham, 55, who was watching the Pittsburgh-Chicago game with his wife. \"He should know better than anyone that to fire someone because of their opinion is not right.\"\n\nOne patron at a sports bar in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Trump supporter Tim Kull, 67, said: \"Do it on your time, not when you are wearing that uniform.\"\n\nIn Foxboro, Massachusetts, more than a dozen players and coaches on the Super Bowl champion Patriots knelt or linked arms, including quarterback Tom Brady, whom Trump name-dropped as a friend on the campaign trail. Brady placed one hand on his chest and used the other to link arms with his teammates.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan linked arms with team players in solidarity at the game against the Baltimore Ravens in London's Wembley Stadium. Khan donated $1 million to the Trump inauguration fund.\n\nRobert McNair, chairman of the Houston Texans, said Trump's comments were \"divisive and counterproductive to what our country needs right now.\" McNair also donated $1 million to Trump.\n\nOther teams decided to stay off the field during the anthem. Before the Seattle Seahawks game against the Tennessee Titans in Nashville, neither team came out until after the pre-game ceremony.\n\nExcept for a single player, the Pittsburgh Steelers remained off the field in Chicago before their game against the Bears to avoid \"playing politics,\" head coach Mike Tomlin said. The team was roundly booed by the home crowd when it finally emerged.\n\nThe demonstrations along the sidelines ahead of Sunday's early game triggered a fresh round of tweets by the president.\n\n\"Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!\" he wrote.\n\nNational Basketball Association players also struck back against comments by the president on Saturday after Trump clashed with one of the biggest stars in the league, Stephen Curry.\n\nThen on Saturday evening, Oakland A's rookie Bruce Maxwell became the first Major League Baseball player to kneel for the national anthem in protest.\n\nIn a Twitter message, Trump rescinded a White House invitation to Curry, who had said he would \"vote\" against the planned visit by the NBA champion Golden State Warriors.\n\nCurry told a news conference in Oakland, California: \"It's beneath the leader of a country to go that route.\"\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday, Trump said the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team, which won the Stanley Cup, accepted his invitation to the White House. \"Great team!\" he wrote.",
    " Title: Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney Clarifies Remarks on Ukraine Aid and Quid Pro Quo\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a clarification of his earlier remarks, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney stated on Thursday that there was \"absolutely no quid pro quo\" between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election. This statement comes after critics accused Mulvaney of admitting to a quid pro quo in his initial comments to the press.\n\nDuring a press conference, Mulvaney responded to a question about the administration's decision to withhold aid from Ukraine. He stated that President Trump had expressed concerns about Ukraine's corruption, and that the administration had withheld aid to prevent it from being wasted or used for personal gain.\n\nMulvaney also mentioned that the administration had conducted an analysis of other countries' support for Ukraine and found that European countries were not providing significant lethal aid. He also stated that the president was dissatisfied with this lack of support.\n\nWhen a reporter suggested that Mulvaney's comments sounded like a quid pro quo, he replied, \"We do that all the time.\" He cited the administration's withholding of aid to the Northern Triangle countries to change their policies on immigration as an example.\n\nMulvaney concluded by stating, \"Elections have consequences, and foreign policy is going to change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration.\" He emphasized that political influence in foreign policy is common and expected.",
    " Title: Federal Judiciary Faces Funding Crisis as Shutdown Drains Court Resources\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States federal judiciary is facing a funding crisis as a result of the ongoing government shutdown and years of budget austerity measures. The judiciary's budget, already reduced by sequestration, is now running on limited resources that are expected to run out by the end of this week.\n\nIn a blog post last week, Senior U.S. District Judge Richard Kopf, a George H.W. Bush appointee, urged his fellow judges to designate all their staff as essential and exempt from furlough. He suggested that such an order would lead to an inter-branch dispute, potentially escalating the situation between Congress and the judiciary.\n\nJudges have been critical of the budgetary constraints imposed by Congress, with some federal courts already shedding nearly 2,700 support staff positions over the past two years. Funding for drug testing and electronic monitoring of pre-trial detainees has also been slashed by 20 percent. Federal defenders have been ordered to take about 15 days of unpaid furlough in the past year.\n\nThe cuts have caused delays in criminal and civil cases, with many federal court clerk's offices looking largely empty compared to a few years ago. Sequestration cut $350 million, or about 5 percent, from the judiciary's budget in the past fiscal year, bringing it to about $6.6 billion annually.\n\nJudges themselves are effectively exempt from furlough because the Constitution states their salaries cannot be reduced. For the past two weeks, the federal courts have essentially operated on fumes, using funds from filing fees and no-year appropriations to pay salaries and keep the lights on. Court budget personnel now predict that money will run out on Thursday or Friday of this week.\n\nThe chief judge of the U.S. District Court located near the Capitol building said the shutdown's funding lapse, piled on top of two years of tight budgets and staff reductions, has prompted his colleagues' frustration level to rise. \"Court budgets have essentially been slashed to the bone, with us losing nationwide thousands of judicial employees performing very important tasks...We're being told to furlough where we're already cut to the bone,\" Judge Richard Roberts said in an interview.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, earlier complaints about the judiciary's budgetary situation drew some skepticism. In July, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) suggested that some of sequestration's impacts on the courts were being exaggerated. Now, with the shutdown taking its own toll on the system, House Judiciary Committee Democrats staged a forum on Capitol Hill last week to draw attention to what they portrayed as a crisis in funding for the courts. The Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, called the impact of the cuts and the shutdown on the courts \"grave and growing each day.\"",
    " Title: House Republicans Propose Second Act to Accompany Trumpcare Legislation, Facing Skepticism and Challenges in Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) assessment of the American Health Care Act (Trumpcare) has faced criticism due to the absence of two proposed \"prongs\" of reform, one legislative and one regulatory, which have not been finalized or written into legislation. In an attempt to garner support from wavering Republicans, House Speaker Paul Ryan is considering incorporating these additional prongs into the initial bill.\n\nThe proposed legislative second act aims to ease cross-state sales of health insurance and limit jury awards for pain and suffering in malpractice lawsuits. However, skepticism persists, with Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas referring to it as \"mythical legislation\" and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) suggesting \"Easter basket\" might be a more fitting description.\n\nCross-state sales of health insurance can occur, as there is no federal restriction preventing it. The decision regarding insurance regulations remains with the states and their respective insurance regulators. The impact on healthcare markets is uncertain, but it may attract more Republican votes due to longstanding Republican support for this policy.\n\nThe second piece, tort reform, has been a longstanding Republican goal due to the belief that malpractice lawyers are predominantly Democrats. Limiting malpractice awards' potential impact on insurance costs for the general public is questionable, but it may appease doctors.\n\nHowever, the companion bill, known as a sidecar bill in Congress-speak, would require 60 votes to pass in the Senate, as it is not directly related to the budget and cannot be passed through budget reconciliation like the first prong. Additionally, it is unlikely to receive eight Democratic votes due to its association with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump is reportedly courting conservatives with a \"manager's amendment\" to accompany the first prong, which may further complicate the bill's passage in the Senate. The amendment could potentially end Medicaid expansion earlier, making it more challenging to secure the 51 votes needed from Republican senators.\n\nCritics argue that the American Health Care Act, with its tax cuts for the wealthy, elimination of Medicaid expansion for the poor, and defunding of Planned Parenthood, is a detrimental piece of legislation.

    " Title: Senate-Warren Controversy: Partisan Tensions Rise in U.S. Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate, traditionally known for its cool and civil deliberation, has faced criticism for its escalating partisanship, as demonstrated by the recent incident involving Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL).\n\nOn Tuesday, Warren was silenced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) for quoting a 1986 letter by civil rights leader Coretta Scott King that criticized Sessions' past actions regarding civil rights issues. The incident, which has since gone viral on social media under the hashtags #LetLizSpeak and #ShePersisted, has raised concerns about the Senate's character as a chamber of reasoned, civil deliberation.\n\nSenate Rule 19, a rarely used rule, forbids a senator from \"impugning\" the motives of another senator or referring offensively to another senator. Warren, a liberal icon known for standing up to President Trump, was warned about breaking this rule but continued to read the letter.\n\nIn defense of Warren, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) vigorously defended her on the Senate floor on Wednesday, stating, \"I certainly hope that this anti-free speech attitude is not traveling down Pennsylvania Avenue to our great chamber.\"\n\nSenator Tim Scott (R-SC), the Senate's only African-American Republican, gave an impassioned defense of Sessions on the Senate floor. He criticized those who had used derogatory language in their criticism of his support for Sessions.\n\nPolitical historians and observers have expressed concern about the deep partisanship in the Senate, with Julian Zelizer, a political historian at Princeton University in New Jersey, stating, \"There is no cooling function left\" in the Senate.\n\nSenators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Bob Corker (R-TN) have offered differing perspectives on the incident. Collins described it as \"unfortunate\" and a \"breakdown of comity on the Senate floor,\" while Corker downplayed the incident, stating it was \"a blip on the radar screen.\"\n\nThe Senate's partisan tensions are expected to continue as the confirmation process for President Trump's Supreme Court nominee looms and Republicans push through major changes in health care and taxes using a budget procedure that leaves out Democrats. Democrats have slowed the confirmation process of the president's cabinet nominees and are facing massive policy threats and a president many believe is dangerous to democracy.",
    " Title: House Select Committee on Benghazi Continues Investigation, Plans Public Hearings\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Select Committee, established to investigate the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, has recently held closed-door meetings with the State and Justice departments. The committee's chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), announced that public hearings will also take place, though much of the investigation will remain classified due to its sensitive nature.\n\nIn a statement, Rep. Gowdy revealed that the Department of State provided new information to the committee and addressed questions raised by its members. The committee's focus is currently on obtaining first-hand accounts from individuals present during the attack.\n\nThe committee also met with the Justice Department regarding document production and potential witnesses, according to Rep. Gowdy. The select committee has held two public hearings so far, and more are expected, though the majority of the work will be conducted in classified settings.\n\nLast week, a rules package was passed in the GOP-controlled House, reauthorizing the committee. This move was met with protest from Democrats on the panel, who expressed concern about the committee's objectives and the lack of opportunities for meaningful debate or amendments to the resolution.\n\nIn a statement, the five Democrats on the committee called for rules that ensure full Democratic participation in the investigation. They stated, \"Since our members were denied the ability to meaningfully debate or amend the resolution, we now look to the committee to quickly adopt rules that ensure that our Democratic members are able to participate fully in the investigation.\"\n\nA report from the House Intelligence Committee released last year largely cleared the CIA of wrongdoing in the lead-up to the attack, which resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens. The report, however, did criticize the agency for not more quickly changing its talking points on the impetus for the attack.\n\nDuring the select committee's second public hearing in December, Rep. Gowdy expressed a commitment to continuing the investigation, stating, \"I am keenly aware that there are people on both sides of the aisle who have concluded all questions have been answered. But I would rather ask a question twice than risk not answering it at all.\"\n\nThe 2012 attack has been a contentious issue between the Obama administration and congressional Republicans, with many Republicans, including potential 2016 presidential candidates, criticizing former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton for the State Department's response to the attack. The issue is expected to play a role in the 2024 presidential race if Mrs. Clinton decides to run.",
    " Title: FBI Director James Comey's Use of \"Extremely Careless\" in Hillary Clinton Email Investigation Sparks Legal Debate\n\n Article:\n\n In a statement on Tuesday, James Comey, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), declared that Hillary Clinton was \"extremely careless\" in her handling of highly sensitive and classified information on her unauthorized and unsecured email server while serving as Secretary of State. This statement has sparked a debate among legal professionals regarding the implications of the term \"extremely careless\" in the context of federal criminal law.\n\n The relevant federal criminal statute, 18 U.S.C. section 793-f, states that anyone entrusted with documents relating to national defense who, through gross negligence, permits such documents to be removed from their proper place of custody, can be fined or imprisoned for up to ten years. The term \"gross negligence\" is central to this statute, and its meaning is well-defined in legal texts and jury instructions.\n\n Black's Law Dictionary, a standard legal reference, defines gross negligence as extreme carelessness. Similarly, Wikipedia, a contemporary resource, describes gross negligence as \"serious carelessness.\" Given that Comey, by his own words, appears to have outlined a case of gross negligence constituting a crime, the question arises as to why he would not recommend criminal prosecution.\n\n James Comey is a former U.S. Attorney, yet some critics argue that his interpretation and application of the law in this case are questionable. The use of the term \"extremely careless\" to describe Clinton's actions, while also outlining a case of gross negligence, has led to confusion and debate among legal professionals.\n\n This situation has raised concerns and questions about the FBI's handling of the investigation and the interpretation of federal criminal law in this case. As a 36-year veteran lawyer, the author of this article has not witnessed such an illogical rationale and conclusion in their legal career.",
    " Title: Faith in Action Hosts National Faith Forum, Candidates Discuss Policy and Moral Teachings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a three-day event, the multiracial and multifaith community organizing network Faith in Action hosted the National Faith Forum in Las Vegas this week, where top presidential candidates, Pete Buttigieg and Tom Steyer, discussed their policy stances and moral teachings with a crowd of around 300 faith-based community organizers.\n\nDuring their presentations, the candidates were given five minutes to introduce themselves before engaging in a question-and-answer session with the audience. The forum provided a platform for individuals from across the country to share their personal stories and express their concerns related to racial and economic equality, criminal justice reform, gun violence, and immigration policies.\n\nBoth Steyer and Buttigieg often connected their responses to moral teachings, emphasizing their support for Faith in Action's goal of building a more just society. Steyer, who has made fighting climate change a central focus of his campaign, drew inspiration from Pope Francis in his advocacy work.\n\nWhen asked about their stance on specific policies, both candidates emphasized the importance of involving those most affected by the issues in the conversation and crafting policies that respond to their needs. Steyer and Buttigieg declined to commit to ending the practice of deportation but expressed a desire to be more respectful of immigrants and their loved ones.\n\nThe National Faith Forum was primarily focused on training faith-based community organizers and strengthening relationships between Faith in Action organizations in different states. Participants also listened to presentations on increasing census participation, improving advocacy campaigns, and getting out the vote for the 2020 election.\n\nThe brief conversations with Buttigieg and Steyer were crucial to Faith in Action's goal of getting policymakers to pay more attention to the concerns of multiracial religious communities. The Rev. Alvin Herring, executive director of Faith in Action, stated that every important conversation should involve people of faith.\n\nAfter each candidate spoke, the Rev. Herring invited them to take part in a prayer, emphasizing the significance of the 2020 election and the important role religious communities can and should play in it. The Rev. Herring prayed for the candidates to remember the concerns of faith-based communities if they were to be elected in November.",
    " Title: Oklahoma Court Orders Johnson & Johnson to Pay $572 Million in Opioid Epidemic Lawsuit\n\nArticle:\n\nAn Oklahoma judge has ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $572 million in damages for its role in the state's opioid epidemic. The ruling, made by Cleveland County District Court Judge Thad Balkman, was in response to a $17 billion lawsuit alleging the drugmaker deceptively peddled painkillers and flooded the market with the deadly drugs.\n\nThe lawsuit, brought by Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, was the first of thousands of similar lawsuits filed by state and local governments against opioid makers and distributors to go to trial. The litigation was closely watched by plaintiffs in over 1,500 similar lawsuits consolidated before a federal judge in Ohio.\n\nOklahoma sued J&J in an effort to address the crisis in the state with addiction treatment and prevention programs. More than 4,000 people died of opioid overdoses in the state between 2007 and 2017, lawyers said.\n\nDuring the non-jury trial, Hunter blasted J&J as a \"kingpin\" company motivated by greed. He said the corporation's years-long, aggressive marketing campaign had caused a public nuisance, with doctors over-prescribing the drugs, leading to a surge in overdose deaths.\n\nTwo of J&J's subsidiaries, Noramco and Tasmanian Alkaloids, have produced a significant amount of the raw opium used by other drug manufacturers to make the painkillers, the state said.\n\nLawyers for the company maintained that it is part of an industry regulated by the federal government, which answers to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and the Food and Drug Administration, among others, during every step of the supply chain. Lead attorney Larry Ottaway also claimed painkillers are important in addressing the health needs of Oklahoma residents.\n\n\"This problem of untreated chronic pain afflicts people here in Oklahoma,\" Ottaway said.\n\nJ&J's shares rose 5 percent in extended trading after the decision. Opioids were involved in nearly 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
    " Title: Fast-Food Industry Introduces Iconic Menu Items to Counter Rising Wages and Costs in Strong Economies\n\nArticle:\n\nConor Sen, a columnist for \u2588\u2588\u2588 Opinion, discusses the strategy employed by fast-food companies to remain profitable during periods of economic growth and tight labor markets. The example he provides is the recent success of Popeyes' new chicken sandwich, which has been popular despite its higher price point compared to similar offerings from competitors like Chick-fil-A.\n\nThe fast-food industry is known for its responsiveness to consumer tastes and budgets, as it is a large and highly competitive market. In times of economic downturn, fast-food companies do not have to worry about rising food or labor costs as much, as their customers are on a tighter budget. However, during periods of economic growth, consumers are still looking for value, but fast-food companies face the challenge of rising food and labor costs, which squeeze their profit margins.\n\nRaising prices on existing menu items can help maintain profit margins, but going too far may lead to customer backlash. An alternative strategy is to introduce new product offerings at higher prices to attract existing or new customers. This \"inflation\" of sorts has been a common tactic in the fast-food industry, with iconic menu items like the Burger King Whopper and the McDonald's Big Mac being introduced during times of low unemployment.\n\nThe Whopper was first introduced in 1957, during a year when the unemployment rate dropped as low as 3.7%. Burger King's co-founder noticed a rival establishment selling well with a bigger burger and sought to imitate it. The Big Mac owes its success to a particularly entrepreneurial McDonald's franchisee in Pittsburgh, who came up with the idea as a way of increasing sales during a time of low national unemployment (below 4%) in 1967.\n\nThe Six Dollar Burger from Carl's Jr and Hardee's was introduced in the late 1990s, during a time of economic growth, as a way of offering a premium product that still offered fast-food speed and value. The Large-Sandwich Indicator Unemployment rate, seasonally adjusted, shows a correlation between periods of low unemployment and the introduction of new menu items.\n\nHowever, the fast-food industry has also faced backlash for its profit-inflating strategies, particularly in the late 1990s. McDonald's introduced a \"Dino-sized\" value meal in response to the opening of the movie \"Jurassic Park,\" which led to a super-sizing arms race throughout the industry, contributing to the growing obesity crisis. After public outcry in response to the documentary \"Super Size Me,\" McDonald's phased out super-sized portions in 2004.\n\nIn recent years, the fast-food industry has introduced menu items featuring plant-based products like Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods, which are not cheap. The Popeyes chicken sandwich, for example, is priced at $3.99, 14% higher than the nearest Chick-fil-A's offering. The hook for the Popeyes sandwich is its use of a brioche bun, a full layer of pickles, and either a spicy Cajun spread or mayonnaise, making it a more premium option compared to Chick-fil-A's sandwich.\n\nIn conclusion, the fast-food industry's need to find new sources of profit in a good economy with growing cost pressures, and the industry's reputation as a contributor to the obesity crisis, provide the backdrop for the product launches the industry has produced this year. The success of the Popeyes chicken sandwich, as well as other iconic menu items like the Whopper, the Big Mac, and the Six Dollar Burger, demonstrates the industry's ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences and economic conditions.",

The endorsement was announced on Friday by Biden's campaign.\n\nIn a statement, Davis stated, \"In times like these, when the political winds are fiercely blowing across our country, it's important for us to have an experienced leader who has been through the diverse storms of life to guide our country.\" He further added, \"That's why I am very pleased to support Vice President Joe Biden to be our next President of the United States of America.\"\n\nBiden's campaign noted that the former vice president has received support from over 600 national, state, and local leaders across the country. Davis is the third African American elected official from Indiana to endorse Biden.\n\nThe endorsement comes as Buttigieg's campaign has seen momentum, particularly in the early caucus state of Iowa. However, Buttigieg has struggled to gain support from black voters. Davis told Politico that Buttigieg's failure to gain support from communities of color \"is not a new problem for him.\"\n\nDavis ran to replace Buttigieg as South Bend's mayor this year, but lost in the Democratic primary to Buttigieg's preferred candidate, James Mueller.",
    " Title: Investigations into Alleged Collusion and Wiretapping: Lack of Evidence and Ongoing Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing investigations into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence, as well as the claim of Obama-era wiretapping of Trump Tower, have left the political landscape in a state of uncertainty. As of today, there is no concrete evidence to support either charge.\n\nJames Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence under President Obama, has stated unequivocally that he has seen no evidence of Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Similarly, no evidence has been presented to support the claim of Obama-era wiretapping of Trump Tower.\n\nThe lack of evidence has not deterred the launch of multiple investigations, with the potential for a special prosecutor. The collusion narrative stems from the unusual circumstances surrounding Michael Flynn's false denial of discussing sanctions with the Russian ambassador and Jeff Sessions' false denial of having any contacts with Russians. However, these actions do not inherently constitute inappropriate behavior, and the reasons for concealment remain unclear.\n\nThe wiretapping storyline, on the other hand, is considered less plausible than a zombie invasion by many, including Congressional Republicans and key figures within the Trump administration. The Obama administration's alleged dissemination of information about Trump associates' contacts with Russians has raised questions about potential abuse of the right to listen in on foreigners to improperly monitor Americans.\n\nDespite the ongoing investigations and speculation, the truth remains elusive. The intelligence agencies are tasked with gathering information, but their actions do not necessarily equate to evidence of wrongdoing. The focus should shift from these internal investigations to addressing pressing national and global issues, such as the escalating tensions with North Korea and the imminent installation of an antimissile shield in South Korea.\n\nIn the midst of these self-created crises, it is crucial to remain vigilant and prepared for the real challenges that lie ahead. The political landscape is fraught with uncertainty, and it is essential to separate fact from fiction to make informed decisions and navigate the complexities of the global stage.",
    " Title: Repurposed Drugs Show Promise in Cancer Treatment, According to New Study\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in Nature Cancer has revealed that drugs originally developed to treat diseases such as diabetes and alcoholism may have applications in cancer treatment. Researchers tested thousands of existing medications, many of which have already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating diseases other than cancer, against hundreds of different human cancer cell lines in the lab. The study identified dozens of newly identified cancer-killing compounds.\n\nThe lead author of the study, Steven Corsello, practices oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and researches new cancer drug development at the Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. Corsello, who regularly treats patients with chemotherapy medications, many of which were developed decades ago, says, \"I deeply appreciate the need for improved and better-tailored cancer therapy.\"\n\nNew drug development is costly and time-consuming, often requiring years of painstaking research, and potential treatments rarely progress beyond the lab. Even when a medication makes it to clinical trials, it must undergo years of safety testing. Many of those that kill cancer efficiently are also so toxic to test subjects that they are never approved.\n\nBecause of these limitations, the field of repurposing existing drugs is \"really coming to the forefront,\" says Jonathan Sexton, a medicinal chemist who directs the University of Michigan's Center for Drug Repurposing and was not involved in the study. \"We're notoriously very bad at predicting what [compounds] are going to be most efficacious against specific cancers, which is why there is a huge attrition rate [for drugs] in clinical trials for cancer,\" he says. This situation has produced a wealth of medications that may not work for one type of cancer but could work for another type. And as libraries of these compounds continue to grow, Sexton says, a veritable pharmacopeia of treatments is becoming available.\n\nAt the Broad Institute, Corsello and his colleagues investigate how drugs affect gene expression\u2014the degree to which genes are turned on or off\u2014to determine whether the compounds have potential applications in cancer treatment. The institute developed a library of more than 1.5 million gene expression profiles from thousands of potential drug molecules, called the Connectivity Map, to guide the search. \"In the course of that research, I realized that we were missing many drugs, including ones that the FDA has already approved for other uses,\" Corsello says. With that in mind, he and his colleagues at the Broad Institute launched the Drug Repurposing Hub (DRH) in 2017 to test existing drugs against various disease models. That open-access library, which researchers anywhere can use for free, now includes more than 6,000 drugs\u2014ranging from aspirin to Zantac\u2014originally developed for other applications.\n\nRong Xu, a medical bioinformaticist at Case Western Reserve University, who was not involved in the study, says that for \"dry\" labs\u2014which use computer-generated models to investigate new drug applications\u2014libraries such as the DRH are invaluable. \"We'll use this as a starting point and correlate and also integrate these data sets with what we know about disease genetics\" to design computer algorithms that can identify potential treatment avenues, Xu says.\n\nIn the new study, published Monday in Nature Cancer, Corsello and his colleagues systematically tested 4,518 compounds from the DRH (of which 3,350 are already approved for use in the U.S. or Europe) against 578 cancer cell lines. Most were developed to treat diseases other than cancer; about a quarter were originally developed for cancer. Using a molecular bar-coding method to keep track of the vast array of cancer cell lines, which employs short sequences of DNA as \"bar codes,\" the researchers were able to test multiple cancer cell types simultaneously in each Petri dish, speeding the process considerably. In total, the team identified nearly 50 compounds that killed cancer cells and left other cells unscathed.\n\nThe researchers found 11 different drugs that trigger the same cancer-killing mechanism. These included one previously approved to treat essential thrombocytosis\u2014a blood disorder\u2014as well as progesterone medications. The drugs all appear to work by inducing an interaction between two proteins: PDE3A, which plays a role in regulating blood pressure, and SLFN12, whose role is not well understood. (In contrast, many existing cancer treatments merely inhibit enzymes.) Corsello says the interaction is \"an attractive target\" for developing new therapies. \"The drugs we found are a nice starting point to do that,\" he adds.\n\nOnce a drug shows selective anticancer effects, the next step is to find out how it works. Corsello says the team does so by looking at \"everything that's known\" about the cancer cell lines the drug kills. He lists a battery of genomic features the researchers analyze to determine where and how the killing blow lands, including gene expression, mutation, and the number of copies of the gene in the genotype. \"Then, using predictive modeling approaches, [we] determine predictive biomarkers of response to each of these therapies,\" he says.\n\nOf course, not all of these medications will turn out to work against cancer in humans. Predictive biomarkers can indicate how effective a treatment will be against a particular type of cancer cell line in the lab or how well it can treat a patient in the clinic. \"We prioritized drugs for follow-up that had selective [anticancer] activity and drugs that had predictive biomarkers from these cell line features,\" Corsello says. Medications that can predictably kill certain cancer cells could eventually be tested in patients and predict individuals who could benefit from those treatments.\n\nCorsello says that the research team plans to add 300 new cancer cell lines and 300 drug compounds to the library. \"I think there's still a lot that remains to be learned and discovered from this data,\" Corsello says. By using technologies such as CRISPR gene editing and screening, \"we're able to take a drug with promising activity and actually figuring out how it's working, which I think is a really promising strategy for the future that may have an impact on drug development.\"",
    " Title: The Onion's Satirical Approach to Mass Shootings in America Sparks Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe satirical news site, The Onion, has published a recurring article titled \"No Way to Prevent This,\" which has been republished three times over the past year and a half following mass shootings in the United States. The most recent instance was this week after a shooter killed nine people at an Oregon community college, following similar events in a black Charleston church in June and at the University of California Santa Barbara in May 2015.\n\nThe article's content remains consistent, with the specifics of each shooting changing, but key lines remain the same. The article highlights the nation's high rate of gun violence and the perceived helplessness of its citizens in preventing these tragedies.\n\nThe article has been shared thousands of times on social media, and some on Twitter have acknowledged its impact. Katie Reeves, a Twitter user, commented, \"This is peculiarly powerful: The Onion simply re-posts its gun violence article with updated locations and dates.\" Drew Thaler, another Twitter user, said, \"This is how you make a point. Three different articles from The Onion.\"\n\nJournalist Dave Cullen, who has covered mass shootings for years and wrote the New York Times bestseller Columbine, praised The Onion's article, stating, \"I think what [the article's popularity] says is we look for the people who tell us the truth\u2014kind of the emperor's new clothes\u2014who see through the stuff, and don't just print the same old stuff, or do the same old stuff, or do the safe stuff\u2014the people who call us on our s**t.\"\n\nCullen also noted that The Onion's satirical coverage of mass shootings in America has not always been well-received. After a shooting that killed 12 at Washington Navy Yard in 2013, The Onion published a story with the headline \"Location of Newest Mass Shooting Revealed. It's A Navy Yard, Authorities Confirm.\" Some criticized the article as \"not funny\" and \"gross stupidity.\"\n\nHowever, not all tragedies leave satirists speechless. After the Charleston church massacre, Jon Stewart, host of The Daily Show, started his comments after the shooting with the words, \"I've got nothing.\" The Onion, after the Sandy Hook massacre, wrote an article with the headline \"F**k Everything, Nation Reports.\"\n\nThe Onion's satirical approach to mass shootings in America has sparked debate, with some praising the site for saying what many feel but are afraid to express, while others find the humor inappropriate during times of tragedy.",
    " Title: Iowa Campaign Events: Trump and Clinton Address Supporters in Opposing Styles\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the town of Oskaloosa, Iowa, over a thousand people gathered at Oskaloosa High School on a hot and muggy Saturday afternoon. The event, organized by billionaire businessman Donald Trump, featured a free catered barbecue and the opportunity to sign up for a mailing list in exchange for T-shirts and other merchandise. Trump delivered a rally in his signature meandering style, criticizing Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and his fiscal policies, recounting his recent trip to Laredo, Texas, and expressing his business acumen.\n\nSimultaneously, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held a more intimate gathering with less than 100 Third District Iowa Democrats under a sycamore tree on the grounds of the Madison County Historical Complex. Clinton, dressed in a striped shirt and slacks, reminisced about her past campaigns with her husband, Bill Clinton, and expressed her appreciation for the support in Iowa.\n\nTrump's rally was designed to attract a large crowd, while Clinton's event was more focused on engaging with a smaller group. Trump's remarks touched on immigration, veterans, competition with China and Japan, and his issues with the Republican Party and Washington. Clinton, on the other hand, went through her policy-heavy stump speech, discussing her opposition to big money in politics, her support for early-childhood education, the Affordable Care Act, gay rights, and elder care.\n\nTrump criticized Wisconsin's current state, claiming it was in turmoil due to Governor Walker's policies. He also highlighted his relationship with veterans, presenting a stack of letters allegedly written by veterans in the past day. Clinton, however, did not mention her primary opponents, despite former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley serenading the crowd with songs, including a rendition of \"This Land Is Your Land.\"\n\nTrump responded to criticism of his comments about Mexican immigrants and Arizona Senator John McCain, while Clinton did not address her email use as Secretary of State. Trump trails Walker in recent Iowa polls, and he jokingly asked the crowd to put him in first place. Both candidates continue their campaigns in Iowa, with Trump focusing on his business acumen and Trump's immigration policies, while Clinton emphasizes her policy positions and experience.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Expected to Uphold Individual Mandate in Narrow Fashion, According to CNN's Bill Mears\n\nArticle:\n\nCNN's Bill Mears, in response to repeated inquiries about the Supreme Court's upcoming decision on the Affordable Care Act, predicts that the individual mandate will be upheld, albeit in a narrow fashion. Mears suggests that Chief Justice John Roberts may write the majority opinion, asserting that the power to assign the opinion-writing is one of the chief justice's prerogatives when in the majority.\n\nThe individual mandate, which requires most Americans to purchase health insurance, is expected to survive, according to Mears. However, he notes that this prediction goes against conventional wisdom and that no one, including himself, has inside information about the court's decision.\n\nIf Chief Justice Roberts takes on the task of writing the majority opinion, Mears believes he will attempt to navigate between the two polar views on the mandate's constitutionality and Congress's power to regulate \"commerce.\" The division of opinion on the mandate's constitutionality was evident during the oral arguments, with Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy asking tough questions of both sides.\n\nThe decision may not command a majority, meaning at least five justices agree on the outcome but not the constitutional basis. This split reasoning could lead to further uncertainty if Congress and the White House were to revise or entirely rework health care reform in the wake of the court's decision.\n\nMears suggests that the task of commanding a five-vote majority and maintaining it throughout the contentious opinion-writing process may lead Roberts, or whoever writes the opinion, to think small and narrow. This approach would involve upholding the mandate by insisting that health care is unique in the national economy and warning Congress not to go much further when regulating \"commerce,\" such as imposing a mandate to buy broccoli or American cars.\n\nThe exact outcome of the Supreme Court's decision remains uncertain, as only the justices, their law clerks, and a handful of court officials know how this will end. However, Mears anticipates a complex, lengthy, and potentially baffling ruling or series of rulings.",
    " Title: The Effectiveness of Conservative Economic Policies: A Perspective on American Economic Growth\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent New York Times article surveyed the state of the American economy and suggested that conservative economic policies, such as deregulation and tax cuts, are more effective than the mainstream press would have readers believe. The article, however, argues that the evidence linking regulation levels to growth is weak, and that deregulation does not necessarily stimulate economic activity.\n\nThe article asserts that the Trump administration has stopped hundreds of Obama-era regulations from being enacted and thousands of yet-to-be-invented regulations from ever being considered. It is suggested that this kind of deregulation has contributed to investment and job growth.\n\nThe article also criticizes the media for propping up economists who focus on issues such as inequality, labor unions, and climate change, rather than economic growth. It argues that these economists are often quoted in the media to support liberal policy positions, giving them a veneer of scientific certitude.\n\nThe article cites examples of policies such as the minimum wage hike, which has led to job losses in cities that have implemented it. It also points out that the predictions made by economists regarding the economic impact of policies such as the \"stimulus,\" the Affordable Care Act, and the minimum wage have often been inaccurate.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that while deregulation and tax cuts are not a panacea, they have already had an impact on the economy, with businesses acting on these policies and announcing bonus checks for their workers. The article suggests that the media should give voice to the economists who argue in favor of the free market and the positive impact of conservative economic policies.",
    " Title: Republican National Convention Shifts GOP Messaging: Disappointment as a Subtle Strategy Against Obama\n\nThe Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, has been characterized by the theme of disappointment, with the Republican Party criticizing President Barack Obama for failing to meet the expectations set in 2008. The convention, according to Obama's team, was a \"miss,\" with the Republicans not landing a significant blow on their opponent.\n\nHowever, the GOP's strategy, as presented in Tampa, represents a more nuanced and potentially dangerous approach for Obama. Instead of the kitchen-sink attacks that preceded the gathering, the Republicans posed as Obama 2008 voters, expressing their disillusionment with the president's unfulfilled promises.\n\nBoth parties acknowledge the power of the disappointment theme. The hope Obama offered for economic recovery, political transformation, and environmental protection has waned, according to the Republicans. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, stated in his acceptance speech, \"President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet. My promise is to help you and your family.\"\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, in his speech, said, \"Our problem with President Obama isn't that he's a bad person...Our problem is that he's a bad president.\"\n\nThe convention saw a shift in tone, with the shrill hyperbole, petty critiques, and Party of No intransigence absent from the proceedings. The convention, at times, resembled a Democratic gathering, with appealing vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan praising his mother and vowing to protect Medicare for seniors, and Senators Marco Rubio and Susana Martinez speaking of the opportunities the United States afforded them to rise into leadership positions.\n\nThe convention's criticism of Obama was more subtle, aimed at shifting momentum and softening the opponent for the remainder of the campaign. The convention's tone may not be immediately apparent to the casual observer, but it represents a strategic body blow that could impact the outcome of the election.",
    " Title: China Imposes Tariffs on U.S. Imports in Response to U.S. Tariff Hikes\n\nArticle:\n\nChina announced on Monday that it will impose tariffs on more than 5,000 U.S. products, in response to President Donald Trump's decision to raise duties on Chinese goods amid ongoing trade talks between the two countries. The new tariffs, which will take effect on June 1, will impact approximately $60 billion in U.S. imports and will range from 5% to 25%.\n\nThe U.S. had previously increased import taxes on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25% on May 10. The White House stated that President Trump is fine with China taking some retaliatory action, as long as it does not exceed an unspecified level. However, economists predict that the costs of the tariffs will be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nThe tariffs will impact a wide range of U.S. products, including coffee, beef, salmon, flowers, and some fruits and vegetables. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 600 points, or 2.3%, and closed at 25,324, its biggest one-day loss since January. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 2.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has been the most vulnerable to trade tensions, was down 3.4% at the closing bell.\n\nBoeing's stock plummeted more than 4% after the editor of a state-owned newspaper speculated that China may single out the jet manufacturer for retaliation for Trump's tariffs. \"China may stop purchasing US agricultural products and energy, reduce Boeing orders, and restrict US service trade with China,\" Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, wrote on Twitter.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, one of the leading Republican critics of Trump's tariffs, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), stated that both the U.S. and China would suffer from the tit-for-tat actions coming out of Washington and Beijing. \"Raising tariffs will hurt both US & China economies + more importantly will hurt US farmers/consumers/businesses,\" Grassley wrote on Twitter.\n\nCailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, stated that she still expects the U.S. and China to reach a limited trade agreement in the next month or so, due to the serious economic ramifications both countries will be dealing with otherwise. However, she also noted that a cooling-off period may be necessary to allow each party to save face before meaningful progress can be made.\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and president of the American Action Forum, a nonprofit policy group, stated that the Chinese tariffs are an extension of its previous strategy. \"At every point they have matched, but not exceeded, a U.S. tariff move,\" Holtz-Eakin said. \"This represents additional tariffs on items already facing duties\u2014just as are the tariffs that President Trump announced last week. Stepping back, they are evidence of an escalating and increasingly troubling trade war.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Senators to Introduce Legislation to Protect Special Counsel's Office\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan group of senators will introduce legislation on Wednesday aimed at protecting the office of the special counsel, following President Donald Trump's comments about potentially firing the special prosecutor investigating Russia and the 2016 election.\n\nRobert Mueller, the special counsel, is currently probing allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, an investigation that has expanded to include whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. Russia has denied interfering in the election, and Trump and the White House have stated there was no collusion.\n\nAfter the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the offices of Trump's personal lawyer on Monday, based partly on a referral by Mueller, Trump called the investigation \"a disgrace\" and suggested he may consider firing the special counsel.\n\nOn Wednesday, four senators announced they would merge two different proposals to protect the office of the special counsel. The original bills were introduced last summer. If passed, the legislation would allow the special counsel to be fired only \"for good cause\" by a senior Justice Department official, with a reason given in writing; provide recourse if the special counsel was fired without good cause; and preserve the staffing and materials of a pending investigation.\n\n\"We need to ensure not only that Special Counsel Mueller can complete his work without interference, but that special counsels in future investigations can, too,\" said Democratic Senator Chris Coons, one of the sponsors of the bill, in a statement.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said that while he thought Mueller should be allowed to continue his probe, he did not think legislation to protect him was necessary. It remains unclear whether the proposal could pass the House or that Trump would approve it. Spokespeople for McConnell and the White House did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comments.\n\nHowever, Coons said in an interview with MSNBC that he thought some Republicans, who currently have the majority in the Senate, could be swayed to back the bill. \"I think the events of the past week have changed some minds in the Republican caucus, that there is a moment here for the Senate to stand up and save the president from himself,\" said Coons.",
    " Title: United States and World: Parallels to 1968 Amidst Political, Social, and Economic Unrest\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States and the world are experiencing a resurgence of language, politics, and global instability reminiscent of 1968. The country, then, was grappling with the Vietnam War, a contentious presidential election, antiwar protests, racial unrest, political assassinations, terrorism, and a looming economic recession, leaving it deeply divided between a vocal radical minority and a silent conservative majority.\n\nIn 2017, the nation appears to be repeating this pattern, with the divide between liberal coasts and red-state America being far deeper and more evenly split. The removal of century-old statues, the NFL's political turmoil, and the permeation of politics in popular culture are just a few examples of the old foundations of American life eroding.\n\nThe European Union, once a model for the future, is unraveling due to the exit of Great Britain, the divide between Spain and Catalonia, the bankruptcy of Mediterranean nation members, terrorist attacks, and the influx of immigrants from war-torn Middle Eastern countries. Germany is once again asserting itself, but this time through insidious means other than military might.\n\nNorth Korea claims to have nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the U.S. West Coast, and Iran is likely to follow a similar nuclear trajectory, while its new Shiite hegemony in the Middle East is feeding on the remnants of Syria and Iraq.\n\nDespite the social unrest and media hysteria, the U.S. economy is growing, unemployment and inflation remain low, the stock market and middle-class incomes are up, and business and consumer confidence are high. Energy production has expanded, the border with Mexico is being enforced, and corporate profits are up.\n\nThe question remains whether this chaos is a necessary and long-overdue purging of dangerous and neglected pathologies or a sign that the conventional wisdom of the past is drawing to a close. The traditional political parties seem to have no answers, with Democrats being overwhelmed by progressive identity politics and socialism, and Republicans torn between populist nationalists and the calcified establishment status quo.\n\nThe instability may be less a symptom of America falling apart and more a sign that the old conventional wisdom is coming to an end, along with the careers of those who profited from it. Historically, any crisis that did not destroy the United States has ended up making it stronger. However, the current situation is marked by a struggle over which is more toxic: the chronic statist malady that has been eating away at the country, or the new populist medicine deemed necessary to cure it.",
    " Title: FBI Officials Discussed 25th Amendment to Remove President Trump, According to Former Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2017, a series of discussions among high-level officials within the Department of Justice (DOJ) reportedly took place to consider the possibility of invoking the U.S. Constitution's 25th Amendment to remove President Donald Trump from office. These discussions, as claimed by former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, involved discussions about declaring the president unfit for office and installing the vice president in his place.\n\nThe 25th Amendment provides a mechanism for removing a president who is unable to perform the duties of the office. However, it is important to note that this is different from impeachment, the process for removing a president for misconduct. The vice president and a majority of cabinet officers must agree, in writing, that the president is unable to discharge the duties of the office. There is no provision for law enforcement or government officials to force a president from office.\n\nMcCabe's claims that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was part of this coup attempt are shocking, given Rosenstein's role in making numerous decisions that impact a wide range of issues. McCabe's veracity is questionable, as he was fired for providing false information to the DOJ. However, it is unlikely that a serious deputy attorney general would joke about such matters.\n\nMcCabe claims that he and others believed they were working for a president who might have conspired with Russia to betray the country. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and special counsel Robert Mueller, who was investigating potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, has not taken any steps to remove the president.\n\nMcCabe and his colleagues were reportedly aware that the explosive claims in the Steele dossier, a document produced by former British spy Christopher Steele for the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign, were unverified. By May 2017, the FBI had months of data from electronic spying on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page and those with whom he communicated, but none of this data resulted in any verification of the claims in the Steele dossier.\n\nFrancey Hakes, a former prosecutor and consultant on national security and the protection of children, served as a prosecutor for 16 years and appeared before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

    " Title: Japan Resumes Commercial Whaling in Defiance of International Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nJapan has initiated its first commercial whale hunt in decades, a move that defies international criticism and withdraws from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) regulations. The whaling fleet, permitted to catch 227 minke, Bryde's, and sei whales this year, set sail from Kushiro, Japan, with a kill cap of 52 minke, 150 Bryde's, and 25 sei whales.\n\nThe last commercial whale hunt in Japan occurred in 1986, but the country has continued whaling under the guise of research. The IWC, comprising member nations, had agreed to an effective ban on whale hunting, but Japan argues that sustainable whale hunting is possible.\n\nThe fisheries ministry has set a quota for the season, with last year's catch under its scientific program at 333 whales. Shigeto Hase, the head of the agency, expressed his excitement for the resumption of commercial whaling, stating that it would preserve the culture and way of life for future generations.\n\nYoshifumi Kai, head of the Japan Small-Type Whaling Association, shared similar sentiments, emphasizing the long-standing history of whale hunting in his hometown. Whalers expressed a mix of excitement and nervousness as they set sail for the season.\n\nThe IUCN Red List of Threatened Species classifies minke and Bryde's whales as not endangered, while sei whales are endangered but with increasing numbers. Conservationist groups like Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd remain critical of Japan's resumption of whaling, but have yet to announce concrete plans for action against the country.\n\nNicola Beynon of Humane Society International described the resumption of commercial whaling as a \"sad day for whale protection globally,\" accusing Japan of beginning a \"new and shocking era of pirate whaling.\" Sam Annesley, executive director at Greenpeace Japan, stated that Japan is \"out of step with the international community.\"\n\nWhaling is considered part of Japan's culture, with coastal communities having hunted whales for centuries. Consumption of whale meat became widespread after World War Two when other food sources were scarce. Whales were brought to the brink of extinction by hunting in the 19th and early 20th Century, and the IWC imposed a hunting moratorium in 1986 to allow whale numbers to recover.\n\nSince 1987, Japan has killed between 200 and 1,200 whales each year under an exemption to the ban allowing scientific research. Critics argue this was a cover for Japan to hunt whales for food, as the meat from the whales killed for research usually ended up for sale. In 2018, Japan attempted one last time to convince the IWC to allow whaling under sustainable quotas, but failed. Japan left the IWC, effective from July 2019.",

The escalation in violence occurred on the day the United States opened its embassy in Jerusalem, an event Palestinians view as clear US backing for Israeli rule over the city's eastern part, which they claim.\n\nThe violence began six weeks ago with protests at the Gaza border, dubbed the \"Great March of Return\" and led by Gaza's Islamist rulers, Hamas. Hamas had previously stated it would escalate the protests on Tuesday, when Palestinians commemorate the Nakba or Catastrophe, marking the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians following the foundation of the Israeli state on May 14, 1948.\n\nOn Monday, the Israeli military reported that 40,000 Palestinians participated in \"violent riots\" at 13 locations along the Gaza Strip security fence. Palestinians hurled stones and incendiary devices, while the Israeli military used snipers. Black smoke poured from burning tires, and the health ministry, run by Hamas, reported that children were among those killed.\n\nThe Israeli military stated that it had killed three people attempting to plant explosives near the security fence in Rafah. Aircraft and tanks also targeted military positions belonging to Hamas in the northern Gaza Strip, according to the Israeli military.\n\nIsrael claims the protests are aimed at breaching the border and attacking Israeli communities nearby. There were also violent clashes between Israeli police and protesters who raised Palestinian flags outside the new embassy, with several protesters being detained.\n\nTuesday is expected to see larger and potentially more violent demonstrations, as Palestinians bury those killed on Monday and return to demonstrate. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated, \"Every nation has the right to defend its borders. Hamas clearly says its intentions are to destroy Israel and sends thousands to break through the border for that end.\"\n\nWestern nations, including the UK, called for restraint. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said, \"We expect all to act with utmost restraint to avoid further loss of life.\" Germany stated that Israel has the right to defend itself but should do so proportionately.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, condemned the \"shocking killing of dozens, injury of hundreds by Israeli live fire.\" A small interim embassy will begin operating from Monday inside the existing US consulate building in Jerusalem, with a larger site to be found later when the rest of the embassy moves from Tel Aviv.\n\nThe opening ceremony was brought forward to coincide with the state of Israel's 70th anniversary. US President Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband Jared Kushner, who are both senior White House advisers, joined US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan for the ceremony.\n\nAfter Ivanka Trump unveiled the seal of the embassy, Jared Kushner said in his address, \"When President Trump makes a promise, he keeps it... We have shown the world that the US can be trusted. We stand with our friends and allies.\" Kushner also referred to Trump's withdrawal from the \"dangerous, flawed, and one-sided Iran deal,\" drawing applause from the guests.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated, \"What a glorious day. Remember this moment. This is history. President Trump, by recognizing history, you have made history.\" Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas condemned the embassy as a \"settlement in East Jerusalem,\" stating that the US was \"no longer a mediator in the Middle East.\"\n\nArab League chief Ahmed Abul Gheit stated it was \"shameful to see countries participating with the US and Israel in celebrating the former's embassy move to occupied Jerusalem in a clear and grave violation of international law.\" The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem not recognized internationally.\n\nSince 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Various countries once had embassies based in Jerusalem but many moved after Israel passed a law in 1980 formally making Jerusalem its capital.",

At the age of 12, Warren's father suffered a heart attack, and the family faced financial hardships, nearly losing their family station wagon and their home.\n\nOne significant event that marked a turning point in Warren's life occurred when she walked into her parents' bedroom and found her mother preparing for a job interview. Her mother, who had never worked outside the home, donned a dress typically reserved for weddings, funerals, and graduations, and took a minimum-wage job answering phones. This job, Warren explains, saved her family.\n\nWarren grew up in Oklahoma with three older brothers who all joined the military. Initially, she aspired to become a public school teacher, but the financial burden of college seemed insurmountable for her family. Despite the obstacles, Warren managed to secure a scholarship and attended George Washington University.\n\nHowever, Warren's journey was not a straightforward one.

    " Title: Study Challenges LGBT Left's Narrative on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity\n\nArticle:\n\nA comprehensive study titled \"Sexuality and Gender: Findings from the Biological, Psychological, and Social Sciences\" has been released by The New Atlantis, challenging the narrative of the LGBT Left on sexual orientation and gender identity. The study, authored by Lawrence Mayer, a scholar-in-residence at Johns Hopkins University, and Paul McHugh, the former psychiatrist-in-chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital, presents findings that contradict the widely accepted notion that sexual orientation and gender identity are innate, biologically fixed properties of human beings.\n\nThe study argues that the view that sexual orientation is an innate, biologically fixed property is not supported by scientific evidence. The authors highlight numerous studies finding that sexual orientation is often fluid, with one study showing high rates of abandonment of non-heterosexual identification as young men grow out of adolescence.\n\nRegarding gender identity, the study asserts that the idea that it is an innate, fixed property independent of biological sex is not supported by scientific evidence. The authors note that only a minority of children who experience \"cross-gender identification\" will continue to do so as they get older.\n\nThe study also reveals that compared to the general population, non-heterosexual subpopulations are at an elevated risk for a variety of adverse health and mental health outcomes. The numbers are sobering, with non-heterosexual populations having 1.5 times the risk of anxiety disorders and substance abuse, twice the risk of depression, and 2.5 times the risk of suicide. The transgender population also is at elevated risk for mental-health problems, with the suicide numbers particularly troubling, with the rate of lifetime suicide attempts across all ages of transgender individuals estimated at 41%, compared to under 5% in the overall U.S. population.\n\nThe study is lengthy and comprehensive, and when delving into its depths, it becomes clear that McHugh and Mayer are not positing simplistic alternative explanations for human sexuality that would mirror and rebut the Left's narrative. Instead, what emerges is a messy, realistic vision of human beings who are shaped by myriad social, cultural, and biological forces.\n\nThe study spends considerable time discussing the high incidence of childhood sexual and physical abuse in the LGBT community. The authors note that the answer to whether LGBT people experience higher rates of abuse and assault because of their orientation or whether the life-altering experience of abuse and assault contributes to the formation of an LGBT identity is not necessarily either/or. A person can be targeted because they're perceived to be gay, and sexual abuse perpetrated by men might cause boys to think they are gay or make girls averse to sexual contact with men.\n\nThe messy reality described by McHugh and Mayer has been experienced by humans since time immemorial. The LGBT Left's narrative is the new nonsense, but in response to the new nonsense, there are sectors of American and European politics and culture that can't kick away the old norms of marriage and gender fast enough. They keep doing so in spite of the mountain of evidence that those who forsake the allegedly oppressive \"Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement,\" to quote Black Lives Matter, face far greater challenges than those who stick faithfully to the heteronormative nightmare of traditional male-female marriage.\n\nWhat's even worse, what's downright insane, is that some on the Left want to end the debate. They want to keep selling their moral vision to the public without any competition. The Judeo-Christian model, by contrast, is aspirational, calling on people not to do what they want but what they should. Admittedly, this path is far easier for some than others, but there has always been some play in the cultural joints. The Left's response is alluring, but it offers a self-indulgent path down which lies cultural ruin. The LGBT Left is driving us there just as fast as it can depress the gas pedal, but thanks to McHugh and Mayer, we now know they most assuredly are not doing so in the name of \"science.\"",
    " Title: Illinois Legalizes Recreational Marijuana, Establishes Statewide Marketplace\n\nArticle:\n\nIllinois has become the 11th state in the United States to legalize marijuana for recreational use, following Governor J.B. Pritzker's signing of a bill that allows residents to purchase and possess up to one ounce of cannabis at a time, and non-residents up to 15 grams. The law, which fulfills one of Pritzker's campaign promises, also implements the nation's first comprehensive statewide cannabis marketplace designed by legislators.\n\nThe legislation, effective from January 1, 2020, permits adults 21 and older to purchase cannabis at approved dispensaries. However, possession remains a crime until the dispensaries are licensed and established.\n\nThe law offers expungement of criminal records for nearly 800,000 people with past convictions for purchasing or possessing 30 grams or less of marijuana. The marketplace portion of the Illinois law also addresses the disproportionate impact of the war on drugs on minority communities.\n\nThe law provides preference to would-be marijuana vendors in areas of high poverty and with records of large numbers of convictions. Portions of the tax proceeds must be reinvested in impoverished communities.\n\nPolice organizations are wary, expressing concerns about enforcing driving under the influence laws and the need for more development of technology for testing marijuana impairment. They were successful in removing an earlier provision that would have allowed anyone to grow up to five marijuana plants at home for personal use.\n\nThe law now allows five plants to be maintained only by authorized patients under the state's medical marijuana law. Previously, they could not grow their own.\n\nTen other states and the District of Columbia have legalized smoking or eating marijuana for recreational use since 2012. Vermont and Michigan were the latest states to legalize marijuana in 2018. Vermont did so through the Legislature, but did not establish a statewide marketplace as Illinois did. Other initiatives have failed, with promising proposals in New York and New Jersey fizzling late this spring. Despite a statewide listening tour on the issue by Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor last winter, the idea never took flight.",
    " Title: Nobel Prize in Literature Awarded to Controversial Austrian Writer Peter Handke\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature for 2019 was awarded to Austrian writer Peter Handke, a decision that has sparked controversy due to Handke's controversial views on the Bosnian War and the genocide committed by Serbs against Muslims in Bosnia.\n\nThe controversy revolves around Handke's political stance, which is best exemplified in a series of essays he wrote in 1996, collected in a short book titled \"A Journey to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia.\" In these essays, Handke criticized the media for portraying the Serbs as evil and distanced himself from Serbian leader Slobodan Milo\u0161evic, who was later tried for genocide and war crimes.\n\nHandke's views on the Bosnian War and the genocide committed in Bosnia have been criticized as a form of denial. In a concise article he wrote for the French newspaper Liberation after his 1996 essays appeared, Handke questioned the use of the term \"concentration camps\" in Bosnia, stating that there were also Croat and Muslim camps, and that the crimes committed by all sides would be judged at The Hague.\n\nHowever, it is widely accepted that the Serb camps in Bosnia were concentration camps, and that the Muslims had nothing like those industrial-scale camps. The United Nations war crimes tribunal at The Hague sentenced Serbs to lengthy prison terms for the crimes committed there.\n\nIn his article for Liberation, Handke also equated the abominable massacre in Srebrenica, where several thousand Muslims were executed by Serb forces, with the massacres committed by Muslim troops. This has been criticized as a form of deception and deflection.\n\nDavid Rieff, a journalist who has reported from Bosnia, assessed Handke's book as follows: \"The truth is that he doesn't know what he's talking about... He came to Serbia knowing nothing about its complicated politics and, to judge by the book, left knowing no more.\"\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature is awarded annually to an author who has produced \"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\" and is considered one of the most prestigious literary prizes in the world. The decision to award the prize to Handke has been met with criticism and controversy, with many arguing that the prize should not be used to legitimize controversial political views.",
    " Title: Email from Former Clinton Administration Official Suggests Need for \"Unaware and Compliant Citizenry\"\n\nArticle:\n\nA recently released email from the Wikileaks data dump, dated March 13, 2016, discusses the need for maintaining political power by producing an \"unaware and compliant citizenry.\" The email was sent to Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, by former Clinton administration official Bill Ivey.\n\nIvey, who served as Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts during Bill Clinton's second term, is a trustee of the Center for American Progress, a think tank with ties to the Clinton campaign. In the email, Ivey expresses concern over the perceived inability of Hillary Clinton to match Donald Trump's celebrity appeal.\n\nIvey suggests that Trump's success in capturing media attention could not be replicated by Clinton, who is not an entertainer or celebrity in the Trump or Kardashian mold. He laments that Trump's larger-than-life appeal might not be countered by simply focusing on policy.\n\nIn the email, Ivey also acknowledges the left's role in \"conspiring\" to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry, but notes that this strategy is becoming less effective. He characterizes public \"unawareness\" as a positive for the Clinton campaign.\n\nThe email concludes with Ivey's admission that the left is struggling to navigate forces that cannot be fully understood, and his intention to attend a Clinton fundraiser.\n\nThe email, penned by Ivey, offers a glimpse into the perceived elitist and arrogant mindset within the Clinton campaign, with Americans viewed as easily manipulated and herded in a certain direction.\n\nPaul Joseph Watson, editor-at-large of \u2588\u2588\u2588.com and Prison Planet.com, has commented on the email, stating that it reveals the elitist and arrogant mindset that pervades the Clinton campaign.",
    " Title: Rep. Tom Cole Discusses Minimum Wage Increase, Accuses White House of Politicizing the Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Tom Cole (R-OK) has expressed opposition to an increase in the minimum wage but is open to considering proposals that include job creation measures such as the Keystone pipeline. In an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Friday, Cole accused the White House of using the minimum wage issue as a \"political weapon.\"\n\nA proposal to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour was blocked by a filibuster in the U.S. Senate earlier this week.\n\nCole acknowledged that there is a case for raising the wage, but he also pointed out that there is opposition to the increase. He cited the Congressional Budget Office's estimate that raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, phased in over three years, would reduce total employment by about 500,000 workers while substantially boosting wages for low-income workers. The report also noted that the uncertainty is substantial, and the job loss could range from \"very slight\" to as many as 1 million jobs.\n\nCole argued that the issue has been politicized and accused the White House of using it as a political tool. He suggested that if the president were serious about raising the minimum wage, he would propose other measures that would attract Republican support.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has indicated a willingness to compromise on the wage issue but not on the $10.10 figure. White House press secretary Jay Carney said on Thursday that offering a different number would not likely be effective, as Republican leaders have not expressed support for a lower figure.\n\nThe information regarding the potential job loss and the political stance of the White House and Congressional leaders is based on the user-provided text.

    " Title: Sanders and Bloomberg: Two Contenders with Distinctive Political Histories Compete in Democratic Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, two prominent figures in American politics, are currently engaged in a heated competition in the Democratic primary race. The two candidates, who represent distinct strands of liberalism, have been compared to comic book characters, with each embodying different ideological perspectives.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, known for his progressive stance, has a history that dates back to the anti-war socialist and populist movements of the early 20th century, with roots in figures such as William Jennings Bryan and Eugene Debs. Sanders is also associated with reformers like Jane Addams. His supporters appreciate his consistent advocacy for democratic socialism and his opposition to economic elites, particularly the \"billionaire class.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman, represents a different kind of liberalism. He is often associated with a technocratic, data-driven approach to governance, having implemented policies in New York City that were met with controversy, such as restrictions on large-sized sodas and the controversial stop-and-frisk policy. Bloomberg's political leanings have evolved over time, from a lifelong Democrat to a Republican, and then an independent, before returning to the Democratic Party in his bid for the presidency.\n\nThe contest between Sanders and Bloomberg has raised questions about the future direction of the Democratic Party. If Sanders were to win the nomination, the party could potentially shift towards a more populist, social democratic orientation. Conversely, if Bloomberg were to win, the party could lean towards a more bureaucratic, authoritarian approach.\n\nIt is important to note that both Sanders and Bloomberg are beneficiaries of the hollowed-out political parties, which have been unable to effectively manage the nomination process. This has led to the rise of outsider candidates like Trump in the Republican Party and potentially Sanders or Bloomberg in the Democratic Party.\n\nThe stakes of their contest are high, as the outcome could significantly shape the identity of the Democratic Party. The choice between these two candidates is zero-sum, and the eventual winner could define the party as much as Donald Trump has defined the Republican Party. Other options for primary voters do exist, but the choice between Sanders and Bloomberg is a significant one that could determine the direction of the Democratic Party in the coming years.",
    " Title: Danish Parliament Member Criticizes Potential U.S. Purchase of Greenland as a Commodity\n\nArticle:\n\nSpeculation surrounding the potential purchase of Greenland by the United States has sparked controversy, with some social media users making light of the situation through photoshopped images and humorous comments. However, at the center of the international incident, there is little humor to be found, according to politicians and residents of Greenland.\n\nAaja Chemnitz Larsen, a Greenlandic member of the Danish Parliament, stated, \"It's never nice to be treated as a commodity.\" Greenland, a nation of 56,000, has a shared history with Denmark dating back a millennium. If the relationship were to change, it would not be up to Denmark, and certainly not up to an American president's \"impulse,\" according to Henrik O. Breitenbauch, an expert on Greenland and the head of the Center for Military Studies at Copenhagen University.\n\nThe speculation suggests that the American president, a former real estate developer, may be interested in Greenland due to its natural resources and strategic location. Greenland offers a real estate investor fresh air, direct access to the sea, an abundance of seafood, and a backyard rich with lucrative minerals. The island's proximity to international sea routes allows for quick passage to various parts of the world (when the ice permits).\n\nHowever, the island's population may not see much benefit from exchanging the Danish queen as their head of state with an American president who has strained relations with traditional allies by criticizing NATO and withdrawing from treaties like the Paris climate accord. Henrik O. Breitenbauch commented, \"Greenland could choose to become Puerto Rico with snow, but I doubt there's much interest in that.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the potential purchase of Greenland by the United States has sparked controversy and criticism from Greenlandic politicians and residents, who view the situation as a dehumanizing commodification of their nation. The speculation suggests that the American president may be interested in Greenland for its strategic resources and location, but the long-term implications for Greenland's population and sovereignty remain uncertain.",

Ryan's comment comes shortly after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a government-wide crackdown on leakers.\n\nSessions warned that the media could be part of the crackdown, and the Justice Department could request sources behind leaks. The investigation will include a review of the Justice Department's policies on subpoenas for media outlets that publish sensitive information.\n\n\"We respect the important role that the press plays and will give them respect, but it is not unlimited,\" Sessions said. \"They can not place lives at risk with impunity.\" He added, \"We must balance their role with protecting our national security and the lives of those who serve in our intelligence community, the armed forces, and all law-abiding Americans.\"\n\nSessions concluded, \"I have this message for the intelligence community: The Department of Justice is open for business. And I have this warning for would-be leakers: Don\u2019t do it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner (D-Va.), suggested on Thursday that Congress should investigate the leak of transcripts of President Trump's phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.

    " Title: CDC Officials Receive $25 Million in Bonuses Since 2007 Amid Flat Funding and Ebola Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nTop public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have received $25 million in bonuses since 2007, according to data compiled by American Transparency's OpenTheBooks.com. This comes as the agency's headcount increased by 23 percent during the same period, despite relatively flat funding.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2013, all federal wages were frozen due to budgetary constraints, but CDC officials found ways to pay themselves through bonuses, overtime, within-grade increases, and promotion pay raises. Donald Shriber, the deputy director of policy and communication at the CDC's Center for Global Health, received the highest bonus in the six years analyzed\u2014$62,895 in 2011.\n\nKathleen Dunlap, the deputy budget director at the CDC, was awarded an $8,000 bonus last year, the highest among her fellow employees. Ms. Dunlap did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe CDC's handling of the Ebola outbreak has been criticized, and the agency has been accused of using budgetary constraints as an excuse for its response. National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins told The Huffington Post last week that the CDC had been working on an Ebola vaccine for more than a decade but was hampered by shrinking budgets.\n\nThe CDC's budget has remained relatively flat since President Obama took office. In fiscal year 2010, the budget request for CDC funding was $6.31 billion. In President Obama's latest budget request, funding is set at $5.39 billion, with additional contributions of $809 million expected from the Prevention and Public Health Fund\u2014totalizing about $6.2 billion.\n\nDespite stagnating funding, the CDC still handed out bonuses and added 1,888 positions from 2007 to 2013, data show. Employees at the CDC earn more than the federal average. According to figures kept by the Office of Personnel Management, the average salary for a full-time federal employee working on a permanent appointment was $79,030 as of September 2013, the most recent date for which the figure has been released. The average salary for a CDC employee was $95,015 last year, OpenTheBooks shows.\n\n\"Employees at the embattled CDC have been making millions in higher-than-average salaries and bonuses,\" said OpenTheBooks.com founder Adam Andrzejewski. \"CDC executives 'gamed the system' to increase employee pay through bonuses during three years of the 'official federal wage freeze.' CDC officials should be focused on preventing diseases rather than pumping up their salaries.\"\n\nIt's too early to tell whether it was money well spent, Mr. Andrzejewski said. \"The CDC's mission is to protect the health of the nation, but will these highly compensated executives be successful and earn their pay, not to mention bonuses?\" he asked.\n\nExcluding Atlanta, where the CDC is based, CDC employees at the National Center for Health Statistics in Hyattsville, Maryland, received the largest federal payout of $304 million in total wages from 2007 to 2013, as well as about $640,000 in bonuses. CDC sites in Cincinnati; Chamblee, Georgia; Bruceton, Pennsylvania; and Morgantown, West Virginia, all had CDC staff earning more than $100 million from 2007 to 2013. They also collectively paid out $1.8 million in bonuses.\n\nAccording to OpenTheBooks, 40 people have been on the CDC's payroll in Dallas since 2007. They have earned about $3 million, on par with the CDC's presence in Richmond, Virginia, or Sacramento, California, but significantly less than the agency's commitment to Fort Collins, Colorado ($64 million in payouts) or Anchorage, Alaska ($14 million in payouts).",
    " Title: DoD Policies Regarding Transgender Service Members' Health Care and Deployability: A Review of RAND Study Findings\n\nArticle:\n\nThe RAND Corporation, a federally funded research and development center, has conducted a study on the health care needs of transgender individuals, with a specific focus on transgender service members in the United States military. The study, sponsored by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, examines various aspects of transition-related treatments, costs, and their potential impact on force readiness and deployability.\n\nThe RAND report identifies the health care needs of the transgender population and transgender service members, outlines the costs associated with transition-related treatments, assesses the potential readiness implications of a policy change, and reviews the experiences of foreign militaries that permit transgender personnel to serve openly.\n\nThe study finds that, if transgender service members are allowed to serve openly, certain DoD policies would need to be changed to accommodate their health care needs. These changes may include:\n\n1. Access to gender transition-related health care: The RAND report suggests that the DoD would need to provide a range of transition-related treatments, including hormone therapy, counseling, and surgeries, to ensure the health and well-being of transgender service members.\n\n2. Coverage of transition-related treatments: The report examines the costs associated with these treatments and finds that the costs vary widely, depending on the specific treatment and the individual's health insurance plan. The report notes that the DoD would need to establish policies for covering these costs, ensuring equitable access to care for all service members.\n\n3. Impact on force readiness and deployability: The study assesses the potential impact of transition-related health care needs on force readiness and deployability. The report finds that, with proper management, the impact on readiness and deployability would be minimal.\n\n4. Experiences of foreign militaries: The RAND report reviews the experiences of foreign militaries that permit transgender personnel to serve openly, providing insights into the challenges and benefits of such policies.\n\nIt is important to note that the RAND report does not take a political stance on the issue of transgender service members in the military. The report's findings are based on objective research and analysis, and it is up to the DoD to consider these findings and make policy decisions accordingly.\n\nThe RAND Corporation is a nonprofit institution that aims to improve policy and decision-making through research and analysis.

    " Title: Former State Department Official Explains Obama Administration's Avoidance of \"Radical Islamic Extremism\" Label\n\nArticle:\n\nA former State Department official, Richard Stengal, has provided an explanation for the Obama administration's reluctance to use the term \"radical Islamic extremism\" to describe radical Islamic extremism. In a New York Times op-ed, Stengal, who served as the former under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, stated that the practical reason for this avoidance was not due to timidity or political correctness, but rather to maintain relationships with Islamic allies.\n\nStengal argued that the Obama administration needed the cooperation of countries like Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia to combat radical Islamic extremism. These allies believed that the term unfairly vilified an entire religion, and they did not consider the Islamic State to be Islamic, as its violent actions against Muslims proved.\n\nStengal also noted that ISIS as a military force is \"on the ropes\" in Iraq and Syria, suggesting that the previous administration's strategy is working. He urged the Trump administration to reassure these Arab allies that references to \"radical Islam\" and \"Islamic extremism\" are only directed at the small percentage of the world's Muslim population that has embraced violence.\n\nDespite this, Stengal expressed apprehension about the new direction the Trump administration is taking, stating that it is not up to the U.S. to define what is Islamic and what is not. Instead, he argued that mainstream Muslims and independent clerics in Muslim countries should create a narrative that refutes the Islamic State's ideology and offers a more positive alternative, which may help in countering the group's recruiting efforts.",
    " Title: President Trump Criticizes Puerto Rico's Infrastructure, Urges Congress to Decide on Aid Duration\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued a series of tweets on Thursday, criticizing Puerto Rico's infrastructure and suggesting that federal aid may not be sustained indefinitely. The comments come a week after Trump visited the U.S. territory, which is still recovering from the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria, the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly a century.\n\nTrump's trip to Puerto Rico was met with criticism, including his comparison of the storm's death toll to that of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. He stated, \"Sixteen people versus in the thousands,\" referring to the lower death toll in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe president has repeatedly called for more help from Puerto Rico on a local level and has had an intermittent feud with the San Juan mayor. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded to Trump's latest tweets, questioning, \"Why do you continue to treat Puerto Ricans differently than other Americans when it comes to natural disasters?\"\n\nAccording to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), there were over 10,000 federal officials on the ground on the island earlier this month. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., plans to lead a small bipartisan group to visit Puerto Rico on Friday. The group includes the chairman and top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, and they are expected to meet with local officials and emergency personnel.\n\nThe House is expected to vote this week on an emergency spending package that includes billions of dollars more in relief for Puerto Rico, Texas, and Florida in the wake of the hurricanes Maria, Harvey, and Irma this season. The president asked Congress this week for a $4.9 billion loan to help Puerto Rico pay its bills from the storm. The island faced more than $70 billion in debt prior to the storm and declared bankruptcy in May.",
    " Title: Former Senator Rick Santorum Ponders 2016 Presidential Run, Discusses Policy Ideas and Party Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, has expressed reservations about another White House run but has not ruled it out. In an interview with The Associated Press, Santorum discussed his policy ideas, the state of the Republican Party, and his thoughts on the 2016 primary field.\n\nSantorum, who is currently serving as CEO of EchoLight Studios, a movie studio focused on faith and family-themed films, cited his professional and personal commitments as reasons for not pursuing another presidential bid. His daughter's health remains a concern, and he is also involved in writing a book about his daughter, who has a genetic disorder.\n\nIn the interview, Santorum emphasized the need for the Republican Party to focus on policies that help working Americans and criticized the libertarian streak within the party. He argued that the GOP will struggle to win elections unless candidates offer solutions for working-class voters.\n\nSantorum's book, \"Blue Collar Conservatives: Recommitting to an America That Works,\" offers policy proposals on energy, education, the economy, and healthcare. The book is part policy paper, part campaign playbook, and part communications advice on connecting with working-class voters.\n\nOne of Santorum's key points is that the Republican Party should not focus solely on business leaders and \"job creators\" but should speak to employees. He argued that anxiety among working-class voters remains high, and Republicans have for too long talked to the top earners and not the workers.\n\nSantorum also criticized the Republican Party for not painting a positive vision for America and for being overly negative in their messaging. He expressed concern that the party is heading toward \"No-ville,\" which he described as a focus on being against things rather than offering a positive vision.\n\nSantorum's book contains incendiary rhetoric that could potentially haunt him should he run again. For example, he writes that poor voters \"took their lie about sex without consequences as gospel\" and calls climate change a \"hyped-up crisis.\"\n\nSantorum's potential 2016 candidacy remains uncertain, and he has not yet indicated a timeline for deciding on a bid. A primary might feature the libertarian wing of the party, led in part by Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas. Santorum's family's support and his daughter's health will be key factors in his decision.",
    " Title: U.S. Officials Adopt Dual Messaging Strategy in Iran Nuclear Talks\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, CNN - The Iran nuclear talks are progressing, but tough issues remain, and a deal may or may not be reached. This ambiguity is a deliberate strategy by the Obama administration to manage expectations and maintain pressure on Iran, according to experts.\n\nU.S. officials are making bold public statements, such as Secretary of State John Kerry's assertion that the U.S. is prepared to leave Iran hanging at the negotiating table if necessary. This messaging is intended to signal to Tehran that it needs to make concessions or risk losing the sanctions relief it has pursued for years.\n\nSen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a key Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, interprets Kerry's words as a determination to send a message to Iran's Supreme Leader: \"The deal that is on the table is the best deal you're going to get. You either need to accept it or we're going to walk away.\"\n\nThe dual messaging strategy also aims to reassure restive members of Congress, who fear that Iran is gaining the upper hand and sticking to its demands while the U.S. caves. By passing the July 9 date set by Congress and entering a 60-day congressional review period instead of the initial 30 days, the administration now has more time to address skepticism and rally votes.\n\nThe coalition of five world powers negotiating alongside the U.S. is already showing signs of strain, with Russia adopting a stance on relaxing sanctions more in line with Iran's. The new Iranian demand that the arms embargo on it be lifted has caused frustration for the U.S. while winning support from Moscow.\n\nOn Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov indicated that his country was backing Iran's bid to lift the arms embargo \"as soon as possible.\" Russia is a top supplier of weapons to Iran.\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey stated this week on Capitol Hill that \"under no circumstances should we relieve pressure on Iran relative to ballistic missile capabilities and arms trafficking.\"\n\nThe talks are extended yet again, and the U.S. needs to keep not just Iran, but its partners, in the negotiations pressing full steam ahead at the negotiating table. The Obama administration's dual messaging strategy is a calculated attempt to influence Iranian decision-making from the outside and manage expectations both at home and abroad.",

The article, titled \"The New David Hogg,\" delves into Hogg's plans to work on a 2020 presidential candidate's campaign and potentially run for Congress in the future.\n\nIn the interview published Sunday, Hogg criticized older Democrats for not relinquishing control to younger generations. \"The reason Republicans are successful right now is because they're empowering young people,\" Hogg told writer Lisa Miller. \"Older Democrats just won't move the f--- off the plate and let us take control. Nancy Pelosi is old.\"\n\nHogg noted that U.S. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan was 45-years-old when he took up the leadership role. Hogg, who is 18, stated that if he could design his future without obstacles, he would go to college in the fall of 2019, read a \"sh--load of books,\" and take some time off in 2020 to work on a presidential campaign.\n\nHogg added that he believes Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will eventually run for the White House successfully. While he expressed admiration for Ocasio-Cortez, Hogg expressed dissatisfaction with the current state of the Democratic Party. \"Sen. Bernie Sanders is a great guy, terrible on guns,\" Hogg said. \"Former President Obama increased drone warfare and killed a lot of civilians.... Honestly, they all kind of suck.\"\n\nThe article also mentions that Hogg and his friends in the March for Our Lives organization plan to spend the next several months meeting more activists and canvasing in advance of the midterm elections. Hogg's seven-year plan includes college in the fall of 2019 and a potential congressional run after college.",

The National Weather Service has warned that the storm is \"extremely dangerous.\"\n\nThe storm is expected to make landfall as early as Thursday evening. Four South Carolina motorways have been diverted one-way to expedite the evacuation process. Georgia, following the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, and Washington DC, has declared a state of emergency.\n\nA National Weather Service forecaster described Florence as \"the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast.\" The storm could bring 20-40 inches (50-100cm) of rain and life-threatening storm surges of up to 13 feet (4 meters). As of Wednesday evening, officials say these surges are now \"highly likely\" as Florence approaches.\n\nThe National Weather Service also predicts \"catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding\" in parts of the Carolinas and Appalachians. Hurricane force winds will extend up to 70 miles from the storm's center, according to meteorologists.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper warned that \"disaster is at the doorstep\" and \"tens of thousands\" of buildings may be flooded. Waves 83 feet (25 meters) tall were recorded at sea on Wednesday morning.\n\nWhile many coastal residents have complied with mandatory evacuation orders, others are choosing to stay and board up their homes. CoreLogic, an analytics firm, estimates that Florence could cause over $170 billion (\u00a3130 billion) of damage and affect nearly 759,000 homes and businesses.\n\nIn 1999, Hurricane Floyd left hundreds of thousands of dead hogs and chickens floating in floodwaters in North Carolina. North Carolina farms are currently moving livestock to safety.\n\nApproximately 1,000 prisoners in South Carolina will not be moved from their cells, despite a mandatory evacuation order in the area. A state department of corrections spokesman stated, \"In the past, it's been safer to leave them there.\"\n\nThere are concerns for wild horse herds in North Carolina's Outer Banks, but experts say these equines can sense bad weather coming and head to higher ground.\n\nUS President Donald Trump warned residents in Florence's path to heed official warnings, stating, \"Get out of its way, don't play games with it.\" European astronaut Alexander Gerst shared images of Florence's eye wall from space, calling the storm a \"no-kidding nightmare.\"\n\nThe relationship between climate change and hurricanes is complex, with warmer seas powering hurricanes and a hotter atmosphere allowing hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas. However, it has been difficult to tease out clear trends from the data due to the many factors contributing to these rare events.\n\nFor more information, contact the BBC at the following numbers or through the provided contact methods.",
    " Title: Clinton Taps into Black Voter Anger over Supreme Court Vacancy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Democratic state representative Stacey Abrams, the House minority leader of Georgia, stated that the upcoming presidential election on November 8th has become more than a mere \"thought exercise.\" Abrams' comments suggest that the vacancy on the Supreme Court could be a crucial issue for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who is relying on nonwhite voters to secure her victory against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nClinton moved quickly on Tuesday to address the anger of black voters over the opposition of Senate Republicans to President Barack Obama's nomination of a replacement for Justice Scalia. In remarks before a predominantly black audience in Harlem, Clinton criticized the Republican senators' stance, stating, \"Now the Republicans say they'll reject anyone President Obama nominates no matter how qualified. Some are even saying he doesn't have the right to nominate anyone!\"\n\nClinton added that this behavior is in keeping with a longstanding pattern of mistreatment. She also accused Republicans of demonizing President Obama and encouraging \"the ugliest impulses of the paranoid fringe.\"\n\nRepublicans have been sensitive about the notion that they are diminishing President Obama because of his race, and several Republican senators, including Mitch McConnell and Tim Scott of South Carolina, declined to comment or were unavailable for comment when approached by the media.\n\nThe suggestion that racism is playing a role in the Senate's handling of the Supreme Court vacancy has angered McConnell's supporters, who point out his formative political experience working for a Republican senator who supported civil rights, his role in overriding President Ronald Reagan's veto of sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa, and his marriage to an Asian-American woman.",
    " Title: U.S. Courts Deliver Opposing Rulings on ACA Subsidies\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo U.S. appeals courts have delivered conflicting rulings on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, with one court striking down subsidies in states that did not establish their own insurance exchanges, and the other upholding subsidies for both state and federal exchanges.\n\nIn a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, a three-judge panel ruled that subsidies are not available for the 36 states that did not set up their own insurance exchanges. The Obama administration has announced its intention to seek a review by the full 11-judge panel, stating that the decision is inconsistent with Congressional intent and at odds with the law's goal of making healthcare affordable for all.\n\nThe ruling has the potential to affect nearly 5 million Americans who signed up for Obamacare through federal exchanges. Losing the subsidies could make health plans sold through the exchange unaffordable for many, potentially leaving millions of U.S. residents uninsured.\n\nIn a separate case heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, a three-judge panel ruled unanimously that the ambiguity in the ACA's language allows for subsidies to be given to both those who signed up using state exchanges and those who used federal exchanges on behalf of states.\n\nThe dispute over ACA subsidies may ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.",
    " Title: Trump's Claim of Total Authority Unconstitutional, Experts Warn\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is currently grappling with two critical emergencies: the coronavirus pandemic and the presidency of Donald Trump. This article will focus on the latter, examining the president's handling of the pandemic response and his assertion of unlimited authority.\n\nDuring a recent news briefing, President Trump claimed, \"When someone is president of the United States, the authority is total. And that's the way it's got to be.\" This statement, made on Twitter by the political podcast \"Pod Save America,\" has sparked controversy and concern among experts, who argue that the president's claim is untrue and unconstitutional.\n\nThe Constitution divides federal authority between the three branches of government, and the 10th Amendment explicitly delegates power to the states. The system is designed so that no person or branch has \"total authority.\" Trump's assertion, if enacted, would undermine the balance of power established by the Constitution.\n\nTrump's performance during the pandemic has been criticized for his slow response and prioritization of his own image over public health. Reports have shown that Trump was slow to take action on the virus, and early discussions were diverted to talk of vaping and accusations towards advisers who warned of the potential need for shutdowns.\n\nThe most troubling part of Trump's Monday performance came when he suggested ordering state governors to ease shelter-at-home rules and re-open their economies. Experts fear that lifting the lockdowns too quickly could lead to a new wave of coronavirus illnesses and deaths.\n\nIn the absence of federal leadership, the nation's governors are devising their own workarounds. Governors from several states, including California, New York, and Massachusetts, are forming partnerships to plan how to re-open their economies.\n\nIn short, the federal government under President Trump is currently unable to perform the tasks expected of it during a national emergency. The president wants all the power, all the credit, and none of the responsibility. The result is a terrifying mix of authoritarianism and fecklessness that threatens American democracy and public health.\n\nVoters should remember not just that Trump mismanaged this deadly pandemic, but that his own behavior constituted a crisis in its own right. The November election will be an opportunity for the American people to decide the direction they want their country to take.",
    " Title: Open Carry Advocates and Public Safety Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent times, the practice of open carry, the act of openly displaying firearms in public, has become a contentious issue in the United States. This article explores the implications of open carry in public places, focusing on instances where open carry enthusiasts have caused apprehension and discomfort among civilians and employees.\n\nIn Georgia, following a new law that allows the open carrying of deadly weapons at all times and in all places, an armed man entered a park where children were playing little league baseball, waving his gun and shouting. The police, upon arrival, found no violation of the law, causing concern among the parents.\n\nSimilarly, after the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, open carry advocates staged demonstrations at Starbucks stores across the country, including in Newtown, Connecticut. No incidents were reported, but the CEO of Starbucks politely requested that these demonstrations not take place in his stores due to employee safety concerns.\n\nRecently, open carry proponents staged a demonstration at a Jack in the Box, causing such fear among employees that they sought refuge in the walk-in freezer. The police, assuming an armed robbery was in progress, responded in force.\n\nOne open carry advocate, Haros, defended the demonstrations, stating, \"We\u2019re not breaking the laws, we\u2019re not here to hurt anybody. We\u2019re not trying to alarm anybody. We\u2019re doing this because it\u2019s our constitutional right.\" Haros believes that open carry helps police, as they cannot be present at all times.\n\nThe article questions the actions of these open carry advocates, suggesting that they are, in essence, acting as self-appointed vigilantes. It argues that while these individuals claim to be exercising their constitutional rights, they are often causing discomfort and fear among the general public, particularly in situations where children are present.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that, in the presence of open carry enthusiasts, the general public may not truly have any rights, as they are often forced to remain polite and avoid confrontation with armed individuals. The article questions the definition of freedom in such situations, suggesting that while open carry advocates may feel free to carry their weapons, the rest of the public may not feel the same level of freedom due to the potential for danger and discomfort.",
    " Title: Romney's Overseas Trip: A Mixed Bag of Successes and Controversies\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney's overseas trip, aimed at showcasing his foreign policy expertise during the election year, has been marked by both substantive highlights and distractions, according to Romney and his top campaign advisers. The Republican candidate's final leg in Poland concluded on Tuesday, with Romney's advisers expressing confidence in the trip's success.\n\nIn a speech at Poland's national library, Romney offered an emotional tribute to the country's journey from the Iron Curtain to the economic envy of Europe. He emphasized the path of freedom trodden by the people of Poland, stating, \"I, and my fellow Americans, are inspired by the path of freedom tread by the people of Poland.\"\n\nHowever, the trip was not without controversy. In Britain, Romney's comments questioning the readiness of London to host the Summer Olympic Games drew criticism, with British Prime Minister David Cameron responding with a not-so-subtle dig at Romney's Games in Salt Lake City. In Israel, Romney's remarks on Jerusalem as the undisputed capital of Israel and his comments on the economic disparity between Israelis and Palestinians inflamed already raw feelings in the region.\n\nDuring the trip, Romney's campaign was also embroiled in a heated exchange with the traveling press. In an incident at the Polish Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Romney's press secretary, Rick Gorka, was reported to have shouted at reporters, \"Kiss my ass. This is a holy site.\" Gorka later apologized for his remarks.\n\nRomney's advisers, including senior adviser Stuart Stevens, have maintained a positive outlook on the trip, with Stevens stating, \"I think it was a great success.\" Stevens added, \"The idea is that, can people get a good sense of who he is? Can people listen and see that this is a person speaking from the heart about Israel and about Poland? And he is.\"\n\nConservative bloggers have also defended Romney, with Powerline blog writer John Hinderaker stating, \"By any reasonable standard, Romney's trip has been successful. Yet press coverage has been unrelentingly negative.\" However, Fox News Channel anchor Greta Van Susteren expressed a different perspective, stating, \"There has been no press access to Governor Romney since we landed in Poland. We (press) are in a holding pattern.\"\n\nUpon returning to the United States, Romney will be greeted by a slew of new ads from his campaign and supporting super PACs, as well as a new mobile app called \"Mitt's VP\" about his vice presidential selection process.",
    " Title: President Trump Calls for Tougher Travel Ban, Criticizes Terrorism Following London Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump called for a \"larger, tougher\" travel ban early Friday in response to the attack at a London subway station, which sent at least 22 people to hospitals. The incident, declared a \"terrorist incident\" by London's Metropolitan Police, was caused by the detonation of an improvised explosive device.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Trump described the perpetrator as a \"loser terrorist\" and emphasized the need for a more aggressive approach to combat terrorism. He stated, \"Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner. The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off & use better!\"\n\nThe president's tweets followed a fire at a London subway station on Friday. The White House later confirmed that Trump spoke with British Prime Minister Theresa May to express his sympathies and prayers for those affected. The statement from the White House indicated that Trump pledged to continue close collaboration with the United Kingdom to combat terrorism and extremism worldwide.\n\nTrump reiterated his stance on political correctness in a series of early morning tweets, advocating for his travel ban and criticizing the Obama Administration's efforts against ISIS. He tweeted, \"The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!\"\n\nIn June, Trump expressed concern over the terror threat in London following an attack on the London Bridge, which resulted in seven deaths and numerous injuries. British Prime Minister May responded to Friday's attack, stating, \"My thoughts are with those injured at Parsons Green and emergency services who are responding bravely to this incident.\"\n\nFormer chief of staff to May, Nick Timothy, criticized Trump's \"loser terrorist\" tweets as \"unhelpful.\" Timothy tweeted, \"True or not\u2014and I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t know\u2014this is so unhelpful from leader of our ally and intelligence partner.\"",
    " Title: New Jersey Allows Illegal Immigrants to Obtain Driver's Licenses, Becoming 14th State to Enact Such Measure\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed a bill on Thursday, allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. This move makes New Jersey the 14th state, along with the District of Columbia, to enact such a measure.\n\nGovernor Murphy stated, \"Expanding access to driver's licenses is critical for the safety of New Jerseyans and a step toward building a stronger and fairer New Jersey for all.\"\n\nThe bill was approved by the Democratic majorities in both the state Assembly and Senate during their final legislative sessions of the year. Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, a Democrat, told The Wall Street Journal, \"The legislation advanced on the Assembly floor and by the Senate today is fair and responsible. It brings us one step closer to ensuring all motor vehicles and drivers are insured, thereby creating safer roadways for all New Jersey residents.\"\n\nThe legislation allows individuals over the age of 16 who are illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and learner's permits. Applicants can use foreign documents such as passports or their old driver's license from their home country to complete the process. A Social Security number is not required, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe law reportedly establishes two types of licenses. One would conform to federal REAL ID requirements and would require proof of legal residency. The second license would only require six points of identification. The applicant would not have to provide proof of U.S. citizenship.\n\nA similar measure known as \"The Green Light Law\" was signed by New York's Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo earlier this year and went into effect this week. It also allows illegal immigrants to obtain a license without having to provide a Social Security number or proof of American citizenship.\n\nThis report includes contributions from Danielle Wallace of Fox News and The Associated Press.",
    " Title: New York Times' Publication of Senator Cotton's Op-Ed Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe publication of Senator Tom Cotton's Op-Ed in The New York Times has sparked controversy, with critics questioning the paper's editorial standards and the motives behind its decision to publish the piece. The editors' note stated that the senator's Op-Ed did not meet the Times' editorial standards.\n\nOne criticism is that the paper could have examined Cotton's views without giving him an unmediated platform. Some argue that his proposal should have been evaluated by the news department, not published uncritically in the Opinion pages. Another point of contention is that his arguments went beyond the moral pale.\n\nHowever, the value of Cotton's Op-Ed does not lie in its goodness or rightness. Instead, it lies in the fact that Cotton is a leading spokesman for a significant current of public opinion. To suggest that readers should not have the opportunity to examine his opinions for themselves is to patronize them, according to the newspaper.\n\nThe most serious criticism is that the publication of the piece puts black lives at risk, including members of the Times' staff. This is a crucial consideration, especially in the current climate, and one about which no responsible publisher can be indifferent. However, it is not the duty of the paper to make people feel safe by refusing to publish a dismaying Op-Ed. Even if one concedes that Cotton's call to send in the troops poses potential risks, it poses those risks whether his call appears in these pages or not.\n\nKnowledge, however unpleasant, is always a source of strength, a belief that lies at the core of our profession. The same goes for any other type of knowledge: having more of it is always a source of strength.",
    " Title: US Imposes New Sanctions on Russia Over Novichok Poisoning Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Russian rouble has plummeted to its lowest level since November 2016, following the United States' announcement of new sanctions in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the UK using the nerve agent Novichok. The dollar-rouble rate reached 66.7 on the Moscow stock exchange, marking a significant drop from Tuesday's rate of 63.4.\n\nThe attack occurred in Salisbury in March, where Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned. Both have since recovered and their current whereabouts are being kept secret. The UK has blamed Russia for the attack, and the UK Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, thanked the US on Thursday for imposing these sanctions.\n\nThe new sanctions, which will take effect on or around August 22, cover exports of sensitive electronic components and other technologies that can have military applications. There will also be some further restrictions on Russian access to US financial services. If Russia fails to provide reliable assurances that it will no longer use chemical weapons and allow on-site inspections by the United Nations, more draconian sanctions, including a far-reaching trade embargo on Russia and a ban on Aeroflot flights to the US, may be imposed within 90 days.\n\nThe US and EU have previously imposed sanctions on dozens of Russian state officials and firms accused of involvement in the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. These sanctions restrict travel and financial transactions.\n\nThe Russian embassy in the US has responded to the new sanctions, stating that it has become \"accustomed to not hearing any facts or evidence\" and that it continues to strongly stand for an open and transparent investigation of the crime committed in Salisbury. The US determination that Russia used chemical or biological weapons against its own nationals is only the third time such a decision has been made, with previous occasions being against Syria and North Korea for the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of leader Kim Jong-un.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has yet to comment on this latest move, which could potentially complicate his efforts to develop a new, warmer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The US and the UK have both stated that relations between Russia and the West have reached a new low following the incident.",
    " Title: Coronavirus Ravages U.S. Prisons and Jails: A Growing Public Health Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe New York Times has reported on the devastating impact of the coronavirus in federal and state prisons across the United States. The Federal Correctional Complex in Oakdale, Louisiana, has become a hotspot for the virus, with seven inmates having died and over 100 inmates and staff members infected.\n\nIn Cook County Jail, the largest in the country, four inmates have died, and 215 have tested positive. Over 190 correctional officers and 34 other sheriff's office employees have also tested positive. The situation in Ohio prisons is equally dire, with 2,300 prisoners in three prisons testing positive.\n\nPrisons and jails, due to their overpopulation and the impossibility of social distancing, are becoming breeding grounds for the virus. Inmates, many of whom have pre-existing health conditions, are particularly vulnerable. Correctional officers, their families, and the communities where they live are also at risk.\n\nIn response, some facilities have taken measures such as reducing their population, providing soap and disinfectants, isolating those with symptoms, and increasing cleaning frequencies. However, testing remains inadequate, putting both prisoners and corrections officers at risk.\n\nPrison uprisings have begun as inmates demand protection and more information. Corrections officers have joined in lawsuits to secure adequate protective equipment, information, and testing.\n\nTo address this growing crisis, it is crucial for prison officials to speed the release of nonviolent offenders, the elderly, and the vulnerable. Universal testing is an imperative. Prisoners need more access to soap and water, and both prisoners and corrections officials need protective gear and information on how to protect themselves.\n\nThe U.S. incarcerates more people than any other country, including China. Prisoners are disproportionately poor and people of color, often victims of institutionalized racism. The pandemic is turning incarceration into a potential death sentence, further exposing the moral outrage of the U.S. prison system.",
    " Title: Rep. John Conyers Settles Sexual Harassment Complaint, Acknowledges Payment to Former Staffer\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a reversal of his earlier denial, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), the longest-serving House member, admitted Tuesday that he settled a sexual harassment complaint with a former staffer who reportedly claimed she was fired for rejecting his advances.\n\nInitially, Conyers told the Associated Press on Tuesday that he had not settled any such harassment complaints. The AP also reported that Conyers, when confronted at his Detroit home, said he knew nothing about claims of inappropriate touching, all of which were made in an extensive BuzzFeed article.\n\nConyers' office issued a detailed clarification Tuesday afternoon, acknowledging the complaint was real, though the lawmaker adamantly denied the underlying claims.\n\n\"The Associated Press made an unannounced visit to the home of Congressman Conyers this morning,\" a spokesperson for Conyers said Tuesday. \"Congressman Conyers was under the impression the reporter was speaking of recent allegations of which he was unaware of and denied.\"\n\nConyers said he has been a \"fierce advocate for equality in the workplace\" and supports the rights of his employees, but noted that it was \"important to recognize that the mere making of an allegation does not mean it is true.\"\n\n\"In this case, I expressly and vehemently denied the allegations made against me and continue to do so,\" Conyers said, adding that his office resolved the allegations. \"That should not be lost in the narrative. The resolution was not for millions of dollars, but rather for an amount that equated to a reasonable severance payment.\"\n\nConyers added that he would \"fully cooperate with an investigation,\" once the House determines the \"extent\" they will look at \"these issues.\"\n\nThe allegations against Conyers amounted to yet another bombshell rocking Capitol Hill. In documents obtained by BuzzFeed News, several former staff members reportedly accused Conyers of requesting sexual favors, rubbing their hands sexually, and rubbing their legs and backs.\n\nThe woman who complained about her firing reportedly claimed she was dismissed because she did not \"succumb to [his] sexual advances.\" She reportedly believed she had no other option than to remain quiet and take the settlement in 2015.\n\nHer identity remains anonymous reportedly due to fears of retribution. Conyers, 88, has served in the House for decades. He was active in the civil-rights movement and helped found the Congressional Black Caucus; he's now the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) called the report \"extremely troubling\" in a statement released Tuesday. He noted he already had directed \"the Committee on House Administration to conduct a full review of all policies and procedures related to workplace harassment and discrimination.\"\n\nAccording to BuzzFeed News, the Congressional Office of Compliance did not confirm or deny dealing with the case.\n\n\"Pursuant to the Congressional Accountability Act, the OOC can not comment on whether matters have or have not been filed with the office,\" Laura Cech, publications and outreach manager at the Office of Compliance, told BuzzFeed.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she was not aware of the reported settlement involving Conyers.\n\n\"No,\" Pelosi told Fox News in a statement. \"The current process includes the signing of non-disclosure agreements by the parties involved.\"\n\nPelosi pointed to new legislation put forth by Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier which the Democratic leader said would provide \"much-needed transparency on these agreements\" and make \"other critical reforms.\"\n\nThe report said the woman who settled with Conyers ended up with a confidentiality agreement in exchange for a roughly $27,000 settlement\u2014which reportedly came from Conyers' office budget as opposed to a massive fund that has been used to settle hundreds of cases with federal employees.\n\nChairman of the Michigan Democratic Party Brandon Dillon said in a statement Tuesday that the allegations against Conyers are \"incredibly serious and disheartening to learn,\" but also said that media reports of the case also \"point to other troubling allegations of misconduct, including the potential misuse of congressional resources.\"\n\n\"That is why we are calling for a full investigation by the House Ethics Committee into all of the allegations against Mr. Conyers, and we urge the Speaker to order a full-scale inquiry into the abuse of authority that has pervaded the halls of power in Washington, along with state capitols across the country, for far too long,\" Dillon said.\n\nThe revelations about Conyers\u2019 alleged conduct are just the latest in a series of allegations shaking the halls of Capitol Hill in recent days. Last week, a TV and Radio broadcast host based in California, LeeAnn Tweeden, accused Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) of groping and kissing her without her consent. On Monday, a second woman, Lindsay Menz, accused Franken of groping her in 2010 while they took a photo together.\n\nAnd Senate Republican candidate Roy Moore in Alabama is battling multiple allegations. The woman whose account started the controversy spoke Monday to NBC's \"Today\" show, and said she was \"absolutely not\" paid to go public. Leigh Corfman claims Moore had sexual contact with her when she was 14 and he was in his 30's. Moore has denied the allegations against him.",

The 80-year-old politician is recovering at home and is reported to be in \"good spirits.\"\n\nThe senator underwent surgery at a clinic in Phoenix, Arizona, last Friday to remove a blood clot from above his left eye. Tissue analysis revealed that the clot was associated with a primary brain tumor known as glioblastoma. A statement from the Mayo Clinic said, \"The senator's doctors say he is recovering from his surgery 'amazingly well' and his underlying health is excellent.\"\n\nTreatment options may include a combination of chemotherapy and radiation, according to the statement. Senior Republicans and Democrats have wished him a speedy recovery, prompting McCain to tweet his thanks and a warning: \"I greatly appreciate the outpouring of support - unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress, I'll be back soon, so stand-by!\"\n\nJohn McCain is known in Washington as a tough, independent-minded senator. He earned his reputation as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, where he was held for more than five years, including two in solitary confinement. During the most recent presidential election campaign, Donald Trump belittled the senator as \"not a war hero,\" saying \"I like people who weren't captured.\"\n\nMcCain may have annoyed many Republicans by arguing for reforms to campaign finance and immigration laws. He may have irritated opponents of America's many wars with his forceful arguments in favor of the projection of US military might.\n\nGlioblastoma is a tumor that affects more men than women and increases in frequency with age. McCain, who is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, is reported to be in \"good spirits as he continues to recover at home with his family.\" His family reacted with \"shock\" to the news, his 32-year-old daughter Meghan said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said McCain had \"always been a fighter\" and, in a statement, said: \"Get well soon.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said McCain was a \"hero to our country.\" \"He has never shied from a fight, and I know that he will face this challenge with the same extraordinary courage that has characterized his life,\" he said on Twitter.

    " Title: Army Warns of Potential Impact of Sequestration on Ground Forces\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Army has issued an internal memo urging active and retired generals to advocate against potential future automatic budget cuts, known as sequestration, as they could significantly impact the Army's ground forces. According to the memo, written by Maj. Gen. Laura Richardson, the Army may become \"hollow\" if relief from sequestration is not granted.\n\nThe budget caps, or sequestration, are currently suspended under a bipartisan budget deal but could resume in fiscal 2016, beginning on October 1, unless an agreement is reached. General Raymond T. Odierno, the Army Chief of Staff and former top commander in Iraq, is reportedly one of the military leaders most vocal about the potential consequences of another round of sequestration.\n\nThe active-duty soldier force peaked at 570,000 during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and is scheduled to shrink to approximately 450,000. However, sequestration poses a threat to further reduce the active force to 420,000, according to General Odierno. He asserts that the 450,000 level is the absolute minimum the active force can be while still fulfilling its strategic responsibilities.\n\nMaj. Gen. Richardson, the Chief of Army Legislative Affairs, wrote in the memo that caps on defense spending are having a detrimental effect on the Army, damaging readiness, reducing manpower, and cutting modernization programs. The memo, obtained by The \u2588\u2588\u2588, states that General Odierno wants all Army general officers to be aware of the impacts of sequestration so they are prepared to discuss the matter with members of Congress and their staff during their engagements.\n\nRecent deployments demonstrate a busy U.S. Army, with forces sent to Europe for war games as a warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a headquarters element deployed to Baghdad to advise the Iraqi Security Forces, soldiers inserted into West Africa to help combat the spread of the Ebola virus, and ground units maintained in Afghanistan.\n\nGeneral Odierno recently told a group of defense reporters that the Army may need to operate with smaller capabilities on four different continents simultaneously due to the evolving nature of the world. In an interview, he stated that further budget cuts would take the Army to a \"breaking point.\" He added that he would have to further reduce purchases of weapons systems needed to modernize a war-weary force.\n\n\"As I look at that,\" he said, \"it's end strength, it's modernization, it's readiness. I can't go any faster on end strength, so that means you have to take further reductions in readiness and modernization.\"",
    " Title: Gun-Violence Prevention Organizations Launch Voting Rights Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nThe gun-violence prevention organizations March For Our Lives, Brady, and Team Enough have launched a joint campaign on Wednesday, focusing on voting rights in an effort to highlight the link between gun violence prevention and democracy. The groups are releasing a report titled \"Accessing Democracy: A Gun Violence Issue,\" which focuses on four categories: voting by mail and absentee voting, voter registration, early voting, and restoration of voting rights.\n\nThe report, \"Accessing Democracy,\" emphasizes the historical marginalization of communities that bear the brunt of gun violence in the democratic process. The report reads, \"These communities have been deprived of the avenues of direct democracy most necessary for citizens to have agency in their own future -- their right to vote.\"\n\nThe campaign will distribute the report and tool kits to hundreds of March For Our Lives, Brady, and Team Enough chapters, as well as the groups' network of other gun-violence prevention organizations. The tool kits will provide information on polling locations, voter registration, vote-by-mail and absentee voting laws, early voting options, and the status of voting rights for citizens with misdemeanor or felony records.\n\nThe tool kits also offer \"action plans\" for the states, providing citizens with contact information for their representatives and suggesting actions such as mailing ballots to eligible voters, extending in-person early voting, repealing voter ID laws, and supplying personal protective equipment to poll workers.\n\nThe campaign, titled Voting Access Saves Lives, comes amid protests and calls for racial justice following the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in Minnesota after an officer knelt on his neck. The groups emphasize that while gun violence disproportionately affects Black communities, voting rights are often suppressed within those communities as well.\n\nThe coalition believes there is a discrepancy between what Americans want and what they get when it comes to policy, in part because of a flawed electoral system and voter suppression. For example, a majority of people support background checks for private gun sales and sales at gun shows, according to the Pew Research Center. However, a bill that would require background checks for all firearms sales, which passed in the House last year, has stalled in the Senate.\n\nThe Voting Access Saves Lives coalition says it is committed to ensuring that communities are able to vote for elected officials who represent them and their beliefs in free and fair elections. \"The reality for our cause is that unless we ensure that we truly have free and fair elections, much of the work that we're trying to do will remain stalled in certain places,\" said Kris Brown, President of Brady.\n\nThrough calling for the restoration of voting rights, the coalition aims to make sure all citizens can participate in the electoral process. Maxwell Frost, national organizing director for March For Our Lives, expressed his excitement about the campaign, stating, \"I'm really excited about this campaign personally because it's specific actions that are going to be helping different communities, you know, specifically the Black community, which is obviously the centerpiece of a national and international movement right now.\"\n\nFrost noted that former felons are among those who historically have had their voting rights suppressed. His own experience with the issue came while he was in Florida working for the American Civil Liberties Union during the campaign for a constitutional amendment that would restore voting rights for most previously convicted felons. The amendment passed in November 2018. Before then, more than 1 in 5 Black adults in the state could not vote.",
    " Title: NHTSA Vehicle Safety Ratings Show Increasing Trend Toward Higher Safety Scores\n\nArticle:\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has been providing safety ratings for new vehicles since 1978, evaluating crash protection and rollover safety. The agency awards up to five stars to vehicles based on various safety measures. High ratings can serve as a significant government seal of approval for automakers.\n\nAn analysis by The Times, using data from car-shopping and research site Edmunds.com, shows that almost every model has received high marks. From 2001 to 2010, 87% of all safety ratings awarded through the program were four or five stars.\n\nJohn O' Dell, a senior editor and vehicle safety expert at Edmunds.com, stated that automakers have become adept at meeting NHTSA's requirements over the years, designing their cars to perform well in the ratings. For instance, the agency tests a vehicle's ability to withstand a rollover accident, an area that automakers have focused on improving.\n\nIn 2011, the agency introduced new standards to make it more challenging to score high and added an overall safety rating. \"The program raised the safety bar by implementing more stringent crash tests, making it harder for vehicles to achieve the top ratings of five stars,\" the agency noted in a request for increased funding for the ratings program.\n\nHowever, the ratings have continued to improve since then, according to The Times' analysis. From 2011 to the present, 92% of the overall safety ratings were four or five-star ratings. The percentage of four and five-star overall ratings increased each year, from 83% for 2011 models to 96% for 2015 models.\n\nJack Gillis, a former NHTSA official involved in early efforts to develop a ratings program at the agency and now a publisher of an independent rating, expressed a different view. He stated, \"The government would have the opportunity to dramatically stimulate competition if they were to present this information on a more relative basis.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Addresses National Security Agency Surveillance Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a candid interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on Friday, President Barack Obama acknowledged concerns over the National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance programs, stating that the rapid advancement of technology could potentially outpace the legal protections in place.\n\n\"There are legitimate concerns that technology is moving so quickly that, at some point, does the technology outpace the laws that are in place and the protections that are in place?\" Mr. Obama questioned. He further added, \"Do some of these [surveillance] systems end up being like a loaded gun out there that somebody at some future point could abuse?\"\n\nDuring the two-day bus tour through upstate New York and Pennsylvania, the president also conceded that the American public remains skeptical of the government's assurances that it is not monitoring citizens' phone calls and emails. This skepticism has been fueled by recent disclosures that the NSA looked at as many as 56,000 communications of Americans over a three-year period, despite no connection to terrorism.\n\n\"This can only work if the American people trust what's going on,\" Mr. Obama said. \"People don't have enough information and aren't confident enough that between all of the safeguards and checks we put in place in the executive branch, and the federal court oversight, and the congressional oversight, people are still concerned that their emails are being read...\"\n\nThe president expressed confidence that the NSA surveillance programs are not being abused at the current moment. The NSA programs were first revealed by Edward Snowden, a former federal contractor who was granted asylum in Russia and is charged by the Justice Department with espionage and other offenses. Snowden is viewed by many civil liberties activists as a hero for exposing the extent of government surveillance on its own people.",
    " Title: Obama Defends Bergdahl Deal, Claims Consultation with Congress on Prisoner Swap\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama defended his administration's efforts to rescue Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from captivity during a press conference in Warsaw, Poland, on Tuesday, stating that the primary objective was to bring an American soldier home. Obama argued that the U.S. has a \"sacred rule\" not to leave its service members behind, a policy that dates back to the earliest days of the nation.\n\nThough some members of Congress have expressed dismay about the lack of 30-day advance notice for the prisoner swap with the Taliban, Obama asserted that his administration had been consulting with lawmakers \"for some time\" and had made clear that it might have to take quick action. However, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) disputed this assertion, stating that Congress had not heard from the Obama administration since 2011 on the possibility of a prisoner swap with the Taliban.\n\nThe White House did not inform lawmakers of the deal until after it had been executed, and the formal notification did not occur until Monday, two days after Obama announced the successful rescue in the Rose Garden of the White House with Bergdahl's parents present.\n\nObama argued that his administration acted appropriately to bring Bergdahl home, seizing an opportunity when the Qataris offered to facilitate an exchange. He emphasized that the administration did not want to miss the opportunity due to concerns about Bergdahl's health.\n\nBergdahl has faced criticism from some of his fellow soldiers who served with him in Afghanistan, who allege that he deserted by walking off his base unarmed in 2009 after expressing concerns about the U.S. mission against the Taliban. Obama acknowledged that there are questions surrounding the circumstances that led to Bergdahl's capture, but stated that the immediate focus is on helping the soldier recover from the stresses of his captivity.\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey wrote on Facebook early Tuesday that any concerns about Bergdahl's conduct are separate from efforts to recover any U.S. service member in enemy captivity. Dempsey added that \"like any American, [Bergdahl] is innocent until proven guilty\" and that the Army will not ignore misconduct if it occurred.\n\nWhen asked whether Bergdahl will face questioning and possibly a court martial for desertion, Obama stated that such discussions are premature, as the immediate priority is ensuring a successful transition for Bergdahl after five years of captivity.\n\nObama also addressed concerns that the release of five members of the Taliban, who had been detained for years at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, poses a threat to U.S. national security. He stated that their release was conditioned on the Qataris monitoring their activities and that the U.S. would be keeping eyes on them. Obama acknowledged that there is a risk of recidivism among released prisoners from Guantanamo, but expressed confidence that the U.S. would be able to take action if the released Taliban members engage in activities that threaten U.S. defenses.",
    " Title: NSA Director Opposes Proposed U.S.-Russia Cyber Security Working Group\n\nArticle:\n\nNational Security Agency (NSA) Director Mike Rogers has expressed opposition to the idea of establishing a U.S.-Russia cyber security working group, a proposal that has been met with skepticism by several senior U.S. lawmakers. The proposal, which was initially indicated as a possibility by President Donald Trump, appears to have been retracted following widespread criticism.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by hacking Democratic emails and distributing online propaganda to support Trump's campaign over his rival, Hillary Clinton. Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump has stated that his campaign did not collude with Russia.\n\nThis week, a Russian presidential envoy reported that discussions were underway between Moscow and Washington to create a joint cyber security working group. In response to a question about the feasibility of setting up a cyber security cell with the Russians, Rogers, speaking at the annual Aspen Security Forum, stated, \"I'm not a policy guy here... I would argue now is probably not the best time to be doing this.\"\n\nTrump mentioned the idea of creating such a group during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg earlier this month. Senior Republicans have criticized the idea, stating that Russia cannot be trusted, and Trump later appeared to back away from the proposal, tweeting, \"The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't.\"\n\nThe widespread concern and confusion about the possible cyber working group reflects the Trump administration's struggles to articulate a clear approach to international cyber security issues due to inconsistent statements by the president and ongoing personnel changes. Rogers suggested that such a unit could be a possibility if there were changes in Russia's behavior.",
    " Title: U.S. and Allies Seize Opportunity to Target Islamic State in Kobani, Acknowledge Long-Term Campaign Against ISIS\n\nArticle:\n\nMilitary and White House officials have stated that the ongoing fighting in the Syrian border town of Kobani has created a favorable situation for taking out large numbers of Islamic State (IS) fighters congregating in the area. Army Gen. Lloyd Austin, head of U.S. Central Command, claimed on Friday that the enemy is pouring manpower into Kobani, making it a target-rich environment for American and coalition air strikes.\n\nWhile touting the opportunity to take out a significant number of targets in Kobani, military officials have cautioned against expecting quick progress in the overall campaign against ISIS. Austin stated that the campaign to destroy ISIL will take time, and there will be occasional setbacks along the way, particularly in the early stages of the campaign as U.S. forces coach and mentor Iraqi forces that are actively working to regenerate capability after years of neglect and poor leadership.\n\nIn addition to Kobani, the U.S. military is also focusing on other regions, such as Anbar province in Iraq, where the militants have made recent gains. Austin expressed optimism that the Iraqi government will successfully enlist the support of Sunni tribal leaders in Anbar to turn the tide in that important region. He also stated that there is no imminent threat to the international airport west of Baghdad, where U.S. Apache helicopters are monitoring Islamic State efforts to make inroads on the capital.\n\nAs an example of fresh progress, Austin mentioned that Iraqi soldiers attacked north from Baghdad to Beiji, home to Iraq's largest oil refinery, on Friday. However, the militants are making gains in some parts, such as the Sunni-dominated Anbar province, even as they stall or retrench in other areas. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby stated that Baghdad is not believed to be in imminent danger of falling but is \"certainly in their sights.\"\n\nThe Pentagon is preparing to set up a more formally organized command structure, known as a joint task force, to lead and coordinate the campaign from a forward headquarters, possibly in Kuwait. On Wednesday, it formally named the campaign \"Operation Inherent Resolve.\" As of Thursday, the U.S. had launched nearly 300 airstrikes in Iraq and nearly 200 in Syria, and allies had tallied fewer than 100, according to Central Command. These figures do not capture the full scope of the effort because many airstrikes launch multiple bombs on multiple targets. Central Command stated that as of Wednesday, U.S. and partner-nation air forces had dropped nearly 1,400 munitions.",
    " Title: Russian An-148 Plane Crashes Near Moscow, Killing All 71 On Board\n\nArticle:\n\nA Russian An-148 regional jet, belonging to Saratov Airlines, crashed minutes after takeoff from Domodedovo Airport in Moscow on Sunday, resulting in the death of all 71 passengers and crew members on board, according to officials. The plane was en route to Orsk, approximately 1,000 miles southeast of Moscow, as reported by REN-TV.\n\nThe Moscow Inter-Regional Transport Prosecutor's Office confirmed the fatalities in a statement to Interfax, stating, \"The plane was carrying 65 passengers and six crewmembers. All of them died.\" Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov added, \"Judging by everything, no one has survived this crash.\"\n\nAuthorities have recovered a black box from the crash site, and the area has been cordoned off, as reported by regional head of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, Sergei Poletykin, in a conference call. \"One recorder was found at the crash site,\" Poletykin said.\n\nThe crew of the doomed aircraft did not report any malfunctions, according to Svetlana Petrenko, an official representative of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, who told Interfax, \"At the moment it has been established that there have been no reports of aircraft failure from the crew.\"\n\nAll passengers aboard the airliner are believed to have been residents of the Orenburg region, along the border with Kazakhstan, according to Interfax news agency and regional governor spokesman Sergei Sheremetsinsky.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin postponed a planned trip to Sochi to closely monitor the investigation and offered his condolences to the families of those killed. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated, \"The president expresses deep condolences to all those who lost their relatives and friends in this disaster.\"\n\nPutin was to meet Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas on Monday in the Black Sea resort where the president has an official residence. Instead, Abbas will meet with Putin in Moscow in the latter part of Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies.\n\nFragments of the jet were found in the Ramenskoye area, about 25 miles from the airport, according to REN-TV. No on-ground casualties were reported. The flight took off from Moscow's Domodedovo Airport and spent about 5 minutes in the air before a signal was lost about 12 miles southeast of the airport, according to Flightradar24, a flight-tracking website.\n\nThe cause of the crash remains unclear, with weather conditions and pilot error being among the possible reasons. Russia's Investigative Committee is looking into all possible crash causes. The An-148 jet was developed by Ukraine's Antonov company in the early 2000s and was manufactured in both Ukraine and Russia.\n\nThe plane had been flying since 2010, with a two-year break due to a shortage of parts, according to Russia's state news agency Tass. The jet was ordered by Rossiya Airlines, a subsidiary of Aeroflot, but was put into storage during 2015-2017 because of a lack of parts. Tass reports it re-entered service for Saratov Airlines in February 2017.\n\nShabby equipment and poor supervision had plagued Russian civil aviation for years after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, but its safety record has improved markedly in recent years. The last large-scale crash in Russia occurred on Dec. 25, 2016, when a Tu-154 operated by the Russian Defense Ministry on its way to Syria crashed into the Black Sea minutes after takeoff from the southern Russian city of Sochi. All 92 people on board were killed. In March 2016, a Boeing 737-800 flown by FlyDubai crashed while landing at Rostov-on-Don, killing all 62 people aboard. An onboard bomb destroyed a Russian Metrojet airliner soon after taking off from Egypt's Sharm al-Sheikh resort, killing 224 people in October 2015.",
    " Title: Former FEMA Director James Lee Witt Considering Run for Arkansas House Seat Amid GOP Troubles Boosting Democratic Recruitment\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing fiscal crises in the United States have provided a boost to Democratic candidate recruitment efforts for the 2014 midterm elections, with more than a dozen blue-chip Democratic candidates now considering or announcing their intention to run in top-tier races.\n\nIn Arkansas, former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director James Lee Witt is looking at running for the seat being vacated by Republican Rep. Tom Cotton. Witt served as the director of FEMA under former President Bill Clinton.\n\nIn Nebraska, Omaha city councilman Pete Festersen, who previously declined to run against GOP Rep. Lee Terry, is now considering a challenge after Terry came under fire for his response to a question about accepting pay during the government shutdown. National Democrats see Festersen as a pro-business moderate who could give the party a shot in the Republican-friendly 2nd Congressional District.\n\nSimilarly, in New Jersey, attorney Bill Hughes Jr., the son of a popular former congressman, is likely to run against longtime GOP Rep. Frank LoBiondo after watching the budget drama unfold. In Indiana, University of Notre Dame official Joe Bock, who had been hesitant about running, recently announced that he will most likely run.\n\nSome of the Democratic recruits have statewide or national profiles. In Florida, Alex Sink, the state's former chief financial officer who narrowly lost a bid for governor in 2010, is considering running for a seat in the St. Petersburg area.\n\nRepublicans are quick to point out that strong recruits are not a guarantee of success in red districts. However, in an election that has given Democrats little reason for hope, the new recruits provide at least a glimmer. The combination of redistricting and demographics has limited the number of competitive seats in 2014, giving Democrats few opportunities to chip away at the GOP's 17-seat majority.\n\nThe shutdown and debt ceiling standoff have prodded candidates who had been on the fence or inclined not to run to jump in. National Democratic Congressional Committee chairman Rep. Steve Israel said the fiscal debate has unquestionably hurt the GOP brand, but it's unclear how lasting the damage will be and whether voters will even care a year from now.",
    " Title: Attorney General Sessions Denies Communication with Russians, but New Report Suggests Otherwise\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions, under oath at his confirmation hearing, stated that he did not communicate with Russians during the 2016 campaign. However, a new report by Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima, and Greg Miller for the Washington Post claims that Sessions did speak with the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak.\n\nAccording to the report, Justice Department officials told the Post that Sessions spoke with Kislyak twice, including, as reported, \"at the height of what U.S. intelligence officials say was a Russian cyber campaign to upend the U.S. presidential race.\" This contradicts Sessions' testimony at his January confirmation hearing, where he was asked by Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, about any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government during the 2016 campaign. Sessions responded, \"I'm not aware of any of those activities.\"\n\nThe Washington Post report suggests that Sessions' contact with Kislyak, even as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee at the time, was unusual. Among the 20 (of 26) members of the committee who responded to the Post, none of them met with Russia's ambassador last year.\n\nThe blockbuster report is the latest in a string of controversies surrounding the Trump administration's ties to Russia. Last month, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was forced to resign after it was revealed that he talked to Kislyak in December and may have suggested that Trump would lift sanctions against Russia\u2014a potential violation of the Logan Act, which bans people outside the executive branch from making foreign policy on behalf of the U.S. administration. (Flynn and Trump were not in office at the time of the call.)\n\nDemocrats responded to the report by calling on Sessions to recuse himself from any investigation into Trump's ties to the Justice Department. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called on Sessions to resign, stating, \"After lying under oath to Congress about his own communications with the Russians, the attorney general must resign. Sessions is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country and must resign. There must be an independent, bipartisan, outside commission to investigate the Trump political, personal, and financial connections to the Russians.\"\n\nFor more on the growing Trump-Russia scandal, read [publication's explainer].",
    " Title: Trump's Response to Florida School Shooting: A Look at the Current State of Gun Control Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the mass shooting at a Florida school that left 17 dead, there has been a renewed push for gun law reform, with students who survived the tragedy leading the charge. Over the weekend, several major corporations, including Delta Air Lines, United, and Avis Budget Group, cut ties with the National Rifle Association (NRA). A CNN/SSRS poll showed that 70% of Americans want tougher regulation of firearms.\n\nHowever, as lawmakers returned to Washington this week, the political landscape appeared to revert to business as usual, with a push for new regulation and strengthened background checks losing momentum. The political realities surrounding the Second Amendment remain as entrenched as ever, and the passage of significant gun laws becomes less likely the more time passes without action.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has promised to \"turn our grief into action,\" pledging to outlaw bump fire stocks and to \"harden\" U.S. schools to protect them from shooters. He has also expressed support for \"strong\" background checks to prevent \"sickos\" from obtaining guns. However, his actions and statements have been met with skepticism, as it remains unclear whether he will offer the leadership necessary to push significant gun control measures through Congress.\n\nTrump has reportedly been considering expanding background checks to gun show sales and making them more efficient, as well as including private transactions. He has also suggested raising the age at which someone can buy a long gun from 18 to 21, but has since stopped discussing this idea in public.\n\nGiven the lack of details from Trump and the sometimes contradictory nature of his remarks, it remains unclear whether he is poised to offer the kind of leadership that would grant his fellow Republicans political cover to push significant gun control measures through Congress. Some Republicans have expressed skepticism about measures such as raising the age for purchasing long guns and banning bump stocks.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for more action, but has given no indication that he is ready to expose his fellow senators to tough votes on measures that would ban assault-style weapons, a plan backed by some more liberal members of the Senate. Some Republicans have signaled that measures such as raising the required age for purchasing long guns and banning bump stocks are unlikely to pass.\n\nSenators Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) have attempted to forge a path forward for their bill on universal background checks, which failed to pass in 2013 after the Sandy Hook school massacre. Manchin expressed hope that the presence of a Republican in the White House could reassure some GOP lawmakers. \"The reason we were not able to get the support we needed was because they were afraid President Obama would go further,\" Manchin said. \"Well, they're not having that fear with President Trump,\" he added. \"It's really up to him.\"",
    " Title: Hong Kong Government Withdraws Extradition Bill, Protesters Call It \"Too Little, Too Late\"\n\nArticle:\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced on Wednesday the government's decision to fully withdraw the controversial extradition bill from the legislature, addressing one of the five demands protesters have been advocating for since June. The bill, which would have allowed the Communist Party of China to extradite individuals accused of violating communist \"crimes\" into the Chinese prison system, has sparked widespread fear among Hong Kong residents due to China's reputation for human rights violations, including political imprisonment, forced organ harvesting, and severe restrictions on free speech and religious activity.\n\nIn her public address, Lam stated that the Legislative Council would fully withdraw the bill \"in order to fully allay public concerns.\" She also acknowledged the violence that has engulfed the city, primarily due to police actions, and lamented the disruptions to daily life caused by the protests.\n\nIn addition to withdrawing the bill, Lam announced modifications to the membership of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), a move that addresses one of the remaining four demands for an independent inquiry on police brutality. However, concerns remain that the police will exonerate themselves of human rights crimes if they conduct the investigation.\n\nThe Global Times, a Chinese regime propaganda outlet, cautioned against interpreting Lam's moves as a concession, warning that radical forces should not view it as a victory in matters related to the \"one country, two systems\" principle that governs Hong Kong and China's sovereignty.\n\nThe protesters' five demands include the withdrawal of the extradition bill, an independent inquiry on police brutality, freedom for political prisoners, direct election of lawmakers, and an apology for labeling the June 12 protest a \"riot.\" Currently, Hong Kong residents can elect only half of lawmakers in the Legislative Council, while the others are appointed by a small group of special interests representatives controlled by China. Similarly, only 1,200 Hong Kong residents, part of a special committee, can vote for their chief executive, and even then only among a list of candidates handpicked by China.\n\nPrior to Wednesday, Lam had refused to withdraw the extradition bill, stating that legislators had tabled it and declaring it \"dead\" in July. However, tabling a bill keeps it alive and allows lawmakers to revive it at any time. Protest movement leaders have criticized Lam for using the term \"dead,\" arguing that it is not a legal term for a bill and that she gave no guarantees lawmakers would not bring it back to life.\n\nThe announcement follows the destruction of the Legislative Council floor and much of the building it uses as its headquarters. Protesters meticulously destroyed all the technology and every facility used to pass laws, but left historical documents, the building's cafeteria, and other irrelevant areas untouched.\n\nLam's concession comes after the publication of a bombshell report this week by Reuters, revealing audio of the chief executive saying she would like to resign from the post but is not allowed. In the audio, Lam expressed regret for causing \"huge havoc\" to Hong Kong and expressed a desire to step down and make a deep apology. However, the Global Times called the Reuters report \"fake\" without elaborating.\n\nProtest leaders have called Lam's withdrawal of the bill \"too little and too late,\" insisting they will continue their struggle for freedom from China.",

For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!\"\n\nChung led a 10-member South Korean delegation to Pyongyang for the two-day visit. North Korea is reportedly ready to have \"heart-to-heart\" talks with the U.S. about its potential denuclearization and normalization of relations between the countries.\n\nThe North and South Korean leaders have agreed to hold summit talks in April at the border, and to establish a \"hotline\" communication channel to lower military tensions. The two Koreas also agreed to cooperate in various areas, including sports, culture, and exchanges.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson, however, called for countries to further isolate North Korea despite the Hermit Kingdom's offer to discuss denuclearization. Tillerson stated that North Korea poses a threat to the global community through its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs and proliferation activities.\n\nThe recent thaw in relations between North and South Korea follows the Pyeongchang Olympics, during which North Korea sent a delegation of athletes, cheerleaders, art troupe members, and officials to Pyeongchang. Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo Jong, attended the opening ceremony and met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in over a three-day visit.\n\nKim Yo Jong wrote of her \"wishes\" for closer ties in a guest book at South Korea's presidential office, stating, \"I expect Pyongyang and Seoul to get closer in the hearts of our [ Korean ] people and the future of unification and prosperity will be advanced.\" However, the \"future of unification\" phrase is seen as a threat by some, as North Korea has touted unification as a \"final victory\" to the Korean War that ended in an armistice in 1953.\n\nKim Jong Un's apparent olive branch to South Korea and the U.S. comes after months of mounting sanctions against the volatile regime. Some analysts believe that the North Korean regime is scrambling to keep its economy afloat due to the crippling effects of international sanctions. According to a South Korean lawmaker, North Korea's hard currency is expected to run dry by October.",

In an interview on the podcast \"Campaign HQ,\" Clinton had implied that Gabbard was being supported by Russian sites, bots, and other means.\n\nWhile Clinton did not mention Gabbard by name, her comments were widely interpreted as a reference to the Hawaii congresswoman, who has repeatedly denied accusations of being a Russian asset. In a series of tweets, Gabbard directly addressed Clinton, calling her the \"embodiment of corruption\" among the Democratic Party establishment.\n\n\"From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation,\" Gabbard tweeted. \"We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know \u2014 it was always you.\"\n\nGabbard challenged Clinton to \"join the race directly\" if she was going to attack her. \"It\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly,\" she added.\n\nGabbard, a member of the Hawaii National Guard and an Iraq War veteran, has faced ongoing concern from political observers that her campaign is being amplified by Russian bots and online trolls. She has raised eyebrows with her anti-establishment foreign policy positions, especially her accusation that the U.S. engages in regime-change wars and her meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad in 2017.\n\nGabbard's tweeted attack on Clinton left fellow Democratic 2020 candidate Sen. Cory Booker speechless. According to the RealClearPolitics polling average, Gabbard is polling at 1.2 percent nationally, making her one of the lower-tier candidates to make this week's primary debate in Ohio.",
    " Title: Iran Denies Reports of Downing Civilian Plane, Invites International Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIranian officials have denied reports from American and European intelligence agencies that Iran shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, which was en route from Tehran to Kyiv on Friday. The denial comes after U.S. officials claimed the plane was hit by an anti-aircraft missile battery.\n\nPresident Donald Trump suggested on Thursday that the incident was the result of an error, stating, \"Somebody could have made a mistake on the other side.\" However, Iran's aviation department head, Ali Abedzadeh, stated at a press conference, \"What is obvious for us, and what we can say with certainty, is that no missile hit the plane.\"\n\nAbedzadeh also invited Boeing officials to join the investigation and expressed Iran's intention to study the aircraft's black box flight recorders before sharing them. The head of the Iranian investigative team, Hassan Rezaeifar, stated that Iran would not share the black boxes immediately but would consider reaching out to international experts if it was unable to extract the recordings. The investigation could take over a month to fully retrieve the black box data, with the investigation itself potentially continuing for up to a year.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed that Canadian intelligence believed the crash was caused by a missile strike, as at least 63 Canadian citizens were on board the aircraft. \"The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile,\" Trudeau said on Thursday.\n\nIn total, 176 people died in the crash, with most being Iranian and Canadian citizens. Ukraine International Airlines has yet to comment on the incident, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated his country \"will conduct a detailed and independent investigation\" into the crash.",
    " Title: Trump's Grip on Republican Primary Voters Remains Strong Despite Few News Headlines\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing race for the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump continues to demonstrate a unique resilience that sets him apart in modern political history. Despite a few setbacks, he maintains a strong grip on the Republican primary voter base.\n\nIn the past two weeks, Trump has been largely absent from news interviews and major policy announcements. However, his absence from the media has not diminished his support significantly. The media has been filled with discussions about the intricacies of Colorado, North Dakota, Wyoming, Rule 40B, and the second ballot. Despite running minimal paid media, Trump has managed to secure an overwhelming victory in New York and is leading in all five states set to vote a week later (Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Rhode Island, and Connecticut). This puts him less than 100 votes shy of 1,000 delegates, needing 1,237 to take the nomination outright.\n\nTed Cruz, who has been making a comeback, could potentially win Pennsylvania, where 54 of the total 71 delegates are not bound, and where the senator is doing well in the delegate selection process. Cruz could also win Indiana's 57 votes and Nebraska's 36. If Cruz managed to parlay his strength in the far West into wins on the Pacific Coast, he could potentially block Trump and win on the second ballot.\n\nHowever, Trump's grip on the Republican primary voter is unyielding. Despite a 75 percent negative rating among American women, there is little gender gap in his primary vote. He does about as well among Republican women as he does with Republican men.\n\nIn the 2004 election, Republicans brought 10 million more (largely white) voters out than in 2000. Barack Obama won in 2008 by bringing out 10 million more blacks, Latinos, and young people than in 2004. Mitt Romney lost, in part, because 10 million white voters stayed home in 2012. Trump has demonstrated a vote-getting power that is extraordinary, pushing Republican turnout to a level 75 percent higher than it was in 2012.\n\nThe question remains whether Trump's ability to get his voters out and hold their support can win in the face of his terrible national general election numbers. Trump runs 10 points worse among women against Hillary Clinton than Romney did against Obama. He is 10 points less favorable and 10 points more unfavorable than Clinton. He loses to her by 10 in the RealClearPolitics average, 49 percent to 39 percent.\n\nHowever, Trump's opposition to trade deals and his refusal to take super-PAC money could potentially rally voters, including those of Bernie Sanders, who supported Sanders over the same issues. The impact of the FBI investigation into Clinton's State emails and the release of the Benghazi report remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Reflections on the 15-Year Anniversary of 9/11: America's Ongoing Struggle Against Terrorism\n\nArticle:\n\nFifteen years have passed since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, a day that left an indelible mark on the United States and the world. The attacks on the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and Flight 93, as well as subsequent incidents such as San Bernardino, Orlando, Nice, Paris, Ansbach, and Istanbul, have shaped the nation's response to terrorism and its foreign policy.\n\nIn the aftermath of 9/11, the United States found itself embroiled in a global war on terror that continues to this day. The events of that fateful day marked the beginning of a worldwide jihad, a conflict that has resulted in significant changes in American society and the implementation of extensive security measures.\n\nThe aftermath of 9/11 saw a shift in American attitudes and behaviors. Roads became quieter, work came to a halt, and citizens clung to their loved ones in fear of further attacks. The skies were devoid of planes, and the silence was a stark reminder of the new reality.\n\nThe TSA, or Transportation Security Administration, was established in response to the attacks, and Americans have grown accustomed to increased security measures such as removing shoes, travel-size toiletries, and undergoing pat-downs at airports. However, the TSA has been criticized for its inability to prevent terrorist attacks, with some arguing that it is merely a theatrical display intended to make people feel safer.\n\nThe question of whether mass surveillance is an effective means of protecting the public is a contentious issue. The Orlando shooter, for example, was interviewed by the FBI, and they concluded he was not a threat. The subsequent attack raises questions about the effectiveness of current security measures and the need for change.\n\nThe war on terror has also led to a significant increase in immigration, as people flee conflict zones in the Middle East. The compatibility of Islamic beliefs with Western-style democracy is another contentious issue, with some arguing that there is a need for reassessment and a reevaluation of solutions.\n\nThe war on terror has been long and costly, with no clear end in sight. The question of whether America should withdraw from its global commitments or continue to engage remains a topic of debate. The potential consequences of both options, including the possibility of more subtle forms of terrorism such as EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse) attacks on the electric grid, are significant.\n\nThe aftermath of 9/11 has also led to the growth of a vast bureaucracy, with agencies such as the NSA and TSA tasked with protecting the nation. However, the effectiveness of these agencies has been called into question, with some arguing that they infringe on personal freedoms while missing obvious threats.\n\nThe events of 9/11 have left a lasting impact on the United States, shaping its foreign policy, security measures, and societal attitudes. The nation continues to grapple with the complexities of the war on terror, attempting to balance the need for security with the preservation of individual freedoms. The terrorists may not have won on 9/11, but the United States has been forever changed by the events of that day.",
    " Title: Julie Swetnick's Credibility Questioned as She Partially Walks Back Sexual Assault Allegations Against Brett Kavanaugh\n\nArticle:\n\nJulie Swetnick, who has made uncorroborated and salacious sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, is facing credibility questions as she appears to partially walk back some of her claims and details about her past emerge. Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy has suggested the FBI scrutinize her, tweeting:\n\n\"A criminal referral should be sent to the FBI/DOJ regarding the apparently false affidavit signed by Julie Swetnick that was submitted to the Senate by @MichaelAvenatti.\"\n\nIn a sworn statement last month, Swetnick claimed she had seen Kavanaugh \"engage in abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls\" and \"grinding\" against girls and attempting to remove their clothes in the early '80s. She also claimed she \"became aware of efforts by [friend] Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh, and others to \u2018spike\u2019 the \u2018punch\u2019 at house parties\" with drugs or alcohol to lower girls' defenses and get them disoriented so they could be \"gang raped\" in a side room by a \"train\" of boys.\n\nSwetnick, in an interview with NBC News, appeared to walk back some of the claims about Kavanaugh, while standing by her claims of sexually aggressive behavior. While she said in her statement she became aware of \"efforts\" by Kavanaugh to spike the punch, she said in the interview she was unclear about what Kavanaugh was actually doing.\n\n\"I saw\u2014I saw him giving red solo cups to quite a few girls during that time frame, and there was grain punch at those parties,\" she said. \"I saw him around the punch\u2014I won\u2019t say bowls, the punch containers. I don\u2019t know what he did, but I saw him by them.\"\n\nAs for the claim about \"trains\" of boys lining up outside rooms to rape girls, she said in the interview she saw boys including Kavanaugh and Judge \"huddled by doors.\" Asked if she was suggesting she thought Kavanaugh was involved, she answered: \"I would say yes, it's just too coincidental.\" She did not offer further details to support the claim he was waiting his \"turn.\"\n\nShe also clarified that while she saw Kavanaugh and Judge at the party and where other boys were gathered, she \"can not specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me\" -- her original statement did not specifically accuse them of assaulting her, either.\n\nMeanwhile, she said she told her mother and the Montgomery County Police the next day. Police officials told NBC News it could take up to a month to recover documents related to any report she may have made. Further, NBC reported that both her mother and the officer she said she spoke with have died.\n\nSwetnick has struggled to provide corroborating witnesses, though her statement said she was aware of other witnesses who could \"attest to the truthfulness\" of her account. Swetnick provided four names to NBC News to back up her story: One is dead, two did not respond to NBC requests, and one other said he didn\u2019t remember Swetnick and didn\u2019t think he had socialized with her.\n\nSwetnick's shifting, uncorroborated claims also led NBC News to issue a statement ahead of the interview.\n\n\"NBC News, for the record, has not been able to independently verify her claims. There are things she told us on camera that differ from her written statements last week,\" host Kate Snow told viewers.\n\nKavanaugh has called Swetnick's accusations a \"joke,\" while Judge has said he \"categorically\" denies her claims. Lawyer Michael Avenatti, who is representing her, responded to some of the controversy by saying that Swetnick is willing to take a polygraph test and told CNN he had done \"significant due diligence\" before going ahead with them. Avenatti, who has also represented adult film star Stormy Daniels in her legal fight against President Trump and has floated the possibility of a 2020 Democratic presidential run, has fueled Republican claims that the impetus behind the sexual assault claims is politically motivated.\n\nSwetnick's ex-boyfriend, Richard Vinneccy, told Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle\" Monday that she had threatened to kill his unborn child. He also said that although they dated on-and-off for seven years, she never mentioned her Kavanaugh claims to him, and was known for wanting to be the center of attention.\n\n\"She was exaggerating everything. Everything that came out of her mouth was just exaggerations,\" he said.\n\nIt was also revealed this week that Swetnick was sued in 2000 by her former employer, Portland-based Webtrends, for allegedly falsifying her educational background and concocting false sexual harassment allegations. The suit, which Avenatti has called \"bogus,\" was voluntarily dismissed by Webtrends shortly afterwards.\n\nThe Associated Press reported on Sunday that Swetnick has been involved in at least six legal cases in the last 25 years. Avenatti told The Associated Press that court cases involving her have no bearing on the credibility of her claims about Kavanaugh. The FBI is currently conducting a background investigation into sexual assault claims made against Kavanaugh. The agency is expected to wrap up its investigation by Friday.",
    " Title: Trump's Path to Securing Republican Nomination Before July Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The possibility of a contested Republican convention this summer may not materialize as Donald Trump is still on track to clinch the nomination before the July convention in Cleveland. Trump is the only candidate with a realistic chance of reaching the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination before the convention, according to the latest polls and delegate allocation rules.\n\nTrump currently has 744 delegates, and he can potentially win an additional 1,226 delegates by the end of the primaries on June 7, if he wins a significant number of upcoming contests.\n\nNew York, with 95 delegates at stake, is crucial for Trump's path to the nomination. If Trump wins a majority of the state's delegates, he could take 77 delegates on the night. Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, Indiana, Nebraska, West Virginia, Oregon, and Washington State hold primaries in April and May, with a total of 534 delegates at stake.\n\nTrump can afford to lose Rhode Island, which awards its 19 delegates proportionally. In all, it's a day on which Trump could claim 93 delegates. Indiana's May 3 primary is important for Trump, with 57 delegates at stake. If Trump can win the state and a majority of the congressional districts, he could collect 45 delegates.\n\nWest Virginia is another unique state in which voters elect 31 delegates in the May 10 primary. If Trump does well here, he could pick up 20 or more delegates. Nebraska's 36 delegates are winner-take-all, but if Nebraska is like its neighbors Kansas and Iowa, two states Cruz won earlier in the race, Trump can't count on these delegates.\n\nOregon and Washington state award delegates proportionally, so even the losers get some. Five states vote on June 7, with 303 delegates up for grabs. The biggest prize is California, along with New Jersey, South Dakota, Montana, and New Mexico. California is more complicated, with 172 delegates at stake. The statewide winner gets only 13. The other 159 are awarded according to the results in individual congressional districts.\n\nFor Trump to clinch the nomination on June 7, the last day of the primary season, he has to win a big majority of California's congressional districts. If he wins 39 districts, he gets 130 delegates. On the last voting day of the primary campaign, Trump could win 242 delegates, leaving him 11 delegates short of the magic number.\n\nMissouri has certified the results of its March 15 primary, with Trump beating Cruz by 1,965 votes. If the results survive a potential recount, Trump wins Missouri and another 12 delegates. Trump's running total is 1,226, 11 delegates short of the magic number.",
    " Title: NSA Director Denies Collecting Millions of European Phone Records, Addresses International Spying Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a hearing on Tuesday, the head of the National Security Agency (NSA), General Keith Alexander, adamantly denied reports that the agency is collecting millions of phone records across Europe. The denial was one of the highlights of a House Intelligence Committee hearing about improving information gathering and privacy protections.\n\nThe hearing took place amid an international uproar over reports that the NSA monitored the cellphone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel for a decade, which is part of a pattern of the agency eavesdropping on friendly countries' leaders. Officials at the hearing did not deny that such spying takes place, but their answers cast doubt on White House assertions that President Obama did not know the extent of the spying on Chancellor Merkel.\n\nWhen asked by Chairman Mike Rogers (R-MI) if the US would consider it important to get access to the communications of foreign leaders, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper responded that knowing \"leadership intentions\" was \"one of the first things I learned in intelligence school in 1963.\"\n\nWhen asked further if America's allies \"conduct espionage on us,\" Mr. Clapper responded \"absolutely\" \u2013 before summarizing that the brouhaha over friends-on-friends spying reminded him of a scene from the movie \"Casablanca.\"\n\nAs for the \"false\" reports of the NSA gathering millions of European phone records, General Alexander said that the data in question were actually collected by foreign intelligence agencies. Moreover, to a large extent, they were gathered outside of Europe, often in war zones of crucial security interest to the US and its European allies.\n\n\"This is not information we collected on European citizens,\" Alexander said, defining it instead as \"information that we and our NATO allies have collected in defense of our countries and in support of military operations.\"\n\nThe documents Mr. Snowden provided European media were actually screenshots of data and were not the documents themselves, Alexander said.\n\nSome committee members asked why European leaders would offer such harsh judgments of US intelligence practices if their services are doing the same thing. Some European parliamentarians and policymakers \"may not have familiarity with exactly how their intelligence operations work,\" Clapper said, adding that officials are often unaware of \"everything\" their own intelligence agencies do.\n\nThe uproar over US intelligence practices overshadowed the purpose of Tuesday's hearing, which was to discuss proposed reforms to the NSA's program for bulk collection of communications under the Foreign Intelligence Security Act (FISA). One proposal from a bipartisan group of House and Senate members would effectively discontinue the program, while an opposing bipartisan collection of lawmakers would keep the program intact while focusing on strengthening its privacy protections.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee's top Democrat, Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, said the program \"allows the government to connect the dots\" of brewing terrorist activities. \"I shudder to think what would happen if the program were completely eliminated,\" he said. But he added that \"FISA must be reformed\" to increase \"transparency\" and \"privacy protections\" if the government wants to \"restore the public's confidence\" in national intelligence activities.\n\nNSA's Alexander said the record offers proof that the US intelligence community is getting things right. Contrasting a tally of more than 2,300 deaths overseas last year in terrorist attacks with the absence of any \"mass casualty\" attack in the US since 9/11, he said, \"That's not by luck.\"\n\nBut Alexander also said the door was open to improving both the NSA's operations and its protections of civil liberties and privacy. \"We're doing the right things,\" he said, \"but that doesn't mean we shouldn't change.\"",
    " Title: Ben Carson Endorses Donald Trump as Republican Presidential Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nRetired neurosurgeon and former presidential candidate Ben Carson has officially endorsed Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for president. The announcement was made alongside Trump at Mar-a-Largo, Trump's luxury club in Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday.\n\nCarson, who dropped out of the race last week, stated during a press conference announcing his endorsement, \"I have found that, in talking with him, that there's a lot more alignment philosophically and spiritually than I ever thought there was.\"\n\nWhen asked about his decision, Carson responded, \"It's about 'we the people.' We need to empower the people.\" He further explained, \"That is not going to be done through politics as usual, be that Republican politics as usual, or be that Democrat politics as usual.\"\n\nCarson elaborated on why he endorsed Trump, stating, \"It requires someone who's a bit of an iconoclast but someone who has the ability to listen and to make wise decisions.\"\n\nThursday night's GOP presidential debate saw Trump and Carson discussing education and improving schools. According to sources close to Carson, the two met in Palm Beach earlier Thursday and reached an agreement.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Carson had been torn between Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, but opted to support Trump due to a rumor circulated ahead of the Iowa caucuses by the Cruz campaign that Carson had dropped out of the race.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Radio's \"John Gibson Show\" on Thursday, Carson was asked whether he was planning to join the Trump campaign. \"Let's put it this way, I'm certainly leaning,\" he said, adding that there are \"two Donald Trumps\" - the one seen on television and the one he's gotten to know behind the scenes.\n\nCarson concluded, \"We will be looking at ways to do things that benefit all Americans that create an equal playing field - equality of opportunity - that's what we're looking for.\"",
    " Title: Ross Perot, Self-made Billionaire and Former Presidential Candidate, Dies at 89\n\nArticle:\n\nRoss Perot, the self-made billionaire and former presidential candidate, has passed away at the age of 89 following a five-month battle with leukemia, according to The Dallas Morning News. Perot, who won 19 percent of the vote as a third-party candidate in 1992, died early Tuesday at his home in Dallas surrounded by his family, family spokesman James Fuller said.\n\nBorn in Texarkana on June 27, 1930, Perot made his billions by founding Electronic Data Systems Corp. (EDS). He was seen by admirers as a patriot who served his country well before his two failed bids for the White House. In 1979, Perot financed a private commando raid to free two EDS employees being held in a prison in Iran. He was also a tireless advocate for Vietnam veterans.\n\nIn 1992, Perot spent more than $60 million of his own money to run against incumbent President George H.W. Bush and challenger Bill Clinton, promising to bring his business acumen to the nation's finances. Some Republicans blamed him for Bush's loss, noting he pulled the largest percentage of votes for a third-party candidate since former President Theodore Roosevelt's 1912 bid.\n\nPerot's second campaign four years later fizzled, as he gathered just 8 percent of the vote, and the Reform Party that he founded and hoped to build into a national political force began to fall apart. However, Perot's ideas on trade and deficit reduction remained part of the political landscape. He blamed both major parties for running up a huge federal budget deficit and letting American jobs be sent to other countries. The movement of U.S. jobs to Mexico, he said, created a \"giant sucking sound.\"\n\nPerot continued to speak out about federal spending for many years. In 2008, he launched a website to highlight the nation's debt with a ticker that tracked the rising total, a blog, and a chart presentation.\n\nYoung Perot's first job was delivering papers in a poor, mostly black part of town from his pony, Miss Bee. Perot said when the newspaper tried to cut his commission, he complained to the publisher\u2014and won. He said he learned to take problems straight to the top.\n\nFrom Texarkana, Perot went to the U.S. Naval Academy even though he had never been on a ship or seen the ocean. After the Navy, Perot joined International Business Machines in 1955 and quickly became a top salesman. In his last year at IBM, he filled his sales quota for the year in January.\n\nIn 1962, with $1,000 from his wife, Margot, Perot founded Electronic Data Systems. Hardware accounted for about 80% of the computer business, Perot said, and IBM wasn't interested in the other 20%, including services.\n\nMany of the early hires at EDS were former military men, and they had to abide by Perot's strict dress code\u2014white shirts, ties, no beards or mustaches\u2014and long work days. Many had crew cuts, like Perot.\n\nThe company's big break came in the mid-1960s when the federal government created Medicare and Medicaid, the health programs for seniors, the disabled, and the poor. States needed help in running the programs, and EDS won contracts\u2014starting in Texas\u2014to handle the millions of claims.\n\nEDS first sold stock to the public in 1968, and overnight, Perot was worth $350 million. His fortune doubled and tripled as the stock price rose steadily. In 1984, he sold control of the company to General Motors Corp. for $2.5 billion and received $700 million in a buyout. In 2008, EDS was sold to Hewlett-Packard Co.\n\nPerot went on to establish another computer-services company, Perot Systems Corp. He retired as CEO in 2000 and was succeeded by his son, Ross Perot Jr. In 2009, Dell Inc. bought Perot Systems.\n\nIn September 2011, Forbes magazine estimated Perot's wealth at $3.5 billion and ranked him No. 91 on its list of richest Americans.",
    " Title: Trump Threatens to Close Southern Border, Cut Aid, and Alter Trade Relations with Mexico\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has warned that he will close the Southern border entirely if Congress does not provide funding for a border wall and change the current immigration laws. In a series of tweets on Friday, Trump stated, \"We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with.\"\n\nThe threat comes amid a partial government shutdown that is now entering its second week. The shutdown began last Saturday as a result of the inability of Republicans and Democrats to agree on a funding package that would keep the government open and fund Trump's promised border wall. Trump has demanded $5 billion for the barrier, but Democrats have refused, offering $1.3 billion for general border security instead.\n\nWith both sides refusing to compromise and little activity on Capitol Hill during the holiday break, there are no signs of the impasse ending soon. One member of the House Republican leadership told a news outlet on Thursday that a resolution may not emerge until the new year.\n\nIn addition to renewing his demands for the wall, Trump also threatened numerous consequences in the absence of the funding. He suggested pulling back on the recently renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which now goes by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\n\"The United States loses soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA, over 75 Billion Dollars a year (not including Drug Money which would be many times that amount), that I would consider closing the Southern Border a 'profit making operation,'\" Trump tweeted.\n\nTrump also suggested bringing the U.S. car industry back to the United States and going back to pre-NAFTA conditions before so many of the companies and jobs were sent to Mexico. He stated, \"Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border.\"\n\nTrump then said the U.S. would terminate aid with Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, which he said are doing \"nothing for the United States but taking our money.\" He also referred to reports of another caravan of migrants planning to leave Honduras in January.\n\n\"Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!\" Trump said.\n\nTrump has previously threatened to shut down the border and cut aid to countries that do not assist or stop the caravans. However, he took no action following those threats. Earlier this month, the U.S. pledged a total of $10.6 billion in aid and investment for Central America and southern Mexico as part of a push to promote better security and job opportunities to prevent Central Americans and Mexicans from emigrating to the U.S.\n\nA cut-off of trade relations with Mexico could also risk a new agreement that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced this month, which calls for immigrants claiming asylum in the U.S. to be returned to Mexico as their cases are processed.\n\nMick Mulvaney, Trump's incoming acting chief of staff, claimed on \"Fox & Friends\" on Friday that Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is interested in a deal but that Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi is preventing it. Mulvaney alleged that Democrats are not negotiating because Pelosi is waiting until she secures the speakership.\n\nHowever, Pelosi has denied claims that Democrats have not provided a counteroffer. Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, stated, \"Democrats have offered Republicans three options to re-open government that all include funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security \u2013 but not the President's immoral, ineffective, and expensive wall.\" Hammill added, \"With the House Majority, Democrats will act swiftly to end the Trump Shutdown, and will fight for a strategic, robust national security policy, including strong and smart border security, and strong support for our servicemembers and veterans.\"",
    " Title: House Oversight Committee Accuses President Trump of Obstruction Following Refusal to Comply with Congressional Subpoenas\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic chairman of the U.S. House Oversight Committee, Elijah Cummings, has accused President Donald Trump of a \"precedent-setting and growing pattern of obstruction\" after Trump ordered federal employees not to comply with congressional investigations. The Republican president has directed officials not to obey legal requests from the Democratic-led House of Representatives, which is conducting multiple investigations of his administration, including his tax returns, White House security clearances, and the probe of Russian interference in U.S. politics.\n\nIn a statement, Cummings stated, \"President Trump and Attorney General (William) Barr are now openly ordering federal employees to ignore congressional subpoenas and simply not show up - without any assertion of a valid legal privilege.\" Cummings warned federal employees to \"think very carefully about their own legal interests\" in refusing to comply with the panel's requests.\n\nTrump has vowed to resist every subpoena from House Democrats investigating his administration and to fight any effort by them to impeach him. Removal from office is unlikely barring a change of heart by his fellow Republicans, who hold a majority in the U.S. Senate.\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit earlier this week to prevent material from being turned over to lawmakers, and on Wednesday, the Justice Department rebuffed a House committee's request for an interview with an official involved in the administration's decision to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census. The department said John Gore, a deputy assistant attorney general in the Civil Rights Division, would not participate in a deposition scheduled for Thursday if he could not have a Justice Department lawyer at his side. The committee had offered to allow a lawyer to sit in a different room.\n\nCummings said the committee would gather to hear Gore's deposition on Thursday and suggested he \"should be well aware of his constitutional, legal, and ethical obligations to comply with a duly authorized subpoena from Congress.\" A Department of Justice (DOJ) official said the committee had provided \"no legitimate or constitutional basis for excluding a DOJ lawyer from assisting at the deposition.\"\n\nThe Constitution empowers Congress to remove a president from office for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" The House is given the power to impeach a president - bring formal charges - and the Senate then convenes a trial, with the senators as jurors. A two-thirds vote is needed to convict a president and remove him from office. The Constitution gives no role to the Supreme Court in impeachment, though it does assign the chief justice the task of presiding over the Senate trial. Conservative John Roberts currently serves as chief justice.",
    " Title: House Democrats Reveal Details of Alleged Illegal Nuclear Technology Sale to Saudi Arabia\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report from the House Oversight and Reform Committee has unveiled disturbing details about a secretive effort by top Trump administration officials to sell sensitive nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, potentially in violation of some ethics statutes. The report, released on Tuesday, provides additional insight into the behind-the-scenes maneuvers to push the proposal through.\n\nThe plan, spearheaded by former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, aimed to export technology for approximately 40 nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia. The effort was part of a broader Middle East economic development plan that Flynn began developing before President Trump's inauguration, while he was serving as an adviser to Trump's campaign and transition team.\n\nDuring the same time period, Flynn was also working as an adviser for a private company called IP3 International, a firm run by retired US military generals with a clear financial interest in exporting US nuclear energy technology to Saudi Arabia. Once Trump was inaugurated, Flynn, along with longtime Trump associate Thomas Barrack, worked with other senior officials in the new Trump administration to make the plan a reality.\n\nOn January 27, 2017, just seven days after the inauguration, several retired generals from IP3 visited the White House to discuss the nuclear plan for Saudi Arabia with Derek Harvey, a senior staffer on Trump's National Security Council at the time. According to the House report, Harvey immediately directed the NSC staff to add information about IP3's \"plan for 40 nuclear power plants\" to the briefing package for President Trump's call with Saudi Arabia's King Salman.\n\nAs of now, the proposal's status is unclear, but the White House is still in discussions to sell nuclear equipment to Saudi Arabia despite fierce Democratic opposition. To sell nuclear technology to a foreign country, the US must sign a \"123 agreement,\" as per Section 123 of the 1954 US Atomic Energy Act. If a country wants to buy nuclear equipment from the US, it must meet nine conditions, including a guarantee that it will not use the technology to make nuclear weapons.\n\nAccording to the Democrats' report, Harvey ignored the requirements for a 123 agreement and insisted that the decision to transfer nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia had already been made. If true, this could potentially allow Riyadh to pursue a nuclear weapon with US-sold equipment in the future.\n\nFurthermore, there is concern over Michael Flynn's personal involvement in the deal. Flynn had previously consulted for IP3, and \"whistleblowers\" who spoke with House Democrats were reportedly worried about Flynn potentially violating ethics rules. White House ethics officials apparently raised these concerns, with one senior political official reportedly stating that Harvey's proposal was \"not a business plan,\" but rather \"a scheme for these generals to make some money.\"\n\nThe report's release marks a significant step in House Democrats' oversight of Trump's foreign policy, as promised when they took the House last November. The report provides new details about the Saudi nuclear deal's progression from an idea conceived by Flynn and a few retired generals to a serious policy being pursued at the highest levels of the White House.\n\nThe report's release could potentially hinder the White House's ability to sign the nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia, as it is now met with stiff resistance from Democrats in Congress. This development may be a warning shot, but it could also signal bigger things to come in terms of Democratic oversight of Trump's foreign policy.",
    " Title: Florida Stops Publishing Real-Time Coronavirus Death Data Compiled by Medical Examiners\n\nArticle:\n\nFlorida health officials have ceased publishing real-time coronavirus death data reported by medical examiners, following a discrepancy between the data and the official state total. The last nine days have seen the withholding of lists compiled by the state Medical Examiners Commission.\n\nThe change in policy was initiated after state health officials intervened, according to Dr. Stephen Nelson, who heads the commission. The officials plan to redact causes of deaths and descriptions of cases from the data, a move Nelson described as making the lists \"meaningless.\"\n\nDr. Nelson stated, \"This is no different than any other public record we deal with. It's paid for by taxpayer dollars, and the taxpayers have a right to know.\" He added that the lists have always been made public since medical examiners began to compile them in 1992.\n\nPaul Petrino, who runs the Palm Beach County medical examiner's office, told The Tampa Bay Times that county lawyers instructed him to stop releasing the numbers last week. Petrino expressed concern that the data's public release was important for individuals to have accurate information about the health crisis.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health told The Times that it \"participated in conference calls\" with law enforcement officials to express \"privacy concerns for the individuals that passed away related to COVID-19.\" The health department's actions come after it attempted to block access to death records last month, according to The Miami Herald.\n\nBarbara Petersen of the First Amendment Foundation told The Times, \"It's just shocking to me the level of interference.\" Florida's Democratic congressional delegation wrote a letter to Governor Ron DeSantis last week, questioning the \"inconsistencies between COVID-19 death tracking methods used by the Florida Department of Health and county medical examiners.\"\n\nThe efforts to keep public health information under wraps come as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, moved to reopen parts of the state's economy after delaying issuing a stay-at-home order earlier in the outbreak. DeSantis announced the plan to reopen on Wednesday, as the state saw its largest spike in coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began.",
    " Title: \"Me Too Movement: A Reassessment of the #MeToo Era and Its Impact on Society\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe phrase \"Me Too\" has undergone a significant transformation in meaning since its inception eighty years ago. Originally, it described a group of Republicans who publicly supported the policies of Franklin Roosevelt, leading to the nomination of a Republican presidential candidate who had recently switched parties. Today, the term \"Me Too\" refers to a social and cultural movement that aims to address sexual harassment and assault, particularly in the workplace.\n\nThe movement has gained momentum in recent years, leading to the ousting of numerous high-profile figures in media, entertainment, and politics. One of the latest targets of the movement is Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.\n\nThe allegations against Kavanaugh have sparked a heated debate, with some questioning the credibility of Ford's story. Ford has declined to testify under oath, her story conflicts with that of the man she names as an eyewitness, and the notes taken by her therapist do not provide a clear account of the alleged assault. Additionally, Ford's history of supporting left-wing causes has raised questions about her motives.\n\nDespite these uncertainties, many prominent Democratic politicians have called for belief in Ford's story. Senator Mazie Hirono declared, \"They need to be believed,\" while Hillary Clinton stated, \"You have the right to be believed.\"\n\nThe movement's emphasis on belief, rather than evidence, has sparked controversy. Those who express skepticism about the allegations against Kavanaugh or other high-profile figures accused of sexual misconduct are often met with criticism and backlash.\n\nThe #MeToo movement's impact extends beyond the political sphere. Comedian Norm Macdonald was disinvited from The Tonight Show after expressing support for the slowdown of the #MeToo movement. Macdonald faces no accusations of misconduct, but he stated that he was \"happy\" the movement had slowed down. NBC's decision to remove Macdonald from its airwaves was seen as a rebuke of his opinion, contradicting the notion that the movement had slowed down.\n\nSimilarly, editor Ian Buruma was forced to resign from the New York Review of Books after publishing an essay by Jian Gomeshi, a talk show host accused of sexual assault but acquitted in court. The backlash against Buruma's decision to publish Gomeshi's essay, despite his acquittal, led to a boycott by university presses that advertise in the magazine, ultimately resulting in Buruma's resignation.\n\nThe #MeToo movement's emphasis on belief, rather than due process, has raised concerns about freedom of speech and the presumption of innocence. The movement's impact on comedians, writers, and other public figures has been significant, with many expressing a desire for the movement to slow down or change course.\n\nThe #MeToo movement has undoubtedly brought attention to an important issue and led to changes in behavior among powerful individuals. However, the movement's emphasis on belief, rather than evidence, and its impact on freedom of speech and due process have sparked controversy and raised concerns about unintended consequences. As the movement continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether it can find a balance between addressing sexual harassment and assault and upholding the principles of fairness and justice.",
    " Title: Global Entities Condemn U.S. Investigation into Auto Tariffs\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to launch an investigation into potential tariffs on vehicle and automotive part imports into the United States has been met with condemnation from China, Japan, and the European Union. The move, which invokes a provision allowing the president to restrict imports and impose unlimited tariffs on national security grounds, is seen as a bargaining tool in stalled talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.\n\nAccording to the Department of Commerce, Mexico is the top exporter of passenger vehicles and light trucks to the U.S, followed by Japan, Canada, Germany, and South Korea. Japan, which accounts for about 40 percent of U.S. vehicle imports, has expressed concern over the potential impact of such measures, with Japan's Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, Hiroshige Seko, stating that such a measure would \"put the global market into turmoil.\"\n\nGermany's association of industry groups has also voiced opposition, describing auto tariffs as a \"provocation\" and \"another nasty blow to our economic relations\" with the United States. The EU executive has stated that such a move would be against the rules of global trade.\n\nIn Beijing, Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng expressed similar sentiments, stating that abusing national security provisions would \"undermine the multilateral trade system and disrupt the order of international trade.\" China, a relatively minor player in the U.S. auto import market, has expressed a desire to expand abroad, with China being ranked second in auto parts exports to the U.S last year.\n\nJapanese and European automakers have not issued individual comments, but some have referred to Global Automakers, an industry group of international automakers based in Washington. Global Automakers Chief Executive John Bozzella stated that the move would \"hurt American consumers\" and lead to \"fewer choices and higher prices for cars and trucks in America.\"\n\nLast week, Japan went to the World Trade Organization to warn of possible retaliation for tariffs on steel and aluminum, which Trump imposed in March. Japan is the only major U.S. ally that was not granted a temporary exemption from the tariffs. Japan estimates these tariffs will cost it about 50 billion yen ( $ 450 million ) a year.\n\nReports suggest that the president has proposed seeking new tariffs of 20 to 25 percent on automobile imports. Critics fear that other countries may retaliate with trade sanctions of their own and question the effectiveness of such a move given the lengthy review required and potential legal challenges ahead.",
    " Title: Senate Rules Committee's Statement on Press Access Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate Rules Committee's recent statement regarding press access on the Senate side of the Capitol complex has sparked controversy among journalists and senators alike. The statement, issued by Chairman Richard Shelby, clarified that no changes have been made to the existing rules governing press coverage, but noted that the committee has been working with press galleries to ensure compliance with these rules to maintain a \"safe environment\" for everyone.\n\nThe \"safety\" concern is not entirely fabricated, as the Capitol is currently experiencing a surge in the number of reporters. A veteran reporter estimates that under the Trump administration, there are approximately double the number of reporters on the Hill on average legislative days compared to previous administrations. This influx of journalists is due to the increased amount of news coming from the Hill, as the government is currently unified under one party and working towards long-standing ideological goals.\n\nThe head of the unified government, President Donald Trump, is a subject of much media scrutiny, with ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the election and questions regarding his actions and policies. This has led to an increased number of questions from reporters to Republican lawmakers, many of which are not met with enthusiasm.\n\nWhile White House and campaign reporters do not have the same level of access to principals as Capitol Hill reporters, the open press access on the Hill allows for more direct interaction between journalists and senators. If open press access on the Hill were restricted, one more branch of public communication would be conducted exclusively through flacks, and one more check on power would be impeded.\n\nIf senators are truly concerned about the size of reporter mobs and their safety, they could be more forthcoming with information about their policies, perhaps through regular press conferences. This would reduce the need for reporters to be creative in their methods of obtaining information.\n\nUntil such a day comes, it is important to maintain a safe and open environment for both journalists and senators, and to avoid any potential accidents that could result from the crowded conditions on Capitol Hill.",
    " Title: Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal Calls for GOP to \"Stop Being the Stupid Party\"\n\nArticle:\n\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, a potential 2016 presidential contender, called on the Republican Party to \"stop being the stupid party\" during a keynote address at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting on Thursday. In his 25-minute speech, Jindal suggested that the GOP might need to change its strategies and messaging to appeal to a rapidly changing American electorate.\n\nJindal's address came as Republican leaders promised to release a report, titled the \"Growth and Opportunity Project,\" in March, outlining recommendations on party rules and messaging. The report aims to address the party's struggles in recent elections, particularly in winning over women and minority voters.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's November victory was fueled, in part, by overwhelming support from the nation's Hispanic, Asian, and African-American communities. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and down-ticket candidates alienated many of these voters with comments and policies perceived as offensive or insensitive.\n\nGOP strategist Sally Bradshaw, who is part of a team appointed by RNC Chairman Reince Priebus to craft the report, stated, \"I think you're going to see a very renewed, aggressive effort by this party to put on a different face.\"\n\nJindal called on conservatives to shift their focus from Capitol Hill number crunching to \"the place where conservatism thrives -- in the real world beyond the Washington Beltway.\"\n\nHours before the speech, Republican leaders promised to release a report outlining recommendations on party rules and messaging designed to appeal to a rapidly changing American electorate. The report, dubbed the \"Growth and Opportunity Project,\" is set to be released in March.\n\nIn the speech, Jindal offered little detail on specific changes but emphasized the need for the GOP to connect with voters across the nation and focus on real-world issues rather than Washington politics.\n\nJindal's comments come a day after the House passed a bill to permit the government to borrow enough money to avoid a first-time default for at least four months. The House passed the measure on a bipartisan basis, with majority Republicans backtracking on their previous demand for an equivalent level of spending cuts in exchange for an increase in the government's borrowing cap.\n\nJindal's blunt remarks follow criticism from another high-profile Republican, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who publicly blasted GOP leadership on Capitol Hill for their handling of disaster relief for victims of Superstorm Sandy. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich suggested that Republicans could use hearings to expose waste and promote better ideas.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Overturns Alabama Redistricting Plan, Deems District Court Ruling \"Legally Erroneous\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has overturned a district court ruling that upheld Alabama's redistricting plan, which allegedly overloaded some districts with black Democratic voters. In a 5-to-4 ruling, the justices rejected the lower court's decision and sent it back for reevaluation.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer, who delivered the opinion, was joined by the court's other liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote. The court's conservatives\u2014Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas\u2014dissented. Thomas wrote a separate dissent.\n\nAs reported by NPR's Nina Totenberg last November, the high court was asked to decide \"whether a 2010 state legislative redistricting in Alabama overloaded some districts with black Democrats on the basis of race or party.\"\n\nIn 2000, Democrats controlled the state Legislature and the redistricting process. They used their power to create districts with black majorities under the Voting Rights Act, while at the same time putting enough reliably Democratic black voters into majority white districts so that white Democratic candidates could build black-white coalitions and have a chance of winning. By 2010, Republicans controlled the Legislature, and they set about consolidating the black vote into existing majority-black districts. Under the plan, about one-sixth of all eligible black voters were moved from majority white state Senate districts to majority-black districts. The result was that in some of those districts, the black majority increased to over 70 percent. At the same time, the majority white districts got whiter, and more safely Republican.\n\nThe redistricting came after the 2010 census showed population shifts that made some existing districts too big in population terms, and others too small. The Republicans tried to equalize the size of the districts. They also tried to maintain the same number of majority-black districts, contending that under the Voting Rights Act, a simple majority of black voters in those districts was not enough. Democrats disagree and contend that the GOP plan calls for unconstitutional racial quotas.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, Justice Breyer said the lower court \"should have reviewed claims of racial gerrymandering on a district-by-district level, not just statewide. He also said the court did not apply the right test when it found that race was not the primary motivating factor.\"\n\nState officials claim they had no choice but to concentrate black voters in some districts, making neighboring seats more white and apt to elect Republicans.",
    " Title: GOP Divisions Threaten Immigration Reform Unity on Capitol Hill\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the 2016 election, there appears to be a GOP consensus on the need for immigration reform; however, a significant obstacle could derail a potential deal: disagreement among Republicans in Congress regarding the approach to take. Some favor piecemeal reform, addressing popular issues while leaving contentious matters, such as a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, for later consideration. Others advocate for a comprehensive deal to tackle the issue holistically.\n\nThe rifts that existed prior to the election persist, with scant evidence of a promised comprehensive immigration reform materializing as of yet. \"Doing a comprehensive bill is a big mistake,\" said Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), who supports a piece-by-piece approach. \"What you end up having is a bill that nobody likes. Everybody hates one piece of it. It's a way to actually avoid doing what we need to do to solve the immigration problem.\"\n\nRepublicans advocating for a piecemeal approach argue that starting with politically palatable components could generate bipartisan momentum for a broader overhaul. They also point to the frustration generated by large legislative efforts like the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), the incoming Senate minority whip, noted, \"There's going to be a natural desire to try to pair things up [on immigration]. But at some point, the bill gets so big and cumbersome that I think by virtue of the size alone, that that makes it harder to pass.\"\n\nThe general outlines of a comprehensive package are clear, encompassing provisions on border security, law enforcement, reforms to the legal immigration system, and a solution for the undocumented immigrants residing in the United States. The contentious issue lies in the last component, which Democrats fear would be neglected if Congress dismantles immigration reform piece by piece.\n\nA pathway to citizenship is the one thing Democrats and immigration advocates will demand, but it is certain to encounter the strongest GOP resistance. \"That is probably the part of immigration reform that needs the greatest reform,\" said Rep. Charles Gonzalez (D-Texas), the outgoing chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. \"That's why I've never really understood that people really believe that this piecemeal thing is going to get us anywhere.\"\n\nCalifornia Rep. Xavier Becerra, the incoming House Democratic Caucus chairman, added, \"Why only half fix the problem? Let's go ahead and fix the whole thing. If you've got a machine that's not working well, you're not going to fix just half of it and have it still not work well, let's go ahead and fix it right.\"",
    " Title: Fiscal Slope: Gradual Tax Increases and Spending Cuts as a Solution to the U.S. Budget Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate regarding the so-called \"fiscal cliff\" in the United States is not as dire as some have portrayed it. While the potential tax increases and spending cuts, with the exception of the payroll tax increase and extended unemployment benefits, are not expected to take effect on January 1, 2013, or February 1, 2013, if a budget deal is not reached by those dates, the \"dramatic impact\" on the economy is largely exaggerated.\n\nIf President Barack Obama and Capitol Hill lawmakers remain rational and dispassionate, they can mitigate the impact of the fiscal situation by turning the fiscal slope into a smaller or \"bunny slope,\" to borrow a skiing metaphor. This approach, which involves four key elements, would help lessen the impact of a budget deal and gradually reduce the budget deficit.\n\nElement 1: Instead of letting all of the 2001-2003 Bush income tax cuts for families with income over $250,000 per year and individuals over $200,000 expire, the income tax cuts for these groups could be halved on January 1, 2013, and the second half could expire on January 1, 2014. This would result in an income tax increase of approximately $26 billion to $30 billion per year.\n\nElement 2: The sequestration, which involves approximately $100 billion in automatic spending cuts, half from the Department of Defense and half from non-defense programs, could be elongated to three years. In 2013, $20 billion could be cut from DOD and $20 billion from non-defense programs, with the same amount being cut in 2014 and 2015. This would result in a total of $120 billion in cuts over three years, with a $40 billion spending reduction each year.\n\nElement 3: The payroll tax that funds Social Security could be increased to its normal rate of 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent over two years, to 5.2 percent in 2013, and to 6.2 percent in 2014. This would reduce the budget deficit by about $48 billion each year.\n\nElement 4: Business expense tax write-offs, and other business tax provisions, could be allowed to expire over two years, with half expiring in 2013, and half in 2014. This would further reduce the deficit by about $30 billion per year.\n\nThe aforementioned tax and spending changes would cut the budget deficit by an equal amount, approximately $148 billion, in both 2013 and 2014, decreasing the projected budget deficit to $980 billion in 2013, and $832 billion in 2014.\n\nAssuming tax or spending policies remain the same after 2014, and the U.S. economy grows at a 3.0 percent rate, the budget deficit should decline to about $652 billion in 2015, $452 billion in 2016, and $230 billion in 2017. In 2017, the budget deficit will occur in a roughly $3.9 trillion U.S. budget, with the net interest payment on the national debt being about $350 billion to $380 billion.\n\nIn other words, by deploying the \"bunny slope\" plan of gradual tax increases and spending cuts, the non-debt-service portion of the U.S. budget will be balanced by the end of 2017. Investors and typical Americans should not agonize over the current budget talks, as the so-called fiscal cliff is really a fiscal slope, and the slope that exists can be converted into a bunny slope, further mitigating any GDP impact, so long as Obama and Congress remain rational and dispassionate. The two parties need to meet in a room and not return until a budget deal is reached. And when the budget deal is reached, the American people, and probably the late, great LBJ, as well, will be very proud.",
    " Title: Trump's Proposed Tariffs on Mexican Goods: Potential Economic Impact and Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's proposed 25% tariff on Mexican goods could significantly increase the existing tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, as well as Chinese imports. The United States has already collected approximately $19 billion in tariffs under Trump's administration. If implemented, the new tariff could potentially add up to $87 billion annually to this total.\n\nMexico is expected to retaliate with counter-tariffs, which could negatively impact sectors such as American agriculture. Two weeks ago, Trump ended a tariff on Mexican aluminum and steel, and Mexico reciprocated by ending a tariff on American farm goods. However, this brief respite may be short-lived, as farmers may need to re-evaluate their export markets.\n\nThe question remains whether the potential benefits of the tariff outweigh the economic pain. Trump is using tariffs as a means to pressure Mexico into strengthening border control measures. While the cost of the tariff would be borne by Americans, the Mexican economy could also suffer from a loss of sales to the United States.\n\nTrump's strategy of linking immigration and economic issues could potentially disrupt both economies. The manufacturing sectors in Mexico and the United States are closely integrated, with about two-thirds of trade between the countries involving factories owned by the same company, according to Deutsche Bank.\n\nImmigrants seeking to cross the southern border primarily originate from Central America, issues that are largely beyond the control of the Mexican government. While Trump often refers to all immigrants as illegal, many are exercising a legal right to seek asylum.\n\nPrevious administrations have sought cooperation from Mexico on immigration matters without disrupting economic relations between the two countries. Trump's decision to conflate the two issues could potentially lead to economic disruption in both countries due to the interconnected nature of their manufacturing sectors.",

Amy Klobuchar Withdraws from Vice Presidential Consideration, Advocates for a Woman of Color\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) announced on Thursday that she is withdrawing her name from consideration as Joe Biden's running mate, stating that a woman of color should be chosen as the vice-presidential nominee instead.\n\nIn the aftermath of this announcement, some political observers have speculated that Klobuchar may have anticipated a potential backlash, with some Black Lives Matter activists expressing disapproval of her candidacy. However, the exact reasons for Klobuchar's decision remain unclear.\n\nIf the Democratic ticket, led by Biden and Klobuchar, were to lose the 2020 presidential election, some have suggested that Klobuchar could face criticism for not being able to help boost African-American turnout in key states such as Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and North Carolina. This hypothetical scenario, in which Biden wins the presidency but fails to secure the necessary electoral votes, would likely result in a significant amount of frustration within the Democratic Party.\n\nShould a Biden administration come into power, there may be cabinet positions available for Klobuchar if she chooses to accept one. It is also possible that Biden may feel obligated to offer her a prestigious post as a gesture of gratitude for her support during the primary and her decision to step aside in the running-mate selection process.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the 2020 election, it is unlikely that Klobuchar will be held responsible for any shortcomings of the Democratic ticket.",
    " Title: Sixty Percent of Americans Disapprove of President Trump's Job Performance in New Washington Post-ABC News Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll conducted by The Washington Post and ABC News shows that 60 percent of Americans disapprove of President Donald Trump's job performance, marking a new high in disapproval for the president. The poll, released on Friday, was conducted just days after special counsel Robert Mueller delivered a series of legal blows to the Trump administration.\n\nThe poll, which was conducted last week, found that only slightly more than one-third of Americans, 36 percent, approve of Trump's job performance. In the previous Washington Post-ABC News poll, conducted in April, Trump's approval rating was 40 percent, and his disapproval rating was 56 percent.\n\nThe poll also found that most Americans would oppose Trump granting a pardon to former associate Paul Manafort, with 66 percent of respondents saying they were against a pardon. Only 18 percent said they would support a pardon.\n\nTrump has recently focused negative attention on Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom Trump has blamed for Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. However, a majority of Americans, 62 percent, side with Sessions, with 64 percent saying Trump should not fire Sessions.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller saw similar positive percentages, with 63 percent of those polled supporting Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and 29 percent saying they oppose it. Further, 53 percent of respondents said they think Trump tried to interfere in Mueller's investigation in a way that \"amounts to obstruction of justice,\" while 35 percent said he did not try to interfere.\n\nA similar portion of survey respondents, 61 percent, said they believe it would be a crime if Trump directed Michael Cohen to make hush-money payments to two women who say they had affairs with Trump during the 2016 election. Cohen pleaded guilty to making payments of that nature, violating campaign-finance laws at the \"direction of a candidate for federal office,\" meaning Trump.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the economy, Americans were more favorable in their evaluations of the president. Forty-five percent of those polled said they approve of Trump's handling of the economy, while 47 percent said they disapprove.\n\nThe poll, which included a sample of 1,003 adults, was conducted from Aug. 26 to Aug. 29 via landlines and cellphones. The poll's margin of error was plus-or-minus 3.5 percentage points.",
    " Title: Seven Potential Inflection Points in the Tight Presidential Race Between Obama and Romney\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing race between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, the contest remains a close one, as indicated by numerous polls. With the Supreme Court's health care ruling now decided, both campaigns are focusing on a limited number of significant events that could influence the election's outcome.\n\nThe campaign, marked by swift news cycles, has remained relatively stable since the primaries concluded. In various national surveys, the race is a tight 3-percentage-point contest, with Obama slightly below 50 percent and Romney around 45 percent.\n\n\"It didn't take long for the race to solidify. There's no reason to think it won't stay solidified,\" said Democratic strategist Steve Murphy.\n\nBoth candidates are running cautious campaigns, offering little in the way of future vision, and neither has much incentive to change their strategies.\n\n\"In a race as close as this one's likely to be, both candidates are going to be ultra-cautious,\" said Dan Schnur, head of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. \"It's hard to see one of them taking the kind of risk that would be necessary to dramatically change the trajectory.\"\n\nSeveral potential inflection points are on the horizon, some known and scheduled, others looming but not yet materialized. Some are within the control of the campaigns, such as their debate performances, while others are global events that could impact voter perceptions of one or both candidates, such as a financial crisis in debt-ridden Europe.\n\n\"This race is going to be very close, and there's plenty of action left to come that can influence it\u2014unemployment numbers, credit downgrading, European crisis, VP choice (a little), the health care ruling fallout, and there's always the potential of Mideast or other foreign policy issues flaring up,\" said Republican strategist Curt Anderson. \"But the truth is, there is a lot more peril than upside in all these things for President Obama.\"\n\nBelow are seven potential inflection points that could alter the current close race:\n\n1. Unemployment Numbers: The state of the economy, particularly unemployment rates, could significantly impact the election's outcome.\n2. Credit Downgrading: Changes in the U.S. credit rating could affect voter perceptions of the economy and the candidates.\n3. European Crisis: The ongoing financial crisis in Europe could impact voter perceptions of the candidates' economic policies and ability to handle global economic issues.\n4. Vice Presidential Candidates: The selection of vice presidential candidates could sway undecided voters or solidify support for either candidate.\n5. Health Care Ruling Fallout: The impact of the Supreme Court's health care ruling on voter perceptions of the Affordable Care Act and the candidates' positions on health care reform.\n6. Middle East or Foreign Policy Issues: Developments in the Middle East or other foreign policy issues could impact voter perceptions of the candidates' foreign policy expertise and ability to handle international crises.\n7. Debate Performances: The upcoming debates between Obama and Romney could significantly impact voter perceptions of the candidates' qualifications and leadership abilities.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Contracts in Q4 2013, First Time Since End of 2008 Recession\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported a slight contraction of 0.1% in the U.S. economy in the fourth quarter of 2013, marking the first time the American economy has shrunk since the end of the 2008 recession. The real gross domestic product (GDP) decreased at an annual rate of 0.1% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, following a 3.1% increase in the previous quarter.\n\nThe downturn in real GDP was primarily due to decreases in private inventory investment, federal government spending, exports, and state and local government spending. These decreases were partly offset by an upturn in nonresidential fixed investment, a larger decrease in imports, and an acceleration in personal consumption expenditures (PCE).\n\nThe 22% decline in federal military spending was a significant factor in the economic contraction. Nonmilitary spending by the federal government increased by 6%, but this increase was not sufficient to offset the decline in military spending cuts. One possible reason for the sharp decline in defense spending is the looming threat of the budget sequester brought on by the 2011 Budget Control Act. The Department of Defense may have made up for the prospective budget cuts in Q3 2012 before paring back in Q4.\n\nThe March budget sequester is still scheduled to take place, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the defense spending cuts will result in a 0.4% drop in GDP. Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle will have to agree on some sort of package to delay the cuts to avoid a potential recession.\n\nThe GDP report was not entirely negative, as personal consumption spending and investment were growing at 2.2% and 8.4%, respectively. The boost in personal spending was driven mostly by durable goods, indicating that consumers may be replacing worn-out items. However, the lack of consumer confidence could spell trouble for the recovery.\n\nThe BEA emphasized that the fourth-quarter advance estimate released today is based on incomplete or subjective data and is subject to further revision. The \"second\" estimate for the fourth quarter, based on more complete data, will be released on February 28, 2013.",
    " Title: Romney's Foreign Policy Stance: A Look at His Middle East and Iran Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) last week, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney addressed the Middle East and Iran, leaving himself a degree of flexibility in his policy proposals.\n\nRegarding the Palestinian issue, Romney stated, \"I will recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel.\" He criticized President Barack Obama for failing to achieve this goal.\n\nWhile Romney's speech emphasized the theme of the Obama administration's \"weakness\" and abandonment of allies, his specific policy proposals on issues like Iran's nuclear program and military aid to difficult allies like Pakistan or Egypt show similarities to Obama's approach.\n\nThe speech did not provide specific details on the resources Romney would devote to these tasks, and it appears that the candidate has not engaged deeply with these issues during the campaign. However, a half dozen advisers stated that this is partly due to Romney's lack of enthusiasm for these issues compared to domestic economic issues.\n\nRomney's foreign policy team has been evolving, with Richard S. Williamson, Mitchell B. Reiss, and Jim Talent playing central roles. Liz Cheney, who served in the State Department during the Bush administration, has also joined a weekly conference call.\n\nDivisions within the foreign policy team remain, with some advisers advocating for more specificity in Romney's statements. The neoconservative faction around John R. Bolton, who has expressed displeasure with working through international organizations, has been largely absent from the calls.\n\nRomney's stance on Syria and Iran has been subject to some confusion. In a television interview, he seemed to forget his position on preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear \"capability\" and sounded like he was in agreement with Obama on simply stopping Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. In the VMI speech, he returned to the promise to \"prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.\"\n\nThe Romney campaign's foreign policy team is awaiting resolution of these internal disputes until after the election. Notable figures from establishment Republican foreign policy circles, such as Henry A. Kissinger, have been absent from the team.",
    " Title: Market Analysts Offer Cautious Outlook on U.S. Economic Recovery\n\nArticle:\n\nStocks experienced volatile trading on Wednesday as the U.S. economy began to reopen. The market showed mixed results, with bank stocks rising, but tech-focused \"stay-at-home\" plays declining. Market analysts and economists are divided on the timeline for economic recovery.\n\nDavid Lebovitz, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, expressed caution due to uncertainties surrounding the reopening process. He stated, \"We have been surprised by the speed and the magnitude at which things have moved, but when you think about building a diversified portfolio, you have the 10-year Treasury yield at 70 basis points. Equities look attractive even if they're trading at north of 20 times. So, we have been encouraging folks to stay long equities despite some of the risks that exist.\"\n\nLebovitz's caution stems from the unknowns about reopening the economy, particularly the capacity requirements for businesses to break even, which he estimates to be around 75%. He also noted that turning the economy back on is more challenging than turning it off.\n\nMike Mayo, managing director and head of U.S. large-cap bank research at Wells Fargo Securities, suggested that the Federal Reserve should let its policies from the previous recession work. He stated, \"We've run over 200 earnings models. We've run different scenarios: a V recovery, a U recovery, an L recovery, and it's pretty tough, we think, for the government to conclude that large banks, well-capitalized banks, well-capitalized banks that earned their dividend twice over in the first quarter, in a quarter when they built reserves, we find it very tough for the Fed to conclude that banks should cut the dividends now.\"\n\nJason Furman, economic policy professor at Harvard University and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, warned investors not to get too eager too soon. He predicted, \"I think we're going to have two phases from here. One is a partial bounce back, which will be very rapid. It'll look like we're on the upslope of a V. We've already seen that. When you look at daily data, it bottomed out\u2026 around April 15. You've even seen growth in consumption spending, a decent amount of it, from April 15 to May 15. Problem is that's the low-hanging fruit of growth where you turn the lights back on, call some of the furloughed workers back. There's a lot more people that are not coming back to their jobs, businesses that are not going to be revived, and so once you get past that first phase, I think you're in for a long and painful slog.\"",
    " Title: New York Attorney General's Office Alleges $1 Billion in Hidden Assets by Sackler Family in Ongoing Opioid Crisis Case\n\nArticle:\n\nThe New York Attorney General's office has alleged in court filings on Friday that the Sackler family, defendants in an ongoing case against Purdue Pharma and the opioid crisis, may have been attempting to hide approximately $1 billion in assets. The filings, which result from subpoenas issued to several financial institutions believed to have information related to the defendants, reveal about $1 billion in wire transfers between and among the Sacklers and their shell companies during the same time frame that they were allegedly draining Purdue Pharma of its opioid proceeds.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James stated in a Friday release, \"While the Sacklers continue to lowball victims and skirt a responsible settlement, we refuse to allow the family to misuse the courts in an effort to shield their financial misconduct.\"\n\nThe limited number of documents provided to the New York Attorney General's office so far underscores the necessity for compliance with every subpoena, according to James. Records from one financial institution alone have shown approximately $1 billion in wire transfers between the Sacklers, entities they control, and different financial institutions, including those that have funneled funds into Swiss bank accounts.\n\nThe New York Attorney General's office is continuing to investigate whether these transactions were a deliberate attempt by the family that owns Purdue Pharma to conceal assets from litigants.\n\nPurdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, is facing thousands of lawsuits linked to the opioid crisis that has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S. The company announced earlier this week that it had reached a tentative settlement with thousands of local governments and more than 20 states, with a $3 billion upfront payment and additional funds from the sale of Mundipharma, a sister company of Purdue Pharma also owned by the Sacklers.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, citing anonymous sources with knowledge of the talks, Purdue would pay up to $12 billion, and the Sackler family would relinquish control of the company. The agreement would not include an admission of guilt.\n\nIn response to the proposed settlement, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey stated, \"This apparent settlement is a slap in the face to everyone who has had to bury a loved one due to this family's destruction and greed.\"\n\nJames, in response to the proposed settlement, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in a statement that the deal \"does not account for the depth of pain and destruction caused by Purdue and the Sacklers\" and that it was \"an insult, plain and simple.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Mortimer D.A. Sackler, formerly a Purdue board member, stated in a statement to The New York Times, \"This is a cynical attempt by a hostile A.G.'s office to generate defamatory headlines to try to torpedo a mutually beneficial settlement that is supported by so many other states and would result in billions of dollars going to communities and individuals across the country that need help.\"",
    " Title: President Obama's Remark on the Private Sector Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama found himself at the center of a political storm on Friday after he made an off-hand comment during a White House news conference that the private sector was \"doing fine.\" The statement opened the door for withering attacks from Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates.\n\nDuring the news conference, Obama was asked to respond to Republican criticisms that his economic policies were failing and that Europe's economic policies were to blame. In response, Obama highlighted the job creation in the private sector, stating that over 4.3 million jobs had been created during his two-year tenure, with 800,000 jobs added this year alone.\n\nHowever, Obama's comment that the private sector was \"doing fine\" was met with immediate criticism. House Speaker John Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney were among those who seized on the remark, arguing that the private sector was not in good shape.\n\nIn a Capitol Hill availability with journalists, Boehner was the first to respond, stating, \"Mr. President, I used to run a small business. And, Mr. President, take it from me, the private sector is not doing well.\" Cantor followed suit, saying, \"As the speaker said, we just listened to the president say the private sector is doing fine. I would say Mr. President, are you kidding? Did you see the jobs numbers last week? The private sector is not doing fine.\"\n\nRomney, on the campaign trail in Iowa, also weighed in, saying, \"He said the private sector is doing fine. Is he really that out of touch?\"\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell and many other Republicans also joined in the criticism, using the hashtag #doingfine on Twitter to express their disapproval.\n\nThe remark may have been a response to the way Democrats, including Obama, criticized Senator John McCain in 2008 when he said, \"The fundamentals of our economy are strong\" during the height of the Great Recession.\n\nJohn Dickerson, who writes for Slate and does political analysis for CBS News, suggested that Obama's remark could be seen as a lack of concern for the very poor. In a tweet, he wrote, \"`private sector is doing fine' = `not concerned about the very poor.' Discuss.\"\n\nIn an attempt to clarify his remarks, Obama told journalists during a photo op with Philippine President Benigno Aquino that he was not out of touch with reality and that he understood that the economy as a whole was not \"fine.\"\n\nThe White House later clarified that Obama was referring to the fact that the private sector had been adding jobs throughout the recovery, while state and local governments had been shedding jobs, which had helped to restrain job growth. However, the damage had already been done, and the \"private sector is doing fine\" remark was likely to be a recurring theme in the political discourse in the coming days.",
    " Title: Republican Party Faces Internal Divide After Contentious Nomination Race\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican Party is grappling with internal discord following the tumultuous nomination race, according to comments made by Mr. Buchanan. He stated, \"Putting the party back together again will be very hard after this nomination race.\" The party, he believes, may shift towards a more nationalist, tribal, and protectionist stance, with a focus on border protection.\n\nThis internal strife within the Republican ranks has been brewing since the end of the George W. Bush administration, initially over policy differences and later over the party's response to the country's evolving demography. While some party leaders, such as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, argue that the Republican Party is in a \"demographic death spiral\" and must appeal to Hispanics and young people to survive, many voters view such statements as a concession.\n\nInstead, these voters yearn for an uncompromising brand of conservatism that confronts rather than accommodates the political establishment, a sentiment that has been reinforced by conservative talk radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh and commentators like Ann Coulter, whose influential rhetoric shapes the party's agenda.\n\nLaura Ingraham, a talk-show host who played a significant role in the primary election defeat of Eric Cantor, then the House majority leader, in 2014, echoed this sentiment, stating, \"All the things the voters want have been shoved off to the sidelines by Republican leaders. And the voters finally have a couple of people here who are saying this table has to be turned over.\"\n\nRegardless of the nominee, the party's divisions will be challenging to mend. If an establishment candidate secures the nomination, the highly energized supporters of Trump and Cruz may rebel, with about two-thirds of Trump supporters indicating they would vote for him as a third-party candidate, according to a Suffolk University/USA Today poll last month. This could potentially aid the Democratic nominee.\n\nIf Mr. Cruz is nominated, he will need to win over party leaders without appearing to betray his anti-establishment supporters. A Fox News poll released on Friday found that 66 percent of Cruz supporters in Iowa felt \"betrayed\" by politicians in their party.\n\nIn the event party leaders support Mr. Trump, they would need to run parallel campaigns, backing a candidate who has advocated for mass deportation of illegal immigrants and a temporary ban on Muslims, while simultaneously attempting to diversify their predominantly white male base.",
    " Title: Clinton Email Scandal: A Closer Look at the Allegations and Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing controversy surrounding the emails sent and received by Hillary Clinton during her tenure as U.S. Secretary of State has escalated, with Clinton admitting to deleting 30,000 government emails and using a personal server for official correspondence.\n\nFederal law defines emails used during the course of one's work for the federal government as the property of the federal government. Clinton could have designated which of the government's emails were personal and then asked the government to send them to her and delete them from government servers. Instead, she decided which of her emails were governmental and sent them on to the State Department. Under federal law, that is not a determination she may lawfully make.\n\nClinton's decision to use a personal server for government emails has raised concerns about the potential theft of metadata and the denial of the opportunity for the government to trace those emails. When asked why she chose to divert government emails through her own server, Clinton stated she believed it would enable her to carry just one mobile device for both personal and governmental emails. However, she later admitted she carried four such devices.\n\nThe scandal took a more serious turn when Clinton's lawyers revealed that after deleting the 30,000 emails and printing the 55,000 she surrendered to the feds, she had the server that carried and stored them professionally wiped clean. Clinton has denied routing classified materials through her server, but both the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community found four classified emails among a random sample of 40.\n\nOne of the four emails was found to be top secret, containing satellite imagery of a foreign country and intercepts of communications among foreign agents. If Clinton is indicted for failure to secure classified information, she will likely argue that if one of the above markings was not on the email, she did not know it was top secret. However, this argument could be met with a judicial instruction to the jury trying her case, stating that the secretary of state is presumed to know what is top secret and what is not.\n\nThe potential consequences of Clinton's behavior with the nation's most sensitive secrets are still uncertain. In the past month, the Department of Justice has indicted individuals for similar offenses, including a young sailor who took a selfie in front of a sonar screen on a nuclear submarine and emailed the selfie to his girlfriend, and a Marine who sent an urgent warning to his superiors on his Gmail account about a dangerous Afghan spy. The emailing Marine was indicted for failure to secure classified materials.\n\nThe future course of action remains to be seen, as the FBI continues its investigation and the White House has yet to comment on the matter. The public's reaction to any potential indictment or lack thereof will be a significant factor in the political landscape moving forward.",
    " Title: U.S. Citizens Slaughtered in Mexico, International Issue Arises\n\nArticle:\n\nAt least three women and six children, all apparently U.S. citizens, were killed by drug cartel gunmen in northern Mexico, according to Mexican officials. Six children were found alive, one child had a bullet wound, and one child is still missing.\n\nThe incident occurred in a rural, mountainous area on the Sonora-Chihuahua border. Mexican Security Secretary Alfonso Durazo suggested that the gunmen may have mistaken the group's large SUVs for rival gangs. At least five children have been taken to Phoenix, Arizona for treatment.\n\nThe slaughter of U.S. citizens on Mexican soil has become an international issue, with U.S. President Donald Trump tweeting, \"This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.\"\n\nMexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador refused this approach, stating at a Tuesday news conference, \"The worst thing you can have is war.\" He added, \"We declared war, and it did not work. That is not an option.\"\n\nThis is the second failure in recent weeks for L\u00f3pez Obrador's \"hugs not bullets\" anti-crime strategy. Two weeks ago, Mexican troops had to release a drug lord after his supporters mounted armed attacks in Culiacan, Sinaloa.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted, \"The United States stands ready, willing & able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively.\" He also stated, \"The great new President of Mexico has made this a big issue, but the cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!\"\n\nThe victims lived in the hamlet of La Mora in Sonora state, a decades-old settlement founded as part of an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The group was attacked while traveling in a convoy of SUVs.\n\nA relative, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, stated that the burned-out, bullet-ridden SUV containing the remains of his nephew's wife and her four children - twin 6-month-old babies and two other children aged 8 and 10 - were found.\n\nTwo women and two other children were later found dead. A relative said, \"The mafia vehicles got her and four of her kids, and then set their vehicle on fire, burnt them to a crisp.\"\n\nDurazo stated that police, soldiers, and the National Guard were searching the area for the missing child. The relative speculated that it was a case of mistaken identity, as the gunmen may have opened fire on the vehicle because it was an SUV.\n\nDurazo also stated that the Sinaloa cartel had an important presence on the Sonora-Chihuahua border, but that a rival cartel was trying to invade the territory from the Chihuahua side.\n\nAnother relative, Julian LeBaron, stated on his Facebook page that one of the dead women was Rhonita Maria LeBaron. Jhon LeBaron, another relative, posted on his Facebook page that his aunt and another woman were dead, and that six of his aunt's children had been left abandoned but alive on a roadside.\n\nIt would not be the first time that members of the break-away church had been attacked in northern Mexico, where their forebears settled - often in Chihuahua state - decades ago. In 2009, Benjamin LeBaron, an anti-crime activist who was related to those killed in Monday's attack, was murdered in neighboring Chihuahua state.",
    " Title: Bipartisan U.S. Senators Introduce Tougher Sanctions on Russia and Cyber Crime\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced legislation on Thursday aimed at imposing stricter sanctions on Russia and combating cybercrime. The bill seeks to punish Moscow for its activities in Syria, Ukraine, and alleged interference in U.S. elections.\n\nThe proposed legislation includes restrictions on new Russian sovereign debt transactions, energy and oil projects, and Russian uranium imports. It also imposes new sanctions on Russian political figures and oligarchs.\n\nThe bill expresses strong support for NATO and requires a two-thirds Senate majority to vote in favor of any attempt to leave the alliance. Russian markets reacted swiftly to the measure, with the rouble slumping toward two-week lows.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the measure's lead sponsors, stated, \"The current sanctions regime has failed to deter Russia from meddling in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections.\" Earlier this week, Graham had announced plans for a \"sanctions bill from hell\" to punish Russia.\n\nCongress passed a Russia sanctions bill last summer, but some lawmakers expressed dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump's perceived reluctance to implement it. He signed the bill only after Congress passed it with overwhelming majorities.\n\nSeveral provisions of the measure introduced on Thursday aim to strengthen the previous law. Democratic Senator Bob Menendez stated that the administration had not fully complied with those sanctions.\n\n\"This bill is the next step in tightening the screws on the Kremlin and will bring to bear the full condemnation of the United States Congress so that Putin finally understands that the U.S. will not tolerate his behavior any longer,\" Menendez said.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats united last month in condemning Trump's failure to publicly condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin for interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections. However, Congress failed to pass any legislation before lawmakers went on their weeks-long summer recess.\n\nThe bill would need to pass both the Senate and House of Representatives and be signed by Trump to become law. Aides to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell referred questions about the bill to the Senate Banking Committee. A committee spokeswoman had no details on what measures the panel might consider.\n\nMcConnell stated last month that Senate committees should hold hearings on legislation to prevent Russia from future election meddling. Both the Banking and Foreign Relations Committees have since scheduled hearings relating to Russia.",
    " Title: Putin Secures Constitutional Changes in Russia, Allowing Potential Stay in Power Until 2036\n\nArticle:\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin appears to have secured a significant political victory with 78 percent of votes counted in a national referendum that could extend his tenure in office until 2036. The referendum, which proposed more than 200 constitutional amendments, includes a provision that resets presidential term limits, allowing Putin to run for two more six-year terms in 2024 and 2030 if he chooses.\n\nAccording to official results after 98 percent of ballots had been counted, Putin, who has ruled Russia for more than two decades as president or prime minister, had easily won the right to run for two more terms. The Central Election Commission reported that 78 percent of votes counted across Russia supported the constitutional changes, while just over 21 percent voted against.\n\nThe Kremlin had emphasized more than 200 other issues in the polls, but these amounted to little more than fine print on the ballot papers. The vote was marked by several irregularities, including online voting and a nearly week-long opportunity for citizens to cast their ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe most novel aspect of Wednesday's election was the announcement of early results by the Central Election Commission before polls had closed in many parts of the country. In Moscow, results from the polls in Russia's Far East, seven hours ahead of the Russian capital, were announced with just around 1 percent of the ballots counted.\n\nThe opposition leader Alexei Navalny's movement Anti-Corruption Foundation published a video showing one polling station had taken it upon itself to submit ballots on behalf of a family that had never voted before. There was also a small protest in Moscow on Wednesday night.\n\nThe result does not set Putin's future in stone. It does, however, pave the way for him to potentially hold on to power until 2036, making him Russia's longest-serving ruler since Peter the Great. But he will have to run two more presidential campaigns, and if he chooses to do so, the question then will be how many people turn out to vote.",
    " Title: Florida High School Shooter's Alarming Behavior Preceded Massacre, Authorities and Witnesses Recount\n\nArticle:\n\nThe teenager charged with the deadly shooting at a Florida high school had previously alarmed authorities, neighbors, and classmates due to behaviors such as obsessing over weapons, shooting small animals with a pellet gun, and harassing neighbors' pets.\n\nOn Thursday, Nikolas Cruz admitted to being the gunman who entered the campus armed with an AR-15-style rifle and shot students he encountered in the hallways and on the school grounds, according to a complaint affidavit released late Thursday.\n\nIn September 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) received a tip about a YouTube commenter with the same name as Mr. Cruz who made an alarming claim: \"I'm going to be a professional school shooter.\" The FBI investigated but failed to link the comment to Mr. Cruz.\n\nThe 19-year-old former student, who had been expelled from the school, may have stalked one of the girls he killed, according to a senior law-enforcement official.\n\nNeighbors described Mr. Cruz as having a cold, cold stare, and a former neighbor, Malcolm Roxburgh, said, \"He had a very strange look in his eyes all the time.\"\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Cruz took an Uber car to his former high school just before classes were dismissed, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. He entered a school building with a legally purchased Smith & Wesson M & P 15 in a soft black bag. He readied his rifle and opened fire into five classrooms, the sheriff said, killing 17 and wounding more than a dozen.\n\nAuthorities have noted a trail of worrying signs that seem to have gone unheeded. Neighbors called the police, classmates said he was obsessed with guns, and campus security considered him troubled.\n\nOn Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said this looked like yet another attack preceded by signals. \"Perhaps we haven't been effective enough in intervening immediately to deal with that,\" Mr. Sessions said, speaking to a sheriffs association in Washington, D.C. on Thursday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced plans to redouble efforts to try to stop school violence. They didn't speak about gun control, focusing more on mental health.\n\nBroward County Public Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie put the focus on weapons, stating, \"Now is the time for this country to have a real conversation on sensible gun-control laws.\"\n\nMr. Cruz made his first appearance in court Thursday afternoon for a bond hearing, shuffling in shackles and wearing an orange outfit. He looked subdued and spoke only briefly, answering \"Yes, ma'am\" when asked to confirm his identity.\n\nJudge Kim Mollica informed Mr. Cruz that he faced 17 counts of premeditated murder and ordered him held without bond. His attorney, Assistant Public Defender Melisa McNeill, said she deferred any arguments until subsequent court proceedings.\n\nAfter the court proceeding, Gordon Weekes, chief assistant public defender in Broward County and part of Mr. Cruz's legal team, described the defendant as \"deeply disturbed, emotionally broken,\" and said he is on suicide watch. \"He fell between the cracks,\" the attorney said.\n\nThe defense is gathering Mr. Cruz's mental-health history and will explore his brain development and the possibility he had autism, according to Mr. Weekes.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Bennight, a bail bondsman in Mississippi, said he contacted the FBI after seeing the comment from \"nikolas cruz\" on one of his YouTube posts. He also said he reported the comment as spam to YouTube, which took it down. Mr. Bennight, who said he creates videos about his business, didn't recall what video received the alarming comment.\n\nFBI agents visited Mr. Bennight at the time and returned Wednesday, he confirmed in an interview. He said he felt the agency took the issue seriously. One agent told him they were limited in how they could respond because it wasn't a direct threat, Mr. Bennight said.\n\n\"I wish the information could have prevented something like this from happening,\" he said in a new YouTube video, posted after the shooting.\n\nRobert Lasky, special agent in charge of the FBI's Miami field office, said the FBI \"conducted database reviews, checks, but was unable to further identify the person who actually made the comment.\"\n\nNone of that investigation led them to Mr. Cruz, who had developed a reputation in his upscale Parkland neighborhood as a socially awkward menace known to steal the mail of his neighbors, run through the yards of other homes, and hurt animals, according to neighbors and classmates.\n\nAlso on Thursday, a white supremacist group, Republic of Florida, told the Anti-Defamation League that Mr. Cruz was affiliated with the group, according to an ADL spokesman. The Republic of Florida didn't return calls for comment.\n\nFormer Douglas high-school student Kyle Ramos, who knew Mr. Cruz from the Army Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, said Mr. Cruz liked to get up early, around 6 a.m., and try to kill squirrels outside his house by shooting them with a pellet gun.",
    " Title: Jobs Report Shows Modest Growth in October, Leaves Little Impact on Election\n\nArticle:\n\nThe October jobs report, released on Friday, showed a gain of 171,000 jobs, exceeding most mainstream forecasts. The report has refocused the campaign spotlight on the economy, as the United States prepares for the upcoming presidential election on Tuesday.\n\nThe jobless rate increased to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent, denying President Barack Obama a clean opportunity to tout a quickening recovery. Both presidential campaigns used the report to reinforce their economic messages before the election.\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican candidate, stated during a campaign stop in West Allis, Wisconsin, \"He said he was going to lower the unemployment rate down to 5.2 percent right now, today we learned that it is actually 7.9 percent and that's 9 million jobs short of what he promised.\" He emphasized that unemployment was higher when Obama took office in January 2009 and peaked around 10 percent in October of that year.\n\nUnemployment was at 7.8 percent when Obama moved into the White House, and a year ago at this time, unemployment was at 9 percent. Romney's surrogates portrayed the job growth as far from satisfactory and any positive interpretation as falling short of what should be expected.\n\nPresident Obama and White House officials, on the other hand, highlighted the continuing trend of job growth as a reason to maintain the current course. Obama stated at a campaign rally in Hilliard, Ohio, \"In 2008 we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and today our businesses have created nearly five and a half million new jobs and this morning we learned that companies hired more workers in October than in any time in the last eight months.\"\n\nThe October gains are in line with the recent trend and are unlikely to significantly alter the course of the campaign, with swing-state polls suggesting Obama is slightly ahead. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, stated, \"These job numbers shouldn't play an important role in the election. They are not strong enough to help the president, not weak enough to help Governor Romney.\"\n\nJohn Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo, said the report might provide a modest benefit to Obama but does not change the overall picture of the economy. \"It's better than expectations and prior months were revised higher. We've got sustained growth of about 2 percent a year and no return to recession,\" he said.",
    " Title: Chicago Police-ICE Agreement Sparks Concern Among Immigrant Rights Activists Ahead of City Council Vote on Sanctuary Law Amendments\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Chicago City Council prepares to vote on amendments to the city's \"sanctuary\" law, a recently disclosed agreement between the Chicago Police Department (CPD) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has raised concerns among immigrant rights activists.\n\nThe agreement, signed by former CPD Superintendent Eddie Johnson in April, allows ICE to designate certain CPD employees as \"customs officers.\" These officers are authorized to enforce a full range of federal offenses but are not permitted to enforce administrative violations of immigration law.\n\nCPD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi stated that there are no department employees currently deputized as \"customs officers.\" However, he defended the agreement, explaining that it allows police to investigate drug trafficking, human trafficking, gangs, and financial crimes through Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a branch of ICE.\n\nRey Wences, a member of Organized Communities Against Deportations, expressed concern about the agreement. Wences helped draft amendments to the Welcoming Cities ordinance, which are set for a full City Council vote on Wednesday. The amendments prohibit CPD from assisting ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and Homeland Security Investigations in enforcing civil immigration operations and require the department to keep track of every request for assistance it receives.\n\nWences stated that she was unaware of the agreement between CPD and ICE, as were Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th) and Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd), who introduced the amendments in December with Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\n\n\"Police-ICE collaboration is police-ICE collaboration, no matter how you paint it,\" Wences said. \"The existence of this agreement... makes you wonder what other kinds of agreements the city has [with ICE].\"\n\nAld. Rodriguez stated that the agreement \"goes against the spirit of the Welcoming Cities ordinance.\"\n\nThe mayor's office and ICE officials did not respond to requests for comments Tuesday.\n\nThe Homeland Security Investigations office was created in 2010 to handle a range of criminal investigations such as weapons smuggling and child sex tourism. ICE has routinely insisted Homeland Security Investigations is separate from its Enforcement and Removal Operations, which handles all deportations.\n\nHowever, under the Trump administration, the line between both branches of ICE has blurred. In 2017, former ICE acting director Tom Homan told Homeland Security Investigations to increase time spent on worksite raids \"by four to five times.\"\n\nWithin two years, Homeland Security Investigations had conducted several high-profile raids across the country, including a raid of seven food processing plants in Mississippi that landed nearly 700 undocumented immigrant workers in detention. (Almost half of them were released the next day.)\n\nA 2019 report by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, the National Immigrant Justice Center, and the National Immigration Law Center criticized Homeland Security Investigations for engaging in racial profiling as it targets criminal gangs across the country.\n\n\"It is no longer a secret that HSI agents use the 'gang' label as a cover for engaging in widespread round-ups of immigrant youth of color,\" the report states.\n\nIn Boston, a similar agreement between the local police department and ICE led to widespread criticism after it was revealed that officials \"regularly offer information back and forth between the agencies,\" as reported by NPR-affiliate WBUR.\n\nGuglielmi stated that he does not believe incidents similar to those in Boston will occur in Chicago and is confident CPD officers will obey the Welcoming Cities ordinance.\n\n\"Our core focus of this department is to protect every resident of the city. We don't care where you were born,\" he said.\n\nFreddy Martinez, a policy analyst at Open the Government who obtained a copy of the CPD-ICE agreement through an open records request, questioned cooperation between immigration authorities and sanctuary cities.\n\n\"We know ICE uses deceptive practices to get CPD to cooperate with them on immigration enforcement, with or without their knowledge,\" Martinez said. \"Significant questions remain about why [CPD] felt the need to enter into these types of agreements when there are no officers deputized to assist ICE.\"",
    " Title: Iran's Economic Struggles and the Pursuit of Sanctions Relief\n\nArticle:\n\nIran's economy is currently experiencing difficulties, but not everyone in the country is equally affected. In a downtown Tehran restaurant, a young man, who prefers to remain anonymous and identifies himself as Ahmad, sits with a friend, enjoying a water pipe of flavored tobacco. Ahmad, who describes himself as an independent trader in the petrochemical business, shares a common sentiment that President Hassan Rouhani has brought a more positive atmosphere to the country but has not implemented significant economic changes.\n\nAhmad's personal struggles, however, may not evoke much sympathy from most Iranians. He expresses concerns about the high import tariffs, citing a 105% tariff on each car imported into Iran. Despite this, he admits to wanting to import two Mercedes, but finds it financially impractical.\n\nIncome inequality is one of the challenges President Rouhani faces, but he maintains that better economic times are on the horizon for Iran. Iranians are hopeful about his promises, but beyond the marginal improvements that come with greater confidence in the new administration, little has changed on the ground.\n\nIranians are pinning their hopes on a nuclear agreement and improved relations with the outside world, achievements that are seen as difficult to achieve. Another major problem Rouhani faces in lifting Iran's economy is the opposition of entrenched interests that profit from Iran's isolation, such as the powerful Revolutionary Guard, which is a significant economic player.\n\nOne graduate student, who only gives his first name, Arman, states that things were at their worst under former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. \"What was really frustrating was the fact that nothing was ever going to get better, because the more sanctions there were going to be, the richer some people are going to get,\" Arman says.\n\nIn the poor neighborhoods of south Tehran, the economic struggles are more apparent. Iran remains an economy of subsidies, although some direct cash payments have been replaced by food baskets for the poor. This change does not sit well with those forced to stand in line in the winter cold. Even there, however, flashes of humor can be found.\n\nAn old man in a wool cap startles a reporter by shouting, \"We chant 'Death to America' all the time! What are you doing here asking questions?\" But then, as the men around him break into grins, he smiles and says, \"Well, I guess you're OK then.\"\n\nMehdi, a 77-year-old man, makes it clear that they may need help, but they do not like food lines. They know the difference between a poor neighborhood and a refugee camp. \"This is the fourth time I've come,\" Mehdi says. \"They tell me to come back later, and then they say they've run out. It's not right.\"\n\nBesides a slight easing of sanctions last month, Iran has benefited from the widespread conviction that Rouhani's economic team is far more competent than Ahmadinejad's. Greater confidence\u2014along with limited success in nuclear negotiations with six world powers\u2014has helped reverse Iran's brutal inflation rate and stabilized the Iranian rial somewhat against the dollar.\n\nHowever, achieving more will require the lifting of sanctions by further curtailing Iran's nuclear program, an effort that has enemies at home and abroad. Conservative Israeli and U.S. watchdogs such as United Against Nuclear Iran sound regular alarms that \"the architecture of the sanctions regime is crumbling,\" largely based on an increase in trade delegations visiting Iran and inflated Iranian predictions. President Obama says Washington will come down \"like a ton of bricks\" on those who violate sanctions.\n\nBut inside Iran, people are not seeing any improvements that would justify such concerns. Even the man in charge of making Iran's oil contracts more attractive to foreign companies is tempering expectations. Oil ministry official Mehdi Hosseini says Iran needs a massive $150 billion in foreign investment in the coming years, and so far, companies are not committing.\n\n\"We still have sanctions now,\" Hosseini says. \"There are companies coming and going, but we can't sign contracts while the sanctions remain, and contract talks will take time.\"\n\nFor now, Iranians say, there's nothing to do but struggle on, recognizing that better times ahead depend on factors beyond their control.",
    " Title: White House Fires Top Aide Over Discrepancy in Tillerson's Dismissal Account\n\nThe White House has reportedly terminated Steve Goldstein, the Under Secretary of State, due to his contradiction of the White House account regarding President Donald Trump's dismissal of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The Associated Press first reported the firing, citing officials.\n\nThe reported dismissal was prompted by a statement from Goldstein on Tuesday, in which he stated that Tillerson was not aware of the reason behind his dismissal and did not speak with Trump before his termination. This account differs from the one provided by a White House official, who stated that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly informed Tillerson on Friday that Trump would fire him.\n\nTrump announced on Tuesday that he made the decision to oust Tillerson on his own and that Tillerson would be \"much happier now.\" The President and Tillerson had reportedly clashed on multiple occasions, most notably after reports that Tillerson referred to Trump as a \"moron\" in private.\n\nThe White House later announced that Heather Nauert, previously the State Department's spokesperson, had been named as Goldstein's replacement. The specific reasons for Goldstein's account differing from the White House's account are unavailable.",
    " Title: Top 10 Notable Segments from \"The Daily Show\" and \"The Colbert Report\" in 2013\n\nArticle:\n\nThis year has been marked by a series of significant events in the United States, including the NSA spying controversy, the government shutdown, and the release of the song \"Accidental Racist\" by LL Cool J and Brad Paisley. In response to these events, \"The Daily Show\" and \"The Colbert Report\" have provided a satirical and humorous perspective, helping Americans cope with the tumultuous year. Here are ten notable moments from both shows:\n\n1. \"Oopsie Daisy Homophobe\" - Stephen Colbert and actor Alan Cumming performed a musical parody of the controversial song \"Accidental Racist,\" titled \"Oopsie Daisy Homophobe.\"\n\n2. John Oliver's 3-part series on gun control in Australia - John Oliver, who hosted \"The Daily Show\" during the summer and recently left the show, investigated Australia's strict gun control measures in response to mass shootings, a topic that the U.S. has yet to address.\n\n3. Jessica Williams' segments on race in America - Notable segments include her piece on food stamps and the \"Frisky Business\" segment, which exposes the hypocrisy and racism of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's stop-and-frisk program.\n\n4. Daft Punk's last-minute cancellation and Colbert's response - After Daft Punk cancelled a \"Colbert Report\" performance, Colbert spoiled the band's VMA performance, criticizing MTV and suggesting that the band's popularity would wane after their initial performance.\n\n5. Aasif Mandvi's expose on North Carolina GOP leader Don Yelton - Mandvi uncovered Yelton's controversial comments in support of voter ID laws, leading to his resignation and a subsequent defense of his remarks.\n\n6. Fox News' War on Christmas - Every December, \"The Daily Show\" and \"The Colbert Report\" often joke about Fox News' perceived war on Christmas. This year, Megyn Kelly was enraged by the idea of a black Santa Claus.\n\n7. The Best F#@king News Team Ever's parody of CNN's shoddy news coverage - The parody is a tribute to CNN's poor journalistic standards.\n\n8. Jon Stewart's verbal assaults on the GOP during the government shutdown - One notable moment includes Stewart calling House Republicans \"self-righteous Orwellian zebra queefs.\"\n\n9. \"Pointless Counter Pointless\" - Colbert hosted a parody program of CNN's \"Crossfire,\" featuring special guests Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird debating various topics.\n\n10. Former President Bill Clinton's Twitter debut - Clinton joined Twitter with the handle \"PrezBillyJeff,\" admitting his insecurity with the social media platform.",
    " Title: Republican Party's Stance on Gun Control: A Look at the Challenges Ahead\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, have prompted calls from Democrats for the GOP-controlled Senate to take action on gun control, particularly passing a bill that would establish universal background checks. However, the likelihood of significant gun control measures passing in the current political climate is uncertain.\n\nPolls show that Republican voters prioritize gun rights over gun control but are not universally opposed to restrictions on firearms. Most Republicans support expanding background checks, \"red flag\" provisions, and requiring a license to purchase a gun. Yet, the Republican Party as an institution is generally hostile to gun control measures.\n\nOne reason for this is the political identity within the GOP, which is closely tied to gun rights. A vote for gun control measures, even popular ones, could potentially make a Republican elected official appear \"anti-gun\" or \"of the left,\" making them electorally vulnerable.\n\nAnother factor is the influence of powerful gun rights organizations such as the National Rifle Association (NRA) and other activist groups. The average Republican member of Congress is more conservative than two decades ago, and this conservatism likely extends to gun policy as well. The party is actively working to expand gun rights at the state level, such as allowing people to carry concealed weapons without permits.\n\nThe NRA is a powerful American interest group with millions of members, constant pressure, and a significant number of single-issue voters who could potentially abandon a representative over the issue. This power of single-issue voters is one of the most underappreciated aspects of politics.\n\nIn 1994, the U.S. adopted an assault weapons ban, with 38 House Republicans and 10 GOP senators voting in favor. Twenty-five years later, only eight Republicans backed the background checks bill that passed the House earlier this year. Republican voters may be moving towards embracing gun control measures, but don't expect the Republican Party to move significantly anytime soon.",
    " Title: Hydroxychloroquine Shows Promise in Treating Coronavirus, According to Early Studies\n\nArticle:\n\nA drug commonly used to treat malaria, hydroxychloroquine, is showing promise in laboratory and clinical studies for the treatment of coronavirus. French researchers found that hydroxychloroquine lowered virus levels in most patients who took part in a clinical study this month. The results of a clinical trial in France and studies conducted in lab settings are building hope that a drug usually used to treat malaria and arthritis can treat and possibly cure coronavirus patients, though scientists say more data is needed before drawing a firm conclusion.\n\nOn Tuesday, a team of French scientists released the first results of a clinical study of the use of hydroxychloroquine on 24 coronavirus patients from southeast France. The research team, led by Didier Raoult, a renowned infectious disease expert from l'Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire in Marseille, administered the drug for 10 days along with azithromycin, a common antibiotic. Researchers said the drugs cleared the virus in the nose and throat of most observed patients in three to six days. After six days of treatment, 70 percent of patients administered hydroxychloroquine were clear of the virus, compared to just 12.5 percent of patients who were not given drugs.\n\nAzithromycin boosted the effect of hydroxychloroquine, according to the study. After six days of treatment, all patients treated with the drug combination \"were virologically cured,\" compared to 57.1 percent of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine by itself. \"We therefore recommend that COVID-19 patients be treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to cure their infection and to limit the transmission of the virus to other people in order to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the world,\" wrote researchers, who acknowledged the small sample size of the study.\n\nLab studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine, which was developed in the 1940s, inhibited coronavirus. A study published in Cell Discovery on Wednesday by three Chinese scientists found that hydroxychloroquine inhibited coronavirus in vitro, or in a lab culture.\n\nMore clinical trials are underway. A researcher at Asan Medical Center, a top research hospital in South Korea, is conducting a clinical trial of 150 patients with mild cases of coronavirus. The lead researcher, Sung-Han Kim, estimates that the trial will be completed in May. According to NBC News, French drug maker Sanofi is working with health authorities to study whether hydroxychloroquine can help with coronavirus. The company is encouraged by preliminary findings, according to NBC News, but still does not have enough data to determine its efficacy.\n\nHealth officials in Belgium and South Korea have recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for patients displaying either severe or mild symptoms from COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus. The United Kingdom appears to have some hope for the drug. On Sunday, government officials there banned the export and hoarding of hydroxychloroquine and two other drugs that could be useful as therapeutics, according to Pharmaceutical Technology.",
    " Title: Former Benghazi Investigator Alleges Partisan Shift in Committee's Focus\n\nArticle:\n\nA former investigator for the Select Committee on Benghazi, Air Force Reserve Maj. Bradley Podliska, has claimed that the investigation, which he initially perceived as non-partisan, shifted its focus towards former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Podliska, an intelligence officer, made these statements during an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday.\n\nPodliska, who was fired from the committee, alleges that he was partially let go for not focusing his investigation heavily enough on Clinton, who was the U.S. Secretary of State during the 2012 Benghazi attack that resulted in the death of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.\n\nHowever, on Sunday, the chairman of the House panel, Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, released a statement denying Podliska's allegations. Gowdy stated that Podliska was improperly focused on Clinton, and that the committee is seeking a \"definitive accounting\" of the attacks.\n\nPodliska, who identifies as a conservative Republican, has stated that his allegations are not partisan. He said, \"I would just like to state that I am going to vote for the Republican nominee in 2016. I do not support Hillary Clinton for president.\"\n\nPodliska further stated, \"Hillary Clinton has a lot of explaining to do. We, however, did not need to shift resources to hyperfocus on Hillary Clinton. We did not need to de-emphasize, and in some cases drop, the investigation on different agencies, different organizations, and different individuals.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Benghazi committee \"vigorously denies all of his allegations.\" The statement further states, \"The employee was terminated, in part, because he himself manifested improper partiality and animus in his investigative work.\"\n\nPodliska told CNN the victims' families are not going to get the truth. He said, \"I know this because the nine months of research I had done is not lost. I have no idea where it is, and I know that I could give those victims' families\u2026 a pretty thorough explanation of why they were told that this attack was due to a video.\"",
    " Title: \"Dreamers' Shutdown: A Political Stalemate Over Immigration Policy\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent government shutdown, variously referred to as the Trump shutdown, the Schumer shutdown, and the Dreamer shutdown, has been a result of a prolonged standoff between Democrats and Republicans over the issue of Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.\n\nFor months, Dreamers have urged Democrats to block government funding unless a bill granting them citizenship rights was included. On Friday, Democrats heeded this call, mounting a filibuster of a four-week spending bill, denying the government the necessary funds to remain open.\n\nDreamers celebrated the shutdown, stating they were finally being taken seriously. Cata Santiago, a Dreamer, said in a statement, \"We know that the public is on our side. We are calling for the immigrant community and our allies to take to the streets immediately to demand that Congress pass legislation guaranteeing permanent protection for immigrant youth NOW.\"\n\nThe shutdown has left many senators stunned, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stating, \"Almost everybody on both sides doesn't understand how we ended up here.\" McConnell laid blame squarely at the feet of the Dreamer debate, saying Democrats held the entire process hostage to the immigration talks.\n\nDemocrats suggested there were other sticking points, but acknowledged immigration and the fate of the Dreamers was the chief hurdle. However, they said the hold-up was President Trump's demands for major changes in immigration policy, which the White House said had to be passed along with any action on Dreamers.\n\nThe Dreamers and their immigrant-rights allies now find themselves in a similar position as conservative and tea party groups, who pressured Republicans into an Obamacare-fueled shutdown in 2013. That shutdown lasted 16 days, and Republicans relented in the end, walking away with no substantive gains.\n\nDreamers are likely to emerge from this shutdown in better shape, with most lawmakers saying they do want to find a solution for them. For now, the Dreamers await the outcome, though they were emboldened by their show of political power.\n\nFrank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a pro-immigration lobby group, said, \"Our fight has never been about a government shutdown; it's about a policy breakthrough. It's not about political advantage; it's about people's lives.\"\n\nDeemed the most sympathetic figures in the immigration debate, most Dreamers were brought to the U.S. by parents with little say in the decision, and many don't have substantive memories of their home countries. They began \"coming out\" as illegal immigrants in the last decade, and quickly became a political force, earning invitations to the State of the Union address, meeting at the White House with President Barack Obama, and addressing the Democratic National Convention.\n\nThey came close to a solution in 2010, when legislation known as the Dream Act\u2014which they took their name from\u2014cleared the House and came close to passing the Senate, falling in a GOP-led filibuster. Their power has grown in the years since, and they felt emboldened last year to demand a shutdown fight. Democrats balked the first few times, but finally agreed to a self-imposed Jan. 19 deadline for action.\n\nHowever, the actual firm deadline for Dreamers is March 5, which is when President Trump's phaseout of the Obama-era DACA deportation amnesty, protecting some 690,000 Dreamers, begins to expire. More than 100 Dreamers are losing status each day now, but those are ones who didn't manage to renew their status by Homeland Security's Oct. 5 deadline.\n\nSen. Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who has led the fight on their behalf for years, said it was a travesty for Congress to have not solved their situation. \"To say we're in no hurry\u2014well, we may not be as senators and congressmen, but these young people are in a hurry to find out whether or not they have a life. That's what it comes down to,\" Mr. Durbin said.\n\nRepublicans countered that they, too, wanted to grant long-term certainty to Dreamers, but didn't want a new amnesty to invite another wave of illegal immigration. They demanded more border security and other policy changes be tied to any Dreamer legislation. \"We can not deal with the issue of individuals in our country illegally...and ignore how it happened in the first place,\" said Sen. James Lankford, Oklahoma Republican.",
    " Title: Disparity in U.S. Unemployment Rates: Five States Below 4% While Others Remain High\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data for June 2021 reveals a significant disparity in unemployment rates across different states, with five states reporting rates below 4%. The states with exceptionally low unemployment figures are primarily located in the Great Plains, where an energy boom has contributed to the economy.\n\nNorth Dakota, with its shale-rich resources, reported a jobless rate of just 2.7% in June. Nebraska, Utah, and South Dakota followed closely with unemployment rates of 3.5%. Wyoming, the only state with a 4% unemployment rate, was the only other state in the Great Plains with a rate below 5%.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, employment remains high in several formerly industrial states and those with poor populations. Rhode Island, deprived of its factory workers and people from the financial services industry, had an unemployment rate of 7.9% in June. Mississippi, with one of the poorest populations in the country based on median household income, also reported an unemployment rate of 7.9%. In another poor state, Kentucky, the jobless rate is 7.4%, and it is higher in the eastern counties that were once a center of coal production.\n\nIllinois, one of the most factory-rich northern states, had an unemployment rate of 7.1% in June. Michigan's was 7.5%, and Nevada, home to the greatest real estate collapse of the Great Recession, which gutted construction jobs, had a jobless rate of 7.7%.\n\nIt is reasonable to conclude that if the U.S. economy is to have a normal, fully recovered jobless rate of 5% or better, these most troubled states have a long way to go to contribute. There is no discernible economic composition in these states that makes such a recovery likely.\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a content partner offering financial news and commentary.

    " Title: Unemployment Benefits Extension: A Contentious Issue in Upcoming Stimulus Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nIn late March, Congress passed the largest stimulus package in American history, a $2 trillion bill aimed at mitigating the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. One of the key provisions of the bill was an enhancement of unemployment insurance benefits for those who lost their jobs due to stay-at-home orders related to the virus.\n\nAs of now, nearly 39 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the past nine weeks. The benefits are designed to replace a certain percentage of an unemployed worker's lost income. The amount of money given out can vary significantly from state to state, ranging from an average of $213 a week in Mississippi to $555 in Massachusetts. The stimulus bill added an extra $600 a week from the federal government to each of these state payments.\n\nThese enhanced benefits are set to end on July 31, unless Congress votes to extend them. The issue is expected to be a key point of contention as Congress considers its next stimulus bill in the coming weeks. House Democrats have passed a bill that would continue the $600 bonus through the end of January. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham stated that the GOP would allow an extension \"over our dead bodies.\"\n\nOpposition to extending the enhanced benefits centers around the claim that the program will hinder the country's economic recovery by providing an incentive for people to stay home rather than return to work. When combined with the average payout from states, a large number of workers are making more money on unemployment than they would if they were to return to their jobs. Workers typically lose their benefits if they turn down a \"suitable\" job offer, but some conservatives worry that the scale of joblessness in the country would make that provision impossible to enforce.\n\nThis imbalance could cause businesses to suffer, Republican lawmakers argue, if employees refuse to accept what would effectively be a pay cut by going back to work when stay-at-home orders are lifted. The situation could also create resentment among the millions of essential workers who have remained on the job during the crisis for less pay than those who were laid off.\n\nProponents of continuing the enhanced payments argue that the extra money has helped stave off an even more severe economic collapse. Despite unemployment at levels not seen since the Great Depression, many people have been able to make ends meet thanks to the boost in benefits. The larger checks also mean people have money to spend, which helps businesses stay afloat. If the extra funds go away, the country could see a wave of evictions, foreclosures, and other secondary economic impacts that result in a prolonged and severe recession, some economists have warned.\n\nOthers argue that incentives that compel workers to stay home are an important part of limiting the spread of coronavirus, which they see as the No. 1 priority. Not only would extending the enhanced benefits save lives, but lessening the severity of the outbreak would also ultimately benefit the economy more than a premature rush to push people back into the workplace, some public health experts say.\n\nRepublicans in the Senate have yet to release a plan for what might be in their next stimulus package, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stated that it \"won't look anything like\" the bill passed by Democrats in the House. The earliest any legislation could move forward will be the first week of June, when senators return from a weeklong recess.\n\nMatthew Yglesias, writing for Vox, stated, \"When people's incomes are stabilized, they pay their bills on time... and keep buying things. Since most workers who've been laid off are at the low end of the income spectrum and thus eligible for generous unemployment insurance benefits, the country has mostly avoided secondary shocks that would further exacerbate economic problems. So far.\"\n\nKristin Tate, writing for Fox News, said, \"It's obvious that this level of aid really disincentivizes productive activity in the market and it puts business owners in a terrible situation. A lot of small business owners, they are getting that green light to start reopening, but they're worried that their employees may prefer to stay home and get paid for that.\"",
    " Title: Obama's Healthcare Overhaul Threatens Democratic Party's Agenda and Liberalism's Future\n\nArticle:\n\nThe rollout of President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has put the reputation of Big Government progressivism at risk for at least this generation. The success or failure of Obamacare is not only a matter for this president but also for the future of the Democratic Party's plausible agenda and liberalism itself.\n\nIn his 2006 best-selling book, \"The Audacity of Hope,\" Obama criticized the achievements of the most recent Democratic president, Bill Clinton, stating that Clinton's policies were \"recognizably progressive if modest in their goals.\" This criticism, penned before Obama's presidency, now carries significant weight.\n\nConservative thinkers have seized on the rocky rollout of Obamacare as proof that the age-old argument over the proper role of state action in American life has reached a critical point for the Democrats. Columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote that the unraveling of Obamacare would \"catastrophically undermine\" the ideology of ever-expansive central government providing cradle-to-grave care for an ever-grateful citizenry.\n\nAnxious congressional Democrats face a fight-or-flight dilemma of their own. Abandoning Obamacare is no easy proposition, as they supported its creation and understand that their constituents need health care reform. The White House, for its part, maintains a positive outlook, with press secretary Jay Carney stating on Friday, \"This is obviously a challenge, and we're facing the challenge, and we're up to the challenge.\"\n\nHowever, more dispassionate analysts say it would be hard to overstate the danger of this moment for Obama and for Democrats more broadly. From the beginning, Obama sketched his agenda for the country as the sort that succeeds only once a generation, if then. The success or failure of Obamacare will significantly impact the Democratic Party's ability to pursue their plausible agenda and the future of liberalism.",
    " Title: Central American Migrants Arrive at U.S.-Mexico Border Despite Trump's Orders\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of Central American migrants, traveling in a caravan through Mexico, arrived at the border city of Tijuana late on Tuesday. The group, numbering approximately 600, had been making their way north from Mexico's southern border with Guatemala, a journey that began a month ago.\n\nBy evening, two busloads of men, women, and children had arrived in Tijuana, a city that borders southern California. The migrants, who fled their homes in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras due to lethal threats or political persecution, gazed toward San Diego, visible at spots through a rusty barrier or across a pedestrian bridge.\n\nAnother four busloads were making their way north from Hermosillo, a city 432 miles south of the border, where the migrants had been stalled for days. Many had clung to the hope of receiving asylum in the United States, but their prospects dimmed after U.S. authorities released statements on Monday stating they would be turned back.\n\nRodrigo Abeja, a coordinator from immigrant rights group Pueblo Sin Fronteras that has been organizing similar caravans for several years, said the caravan planned to regroup before making any decisions. \"They will wait for all those seeking asylum to be together,\" Abeja said.\n\nA third group, resigned to staying in Mexico, awaited processing for year-long visas by immigration authorities in Hermosillo. The number of migrants traveling together had decreased from a peak of about 1,500 people due to waiting for transportation and attacks by U.S. President Donald Trump, who began criticizing the caravan on Twitter in early April.\n\nAfter Trump's comments, Mexican authorities stalled the caravan in a southern town and began handing out temporary visas that gave them legal status to travel to the border. The U.S. President has ordered officials to repel the migrants.",
    " Title: Hurricane Hermine Makes Landfall in Florida, Threatens East Coast\n\nArticle:\n\nHurricane Hermine, the first hurricane to hit Florida in over a decade, caused significant damage to beachside buildings and toppled trees onto homes on Friday before moving inland. The storm weakened to a tropical storm and was spinning along the North Carolina coast late Friday, but the National Hurricane Center predicted it would regain hurricane strength over the weekend and potentially impact coastal areas as far north as Connecticut and Rhode Island through Labor Day.\n\nThe storm's projected path prompted New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to declare a state of emergency for three counties on the Atlantic Ocean on Saturday. In Florida, the main impact of Hermine was power outages and damage from storm surges. A homeless man south of Gainesville died when a tree fell on him, according to Governor Rick Scott.\n\nIn the coastal communities of Cedar Key and Steinhatchee, which were hit hard by the storm, Governor Scott pledged that businesses would be eligible for state assistance. However, it remains unclear whether Florida will receive federal disaster assistance as the state begins to clean up from the storm.\n\nAn estimated 325,000 people were without power statewide, and over 107,000 in neighboring Georgia, officials said. At 2 a.m. Saturday, the hurricane center said the tropical storm's center was about 60 miles west-northwest of Cape Lookout, North Carolina. The storm threatens a dangerous storm surge into Hampton Roads in southeast Virginia.\n\nHermine had top sustained winds of 60 mph and was moving northeast at 22 mph. Forecasters predict the system could strengthen back into a hurricane by Monday morning off the Maryland-Delaware coast before weakening again as it moves north. Tropical storm watches and warnings were posted up and down the coastline.\n\nAmtrak has cancelled or altered some service on the East Coast as the storm approaches. Back in Florida, a storm surge at Dekle Beach damaged numerous homes and destroyed storage buildings and a 100-yard fishing pier. The area is about 60 miles southeast of St. Marks, where Hermine made landfall at 1:30 a.m. in the Big Bend area, where Florida's peninsula and panhandle meet.\n\nIn nearby Steinhatchee, a storm surge crashed into Bobbi Pattison's home. She wore galoshes and was covered in black muck as she stood in her living room amid overturned furniture and an acrid smell. Tiny crabs darted around her floor. \"I had a hurricane cocktail party last night and God got even with me,\" she said with a chuckle. Where her bar once stood was now only wet sand and rubble.\n\nIn Keaton Beach, about two dozen people waited on a road just after sunrise Friday, trying to get to their homes. Police blocked the road because of flooding. Dustin Beach, 31, rushed there from a hospital in Tallahassee where his wife gave birth to a girl Thursday night to see if his home still stood. \"When my wife got up this morning, she said, 'Go home and check on the house. I need to know where we're going after we leave the hospital,'\" Beach said.\n\nHigh winds knocked trees onto several houses in Tallahassee, injuring people inside. It was sometime after midnight when Alan Autry, 48, started hearing the large pines in his Tallahassee neighborhood start to crack and fall to the ground. Then he heard one come down on the top floor of his house. The tree did not initially crash through the roof, and Autry and his wife went to a neighbor's house. Sometime before dawn, the corner of his house collapsed from the weight of the tree.\n\n\"We've been married 13 years and this is our fifth hurricane,\" said Autry, who moved from central Florida six years ago. \"By far, this is the worst damage we've ever had.\" Tampa and St. Petersburg escaped major damage. Up to 17 inches of rain fell in the area over the last two days.\n\nThe last hurricane to strike Florida was Wilma, a powerful Category 3 storm that arrived on Oct. 24, 2005. It swept across the Everglades and struck heavily populated south Florida, causing five deaths in the state and an estimated $23 billion in damage. The Florida governor declared an emergency in 51 counties and said about 6,000 National Guardsmen stood ready to mobilize for the storm's aftermath. The governors of Georgia and North Carolina also declared emergencies.",
    " Title: Gunman's Actions and Manifesto Aligned with White Nationalist Ideology, Online Trolling Tactics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe perpetrator of the recent shooting incident appears to have coordinated his actions with the typical online tactics of far-right instigators, engaging a community of like-minded supporters in real-time as they watched the events unfold. The manifesto, which expresses the author's intentions, explicitly states the usual unspoken objectives of internet trolls: to provoke outrage and stir up arguments among opponents.\n\nOne of the gunman's stated objectives was to \"agitate the political enemies of my people into action, to cause them to overextend their own hand and experience the eventual and inevitable backlash as a result.\" He also aimed to \"incite violence, retaliation, and further divide.\"\n\nThe manifesto, the chilling video, and the gunman's social media posts exhibit typical white nationalist rhetoric, layered with irony and meta jokes, making it challenging to discern what is genuine and what was considered humorous.\n\nThe gunman seems to have a profound interest in history, particularly events that align with a white nationalist narrative. He inscribed the names of centuries-old military leaders who led battles against predominantly nonwhite forces, as well as the names of individuals who recently carried out mass shootings against Jewish and Muslim communities, on his weapons.\n\nThe manifesto, steeped in anti-Muslim sentiment, refers to nonwhites as \"invaders\" who pose a threat to \"replace\" white people. The author's language and specific memes suggest a deep connection to the far-right online community.\n\nThe link to the livestreamed video was initially posted on the /pol/ forum of 8chan, a notorious far-right space, where the gunman was celebrated as a hero following the shooting. Some of his references were subtle, such as listening to a song associated with a 1995 Serbian nationalist video, which has recently been adopted as a racist meme, during his drive to the mosque.",
    " Title: Democrats Eye Gains in U.S. House of Representatives as Midterm Elections Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the central Virginia district of Spotsylvania, voters such as Meg Sneed and Cheryll Lesser are contributing to a significant shift in the political landscape. Sneed, who previously voted for the Republican incumbent, Dave Brat, in the last U.S. congressional elections, is now leaning towards the Democrat running against Brat, Abigail Spanberger. Lesser, who did not vote in the last election, is also considering voting for Spanberger due to her disapproval of President Donald Trump.\n\nThis trend is a key reason why Democrats believe they can win more than the 23 seats needed to seize control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the Nov. 6 midterm elections. Some predict that Democrats could take as many as 40 seats by flipping districts like Brat's in Virginia.\n\nEarlier this year, Brat's seat was considered safe. However, if a so-called \"blue wave\" materializes, it would roll through a district like his, which includes pockets of suburban voters who have been increasingly turning away from Republicans.\n\nDoug Heye, a former official at the Republican National Committee, noted, \"Republicans are playing defense in more and more places. The Democrats' map continues to get bigger. The Republicans' map continues to get smaller. That's a real problem.\"\n\nIf Democrats do take the House, much of Trump's agenda would be stalled, and his administration would fall under greater scrutiny. Republicans are favored to retain the Senate, but they must defend seats in several conservative states.\n\nDemocrats have poured resources into Brat's district, as well as other battleground districts in states such as Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Southern California, and other parts of Virginia, such as the district currently represented by Republican Scott Taylor. They have been backed by deep-pocketed advocacy groups such as House Majority PAC and NextGen, funded by California billionaire Tom Steyer.\n\nIn response, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican political action committee, is running ads attacking Spanberger, a sign that the party is genuinely worried about losing the seat.\n\nBrat, who shocked the political order by beating then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a Republican primary in 2014, has aligned himself with the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus. Last year, as protesters crashed his events during a House push to repeal former President Barack Obama's healthcare program, Brat remarked that \"women are in my grille no matter where I go.\"\n\nThe firestorm over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault while in high school, came at a perilous moment for Brat, given his already difficult reputation with some women voters. Trump has played a part in this, as both Sneed and Lesser were angry that he chose to attack Kavanaugh's accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, at a rally last week.\n\nKavanaugh was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on Saturday. Democratic activists hope discontent with his nomination will linger through November. Republicans, however, see the Kavanaugh fracas as galvanizing conservative voters who have been looking for a reason to come out and vote in November's elections.\n\nA 39-year-old former officer for the Central Intelligence Agency, Spanberger presents herself as the face of the Resistance, the woman-driven protest movement against Trump. However, she has been careful to not alienate the independent and moderate voters she needs to win the district. At the Spotsylvania event, she didn't mention Trump, Brat, or Kavanaugh, focusing on domestic-policy issues such as healthcare and education.\n\nAsked for her position on Kavanaugh's nomination, her campaign declined to comment. Instead, Spanberger touched on the thing that attracted voters such as Meg Sneed to her: turning down the volume in the civic discourse.\n\n\"We've reached a place where we need to restore a level of civility to our conversations,\" she told the crowd.\n\nTom Davis, a former Republican congressman from Virginia, stated that it remains Brat's race to win, and that Kavanaugh may be the issue that pulls him over the finish line. \"It's still a southern district,\" Davis said. \"There's nothing like a good fight to keep your base in line.\"",
    " Title: Economic Growth and Life Expectancy: A Comparative Analysis of Hong Kong, Central Europe, and the Baltic States\n\nArticle:\n\nLast Friday, the Cato Institute hosted a forum on Neil Monnery's book, \"Architect of Prosperity: Sir John Cowperthwaite and the Making of Hong Kong.\" Sir John Cowperthwaite, the financial secretary of Hong Kong from 1961 to 1971 and its financial under-secretary from 1951 to 1961, is credited for establishing policies that transformed Hong Kong from a poor backwater of the British Empire into one of the world's wealthiest regions.\n\nWhen asked about Hong Kong's success, Monnery noted that in the years following World War II, Hong Kong's per capita income was one-third of that in Britain. By the time of the British transfer of the territory to China in 1997, incomes in the two countries were equal. Today, the average inhabitant of Hong Kong is over 30% richer than the average Briton.\n\nEconomic growth, according to Monnery, is not only crucial for rising standards of living but also for health and life expectancy. In 1960, people in Hong Kong lived four years shorter than those in Britain. Today, they live four years longer. This correlation between economic growth and life expectancy was a key topic of discussion during the forum.\n\nThis correlation was also observed in the context of Central Europe, particularly since the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, marking 28 years since the end of the communist period. Following the end of the communist period, the region experienced an economic recession, as unproductive industries shut down, and millions of people lost their jobs. Life expectancy started to decline, which opponents of market reforms saw as proof of capitalism's deleterious consequences for people's welfare.\n\nRevisiting life expectancy statistics three decades later, a different picture emerges. Between 1960 and 1989, life expectancy in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia rose by 1.33, 1.46, 3.36, and 1.05 years, respectively. Between 1989 and 2015, it increased by 7.1, 5.68, 6.44, and 5.24 years, respectively. The post-communist dip in life expectancy, such as it was, proved to be small and temporary.\n\nFurther afield, post-communist depression was much more pronounced in the Baltic countries, which is, in retrospect, unsurprising. These economies, being parts of the Soviet Union, were much more heavily distorted than their neighbors to the west. In other words, a deeper restructuring was necessary.\n\nHowever, the relationship between economic growth and life expectancy still holds. In the 31 years between 1960 and 1991, life expectancy in Estonia and Lithuania rose by 1.47 and 0.52 years, respectively, while in Latvia it fell by 0.75 years. Between 1991 and 2015, life expectancy rose by 7.33 years in Estonia, 2.97 years in Lithuania, and 5.02 years in Latvia.\n\nIn conclusion, a switch from socialism to capitalism appears to be beneficial for the health and longevity of the citizenry. The data suggests that economic growth, driven by free-market policies, contributes to improved life expectancy and health outcomes. However, it is important to note that the specific circumstances and historical context of each region play a significant role in the outcomes observed.",
    " Title: Deadly Bombing Rocks Bangkok's Downtown Area, Kills 18 and Injures Over 100\n\nArticle:\n\nA devastating bomb blast in downtown Bangkok during the evening rush hour on Monday has left at least 18 people dead and over 100 injured, according to authorities. The explosion occurred near the Erawan Shrine, a Hindu religious site.\n\nAlexander Hotz, an American filmmaker working in the area, described the incident as \"thunder-like.\" He was in his office when the blast occurred, initially mistaking it for a heavy rainstorm. One of his Thai interns later informed him of the chaos unfolding outside.\n\nThe BBC reported that body parts were scattered and a crater was present, suggesting a bombing. People near the Erawan Shrine were hit by the \"full force of the blast,\" according to the BBC. Burned motorbikes were visible on the road.\n\nInitially, police were concerned about a second explosion due to a suspicious object found near the blast site. However, national police chief Somyot Poompummuang later confirmed that the object was harmless.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that at least 18 people were confirmed dead and 117 injured. The Bangkok Post, citing the Royal Thai Police, put the death toll at 19. The explosion occurred at 6.55 p.m. local time, and the Bangkok Post reported that an improvised explosive device was placed inside the shrine complex.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Prawit Wongsuwan condemned the bombing and expressed condolences to the families of the deceased and injured. He stated it was too soon to determine if the attacks were politically motivated.\n\nThe White House also condemned the attack and extended \"our deepest condolences to all those affected by the explosion.\"\n\nWhile such attacks are rare in Bangkok, there have been smaller incidents in recent months. In February, a small homemade pipe bomb exploded near a Bangkok shopping mall. In March, grenades were tossed in front of the Central Criminal Court in Bangkok, and in April, seven people were injured in a parking lot blast on the tourist island of Koh Samui.\n\nIt is unclear why the shrine was targeted. Over 90% of Thailand's 66 million people are Buddhist, with Hindus making up a tiny fraction of the rest. About 5% of the population is Islamic, and there has been some religious unrest involving Islamic separatists in southern Thailand in recent years.\n\nThailand experienced a military coup in May 2014. The government was dissolved, replaced by a military-dominated national legislature. The current prime minister, Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha, has cracked down on dissent and banned criticism of his government.\n\nAnna Mallika, a Thai-American auditor, was in an exercise class when the blast hit. \"We heard the most almighty bang,\" Mallika said. \"Most of us thought that something was wrong, but the instructor told us that it was probably just a car crash or something like that. Minutes later we saw people running and panicking outside the window.\"\n\nRichard Sri-kureja told the BBC he was walking to a mall next to the shrine when he heard the blast. \"There was total chaos,\" he said. \"That area is usually very, very crowded as it's in the middle of the city and it's usually very packed. A local hotel is full of injured patients.\"\n\nThis article was reported from McLean, Va. Contributing: Jane Onyanga-Omara in London.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Emergency Request for Supreme Court Intervention in Border Wall Funding Case\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration is seeking the Supreme Court's help in its effort to build a wall on the southwestern border using $2.5 billion reallocated from the Defense Department's budget without congressional authorization. A federal district judge in Oakland, Calif., Haywood Gilliam Jr., previously blocked the Defense Department from spending money that Congress had not appropriated for that purpose.\n\nThe administration's request for a stay of Judge Gilliam's order was refused by the judge and a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The appeals court majority wrote that the public interest weighs against issuing a stay because \"the Constitution assigns to Congress the power of the purse.\" The judges continued, stating that \"under the Appropriations Clause, it is Congress that is to make decisions regarding how to spend taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nClaiming an emergency, the administration went to the Supreme Court last week seeking a stay. Justice Elena Kagan, who has supervisory jurisdiction over cases coming from the Ninth Circuit, gave the plaintiff, the Sierra Club, a deadline of this Friday to file a response to the administration's application. The end of the current fiscal year comes up on Sept. 30, by which time, the administration says, construction contracts have to be in place if the project is to proceed.\n\nThis is the 28th time, by the count of Professor Stephen Vladeck of the University of Texas School of Law, that the Trump administration has gone to the Supreme Court with an emergency application of some kind - a request for a stay or for the justices to skip the appeals court and grant direct review of a Federal District Court decision, as the court did in the census case. By contrast, the administration of President George W. Bush sought Supreme Court intervention of this sort only six times in eight years, and for the Obama administration, the number of such requests was four in eight years.\n\nThe Trump administration's frequent requests for Supreme Court intervention mark a significant change in the attitude and behavior of a presidential administration towards the Supreme Court. It is a change that warrants close and skeptical watching.",
    " Title: Sen. Charles Schumer Says Gang of Eight Has Completed 90% of Immigration Legislation Drafting\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama expressed optimism on Wednesday that Congress will have a bill overhauling the nation's immigration laws ready next month, with the possibility of passage by the end of summer. In an interview with Spanish-language network Telemundo, Obama stated, \"If we have a bill introduced at the beginning of next month as these senators indicate it will be, then I'm confident that we can get it done certainly before the end of the summer.\"\n\nThe president's comments come as four members of the Senate's so-called \"Gang of Eight,\" including Arizona Republican John McCain and Democrat Charles Schumer, completed a tour of the Arizona-Mexico border on Wednesday. Schumer told reporters after the tour that the lawmakers were 90% done with their work crafting the legislation.\n\nObama called on Congress this week to expedite the process and deliver an immigration bill as soon as possible. The president won the Latino vote overwhelmingly in his race against Mitt Romney, but has faced criticism from some Latinos for failing to address immigration reform in his first term and for a record number of deportations under his administration.\n\nIn the Telemundo interview, Obama dismissed the potential political fallout for his party if the push on immigration reform falls short. \"I'm not concerned about the Democratic Party,\" Obama said. \"I'm concerned about the people whose actual lives are (going to) be impacted by it.\"\n\nObama emphasized the importance of strengthening border security, creating a pathway to citizenship, and ensuring a better life for immigrants and their families. He also noted that he is prepared to introduce his own plan if necessary, but believes it will not be necessary.",
    " Title: Border Patrol Agents Warn of Increased Illegal Border Crossings and Drug Trafficking as Immigration Reform Discussions Intensify\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Gang of Eight, a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators, prepares to announce an immigration reform deal later this week, concerns regarding border security and the potential impact on illegal border crossings are rising among Border Patrol agents. According to an anonymous Border Patrol agent, the number of illegal aliens has reportedly doubled, or even tripled, since discussions of amnesty began.\n\nData obtained by a media outlet and reported within Customs and Border Protection (CBP) from February 5 through March 1, 2013, shows 504 illegal aliens were spotted in the Tucson/Nogales area, with 189 being caught on CBP intelligence cameras. Of those 504, only 174 were apprehended, and 32 of the 189 on camera were carrying large drug loads for Mexican cartels. Some were armed with AK-47 style weapons.\n\nPhotos obtained by the media outlet from CBP intelligence cameras in Southern Arizona near the border with Mexico have been provided, with sensitive information redacted to protect the security and identity of the camera locations.\n\nLast week, Fox News reported that sections of the border will soon become unpatrolled as hours for on-the-ground agents are cut. The media outlet has learned that Border Patrol agents working the border have been fully funded, yet internal political battles within CBP may be causing funds to be funneled to managers rather than those on patrol.\n\n\"Customs and Border Protection has been given enough money to fully staff the border but has chosen to use the money elsewhere, we believe it is to fund the salaries of Supervisory CBP Officers,\" Vice President of the National Border Patrol Council Shawn Moran tells the media outlet. \"The money they are diverting was to go to AUO (Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime), which is actually straight pay and is used to pay Border Patrol Agents for anything past eight hours. Being that we have to maintain staffing 24/7, this is a huge part of border security. The criminals and drugs do not stop coming, so we have to make sure we have people out there.\"\n\n\"Cutting AUO will be a 30% pay cut for our agents but more importantly a minimum 20% loss of staffing out in the field,\" Moran continues. \"This is internal politics within CBP and also with immigration reform. There are still battles between legacy Customs, INS, and Border Patrol managers as to the direction CBP takes and how the funds are being used. Meanwhile, both parties claim no immigration reform until the border is secured, well, this surely will not secure the border.\"\n\nAs sequestration goes into full effect on April 7 and a deal in Washington on immigration reform gets locked in, illegal crossings are expected to get worse.\n\n\"We have seen increased crossings and smuggling since word of staffing cuts began circulating,\" Moran says. \"The illegals have even told us that is why they tried crossing. The border is safer but by no means secure.\"\n\nAnother agent expressed the same sentiment, stating when apprehended, some illegal aliens ask where they can go to find amnesty.\n\nDespite border security being put further at risk through bad policy, the push for immigration reform, well before full border security is ongoing. The AFL-CIO reached a deal with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on a guest worker program late last Friday. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said the Gang of Eight has reached a deal on immigration reform on CNN's State of the Union over the weekend, but Republican Senator Marco Rubio has said reports of a deal are premature.",
    " Title: Michael Cohen's Attorneys Expected to Cease Representation in Criminal Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nMichael Cohen, President Donald Trump's longtime personal lawyer, is expected to lose his legal representation in the ongoing criminal investigation into his business dealings, according to a source familiar with the matter. The attorneys from the law firm McDermott, Will & Emery LLP, who have represented Cohen since June 2017, are expected to cease representation after completing a review of over 3.7 million documents seized during an April raid on Cohen's home, office, and hotel room.\n\nThe review aims to determine which communications are protected by attorney-client privilege ahead of a Friday deadline set by Judge Kimba Wood of the Southern District of New York. Stephen Ryan, Todd Harrison, and others at the firm will no longer represent Cohen once the review is complete, the source said.\n\nCohen is yet to secure a replacement law firm, but is reportedly searching for a federal criminal lawyer in New York. Sources familiar with the matter suggest Cohen is looking for a lawyer with close ties to the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office. Cohen has not yet decided whether he will cooperate with prosecutors in the case, according to one of these sources. He has not been charged with any crime.\n\nJudge Wood has appointed a special master to oversee the document review and decide whether communications designated as privileged by Cohen, Trump, or the Trump Organization can be viewed by government investigators. The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office is investigating whether Cohen committed bank fraud, campaign-finance violations, and other potential crimes. A spokeswoman for the office declined to comment. Cohen has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe expected withdrawal of Cohen's law firm was first reported by ABC News.",
    " Title: FBI Agent Peter Strzok Faces Intense Scrutiny in 10-Hour Congressional Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 10-hour joint hearing between the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees on Capitol Hill Thursday, senior FBI agent Peter Strzok testified, facing intense questioning regarding his role in investigations into Hillary Clinton's private email server and potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nDuring the hearing, Strzok addressed allegations surrounding a series of text messages he exchanged with his former FBI attorney, Lisa Page. One of the contentious exchanges, from August 26, 2016, read, \"Just went to a southern Virginia Walmart \u2013 I could smell the Trump support.\" When asked about this exchange, Strzok stated, \"Sir, that's an expression of speech. I clearly was not smelling one thing or the other.\"\n\nStrzok maintained that he separated his political opinions from his investigations into Clinton and the Trump campaign. However, after special counsel Robert Mueller discovered his text messages, he was removed from the Russia investigation.\n\nOne of the most intense lines of questioning came from House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), who stated, \"It wasn't the discovery of your texts, Mr. Strzok. It was the existence of your bias that got you kicked off.\" Strzok responded, \"No, Mr. Gowdy, it was not.\"\n\nThe hearing saw Democrats staunchly defending Strzok, with Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) stating, \"If I could give you a Purple Heart, I would.\" Republicans, on the other hand, peppered Strzok with questions and expressed outrage that had been building for months.\n\nAt one point, Strzok refused to answer questions, citing a directive by FBI attorneys. This led to a threat of contempt of Congress from Chairman Goodlatte. \"And potential criminal liability \u2013 do you understand that?\" Goodlatte threatened Strzok.\n\nTowards the end of the hearing, it was announced that Lisa Page would be questioned by members of Congress in a closed-door session on a subsequent day, having had the benefit of watching Strzok's testimony.",

Kerry made a surprise appearance at a State Department briefing on Thursday, ahead of a U.N. meeting next week in New York, where U.S. diplomats will continue working on a U.N. resolution to enforce a newly struck agreement that would have the Assad regime turn over its chemical weapons to international control.\n\nIn the interview, Assad admitted to having chemical weapons but denied that his government was behind the attack, continuing to push the theory that the opposition was behind the strike. Kerry stated, \"Sarin was used. Sarin killed,\" and questioned the feasibility of the opposition launching the attack, suggesting that it would be implausible for the opposition to gain control of territory, acquire the necessary rockets and weapons, and possess the chemical agent sarin to carry out the attack.\n\nThe U.N. report on the Aug. 21 attack, which was recently released, states that there is conclusive evidence that the chemical attack occurred. The report did not assign blame, but included findings about the type of rocket used, which the U.S. and its allies claim point to Syrian government culpability. Kerry emphasized that nations cannot \"have their own set of facts.\" He stated, \"This fight about Syria's chemical weapons is not a game. Anybody who reads the facts (in the U.N. report) and puts the dots together... understands what those facts mean.\"",

Carter previously flew to Pyongyang in 1994, striking a deal with Kim Il-sung, the grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong-un. North Korea secretly cheated on the deal four years later. Carter stated, \"I would go [to North Korea], yes.\"\n\nCarter also addressed Russia's attempt to influence the 2016 election, stating, \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any evidence that what the Russians did changed enough votes, or any votes.\"\n\nFinally, Carter expressed a preference for NFL players to stand during the national anthem, stating, \"I think they ought to find a different way to object, to demonstrate.

    " Title: Obama Delays Employer Mandate in Healthcare Law, Highlighting Ongoing Changes to the Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's decision this week to delay the employer mandate to provide health insurance is the latest modification to his healthcare law, officially known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and widely nicknamed \"Obamacare.\" The decision underscores the ongoing changes to the law more than three years after it was signed into law.\n\nThe courts have rewritten the way the Medicaid expansion works, while Mr. Obama and Congress have repealed a budget-busting long-term care program and onerous reporting requirements for businesses. On Tuesday, Mr. Obama took unilateral action to postpone the employer mandate for a year, with his aides stating they are trying to show the kind of flexibility all sides have asked for as the massive bill lurches toward full implementation.\n\nThe fits and starts have left an ever-shifting platform that could be even more complicated by the time the law's most controversial aspect\u2014the individual mandate to have health insurance or pay a fine/tax\u2014goes into effect on Jan. 1. \"There will be certainly opportunities here for further confusing people,\" said Timothy Jost, a professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law.\n\nAll sides had predicted the law would change over time, and even Mr. Obama and congressional Democrats had said they'd be open to tweaks that might make it work better. However, observers were caught off guard by the White House's sudden decision to delay the employer mandate by one year, to 2015. The provision requires businesses with more than 50 workers to offer insurance to all full-time employees, or else pay a fine of $2,000 per worker.\n\nOpponents of the law said the move exposed its fundamental flaws. \"Implementation of the ACA has not lowered costs or increased access as promised,\" said Sen. Jerry Moran, Kansas Republican. \"Individuals, families, and employers still face increasing health insurance costs, new taxes overseen by what we have recently learned is a politically-biased IRS, burdensome mandates, and massive uncertainty because of this flawed law.\"\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly tried to repeal the law, or at least chip away at it, while Democrats say unfounded criticism and a lack of funding have undermined the administration's efforts after years of work. \"The problem all along has been that while the program was passed with great fanfare a few years ago, most of the policies that will really impact people won't take effect until 2014,\" said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and former spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. \"Which is a tough way to sell something to the American people, especially when the Republicans are doing everything they can to undermine a bill that is the law of the land.\"\n\nMr. Jost also said \"widespread, vicious opposition to this law\" has been the prime source of turbulence along the path to implementation. \"It's like if you're trying to get your work done, and somebody's slapping you in the face all the time,\" he said.\n\nThe choices Congress made in writing the law have contributed to the complexity of getting it up and running. Congress did not employ a single-payer system that would have given the federal government complete control, and in an attempt to give states some flexibility, it offered them the chance to set up their own health insurance marketplaces, or exchanges. However, more than half of the states decided to let the federal government create one for them, creating a hodgepodge of state-run and federally facilitated marketplaces.\n\nThe Supreme Court added to the complexity last year when it upheld the core of the law but said states should be allowed to opt out of the Medicaid expansion. Some statehouses are still grappling with whether to accept the opt-out. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers have gone back and recaptured some of the money the law would have overpaid as tax credits for those using subsidies to buy insurance on the exchanges.\n\nIn 2011, all sides agreed to repeal a business expense reporting requirement that had been designed so the IRS could make sure employers were paying their full tax burdens. This week's decision signaled that more tweaks and changes may be on the way. \"These things have never been that easy,\" said Mr. Jost. \"I just think it's so unfortunate that it's turned out this way.\"",

The House is expected to vote on a $9 billion flood insurance measure on Friday, followed by a vote on a $51 billion aid bill on Jan. 15.\n\nRep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), who earlier criticized party leaders for the move, reported after a closed-door meeting with the speaker that they were told the House would vote on the aid package in two installments. As far as King is concerned, he stated that the meeting was \"an extremely positive meeting.\"\n\nBoehner and House Republican Leader Eric Cantor affirmed the plan in a written statement, saying, \"Getting critical aid to the victims of Hurricane Sandy should be the first priority in the new Congress, and that was reaffirmed today with members of the New York and New Jersey delegations.\"\n\nThe decision still pushes a vote until the next session, which starts Thursday. However, the meeting appeared to calm tensions in the party. King, who was among the most vocal in his complaints, earlier called the decision to put off a vote a \"disgrace\" and \"immoral.\"\n\nPresident Obama, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also decried the \"failure\" to act, saying in a statement, \"When American citizens are in need, we come to their aid. That tradition was abandoned in the House last night.\"\n\nAt a press conference earlier in the afternoon, Christie said the blame lies with House Republicans and Boehner himself. However, Boehner's toughest Republican critics on the Hill were walking things back late Wednesday.\n\nSome conservatives had earlier expressed concern about the sheer size of the Sandy bill, with the Senate-passed version exceeding $60 billion. The House Appropriations Committee produced a bill Tuesday that significantly pared back the Senate version, bringing it down to $27 billion. Now, it appears the House will move forward with a vote on the full $60 billion, in two installments.\n\nA procession of lawmakers took to the House floor Wednesday to urge action on the bill and decry the decision to postpone it. \"We can not and we should not wait,\" House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer said. \"We must not walk away. I urge the speaker of this House to reconsider and act immediately.\"\n\nA spokesman for Boehner, Michael Steel, said, \"The speaker is committed to getting this bill passed this month.\"",

Pence's remarks came as the White House deals with the controversy surrounding the USS Carl Vinson's movement towards Australia instead of North Korea.\n\nPence, who was speaking to 2,500 sailors in blue fatigues and Naval baseball caps, emphasized the U.S.'s commitment to peace while also highlighting the readiness of the military. He stated, \"The United States of America will always seek peace but under President Trump, the shield stands guard and the sword stands ready.\"\n\nThe vice president reaffirmed the U.S.'s commitment to working with allies such as Japan, China, and other global powers to apply economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea. He also emphasized the importance of readiness, saying, \"Those who would challenge our resolve or readiness should know, we will defeat any attack and meet any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective American response.\"\n\nPence also addressed the U.S.'s alliance with Pacific Rim nations and its commitment to protecting freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, a region where China has been staking claims to disputed territory.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis, currently on a Middle East tour, also warned against North Korea's latest failed missile launch, describing it as a \"reckless act of provocation.\" Mattis did not specify the type of missile, but stated it was not of intercontinental range, meaning it could not reach U.S. territory.\n\nAn unnamed official reportedly said the missile was a Scud variant known as a KN-17. Mattis also credited China with trying to help resolve the North Korea situation with the goal of denuclearizing the peninsula.\n\nThe Trump administration has signaled a forceful U.S. stance on North Korea's recent actions, with Pence's visit to the Demilitarized Zone dividing North and South Korea on Monday serving as a show of American resolve. However, the specifics of the administration's next steps remain unclear.\n\nBehind the heated rhetoric, Trump's strategy in the region appears to resemble that of his predecessor, Barack Obama, albeit with the added unpredictability of a new president who has shown a willingness to use force. Pence stated that Trump is hopeful China will use its influence in the region to pressure North Korea to abandon its weapons program, but expressed impatience with North Korea's unwillingness to move toward denuclearization.\n\nIn Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed hope that the U.S. would follow a peaceful resolution to the situation, while China made a plea for a return to negotiations to bring the escalating dispute to a peaceful resolution. China also expressed concern over the U.S.'s plans to deploy a missile defense system in South Korea, stating it was damaging its relations with China.",

In an interview with ABC's Jonathan Karl on \"This Week,\" Booker expressed his disagreement with Warren's proposal, stating it as not suitable for a president and sounding \"more like a Donald Trump thing to say.\"\n\nBooker, who has pledged to call for Justice Department investigations and antitrust laws to rein in monopolies if elected, expressed concern over the \"really ill effects\" of \"corporate consolidation\" in America. However, he disagreed with Warren's plan to create a level playing field by splitting giant tech firms, including Amazon, Facebook, and Google, which she has accused of unfair competition and \"eating up\" startups.\n\n\"I do not think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here,\" Booker said. He further compared Warren's proposal to Trump's rhetoric, stating, \"It's not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks. That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say, \u2018 I'm going to break up you guys.\u2019\"\n\nBooker insisted he was not comparing Warren to Trump, calling her \"my friend.\" However, he added, \"I'm telling you right now: We do not need a president that is going to use their own personal beliefs and tell you which companies we should break up.\"\n\nAnother Democratic presidential candidate, Sen.

Our independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our constitutional republic.\" The hearing, which was interrupted repeatedly by Democratic senators and protesters, became a tumultuous event.\n\nDemocrats decried the withholding of the documents and sought to adjourn the hearing, as Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, the committee's chairman, struggled to maintain order. \"This is the first confirmation for a Supreme Court justice I've seen, basically, according to mob rule,\" said Republican Senator John Cornyn, a characterization Democrats rejected. \"What we've heard is the noise of democracy,\" Democratic Senator Dick Durbin responded.\n\nProtesters, mostly women, took turns yelling as senators spoke, shouting slogans such as \"This is a travesty of justice,\" \"Our democracy is broken,\" and \"Vote no on Kavanaugh.\" Concerns were expressed about the potential impact of Kavanaugh on abortion rights, healthcare access, and gun control.\n\nDemocratic Senator Cory Booker appealed to Grassley's \"sense of decency and integrity\" and said the withholding of the documents by Republicans and the White House left lawmakers unable to properly vet Kavanaugh. \"We can not possibly move forward. We have not had an opportunity to have a meaningful hearing,\" said Democratic Senator Kamala Harris.\n\nGrassley deemed the Democrats' request to halt the hearing \"out of order\" and accused them of obstruction. Republicans hold a slim Senate majority and can confirm Kavanaugh if they stay united. There were no signs of Republican defections.\n\nPresident Trump criticized the Democrats on Twitter, stating the hearing was \"truly a display of how mean, angry and despicable the other side is\" and accusing them of \"looking to inflict pain and embarrassment\" on Kavanaugh. If confirmed, Kavanaugh, who is 53, is expected to move the court, which already has a conservative majority, further to the right.\n\nSenate Democratic leaders have vowed a fierce fight to try to block Kavanaugh's confirmation. Democrats signaled they would press Kavanaugh on abortion, gun rights, and presidential power when they get to question him starting on Wednesday in a hearing scheduled to run through Friday.\n\nDemocrats have demanded in vain to see documents relating to Kavanaugh's time as staff secretary to Republican former President George W. Bush from 2003 to 2006. That job involved managing paper flow from advisers to Bush. Republicans have released some, but not all, documents concerning Kavanaugh's two prior years as a lawyer in Bush's White House Counsel's Office.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh sat quietly, fingers intertwined, as protesters in the audience screamed while being dragged out of the room. He occasionally jotted notes on paper. When he finally got to speak, Kavanaugh called the Supreme Court \"the last line of defense for the separation of powers (in the U.S. government) and the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution.\"\n\nAs the hearing paused for a lunch break, Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter who was killed in the Parkland, Florida high school mass shooting in February, tried to talk to Kavanaugh but the nominee turned away. Video of the encounter was shared widely on social media. \"I guess he did not want to deal with the reality of gun violence,\" Guttenberg wrote on Twitter afterward. White House spokesman Raj Shah said security intervened before Kavanaugh could shake Guttenberg's hand.\n\nThe Democratic frustrations that boiled over on Tuesday had been simmering for more than two years. Democrats have accused Senate Republican leaders of stealing a Supreme Court seat by refusing to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama's nominee to the high court, Merrick Garland, in 2016, allowing Trump to fill a Supreme Court vacancy instead.\n\nRepublicans also last year reduced the margin for advancing Supreme Court nominations from 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate to a simple majority in order to force through the confirmation of Trump's first high court nominee Neil Gorsuch. The Senate is likely to vote on confirmation by the end of September. The court begins its next term in October. The hearing gave Democrats a platform to make their case against Kavanaugh ahead of November's congressional elections in which they are seeking to seize control of Congress from Republicans.\n\nLiberals are concerned Kavanaugh could provide a decisive fifth vote on the nine-justice court to overturn or weaken the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion nationwide. Kavanaugh is likely to be questioned about his views on investigating sitting presidents and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion between Moscow and Trump's campaign.",
    " Title: US-Iran Tensions Escalate as Leaders Exchange Hostile Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States and Iran have engaged in a series of hostile exchanges, escalating tensions between the two nations. US President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran, stating that the country would face consequences \"the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered\" if it threatened the US. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani earlier stated that a war with Iran would be \"the mother of all wars.\"\n\nIn May, the US withdrew from a deal that curbed Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. The US is now re-imposing these sanctions, despite objections from the UK, France, China, Russia, and Germany, who all signed the 2015 agreement.\n\nThe US is suspicious of Iranian activity in the Middle East, and is an ally of Israel and Saudi Arabia, two of Iran's foes. President Rouhani's comments, made to Iranian diplomats, did leave open the possibility of future good relations with the US.\n\n\"America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars,\" he said, according to Iran's state news agency Irna. Responding to Mr. Trump's broadside, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted, \"Color us unimpressed.\"\n\nPresident Trump's aggressive rhetoric mirrors his Twitter barrages against North Korea's Kim Jong-un, whom he branded a \"madman.\" Their verbal hostilities, however, have evolved into diplomacy.\n\nOn Monday, a senior commander in Iran's Revolutionary Guards suggested the US president's statements were part of a broader strategy. \"The remarks Trump makes against Iran are psychological warfare, and he would be mistaken should he seek to take action against Iran,\" Gholamhossein Gheybparvar said, quoted by the Iranian Students News Agency.\n\nOn Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he wanted to try to stop countries importing Iranian oil by November as part of continued pressure on Tehran. Addressing a group of Iranian Americans in California, he said the Iranian regime \"resembles the mafia more than a government.\"\n\nThe gathering was the first time a top US official had directly addressed such a large number of Iranian Americans, and is seen as part of the administration's strategy to increase pressure on Iran's leadership.\n\nPresident Trump has consistently opposed the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw the US release billions of dollars of frozen assets in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear program. The Trump administration regards Iran as a destabilizing force in the Middle East, arguing the nuclear deal enabled Iran to pursue a more assertive regional policy. Iran has sent hundreds of troops and thousands of volunteer militiamen to Syria, and has strengthened its military presence there.\n\nGulf states have accused Iran of backing Yemen's Houthi rebels with both money and weapons, though Iran has denied this. Saudi Arabia, a key US ally, is a major adversary of Iran and has repeatedly warned about Iran's intentions.\n\nIn May, Mr. Trump called the nuclear accord - or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as it is formally known - a \"horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.\" He alleged that the deal did not restrict Iran's \"destabilizing activities\" in the region enough, and could not detect or prevent any breaking of its terms.\n\nAnalysts also cited the influence of White House Iran hawks including Mr. Pompeo and US National Security Adviser John Bolton, and Mr. Trump's tendency to target major policies of his predecessor President Obama.\n\nIran insists its nuclear program is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has said Iran is honoring its commitments. The IAEA has said its inspectors were granted access to all locations they needed to visit in 2017, but that they did not seek to enter any military sites, which Iranian officials declared off-limits - a move the US said raised doubts over Tehran's compliance.\n\nIn May, Mr. Pompeo outlined 12 conditions for any \"new deal\" between the US and Iran, including the withdrawal of its forces from Syria and an end to its support for rebels in Yemen. Iran is one of the world's largest oil producers, with exports worth billions of dollars each year. It is already feeling economic pressures, and has seen large-scale protests over rising prices and a decline in the value of its currency, the rial.",
    " Title: Democrats Face Challenges in ACA Implementation, but Lack of Veto-Proof Majority for Repeal\n\nArticle:\n\nThe implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, has faced numerous challenges, with many criticizing its rollout as a debacle. However, the possibility of full repeal of the ACA is unlikely, as it would require a veto-proof majority in both the House and the Senate, a situation that is currently far from reality.\n\nIn a recent interview on MSNBC, Representative Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) stated, \"I can't see a veto-proof number coming up... I just don't see that happening.\" He further added, \"Democrats are going to be vulnerable to Republican attacks on the Affordable Care Act regardless.\"\n\nThe ACA, while bearing President Obama's name, is a Democratic Party creation. If Democrats were to help Republicans obliterate it, it would be seen as an admission of governing incompetence, potentially leading to a \"do not elect me or members of my party because we do not know what we're doing\" vote.\n\nTwo possible futures for the ACA are foreseeable. One is where the ACA limps ahead, and the other is a swift reversal of fortune. The nightmare scenario is not the repeal of Obamacare, but rather the difficulty in achieving a massive expansion of health insurance coverage in the U.S.\n\nIf the Healthcare.gov website takes significantly longer to fix than the Obama administration is forecasting, or if enrollments never spike, political, moral, and substantive considerations could change. For instance, if fewer people enroll through the exchanges than see their policies canceled, it could lead to a net reduction in individual market coverage. This would be politically humiliating and raise questions about the fairness of imposing penalties on people for not entering a system they cannot access or trust.\n\nIn this scenario, Democrats would face intense pressure to vote for a delay of the individual mandate. They might do so to stave off a full-scale rebellion, with the administration likely acting unilaterally, agreeing to provide hardship exemptions en masse, and hoping to hold the votes for a universal delay below a veto-proof threshold, to protect markets in states with functioning exchanges.\n\nA more desirable scenario is one where the website works well in a few weeks, enrollments shoot upward, quickly overtaking the number of people whose policies have been canceled. In this scenario, aggregates would begin to matter, and the media's bias towards anecdote and hardship would have to contend with raw numbers. If total enrollments, including new Medicaid beneficiaries, approach anywhere near the 16 million the Congressional Budget Office initially projected, the ACA's success would be impossible for the media to ignore.\n\nStarting Dec. 1, opponents of the law will screen-grab and disseminate every website failure they encounter. However, if the law truly is working well \"for the vast majority of users\" as the administration likes to say, it will be reflected in swelling enrollment figures and regular updates on the law's improving progress. This will take the sting out of \"you can keep it\" attacks, and Democrats will no longer have anything to run from. In fact, they might even repurpose the Upton bill, using it to put Republicans on record against stripping new beneficiaries of their health plans.\n\nSuch a volte-face could stop the repeal campaign dead in its tracks.",
    " Title: Impeachment of President Obama Unlikely Despite Republican Control of Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the prospect of impeaching President Barack Obama, a long-held dream of some conservative groups, appears unlikely, even if Republicans gain control of the Senate and maintain their majority in the House of Representatives in the November congressional elections.\n\nThe reasons for this are twofold. First, the mathematical odds are against Republicans achieving the two-thirds Senate majority necessary to convict Obama if the House of Representatives were to pass articles of impeachment. Under the most optimistic election results for Republicans, they would fall short of this requirement.\n\nSecond, a CNN/ORC International Poll last week showed that nearly two-thirds of respondents oppose impeaching the President. This reality is not lost on Republican leaders such as House Speaker John Boehner and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, who have publicly dismissed the possibility of impeachment.\n\nBoehner stated this week, \"We have no plans to impeach the President. We have no future plans.\" Ryan, who may have presidential ambitions in 2016, also quashed the possibility, saying Wednesday that \"this does not rise to the high crimes and misdemeanors level\" of impeachment.\n\nMeanwhile, Obama and Democrats are using the threat of impeachment to raise funds and inspire their supporters to turn out in November. The President cited the vote by House Republicans authorizing Boehner to sue him over executive actions, saying Congress should instead be passing legislation.\n\n\"They're mad because I'm doing my job,\" Obama said of his Republican foes, urging them to \"stop just hatin' all the time.\" In debate before Wednesday night's vote, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi made sure to link the lawsuit proposal to possible impeachment down the road, calling it a first step to trying to oust the President next year.\n\nThe issue resonates with Democratic supporters, according to Rep. Steve Israel of New York, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The group has raised $7.6 million online since Boehner announced the lawsuit plan just over five weeks ago, he said.\n\n\"You bet we're going to run on a Congress that is just obsessed with lawsuits, suing the President, talking about impeaching him instead of solutions for the middle class, talking about jobs and infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nThe impeachment discussion reflects deeper political undercurrents, particularly for a right wing already divided between diehard conservatives and more moderate Republicans. Wendy Schiller, a political scientist at Brown University, called impeachment a \"farfetched\" maneuver that could cause independent voters leaning Republican now to instead vote Democratic in November.\n\n\"It reflects in the Republican Party the idea that if you lose an election, you can use every means possible to nullify the result,\" she said. \"That's just not how America works.\"\n\nJonathan Chait, a writer who predicted four years ago in a New Republic article that House Republicans would vote to impeach Obama before his presidency ended, said Wednesday that he now doubts that will happen. Missteps by Republicans, including primary defeats of viable candidates by conservative extremists and the government shutdown they forced last year, \"really convinced the establishment that they could not indulge the base on all its flights of fancy,\" Chait said.\n\nNow, Boehner and others want to steer their base away from impeachment, he said, noting that they fear getting pushed into holding a vote that would be politically damaging. In dismissing an impeachment move, Boehner and Ryan sought to shift the blame for any discussion about it onto Democrats and the White House.\n\nBoehner called it a Democratic fundraising \"scam,\" adding, \"They're trying to rally their people to give money and to show up in this year's elections.\" Asked about the accusation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest offered a list of Republican legislators who have discussed impeaching Obama in recent months, including Reps. Steve King of Iowa, Ted Yoho of Florida, and Steve Stockman and Blake Farenthold of Texas.\n\nThe challenge to Boehner and other GOP leaders is to find a middle path between tea party demands to impeach Obama and less extreme options for action, such as the lawsuit. An impeachment effort after the November election would dominate Washington in the final two years of Obama's presidency, posing possible benefits and risks.\n\nIt would divert attention from congressional dysfunction contributing to dismal approval ratings but also could cause the public to blame Republicans for exacerbating that dysfunction. \"We've got a lot of tools at our disposal,\" Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma said, citing such steps as cutting funding for some parts of government disproportionate to the problems.\n\n\"Nor do I think you ought to do things in a legislative sense to harass the President,\" said Cole, who is a Boehner ally. \"We've got a disagreement between the two branches, and this is not uncommon. You go to court, and that's what we're seeking to do.\"\n\nThe impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon and his subsequent resignation still rankle many Republicans today, 40 years later. It was an event that made efforts to remove a sitting president part of routine political discussion in America. A GOP-led House voted to impeach President Bill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction in 1998. The Senate acquitted him on both charges, with none of the minority Democrats voting to convict, and he stayed in office.\n\nToday, any Republican with presidential ambitions\u2014such as Ryan, perhaps\u2014wants to avoid making impeachment a reflex response to dissatisfaction with the White House, Schiller noted. \"If you want to be president some day,\" she said, \"the last thing you want is for Congress to be able willy-nilly to impeach you.\"",
    " Title: Edward Snowden Remains in Moscow Airport Transit Zone as Asylum Application Pending\n\nArticle:\n\nEdward Snowden, the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor and leaker of classified information, remains in the transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, following a brief period of speculation that he might be able to leave the airport and enter Russia.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Russian lawyer was reportedly planning to meet with Snowden at the airport, sparking speculation that he would bring documents allowing Snowden to formally enter Russia. However, it appears that even with new legal papers, Snowden must continue to wait at the airport while Russian authorities consider his asylum request.\n\nSnowden applied for temporary asylum in Russia last week, after his attempts to leave the airport and fly out of the country were thwarted. The Federal Migration Service spokeswoman told the Associated Press they had no information about the status of Snowden's asylum application.\n\nSnowden has been staying at the airport transit zone since June 23, when he arrived on a flight from Hong Kong. U.S. prosecutors charged Snowden last month with espionage and theft of government property. On Monday, the U.S. Ambassador in Moscow, Michael McFaul, demanded that Russia turn over Snowden, stating via Twitter, \"Mr. Snowden ought to be returned to the United States to face the felony charges against him.\"\n\nRussian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted an unnamed security official on Wednesday as saying that Snowden has been issued documents allowing him to formally enter Russia. However, this information has not been confirmed by other sources.\n\nAnna Zakharenkova, a spokeswoman for the airport, told The Associated Press that Anatoly Kucherena, a Russian lawyer advising Snowden, would meet with him. President Vladimir Putin has stated that Snowden can be granted asylum in Russia only if he stops leaking secrets.\n\nGranting Snowden asylum would add new tensions to U.S.-Russian relations, which are already strained by criticism of Russia's pressure on opposition groups, Moscow's suspicion of U.S. missile-defense plans, and Russia's resistance to sanctions against the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad.",
    " Title: U.S. Calls for Integration of Religious Freedom into Foreign Policy to Counter Terrorism\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is advocating for the integration of religious freedom into its foreign policy as a means to counter terrorism, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is reportedly destroying Christian communities and relics, committing atrocities against religious minorities, and causing an escalating refugee crisis.\n\nThe Obama Administration has been criticized for its lack of action in defending religious freedom abroad, with the administration repeatedly refusing to address the issue and the devastating consequences it has on targeted religious communities. As a nation founded on the principles of religious freedom, the U.S. is urged to take a more active role in combating religious intolerance, which is contributing to political instability and violence in the region.\n\nThe Obama Administration can counter ISIS's strategy by building alliances with local and regional leaders who can expose radical ideologies and champion pluralism and tolerance. The Administration should also combat terrorist propaganda about religious minorities and develop programs that promote tolerance and empower minorities to advocate for their rights and interests.\n\nA U.S. foreign policy committed to religious freedom can advance national security interests, stabilize and consolidate the spread of democracy, help sustain economic growth, and promote the equality of men and women. It can also help prevent religiously-motivated terrorism and undermine the conditions that have helped spur the rise of groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, and the Shuddhikaran Movement.\n\nFurthermore, higher levels of religious freedom are associated with higher levels of economic productivity and growth, as recent studies by groups such as the Religious Freedom and Business Foundation have found. Sustainable political and economic development is only possible when religious freedom and equal opportunity contribute to a secure environment in which citizens and businesses can operate freely.\n\nFinally, the U.S. must remain committed to religious freedom because of the special distinction religious freedom holds as a fundamental human right, a belief shared by democratic countries across the globe and protected by numerous international treaties and agreements. American support for religious liberty sends a powerful message to threatened communities around the world: America is their friend. Such support builds enduring goodwill towards the U.S. among those who could be leading their own nations in the years ahead. It also reminds all observers, whether friendly or hostile, that the U.S. remains committed to a world where justice and human dignity are central to legitimate governance.",
    " Title: Kamala Harris Ends 2020 Presidential Bid, Marks Historic Exit from Democratic Race\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) announced on Tuesday that she was ending her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, marking a significant moment in a campaign that once held historic potential.\n\nIn a statement to supporters, Harris cited insufficient financial resources as the reason for her decision. \"I've taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life,\" the California Democrat said.\n\nA senior campaign aide confirmed that Harris made the decision on Monday after discussing the path forward with family and other top officials over the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nHarris, the first woman and first black attorney general and U.S. senator in California's history, launched her campaign in front of 20,000 people on a chilly January day in Oakland, California. She was widely viewed as a candidate poised to excite the multiracial coalition of voters that sent Barack Obama to the White House.\n\nHer departure from the race erodes the diversity of the Democratic field, which is currently dominated by a top tier that is white and mostly male.\n\nThroughout her campaign, Harris struggled to craft a message that resonated with voters or secure the necessary funds to continue her run. She raised an impressive $12 million in the first three months of her campaign but was unable to attract the type of attention being showered on other candidates such as Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nIn her note to supporters, Harris lamented the role of money in politics and took a shot at billionaire candidates Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg, who are funding their own presidential bids. \"I'm not a billionaire. I can't fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete,\" she said.\n\nHarris's campaign was also marked by inconsistency in her pitch to voters. Her slogan \"For the people\" referenced her career as a prosecutor, a record that was viewed skeptically by the party's most progressive voters.\n\nWith Harris's exit, 15 Democrats remain in the race for the nomination. Several praised her on Tuesday, including former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Harris anchored her campaign in the powerful legacy of pioneering African Americans, often referencing the struggles and achievements of Shirley Chisholm and other trailblazers.",
    " Title: Obama's Apology and Healthcare.gov Progress Report\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's recent interview with NBC's Chuck Todd focused on his apology for the promise that individuals could keep their existing insurance policies, but the most newsworthy moment was his assessment of the progress made in fixing the Healthcare.gov website.\n\nObama stated, \"I'm confident that it will be even better by November 30 and that the majority of people are going to be able to get on there. They're going to be able to enroll. They're going to be able to apply. And they're going to get a good deal -- a better deal than they've got right now when it comes to buying health insurance.\"\n\nHowever, the administration's progress report on Thursday revealed that the website's issues persist. A spokeswoman for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services explained, \"Essentially what is happening is people are going through the entire process. As we have fixed certain pieces of functionality, like the account creation process, we're seeing volume go further down the application. We're identifying new issues that we need to be in a position to troubleshoot.\"\n\nThe administration remains confident that Healthcare.gov will be functional for the majority of users by the end of the month. However, the detailed assessments make this increasingly hard to believe, as insurance industry officials and Republicans in Congress express skepticism.\n\nIndustry consultant Robert Laszewski suggests policy options, such as encouraging people to enroll directly with insurance companies participating in the exchanges and asking working- and middle-class people to pay full premiums until the subsidy system is functional.\n\nPolitically, the situation is complex, with Republicans planning to put legislation on the House floor that would allow people to keep their canceled plans for another year and exempt them from the mandate penalty. This bill has little policy merit but could fracture the pro-Obamacare coalition and potentially require Obama to veto it.\n\nIf Healthcare.gov is not functional by the end of the month, the administration may have to consider administrative remedies, such as extending the open enrollment period and providing hardship exemptions from the penalty to people in states without functioning marketplaces. However, this would require admitting failure and could lead to lasting damage to Obama's signature achievement.",
    " Title: Trump Sends Letter to Pelosi, Labels Impeachment as \"Illegal, Partisan Attempted Coup\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an extraordinary move on the eve of an anticipated historic vote in the House of Representatives to impeach President Donald Trump, the President sent a six-page personal letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday. In the letter, Trump denounces the impeachment process as an \"illegal, partisan attempted coup.\"\n\nThe President writes, \"I write this letter to you for the purpose of history and to put my thoughts on a permanent and indelible record.\" He further states, \"One hundred years from now, when people look back at this affair, I want them to understand it and learn from it, so that it can never happen to another President again.\"\n\nThe letter, which represents a compilation of the President's grievances with the impeachment process and Pelosi's conduct, is a remarkable expression of the President's feelings. The President, making no attempt to mask his personal animus towards the Speaker, accuses Pelosi of being inauthentic for saying she prays for the President.\n\nThe President writes, \"You are offending Americans of faith by continually saying 'I pray for the President'... when you know this statement is not true, unless it is meant in a negative sense.\" He further takes issue with her demeanor throughout this process, writing that \"Perhaps most insulting of all is your false display of solemnity... no intelligent person believes what you are saying.\"\n\nThe President contends that \"more due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials,\" and accuses Pelosi of turning what he describes as a \"policy disagreement\" into an impeachable offense. He even harks back to his Electoral College victory some three years ago, saying that Pelosi is trying to undo the results of the 2016 election because \"your chosen candidate lost the election\" and says Pelosi is suffering from a case of \"Trump derangement syndrome.\"\n\n\"You view democracy as your enemy!\" the President writes to Pelosi in the exclamation point-laden letter. \"You are the ones interfering in America's elections. You are the ones subverting America's Democracy. You are are the ones Obstructing Justice. You are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our Republic for your own selfish personal, political, and partisan gain,\" the President writes.\n\nMinutes after the President's angrily-worded letter to Pelosi was made public to reporters, the President struck a notably more subdued tone in comments before cameras as he was seated next to the visiting President of Guatemala. When asked if he takes any personal responsibility for the looming impeachment, the President said he takes \"zero\" responsibility.\n\n\"No, I do not take any, zero, to put it mildly,\" Trump said. \"They took a perfect phone call that I had with the President of Ukraine, an absolutely perfect call... to impeach the President of the United States for that is a disgrace and it's a mark on our country.\"",

Trump wrote, \"Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen.\" He continued, \"Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!\"\n\n House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, responded to Trump's threat, stating that it \"insults the memory of scores of Americans who perished in wildfires last year & thousands more who lost their homes.\" Pelosi's tweet called on House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, another Californian, to join her in condemning the president's actions and reassuring California residents that federal aid will be available during their time of need.\n\n Trump has previously threatened to order the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to cut off funds for California wildfires, but the administration has not published an official order. Critics on Twitter questioned whether Trump could legally withhold FEMA money that has been appropriated.\n\n State officials accused Trump of playing politics with the California wildfires and said he does not understand the issues involved in fighting fires. They also questioned whether Trump is targeting California because it is a Democratic state.\n\n Brian Rice, president of the California Professional Firefighters, criticized Trump's blame of state forest management for the wildfires. Rice cited the damage in and around Paradise, California, and stated, \"The people there have only begun to be able to rebuild their lives... Now, they find themselves being used as pawns in the president\u2019s ill-informed chest-pounding at their expense.\"\n\n Rice noted that more than 60 percent of California's forests are controlled by the federal government, not the state. California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has criticized Trump's firefighting policy, proposed $105 million in new spending to prevent, fight, and escape wildfires in the wake of one of the state's worst fire seasons.\n\n Trump's policy decisions have been known to change or modify days after they are announced, as demonstrated by the slowed-down withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria.",

Here are some recommendations for how to prepare for the journey:\n\n1. Organize your shopping list by department or aisle to minimize time spent crisscrossing the store.\n2. Consider shopping solo to reduce the number of people in the store at one time, making it easier to maintain physical distancing.\n3. If possible, combine shopping trips for multiple households to minimize travel and exposure.\n4. Be prepared for lines outside the store entrance, as some stores may be limiting the number of shoppers allowed in at one time.\n5. Wear earphones to avoid small talk in line, if desired.\n6. Sanitize carts or wipe them down if the store allows it. Some stores may be sanitizing carts between shoppers.\n7. Practice patience and avoid getting too close to others, but also be understanding if someone invades your personal space.\n8. Expect many items to be out of stock, and be prepared to adjust your list with alternative options.\n9. If shopping for others, ask them for their preferred alternatives beforehand to reduce shopping time and set expectations.\n10.

    " Title: Timeline of Events Leading to the Death of 8-Year-Old Migrant Felipe Alonzo-Gomez\n\nArticle:\n\nAn 8-year-old migrant, identified as Felipe Alonzo-Gomez, spent his final days in a series of border patrol stations and hospitals, approximately 2,000 miles from his family's home in Guatemala. The child's death, which occurred while in the custody of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), follows the death of a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl under similar circumstances.\n\nAccording to a timeline provided by CBP, Felipe was apprehended with his father near the Paso Del Norte port of entry in El Paso, Texas for illegal entry on December 18. The apprehension location is a short drive from the port, but detainees may be held in the field until transportation is available.\n\nFelipe and his father were transferred to the Paso Del Norte processing center, where they received food, snacks, juice, and water, and six welfare checks were logged. They were then moved to the El Paso Border Patrol Station, where they received showers, food, juice, and water, and 17 welfare checks were logged over the next two days.\n\nDue to capacity levels at the El Paso station, Felipe and his father were transferred to the Alamogordo Border Patrol Station in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Upon arrival, they were provided with personal hygiene products and meals, and several welfare checks were conducted.\n\nA processing agent noticed that Felipe was coughing and appeared to have glossy eyes. About 30 minutes later, based on the agents' observations, Felipe was transferred to Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center in Alamogordo with possible influenza symptoms. He was accompanied by his father.\n\nAt the hospital, Felipe was diagnosed with a common cold and given Tylenol. He was evaluated for release but was found to have a 103-degree fever and was held for continued observation. Felipe was released from the emergency room with a prescription for Ibuprofen and amoxicillin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic.\n\nFelipe and his father were transported to temporary holding at the Highway 70 checkpoint, where they were offered and accepted a hot meal. Agents provided Felipe with a dose of the prescribed medication as ordered by the medical staff, and several welfare checks were conducted that evening.\n\nHowever, Felipe appeared to be nauseous and vomited. Agents were aware of this and helped clean up the vomit. His father declined further medical assistance as the child had been feeling better. Due to a lack of an EMT on duty, agents made the decision to return Felipe and his father to Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center out of caution.\n\nDuring transportation to the hospital, Felipe began to vomit and lost consciousness. Hospital staff were unable to revive Felipe and pronounced him dead. The Guatemalan Consulate was contacted about the child's death, and his father is currently detained at the Alamogordo Station pending transfer to ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. He has spoken to his spouse in Guatemala and the Guatemalan Consulate.\n\nThe Guatemalan Foreign Ministry issued a statement that it was alerted to a minor's death in the US. Guatemala's Consul General in Phoenix, Oscar Padilla Lam, traveled to Alamogordo to meet with the boy's father to \"hear his version of the facts,\" according to the statement. The Foreign Ministry stated it will provide all assistance and consular protection to the boy's father and assume responsibility for the repatriation of the boy's remains.",
    " Title: Strzok Testifies: Hillary Clinton Not a Target in Email Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a transcript released Thursday, former FBI Agent Peter Strzok testified before the House Judiciary Committee last year that Hillary Clinton was not a target, witness, subject, or suspect during the investigation into her storage and sending of classified emails on her home server. Strzok stated that while Clinton was considered a \"critical player,\" she was not the only person of investigative interest.\n\nRep. Doug Collins (R-GA) inserted the transcripts into the Congressional Record during a floor speech, expressing frustration with the Justice Department's slow release of information. Strzok, who was the lead agent in an investigation into President Trump during the 2016 campaign, later worked for special counsel Robert Mueller before being removed from the team due to anti-Trump text messages exchanged with his affair partner, FBI lawyer Lisa Page. He was subsequently fired from the FBI.\n\nDuring his interview with the House Judiciary Committee, Strzok admitted to his affair with Page, despite acknowledging that it made him vulnerable to being blackmailed by America's enemies. The transcript is the third set released by Rep. Collins, following those from Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and Page herself.\n\nThe Strzok transcript reveals some surprising discrepancies between the two lovers. For instance, in a text sent to Strzok, Page described Clinton as a \"menace\" that needed to be saved, while Strzok stated that he believed the \"menace\" referred to Russia.\n\nStrzok also disputed the meaning of the now-infamous text exchange where Page expressed concern that Trump would become president, to which Strzok replied, \"No. No he won't. We'll stop it.\" In his June 27, 2018, closed-door appearance with the Judiciary Committee, Strzok clarified that he did not mean he would take official action to impact the presidency.\n\nStrzok also defended his texts from March 2016, before Clinton had won the Democratic nomination and Trump the GOP nomination, where he stated Clinton \"should\" win the White House 100 million to zero. Strzok maintained that his confidence in Clinton did not influence his investigative efforts.",
    " Title: Justice Scalia's Views on the Death Penalty and the McCollum-Brown Case\n\nArticle:\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia, a prominent figure in the United States Supreme Court, has faced criticism for his views on the death penalty, particularly in light of the exoneration of Henry Lee McCollum and Leon Brown, two mentally disabled men who spent decades on death row for a crime they did not commit.\n\nThe case, which has garnered significant attention, involves the two brothers who were convicted based on coerced confessions when they were 19 and 15 years old. The conviction was overturned after DNA evidence implicated another man and other evidence from the crime scene that pointed to another convicted rapist was processed.\n\nIn 1994, in the case Collins v. Collins, Justice Scalia cited this case in his disagreement with Justice Harry Blackmun on the constitutionality of the death penalty. Scalia, known for his sarcasm, wrote that Justice Blackmun's description of a lethal injection as a \"less brutal\" method of death compared to other cases was \"enviable.\"\n\nCritics argue that Scalia's comments suggest that the methods of punishment should be directly correlated to the brutality of the crime, a concept rejected by the Enlightenment-influenced writers of the Constitution.\n\nDeath penalty supporters often use cases like this to argue that \"the system worked,\" but critics view this as sophistry, as the only reason the system worked in this case was due to an outside commission's investigation into the case. The legal system, they argue, obscured the truth at every level and every step along the way.\n\nJustice Scalia has stated that the Constitution does not forbid the execution of a convicted defendant who has had a full and fair trial but is later able to convince a habeas court that he is \"actually\" innocent. This stance has been criticized as callous, as it suggests a disregard for the horrifying injustice of executing an innocent person.\n\nCritics question how a person who claims he could not be a judge if he thought his participation in the death penalty was immoral could also believe it is constitutionally acceptable for the state to execute innocent people. The exoneration of McCollum and Brown has sparked debate about the morality and effectiveness of the death penalty in the United States.",
    " Title: Younger Generations' Shifting Political Preferences and Economic Perceptions\n\nArticle:\n\nA new survey by YouGov and the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation reveals a significant shift in the political preferences of younger generations, with a growing inclination towards socialism. The poll, which surveyed 2,100 individuals aged 16 and over, found that 70 percent of Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) and 64 percent of Generation Z (born from 1997 onwards) are somewhat or extremely likely to vote for a socialist candidate.\n\nThe survey also indicates a dwindling support for capitalism, with 50 percent of Millennials and 51 percent of Generation Z holding a somewhat or very unfavorable view of capitalism. This shift in political leanings coincides with a perceived lack of understanding of economic philosophies and recent history among younger Americans.\n\nAccording to Pew Research, Millennials are better educated than earlier generations, with a higher percentage holding college and postgraduate degrees. However, their economic education appears to be lacking, as evidenced by their understanding of socialism. The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics defines socialism as a centrally planned economy in which the government controls all means of production.\n\nMatt Kibbe, of the libertarian organization Free the People, suggests that the appeal of socialism to young people lies in their values and personal experiences rather than empirical facts. Kibbe states that socialism, as described by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is associated with community, cooperation, and dignity, but these values are not historically part of socialist reality.\n\nDespite their apparent affinity for socialism, younger Americans also embrace entrepreneurship and small business, hallmarks of capitalism. However, they do not connect these activities with capitalism and a free market.\n\nThe survey also reveals a lack of historical knowledge among younger Americans. For instance, almost 20 percent of Millennials thought the Communist Manifesto \"better guarantees freedom and equality for all\" than the Declaration of Independence, compared to just two percent of Baby Boomers and five percent of Gen X. Additionally, a YouGov survey last year found that 87 percent of high school students flunked a five-question test of basic knowledge about American history, with the worst performance among this age group.\n\nThe survey also revealed a lack of knowledge about historical events such as World War II and the Holocaust, with two-thirds of American Millennials unable to identify the Nazi extermination camp of Auschwitz, and 22 percent unaware of or unsure about the Holocaust.\n\nThe oldest of the Millennials were small children when the Berlin Wall was dismantled, and they never experienced the threat of the Cuban Missile Crisis or nuclear war drills. They have not lived through the socialist regimes of the Soviet Union, Red China, or Venezuela, which are often associated with socialism in history.\n\nRepresentative Ocasio-Cortez has stated that her generation has never known true prosperity. However, according to Matt Kibbe, the misery that AOC attributes to capitalism is not a reality. Kibbe argues that, by any conceivable measure, the current times are the most prosperous, opportunistic, and beautiful in the history of the universe.",
    " Title: Former Homeland Security Secretary Criticizes White House's Dismissal of July 4 Terror Warning\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge has criticized the White House for dismissing the government's July 4 weekend terror warning as \"standard operating procedure.\" In an interview on Fox News Channel's \"Your World with Neil Cavuto\" on Monday, Ridge stated that the comment made by White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was inaccurate.\n\n\"It's a real threat. I think this is a scourge with which we're going to have to deal with... for the foreseeable future,\" Ridge said. He further emphasized that the threat is \"permanent\" and not just a temporary concern.\n\nFormer CIA Deputy Director Mike Morell also urged Americans to take the threat seriously. On the same day, Morell stated, \"I wouldn't be surprised if we're sitting here a week from today talking about an attack over the weekend in the United States. That's how serious this is.\"\n\nThe July 4 warning was issued by the FBI, Homeland Security, and the National Counterterrorism Center. According to Ridge, unless the United States takes a more aggressive stance against the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL), the warning may become a standard warning, indicating a constant risk to the country.\n\nThe warning comes amid a \"confluence of events,\" as described by House Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul on Sunday. This includes the holiday honoring America's founding, ISIS celebrating its one-year anniversary of major territorial wins this week, and increased Internet traffic with ISIS calling for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, currently underway, to be changed from a month of peace to a month of calamities.\n\nISIS claimed responsibility for three terror attacks on Friday across three continents, which Ridge suggested were likely coordinated. He stated, \"This is a global scourge, and, frankly, until the White House, until this president, western allies, and countries in that region, with the exception of Iran, get serious about destroying ISIL, we're going to be living with this threat on a fairly regular basis.\"",
    " Title: Federal Workers, Contractors File for Unemployment as Shutdown Continues\n\nArticle:\n\nFederal workers and contractors are filing for unemployment benefits as the partial government shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history, enters its fourth week. Long-time federal contractor John Woodson was among those who applied for unemployment at an office in Washington, D.C. on Thursday.\n\n\"We should still be at work right now,\" said Woodson. \"Politicians should handle this\u2014don't put this on the citizens. You're hurting us.\"\n\nEven if Woodson can get unemployment, which pays up to $425 a week in D.C., he says it won't be enough to care for his family. \"I might have to wash some cars, go back detailing or wash some windows\u2014whatever it takes to put some food on the table,\" said Woodson.\n\nFederal workers and contractors are missing paychecks for the first time since the shutdown began on December 22. Officials in D.C. and Maryland say at least 7,000 unemployment claims have been filed by these workers since the shutdown began. They expect that number to rise sharply if the shutdown continues. In all, some 800,000 employees have been affected by the shutdown. An estimated 420,000 are working without pay, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee, while another 380,000 are at home on furlough.\n\nAt a rally for federal workers and their supporters in Silver Spring, Md., on Wednesday, some federal workers said they had no choice but to consider applying for unemployment benefits. \"This is the first time in my working life I am going to have to go to my creditors and say 'I don't know how to pay you.' And it's embarrassing,\" said Michelle, a long-time federal employee who did not want to give her full name because she's worried about potential repercussions.\n\nMichelle wiped away tears as she talked with a group of women about how to apply for unemployment. She never expected to be in this position. \"I show up to work. I do a good job. I'm doing everything a responsible adult is supposed to do,\" said Michelle. \"All of a sudden, it's all blown up and I don't know what else to do.\"\n\nAccording to the federal government, the shutdown will cost at least $50 million a day in lost wages and productivity. However, there are hidden costs, too, that go beyond money, said Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees. \"Who in [the] world is going to want to work for the federal government when [workers] are disrespected...when people are not able to fill prescriptions, bouncing checks [and] ruining their credit?\" said Erwin, whose union represents 100,000 federal workers.\n\nThe details surrounding who is\u2014and isn't\u2014eligible for unemployment can get complicated. Federal employees who've been furloughed can apply for unemployment benefits; workers who've been deemed \"essential\" and are working without pay are not eligible for unemployment. Federal employees who do receive unemployment benefits will have to reimburse the government if Congress votes to give employees backpay\u2014which typically happens when the government re-opens.\n\nThe U.S. Office of Personnel Management has issued guidance for furloughed workers on what to do during a shutdown\u2014including how to write to creditors and mortgage companies. On Friday, President Trump said he would sign a bill passed by both the House and the Senate to give back pay to federal workers affected by the shutdown.",
    " Title: American Contractor Alan Gross Returns to U.S. After Five-Year Imprisonment in Cuba\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant humanitarian prisoner exchange, American contractor Alan Gross has returned to the United States after spending five years in a Cuban prison. The announcement was made today by President Obama at the White House, following over a year of secret high-level talks between the two governments.\n\nThe release of Gross, aged 65, who is reported to be in poor physical condition, marks a first step toward normalizing relations with the neighboring island nation just 90 miles off the Florida coast. The U.S. and Cuba are now set to begin talks to restore diplomatic relations, as announced by the White House.\n\n\"What we are doing is beginning the normalization of relations between the U.S. and Cuba,\" a senior administration official stated. In the coming months, the U.S. plans to re-establish an embassy in Havana, according to President Obama.\n\n\"Today, the United States is taking historic steps to chart a new course in our relations with Cuba and to further engage and empower the Cuban people,\" Obama said. \"We are separated by 90 miles of water, but brought together through the relationships between the two million Cubans and Americans of Cuban descent that live in the United States, and the 11 million Cubans who share similar hopes for a more positive future for Cuba.\"\n\nThe announcement follows a phone conversation between Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro on Tuesday. Their discussion was described as a \"summing up\" of the work done over the past year leading up to these changes. The two leaders discussed issues of importance in the hemisphere, while also acknowledging that they will have differences to address. According to a senior administration official, Obama made clear his intent to maintain U.S. advocacy for human rights in Cuba.\n\nGross was convicted of espionage by a Cuban court in 2011 and sentenced to 15 years for bringing telecommunication devices into Cuba while working as a subcontractor for the United States Agency for International Development. The Cuban government accused him of being party to a U.S.-led plot to overthrow the government through an \"Arab spring.\"\n\nFollowing a recent visit, Gross' attorney described him as nearly toothless, barely able to walk due to arthritis in his hips, and blind in one eye. He has been kept in a small room at a military hospital 24 hours a day with two other Cuban political prisoners. Gross has refused medical and dental care or outside privileges, and declined visits and food from the U.S. Interest section in Havana. He had promised a hunger strike leading to death if not released by the end of this year.\n\nIn a statement released earlier this month to mark the anniversary of Gross' time in jail, Gross' wife Judy said, \"Enough is enough. My husband has paid a terrible price for serving his country and community.\"\n\nIn exchange for Gross, the United States has agreed to the humanitarian release of three Cuban agents convicted of espionage in a controversial trial that found them guilty of spying on anti-Castro groups in Miami, but not the U.S. government. All three were most recently held in North Carolina at a federal medical facility for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons.\n\nThis humanitarian release marks the beginning of a promised new relationship with Cuba. The White House is indicating the beginning of new talks on everything from travel restrictions to eventual lifting of the Cuban embargo, which has been in place since John F. Kennedy was president.\n\nIn an interview last week with Jorge Ramos for Fusion -- a sister network to \u2588\u2588\u2588 -- President Obama said, \"We've been in conversations about how we can get Alan Gross home for quite some time.\"\n\n\"We continue to be concerned about him. We think that he shouldn't have been held in the first place,\" Obama told Ramos. \"With respect to Cuba generally, I've made very clear that the policies that we have in making remittances easier for Cuban families, and making it easier for families to travel, have been helpful to people inside Cuba... But the Cuban government still needs to make significant changes.\"",
    " Title: Prosecutor's Assessment Could Influence Kavanaugh Vote Outcome\n\nArticle:\n\nThe sex-crimes prosecutor, Rachel Mitchell, hired by Republicans to question Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford during Thursday's hearing informed senators that the case would not hold up in a courtroom, according to sources speaking to Fox News. This guidance could be crucial as wavering lawmakers prepare to vote.\n\nMitchell presented her findings during an overnight meeting attended by all 51 Republican senators, two people briefed on the session reported. She reportedly told senators that she would not charge Kavanaugh and would not even seek a search warrant.\n\nMitchell's opinion could sway undecided senators ahead of a critical Senate Judiciary Committee vote scheduled for Friday afternoon. While Kavanaugh does not need majority approval from the committee to advance to the full Senate, a favorable recommendation could bolster his imperiled nomination, and vice-versa.\n\nIn a significant development, Republican Sen. Jeff Flake announced Friday morning that he will support Kavanaugh, stating, \"I left the hearing yesterday with as much doubt as certainty.\" With Flake's announcement, 48 Republican senators have now pledged to vote for Kavanaugh at the scheduled full Senate vote on Tuesday. The remaining Republicans are Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mike Enzi of Wyoming. Enzi is expected to vote in support of Kavanaugh, but has stated he will not announce his position until he votes.\n\nHowever, Collins, Murkowski, Flake, and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin could potentially vote as a bloc. According to a source, Collins, Murkowski, and Flake huddled with Manchin on the sidelines Thursday evening to discuss the nomination before the GOP lawmakers were briefed by Mitchell. They reportedly spoke for approximately 30 minutes.\n\n\"It's a tough one. She offered good testimony, and so did he,\" Flake, who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said Thursday night before announcing his support. \"If you're making an allegation, you want there to be some corroboration. Where is the burden? It's like impeachment. You don't know.\"\n\nRepublicans, including President Trump, have emphasized that none of the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh made in the last several days have first-hand corroboration.\n\nHowever, Ford insisted during Thursday's testimony that Kavanaugh and a friend trapped her in a room during a high school gathering in 1982, and the now-court nominee allegedly tried to force himself on her before she escaped. She stated she is \"100 percent\" sure it was him, though Kavanaugh adamantly denied it.\n\nWhen asked whether more time or investigation would help, as Democrats suggested repeatedly on Thursday, Flake rejected the idea.\n\n\"Where does this start, where does it end?\" he asked. \"More time, more ludicrous allegations. What does that do to the accused?\"\n\nManchin, from deep-red West Virginia, is seen as a possible \"yea\" vote for Kavanaugh.\n\n\"There have been no decisions,\" Manchin reportedly said outside the hearing room. \"There are some concerns that people have, and we're going to try to close that loop.\"\n\nDemocratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana have not revealed which way they might vote.\n\nEarly Friday, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said that he would vote \"no.\"\n\nRepublicans hold a narrow 51-49 majority in the Senate, and can only afford one defection in their bid to confirm Kavanaugh, assuming they secure no Democratic votes. Other Republican senators whose votes were expected to be up in the air, like Sens. Bob Corker, came out in support of Kavanaugh late Thursday.\n\n\"While both individuals provided a compelling testimony, nothing that has been presented corroborates the allegation,\" Corker said in a statement, referring to Kavanaugh and Ford.\n\nKavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations leveled against him by Ford, calling the process a \"national disgrace\" and a \"circus.\"\n\n\"The Constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process,\" Kavanaugh said in his opening statement. \"But you have replaced advise and consent with search and destroy.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced late Thursday a full Senate vote for Tuesday.\n\n\"I think we're going to go ahead,\" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said. \"I worry about every one of these votes.\"",
    " Title: Facebook's Privacy Agreement with Regulators: A Look at the Company's Data Sharing Practices\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook's agreement with regulators in 2011 was a response to the social media platform's early experiments with data sharing. In late 2009, Facebook altered the privacy settings of its 400 million users, making some of their information accessible to all internet users. This information, including users' locations and religious and political leanings, was then shared with Microsoft and other partners.\n\nThis practice, known as \"instant personalization,\" was promoted by Facebook as a step towards a better internet, where companies could use the information to customize content on sites like Bing. However, the feature drew criticism from privacy advocates and Facebook users, who felt that their information was shared without their permission.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigated these practices in 2011, citing the privacy changes as a deceptive practice. Caught off guard, Facebook officials ceased mentioning instant personalization in public and entered into a consent agreement with the FTC.\n\nUnder the decree, Facebook introduced a \"comprehensive privacy program\" to review new products and features. Initially overseen by two chief privacy officers, this program was intended to demonstrate Facebook's commitment to privacy. The company also hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to assess its privacy practices every two years.\n\nHowever, according to four former Facebook employees with direct knowledge of the company's efforts, the privacy program faced internal resistance from the start. Some engineers and executives considered the privacy reviews an impediment to quick innovation and growth. The core team responsible for coordinating the reviews, numbering about a dozen people by 2016, was moved around within Facebook's organization, sending mixed signals about the company's commitment to privacy.\n\nCritically, many of Facebook's special sharing partnerships were not subject to extensive privacy program reviews, according to two of the former employees. Executives believed that because the partnerships were governed by business contracts requiring them to follow Facebook's data policies, they did not require the same level of scrutiny. The privacy team had limited ability to review or suggest changes to some of these data-sharing agreements, which had been negotiated by more senior officials at the company.\n\nFacebook officials stated that members of the privacy team had been consulted on the sharing agreements, but that the level of review \"depended on the specific partnership and the time it was created.\"",
    " Title: Senate Confirms Gina Haspel as First Female CIA Director Despite Controversial Past\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate has approved Gina Haspel as the first female director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), despite her role in the agency's post-9/11 interrogation program. The confirmation came in a 54-45 vote following a partisan debate among senators regarding the CIA's use of enhanced interrogation techniques during the Bush era.\n\nGina Haspel, a CIA veteran, once oversaw a covert detention site in Thailand following the September 11, 2001 attacks. Her confirmation as the CIA's director follows the departure of former CIA chief Mike Pompeo, who left to become the U.S. Secretary of State.\n\nSenator John McCain, a Republican who was tortured during his more than five years in a Vietnamese prison, announced his opposition to President Donald Trump's nominee. However, six Democrats crossed party lines to vote in her favor.\n\nVirginia Senator Mark Warner, one of the Democrats who voted for Haspel, said she had told him the agency should never have resorted to enhanced interrogation techniques. Warner also stated that Haspel had pledged never to use such methods if the president demanded it.\n\n``I believe she is someone who can and will stand up to the president, who will speak truth to power if this president orders her to do something illegal or immoral, like a return to torture,'' Warner said in a speech before the vote.\n\nTwo Republicans, Jeff Flake and Rand Paul, voted against Haspel, meaning she would not have been confirmed without support from Democrats.\n\nRepublican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Richard Burr spoke before the vote, stating the confirmation of a woman as CIA head would send an important message.\n\n``Many others who have served, or are currently serving, have cracked the glass ceiling at the agency. Gina is poised to break it,'' Burr said.\n\n``It may be impossible to measure the importance of that breakthrough, but I do know that it will send a signal to the current workforce and to the workforce of the future that a lifetime of commitment to the agency can and will be rewarded,'' Burr added.\n\nA 33-year veteran of the agency, Haspel, 61, spent most of her career as an undercover operative. In 2002, she was selected by the agency to run a covert detention site in Thailand where harsh interrogation techniques were used that a Senate report deemed to be torture.\n\nOne suspect that was brought there, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, was subjected to methods that were later banned by President Barack Obama. Al-Nashiri, who was interrogated after Haspel took over the post, was also subjected to sleep deprivation, nudity, extreme temperatures, being held in a small box, and \"walling\" (being slammed repeatedly into a wall).\n\nThree years later, Haspel ordered the destruction of 92 video tapes that documented the interrogation of al-Nashiri and Abu Zubaydah, who was also held at the Thai location. At least 119 men were tortured by the US in the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, according to a 2014 Senate report.\n\nHuman rights groups say Haspel left Thailand to oversee further US torture, but it is unclear what role she played as her exact record has been classified by the CIA. Trump has previously called for the US to resume waterboarding terrorism suspects.",
    " Title: U.S. Senate Reviews U.S.-Saudi Relations Amid Yemen Crisis; Iran's Role in Yemen Conflict Highlighted\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate is currently reviewing U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia, including the U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led coalition in the Yemen conflict. The humanitarian crisis in Yemen, caused by the ongoing conflict between the Saudi-supported government and the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, has claimed over 57,000 lives, driven half of Yemen's 28 million people to the brink of famine, and displaced 2.3 million Yemenis from their homes.\n\nThe article highlights Iran's direct responsibility for the suffering, violence, and tragedy in Yemen. Iran is reportedly using arms transfers, training, and terrorist proxies to empower the Houthi rebels, terrorize Yemeni civilians, undermine the security of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and challenge U.S. national security interests in the region.\n\nHouthi rebels have used Iranian-supplied advanced arms in the Yemen conflict, indiscriminately launching over 100 ballistic missiles against Saudi cities, unleashing explosive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) against Saudi civilian targets, and deploying explosive boats and anti-ship missiles against commercial ships in the Arabian Gulf.\n\nMoreover, Iran-backed Houthi rebels have detained thousands of Yemenis and reportedly subjected many of them to \"extreme torture,\" including being beaten with batons, hung from chains by their wrists or genitals for weeks at a time, and scorched with acid.\n\nIran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah terrorists have provided training and support that have greatly increased the lethality and combat effectiveness of Houthi rebels, and enhanced their ability to threaten Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, international shipping in the Gulf, and U.S. forces in the region.\n\nWhile the article acknowledges the need for accountability for Saudi Arabia's role in the Khashoggi murder, it emphasizes the importance of addressing Iran's central role in perpetuating Yemen's conflict. The article argues that failure to do so risks prolonging the conflict and causing more war, oppression, and misery in the region.\n\nThe article also discusses the need for a political solution to end the conflict, but warns against any negotiation that would formalize an Iranian-Yemeni security relationship or provide a strong incentive for the Iranian regime to cause other conflicts in the region. The article also highlights the ongoing threat of extremist networks in Yemen, such as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and ISIS-Yemen, and the need to maintain U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the region.",
    " Title: Obama's State of the Union Address: Focus on Economic Fairness and Middle-Class Economics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Obama, with a Congress controlled by an opposing party, addressed the economic challenges facing the nation, emphasizing the disparity between the wealthy and the middle and working classes. He proposed a redistribution of wealth through tax increases on the wealthy and the use of other measures to raise wages and create jobs.\n\nThe President did not engage in a stark debate on economic inequality as some economists have, instead focusing on the virtues of \"middle-class economics.\" He posed the question, \"Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well, or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?\"\n\nPresident Obama's proposals, such as raising the capital gains tax to 28 percent, which was the rate during the Reagan era, and imposing ordinary income tax rates on dividends, are not radical. He also aims to end a provision in the tax code that shields hundreds of billions of dollars in appreciated wealth passed on to heirs. These changes, along with a new fee on big banks, would finance tax breaks for middle-income families, including credits for two-earner couples, increased child care and college tuition credits, as well as other programs, including two years of tuition-free community college for some students.\n\nThe proposal is designed to be revenue-neutral, with the tax increases paying for the new programs to avoid the ongoing debates over deficits that have exhausted both political parties and the American public.\n\nWhile the rhetoric in the address was combative and defiant at times, the President's proposal is not a new concept, as it aims to address the plight of the middle class and the larger issue of economic inequality. By raising these issues, President Obama has inserted economic fairness into the political debate, making it difficult for future Democratic candidates, such as Hillary Rodham Clinton, to ignore these concerns. Even Republican candidates, who may be reluctant to raise taxes on top-tier earners, may find the idea of helping the middle class attractive.",
    " Title: Email Alerts Detail Unfolding Events of U.S. Consulate Attack in Benghazi\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Tuesday, six weeks ago, the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, resulting in the death of four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Newly obtained email alerts reveal the earliest description of the events that transpired during the attack.\n\nAt 4:05 p.m. Eastern time on September 11, an alert from the State Department Operations Center was issued to various government and intelligence agencies, including the White House Situation Room, the office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the FBI. The alert read, \"US Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi Under Attack.\" It described approximately 20 armed individuals firing shots and explosions being heard. The ambassador, who was currently in Benghazi, and four COM (Chief of Mission/embassy) personnel were reported to be in the compound's safe haven.\n\nAt 4:54 p.m., less than an hour later, another alert was issued: \"the firing... in Benghazi... has stopped... A response team is on site attempting to locate COM (embassy) personnel.\"\n\nThen, at 6:07 p.m., State sent out another alert stating that the embassy in Tripoli reported the Islamic military group \"Ansar al-Sharia Claims Responsibility for Benghazi Attack\" on Facebook and Twitter and had called for an attack on Embassy Tripoli.\n\nThe emails are part of what are likely a large number of communications exchanged throughout the night. They are expected to become part of the ongoing political debate over whether the administration attempted to mislead by stating the assault was an outgrowth of a protest rather than a planned attack by terrorists.\n\nFourteen hours after the attack, President Obama sat down with Steve Kroft of \"60 Minutes\" for a previously scheduled interview and said he did not believe it was simply due to mob violence. \"You're right that this is not a situation that was -- exactly the same as what happened in Egypt and my suspicion is that there are folks involved in this who were looking to target Americans from the start,\" Mr. Obama said.\n\nThe White House and State Department declined comment on the email alerts. The House Oversight Committee told the source that the information in the emails will be part of their ongoing investigation into the Benghazi attack.",
    " Title: Obama Promises Bipartisan Approach, Vows to Work with Compromising Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a political fundraiser on Wednesday, former President Barack Obama pledged to advocate for Democratic ideals while maintaining a bipartisan tone. He emphasized the need for a politics that aligns with the American people's decency, hard work, and creativity.\n\nSpeaking at the Chicago Hilton, Obama acknowledged the current political climate's challenges, stating, \"We've got a politics that's stuck right now.\" He vowed to collaborate with Republicans who view compromise as a positive aspect, aiming to create a government suitable for the next generation of Americans.\n\nThe event, hosted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), was the first of two fundraisers Obama attended during his one-night visit to his hometown. Attendees, who paid between $1,000 and $5,000, listened to Obama discuss gun control, education, U.S. infrastructure, and climate change.\n\nObama emphasized the potential for energy independence, stating, \"We will over the next couple of decades have the capacity to be energy independent for the first time - incredible change.\" He also highlighted the need to address climate change, stating, \"The climate is changing in ways that we can't fully predict, but we know are not going to be good for our kids.\"\n\nIn addition to donors, the audience included members of the Illinois congressional delegation, Democratic power players such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, DCCC Chairman Rep. Steve Israel, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who served as White House chief of staff during Obama's first two years as president.\n\nFollowing the Hilton event, Obama visited the home of longtime supporters and Democratic activists Paul and Bettylu Saltzman. Obama expressed gratitude for their support, stating they played a crucial role in his presidential campaign. A crowd of approximately 70 people paid either $10,000 per person or $32,400 per couple for dinner with the president.\n\nThe pair of fundraisers marks the third time Obama has headlined events for the DCCC; he is scheduled for three more this year.",
    " Title: Democrats Prepare to Advance Progressive Agenda in New Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nWith the Democrats set to take control of the House of Representatives in January, a wave of big-government bills is expected to be introduced and potentially voted on. These measures, which have been stalled under Republican leadership for years, include proposals like \"Medicare for all\" and various generous welfare programs.\n\nRep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.) told Fox News that many of these measures, such as the \"Medicare for all\" and similar proposals, could see a floor vote under Democratic leadership. However, with the Republican Party's expanded majority in the Senate, it is unlikely these measures would make it to President Trump's desk.\n\nThe consideration of these measures on the House side would mark a first step in formally considering major government expansions in areas like education and health care, which Democrats increasingly favor. \"Medicare for all\" and similar proposals, such as the \"Green New Deal\" platform being pushed by progressive lawmakers like Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, could reveal the extent of their support.\n\nThe \"Green New Deal\" platform also calls for a tuition-free and federally funded education system, guaranteed jobs with an emphasis on \"green\" jobs, and more. The support for this plan among Democratic lawmakers is unclear, but more than 40 Democratic lawmakers have expressed backing for the \"Green New Deal\" in some form.\n\nIn addition to these measures, individual bills sponsored by Democratic members during the last two years, which could now be voted on, include proposals for \"college for all,\" \"debt-free college,\" \"child care for all,\" and a \"jobs guarantee.\"\n\nRep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), likely the incoming chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee, has also introduced a \"Worker's Freedom to Negotiate Act\" that bans state laws that allow employees to opt not to join a union and pay union dues. The Democratic campaign plan also calls for spending $ 40 billion on \"universal high-speed Internet.\"\n\nRep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) has been a leading advocate of the Child Care for Working Families Act, a concept promoted in the party's campaign plan. The legislation would ensure that no family under 150 percent of a state's median income pays more than 7 percent of their income for child care.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said he anticipates his Job Opportunities for All Act\u2014with 22 Democratic co-sponsors\u2014will make it to the floor in the new Congress. The legislation, which Khanna has said fulfills part of President Franklin Roosevelt's proposed \"economic bill of rights,\" would provide federal funding to put people to work immediately in both the public and the private sector.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) could play a prominent role in such legislative proposals. She is a co-chairwoman of the Medicare For All Caucus, which has nearly 80 members committed to a complete government-run health care system. Jayapal was also the sponsor of the College for All Act in 2017, which would eliminate tuition and fees at public colleges and universities for families earning up to $ 125,000, and make community college free for everyone. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) introduced the Senate version. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), the other progressive caucus co-chairman, introduced a similar bill, the Debt-Free College Act, which would provide more federal funding to states to alleviate student loan debt.\n\nFred Lucas is the White House correspondent for the Daily Signal.",
    " Title: White House Faces Challenges as Democratic Unity Cracks over Obamacare Website Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic Party's unity, which held strong during the government shutdown in October 2013, has reportedly begun to fracture due to issues with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) website.\n\nFor weeks leading up to the shutdown, President Barack Obama managed to keep every Democrat in the House and Senate united. However, the problems with the Obamacare website have transformed the president from a man with political capital to one who appears to be on the defensive.\n\nThe website's botched rollout has led to growing impatience and dismay among Democrats, with some questioning the administration's strategy and others pushing for changes to the current position that the problems can be fixed without altering the deadlines or time frame.\n\nSenator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) has been vocal in his criticism, suggesting a delay in the individual mandate penalty for a year. Manchin, who has always been suspicious of the individual mandate, has not received a response from the White House regarding his proposal.\n\nDespite these challenges, White House officials maintain that most people outside of Washington view Obamacare as a non-political issue and want to see it preserved, if repaired. They argue that any political fallout will be addressed as they overhaul the site.\n\nHowever, the situation remains fluid, with the extent of the Democratic Party's internal divisions unclear. The White House is reportedly dealing with a bizarre episode involving Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Speaker John Boehner's denial of an unnamed Republican's alleged insult towards the president.\n\nPrivately, some Republicans express concern with the party's focus on the website, suggesting that attention should be directed towards other potentially problematic aspects of the law. Polls show support for Republicans remains low, while support for Obamacare is still ticking up.\n\nThe situation underscores the challenges the Obama administration faces in implementing the Affordable Care Act and maintaining Democratic unity on the issue.",
    " Title: New York Attorney General Files Lawsuit Against Trump Foundation, Alleges Extensive Lawbreaking\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York Attorney General Barbara Underwood has filed a lawsuit against the Trump Foundation, President Donald Trump, and his three eldest children, Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka, alleging extensive and persistent lawbreaking. The lawsuit seeks to dissolve the foundation and $2.8 million in restitution.\n\nIn a statement, Ms. Underwood accused the foundation and its directors, including Mr. Trump, of unlawful political coordination, repeated self-dealing transactions, and violating laws under which non-profit organizations must operate.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the foundation and its directors illegally coordinated with the Trump presidential campaign, using the foundation's name and funds raised to promote the campaign. The petition also claims that Mr. Trump used charitable assets to pay off legal obligations, to promote his own businesses, and to purchase personal items, including a painting of himself.\n\nThe Trump Foundation issued a statement denying the charges and accusing the attorney general of holding its $1.7 million in remaining funds \"hostage for political gain.\"\n\nThe lawsuit is the culmination of a two-year investigation that began under the previous New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman. Mr. Schneiderman resigned last month after several former girlfriends accused him of physical abuse.\n\nIn October 2016, Mr. Schneiderman ordered the Trump Foundation to stop fundraising in New York, after finding it had no proper registration. President-elect Trump vowed to shut the charitable foundation down in December 2016, to avoid \"even the appearance\" of any conflict of interest.\n\nThe Trump Foundation lawsuit adds to Mr. Trump's legal challenges, which include a wide-ranging special counsel investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has indicted several of Mr. Trump's associates and raided the home and office of the president's long-time lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen.\n\nThursday's 41-page document filed with the NY Supreme Court spells out a range of alleged violations of laws concerning non-profit organizations, dating back more than a decade. The investigation apparently found that the foundation was \"little more than an empty shell that functions with no oversight by its board of directors.\" The board had not met since 1999, despite being legally required to meet annually, and did not oversee the foundation's activities \"in any way,\" the document says.\n\nMr. Trump, who has not contributed any personal funds to the foundation since 2008, was the sole signatory on the foundation's bank accounts and approved all of its grants. Several pages of the document focus on a charity fundraiser for veterans in Iowa in January 2016, which Mr. Trump chose to hold instead of taking part in a TV debate with other Republican presidential hopefuls ahead of the influential state's caucuses. More than $2.8 million was donated to the Trump Foundation at that event. The petition alleges that those funds raised from the public were used to promote Mr. Trump's campaign for the presidency, in particular in the Iowa nominating caucuses.\n\nThe lawsuit also claims that the foundation paid $100,000 to settle legal claims against Mr. Trump's Mar-A-Lago resort, $158,000 to settle claims against one of his golf clubs, and $10,000 to purchase a painting of Mr. Trump to hang at another of his golf clubs. The purchase of the painting was an example of one of \"at least five self-dealing transactions\" which violate tax regulations on non-profit charities, the statement said.\n\n\"As our investigation reveals, the Trump Foundation was little more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose or legality,\" Ms. Underwood said.",
    " Title: NSA Acknowledges Thousands of Privacy Violations in Annual Audit\n\nArticle:\n\nThe National Security Agency (NSA) faced criticism on Friday following the release of an internal audit showing the agency had violated privacy rules thousands of times annually since 2008. The Washington Post reported the details on Thursday, sparking a renewed debate in Washington over the NSA's impact on Americans' privacy.\n\nSenator Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, expressed concern about the NSA's actions and stated that his committee will hold a hearing on the matter. Leahy stated, \"I remain concerned that we are still not getting straightforward answers from the NSA.\"\n\nJohn DeLong, the NSA's director of compliance, admitted that \"mistakes occur,\" but insisted that only a \"tiny\" amount of such issues were intentional. In a call with reporters, DeLong emphasized that \"no one at NSA thinks a mistake is OK.\"\n\nThe May 2012 audit found 2,776 incidents of \"unauthorized collection, storage, access to or distribution of legally protected communications\" in the preceding 12 months, according to the Washington Post. Most of these incidents involved failures of due diligence or violations of standard operating procedure, with the most serious incidents including a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 Americans and green-card holders.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, stated that her committee \"can and should do more to independently verify that NSA's operations are appropriate, and its reports of compliance incidents are accurate.\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also called for \"rigorous oversight\" by Congress on the \"incidents of non-compliance.\"\n\nThe Washington Post reported that most incidents involved unauthorized surveillance of Americans or foreign intelligence targets in the country. In one case, a programming error led to the interception of a \"large number\" of calls placed from Washington due to a confusion between the capitol's 202 area code and the international dialing code for Egypt.\n\nThe NSA stated that factors such as the implementation of new procedures, technology or software changes, and expanded access can cause the number of incidents to trend up or down from one quarter to the next. The agency also emphasized its commitment to identifying and addressing incidents and driving the numbers down.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest offered a statement on Friday, saying the NSA compliance office's review reflects its commitment to abiding by the law and protecting people's privacy. The man who leaked the audit to the Post, Edward Snowden, has been charged with felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, for the leaks. Snowden currently resides in Russia after fleeing to Hong Kong following the leaks.\n\nA CNN/ORC International survey released last month indicated that 52% of the public disapproved of Snowden's actions, while 44% said they approved of the leaks. Fifty-four percent of those questioned in the poll said the government should attempt to bring Snowden back to the United States and prosecute him for his leaks. As for the program Snowden revealed, there is a noticeable generational divide on the surveillance tactics, with younger Americans more likely to support Snowden than older Americans.",
    " Title: GOP Rep. Lou Barletta Wins Pennsylvania Republican Senate Primary, Faces Off Against Democratic Incumbent Bob Casey Jr.\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican Representative Lou Barletta has emerged victorious in the Pennsylvania Republican Senate primary, defeating state Representative Jim Christiana. The Associated Press declared the race for Barletta after 52 percent of precincts had reported their numbers, showing he had 59 percent of the votes.\n\nBarletta, who was endorsed by President Donald Trump in a February tweet, will now face Democratic incumbent Bob Casey Jr. in the high-stakes race for U.S. Senate. In the tweet, Trump praised Barletta as \"a Great Republican\" and pointed out that he was one of his \"very earliest supporters.\" Trump also criticized Casey, stating that he listens to \"Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer.\"\n\nIn a tweet on Wednesday, Trump congratulated Barletta on his victory, saying, \"Lou is a friend of mine and a special guy, he will very much help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nTrump's endorsement of Barletta was evident in another tweet sent out on May 16, 2018, where he expressed his confidence in Barletta's ability to represent the people of Pennsylvania effectively.\n\nBarletta will now be taking on Casey in the November general election for U.S. Senate. The outcome of this election will determine who will represent Pennsylvania in the U.S. Senate. Further information regarding the candidates' positions and policies is unavailable at this time.",
    " Title: Media's Advice to Trump and the Ongoing Criticism of John Brennan\n\nArticle:\n\nThe relationship between the media and the Republican Party, particularly in the context of President Donald Trump, has been a subject of debate. The article suggests that the media often provides unsolicited and potentially harmful advice to the GOP, with the party's success often inversely proportional to its adherence to this advice.\n\nIn the case of Trump, the article argues that his success is not despite but because of his disregard for media counsel. The author suggests that Trump should continue to criticize Special Counsel Robert Mueller, detailing his conflicts of interest and exposing the partisan nature of the investigation.\n\nThe article also criticizes media reactions to the prospect of Trump firing Mueller, stating that such an action would not have significant consequences, and any temporary backlash from the media and the ruling class would be minimal.\n\nThe article further discusses a principle it claims the media would not extend to a Democrat, namely, that a duly elected president should not be allowed to run their own executive branch. The author suggests that Trump should challenge this principle, asserting that he was elected by the American people and should govern accordingly.\n\nThe article also mentions former CIA Director John Brennan's call for government officials to refuse orders to fire Mueller. The author characterizes Brennan's comments as treasonous and anti-American, comparing him to a Soviet plant and a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood. The article concludes by stating that there is no difference between the John Brennan of the 1970s and the John Brennan of today, both of whom are calling for mutiny against a duly elected U.S. president.\n\nThe article also implies a criticism of the media for normalizing left-wing radicalism and casting such comments as evidence of high patriotism and statesmanlike sagacity. The author suggests that the media's hostility to the American people has not changed from its baby boomerish nihilism.",
    " Title: Obama Warns of Red Line on Syrian Chemical Weapons Use\n\nArticle:\n\nIn August, former President Barack Obama stated that any evidence of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad moving chemical weapons in a threatening manner or using them would be a \"red line\" for the United States, potentially prompting direct American intervention.\n\nHowever, American officials have not yet determined whether the recent activity in Syria approaches the red line set by Obama. A senior American diplomat, deeply involved in the effort to dissuade Assad's forces from using chemical weapons, suggested the activity could be a sign of desperation rather than a direct threat.\n\nA senior Israeli official speculated that the movement of chemical weapons and the apparent preparations to use them could be a bluff, intended as a warning to the West during a time of debate over increased support to opposition groups.\n\nThe White House has remained silent on intelligence reports regarding the situation, but a senior administration official issued a warning to the Syrians. The official stated that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would cross a red line for the United States. The official also emphasized that the U.S. is monitoring developments related to Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles and is in regular contact with international partners who share the concern.\n\nRepresentative Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who heads the House Intelligence Committee, declined to comment on the new intelligence reports but expressed concern about the potential collapse of the Assad regime and the dangerous vacuum it would create. Rogers also warned that the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime would be a serious escalation demanding decisive action from the international community.\n\nSeveral months ago, the United States military sent a task force of over 150 planners and specialists to Jordan to help the armed forces prepare for the possibility of Syria losing control of its chemical weapons. Turkey has requested two batteries of the Patriot antimissile system from NATO, in part as protection against Syrian missiles that might enter Turkish territory.\n\nThis is not the first time activity at stockpile sites has been detected. In September, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta stated that there had been \"some movement\" of Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles to more secure locations. However, the new activity appears to be of a different nature, and officials are no longer willing to confirm that all the sites remain secure.\n\nSince the crisis in Syria began, the United States and its allies have increased electronic eavesdropping and other surveillance activities of the sites. A senior defense official stated that no U.S. troops had been put on heightened alert in response to the activity, although the Pentagon is prepared to do so if necessary.",
    " Title: George Conway Discusses Trump Administration, Marriage, and Political Allegiance in Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo News' podcast Skullduggery on Friday, George Conway, husband to Kellyanne Conway, one of President Trump's closest advisers, discussed his views on the Trump administration, his wife's role in the White House, and their differing political views.\n\nConway, who has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration, spoke about being considered for a position at the Justice Department as the chief of the civil division, a role that would have involved him in defending the administration in lawsuits.\n\nRegarding his wife's feelings about his public criticisms of the administration, Conway stated, \"I don\u2019t think she likes it.\" However, he added, \"I\u2019ve told her, I don\u2019t like the administration, so it\u2019s even.\"\n\nConway compared their political disagreements to those common in Washington, D.C., stating, \"If I had a nickel for everybody in Washington who disagrees with their spouse on something that happens in this town, I wouldn\u2019t be on this podcast. I\u2019d be probably on a beach somewhere.\"\n\nConway withdrew his candidacy for the Justice Department role, stating, \"The administration is like a shit show in a dumpster fire.\" He cited events such as the firing of James Comey, Trump's comments about Russia, and the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel as reasons for his decision.\n\nDespite their differences, Conway praised his wife's work, stating, \"She basically got this guy elected. She steadied that boat.\" He also expressed pride in his wife's role in helping Trump become president during the campaign.\n\nHowever, Conway criticized the current state of the Republican party under Trump, describing it as a \"personality cult.\" He went on to say that he had switched parties and no longer felt comfortable being a Republican. He also expressed a preference for moving to Australia rather than voting for Trump again.",
    " Title: Israel Warns of Iran's Nuclear Program and Links to Holocaust, as Tensions Rise over Peace Talks and Apartheid Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions between Israel and the international community, particularly the United States, have escalated in recent days as peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have stalled and concerns over Iran's nuclear program have resurfaced. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a stern warning during the country's annual memorial day for the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust, linking the Nazi genocide to Iran's suspected nuclear ambitions and its leaders' denial of the Holocaust.\n\nAt the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, Netanyahu questioned why world leaders in the years before the Holocaust failed to recognize the danger ahead of time. He stated, \"In hindsight, all the signs were there.\" The Obama administration's approach to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons has been criticized, with some claiming it has been placed on the back burner.\n\nMeanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry's comments about Israel during peace talks have caused controversy. In a closed-door meeting with influential world leaders, Kerry suggested that if a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not reached soon, Israel risks becoming \"an apartheid state.\" This comparison has sparked outrage among Jewish leaders in America and could attract unwanted attention in Israel.\n\nThe use of the term \"apartheid\" by a senior American official is rare, and President Obama has previously rejected the idea that the term should apply to Israel. The Obama administration's approach to foreign policy, particularly in the Middle East, has been criticized by some as isolating allies and promoting enemies. The potential withdrawal of sanctions by Russia on Iran further complicates the situation.",
    " Title: U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm Faces Criminal Charges from Federal Prosecutors\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York (AP) - The attorney representing Republican U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm has stated that the congressman has not committed any wrongdoing but expressed no surprise about the criminal charges he is facing from federal prosecutors. Grimm has been under investigation for possible campaign finance violations since his first campaign for Congress in 2009 and 2010.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, said, \"After more than two years of investigation plagued by malicious leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy, and strong-arm tactics, the U.S. Attorney's Office has disclosed its intent to file criminal charges against Congressman Grimm. When the dust settles, he will be vindicated.\"\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn declined to comment or confirm or deny the case. The FBI's New York office, which handles investigations, also declined to comment.\n\nIn November, the House Ethics Committee announced that Grimm was under investigation for possible campaign finance violations. After the announcement, the panel said it would defer its inquiry because of a separate Department of Justice investigation.\n\nGrimm made headlines in January after confronting a New York City cable news station reporter who tried to question him about a long-running FBI investigation into campaign finance on a balcony in the Capitol. Grimm was indicted in Brooklyn on Friday on charges related to the use of straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions.\n\nDuring Grimm's first campaign, he acknowledged receiving $250,000 to $300,000 in contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto. Some members of Pinto's congregation subsequently said they made tens of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions, including gifts passed through straw donors.\n\nGrimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, and the FBI hasn't accused him of any wrongdoing. The Israeli businessman who had served as Grimm's liaison to Pinto's followers, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty in August to an immigration fraud charge.\n\nThree days after Biton's guilty plea, the FBI filed a sealed criminal complaint accusing a Houston woman named Diana Durand, who had been romantically involved with Grimm, of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions.\n\nAttorney Stuart Kaplan said Durand would plead not guilty to the charges. Kaplan, who said Durand and Grimm met in Texas before Grimm ran for Congress, said he was hopeful prosecutors wouldn't join the two cases.\n\n\"When you take out their relationship, there's no evidence to connect either one with respect to complicity, violating the law by acting in concert or doing something as a criminal enterprise,\" he said.\n\nA spokesman in Grimm's Washington office did not immediately return emails or a telephone message seeking comment.\n\nA House member who has been indicted does not lose any rights or privileges under federal law or the chamber's rules, according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nRules used by the two major political parties require indicted committee or subcommittee chairmen, or members of a party's leadership, to temporarily step aside. Grimm is not a chairman or a member of the leadership.",
    " Title: Sanders Leads in Ad Spending, Trump Excels in Efficiency\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2016 U.S. general election is shaping up to be the most expensive in history, with a significant increase in the number of television ads aired compared to the 2012 election. According to a report from the Wesleyan Media Project, 480,000 ads have aired thus far in the 2016 election cycle, a 112% increase over the same period in 2012.\n\nIn the Democratic race, Bernie Sanders has spent the most on television ads, totaling nearly 125,000 ads as of May 8. Sanders, who has relied heavily on small donors, has spent approximately $18.5 million, compared to Hillary Clinton's $16.9 million on 105,000 ads. However, Clinton has earned more votes, and when spending per vote is considered, Clinton has spent about $5 per vote, while Sanders has spent about $8 per vote.\n\nOn the Republican side, the spending per vote disparities are more pronounced. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, who dropped out before any contests took place, spent approximately $17,000 per vote, according to election tracking site The Green Papers. Jindal's campaign dwarfs all other candidates listed by Wesleyan, but his astronomical figure is skewed due to potentially uncounted write-in votes.\n\nExcluding Jindal's spending, the Republican candidates spent significantly less per vote. Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Lindsey Graham, and John Kasich, who amassed millions but had few votes to show for it, spent between $2 and $4 per vote. The majority of their ads were bought through money from outside groups like superPACs, with over 90% of the money for Bush, Christie, and Jindal's ads coming from outside groups, along with nearly 60% for Graham.\n\nDonald Trump, who has spent about $2 on TV ads per vote, stands out as the most efficient candidate in terms of ad spending. Trump's name recognition and ability to generate free media coverage may have contributed to the effectiveness of his ads, as he had received an estimated $2 billion in free media coverage as of March.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2016 U.S. general election is on track to be the most expensive in history, with significant differences in ad spending and spending per vote between the candidates. Bernie Sanders has spent the most on television ads, but Donald Trump has excelled in ad efficiency, spending less per vote than any of his competitors.",
    " Title: Pentagon Clarifies Number of Troops Treated for Brain Injuries Following Iraq Operation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Pentagon has provided an update on the number of troops who have been diagnosed with brain injuries following a recent operation in Iraq. According to the military, 11 troops were initially pulled out for treatment, but subsequent follow-on screenings have revealed that the actual number is 34.\n\nAs of Friday, 17 of the 34 troops have returned to duty, including one service member who was transferred to Kuwait for further treatment. Eight service members have been transferred to the United States for treatment after initially being sent to Germany. Nine are still undergoing treatment and evaluation in Germany.\n\nMark T. Esper, the Secretary of Defense, attributed the change in numbers to symptoms that \"are late-developing and manifest over a period of time.\" He explained that while some troops initially screened for concussion-like symptoms showed improvement, others did not, with some conditions worsening and requiring further treatment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had previously played down the initial reports of injuries, stating on Wednesday that the injuries were not \"very serious.\" However, Esper defended the Pentagon's reporting of injuries around the globe, stating that they are committed to being transparent and accurate in their reporting, and that they categorize things properly. Esper also noted that this is not limited to Iraq, but applies to troops engaged worldwide.",
    " Title: Facebook's Trending Topics Allegations: A Call for Informed Consumer Choice\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook's Trending Topics, a feature that provides users with a headline feed of the top stories generating discussion on the social network, has been under scrutiny following a Gizmodo investigation. The investigation alleges that the Trending Topics index is less \"organic\" than advertised, with conservative news and opinion sites being excluded from the feed.\n\nAccording to Gizmodo's sources, topics related to conservative events, personalities, and news sites were suppressed. Excluded sites included The Drudge Report, Breitbart News, The Washington Examiner, and RedState, a site owned by Townhall Media Group, which also owns Hot Air, where the author is employed as senior editor.\n\nThe suppressed topics ranged from major annual conservative events like the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) to discussions about conservative politicians such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R). Some curators reportedly received instructions to \"inject\" topics into the index to artificially produce discussion, with some injected topics appearing to be agenda promotion, such as the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nFacebook, of course, denies these allegations. Tom Stocky, the Facebook executive in charge of trending topics, stated, \"We take these reports extremely seriously, and have found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true.\" Facebook's explanation of the trending index states that the topics displayed are based on factors including engagement, timeliness, Pages liked, and location.\n\nIn the wake of these allegations, discussion among conservatives on social media has turned to questions of whether conservative sites should abandon Facebook. The author argues that this would be a mistake, as Facebook is a significant platform with nearly three in five American adults having a Facebook account. Failing to be part of Facebook would make conservatism more insular than it already is.\n\nHowever, the author also emphasizes the need for conservatives (and all Facebook users) to treat Facebook more skeptically than they once did. With the increasing access and choice in news sources, consumers should exercise their own choices and call out those biases when they become obvious. Informed consumer choice is not just an antidote to editorial bias, but a freedom worth embracing on any and all social networks.",
    " Title: White House Clarifies IRS Investigation Involvement, Consults with Treasury Department\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has revised its explanation of its knowledge regarding the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) investigation into the scrutiny of conservative political groups. On Tuesday, press secretary Jay Carney revealed that the White House had consulted with the Treasury Department on the timing and content of the public release of the IRS audit findings.\n\nAccording to Carney, these discussions, led by Deputy Chief of Staff Mark Childress, focused on the timing of the release of the information and the findings of the actual audit. The conversations reportedly included discussions about a potential speech by Lois Lerner, who oversaw the IRS's work on tax-exempt groups, and the acting commissioner's potential testimony and statements regarding the issue.\n\nBesides Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, Deputy Chief of Staff Mark Childress, and White House Counsel Kathy Ruemmler, Carney has only named one other senior White House staffer who was aware of the IRS probe: White House Counsel Kathy Ruemmler. Carney stated that Ruemmler made the decision not to inform the president of the forthcoming inspector general report on the issue.\n\nCarney's revelation of additional information about which officials were aware of the situation and when they were informed was in response to specific questions. However, when pressed for more details about who else knew of the report's existence before the first news stories about it emerged on May 10, and how they were informed, Carney provided limited information.\n\nThe briefing grew testy when Carney was asked whether he was among the senior staff who were told of the IRS investigation before news reports emerged. He confirmed that he was not, like the president, who also learned about it from news reports.\n\nAs on Monday, Carney again defended the White House's position of not looping in the president about the inspector general's report of the IRS before the news became public.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the White House had consulted with the IRS on how to make the findings public, instead of with the Treasury Department.",
    " Title: Medicaid Doctors Face 42% Pay Cut as Obamacare Payment Boost Expires\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act temporarily increased payment rates for primary care doctors who see Medicaid patients in 2013 and 2014. The aim was to ensure doctors continued participating in Medicaid, which typically has low reimbursement rates, as the program expanded to cover millions more Americans in 2015.\n\nThe earlier Obamacare pay raise averaged out to a 73% increase for primary care doctors across the country. However, it was temporary, lasting only two years, and is set to end on December 31, 2014. As a result, beginning January 1, 2015, Medicaid doctors will earn less each time they see a patient, or they could decide to withdraw from the program altogether. The exact impact on doctors' decisions remains uncertain.\n\nHere's a quick guide to why the raise happened, why it's ending, and what it means for the future of Obamacare:\n\n1. Obamacare raised Medicaid's primary care payments in 2013 and 2014\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, Medicare (the federal insurance program for the elderly) paid doctors more than Medicaid (the state-federal insurance program for the poor). On average, Medicaid paid doctors about two-thirds of what Medicare paid, although there was significant variation across the country.\n\nEven though Medicaid paid less, it has generally done a good job ensuring patients can see primary care doctors. However, there was a concern that, after Obamacare, this might not be the case. Medicaid is one of the two main programs the law relies on to expand health insurance coverage (the other is the marketplaces). Forecasters estimated that 13 million additional people would join the program in Obamacare's first decade, and 7 million of those people would sign up in the first year.\n\nResearch has found that doctors are more likely to accept new Medicaid patients when their payment rates are higher. The Affordable Care Act included a provision that aimed to encourage doctors to continue or join the program as it expanded to cover millions more Americans. Beginning in 2013, the law increased Medicaid primary care doctors' reimbursement rates to match those of Medicare (specialists did not receive any increase). The law funded the increased payments through the end of 2014, setting up a looming cliff that we're now approaching.\n\n2. Doctors will see a 42% pay cut in 2015\nThis is an estimate from the Urban Institute, which ran the numbers on how payment rates will change in 2015. The decline will vary significantly from state to state, as each state sets its own payment rates for primary care doctors. In a state like California, for example, which tended to pay Medicaid doctors very low rates, Obamacare has doubled their fees. But in North Carolina, where the two programs' fees were more similar, the pay rate increase was much smaller.\n\n3. The federal government will not extend the pay cut\nMostly because it's expensive: the two years of the pay-bump cost the federal government $11 billion.\n\nMedicaid advocacy groups have lobbied Congress to extend the pay cut for at least two years. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) did introduce legislation that would extend the pay bump until 2016. However, the issue has not gained traction; the Murray-Brown bill has languished in committee since its introduction this past summer. As a result, barring any last-minute miracle, Medicaid payment rates will decline in many states\u2014but not all\u2014on January 1, 2015.\n\n4. Fifteen states are stepping in to extend the payment raise\nMedicaid is a joint federal-state program, with the two governments splitting the bill for patients' coverage. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 15 states will step in and provide funding to either fully or partially continue the payment increase.\n\nWhat's notable about this map, however, is that the states stepping in tend to be those that were already paying Medicaid doctors well in the first place. They are places like New Mexico, which, before Obamacare, paid primary doctors 85% of the Medicare rate, or Mississippi, which paid 90%.\n\nThe states that have a much bigger gap between Medicaid and Medicare payments, like California, are not generally stepping in to avert the payment cut. This is probably due to the fact that fixing the bigger gaps is so much more expensive.\n\n5. Nobody knows what this will mean for Medicaid patients' access to care\nThe worry among Medicaid advocates is that lower payment rates will translate into fewer doctors being willing to see patients. This is articulated in a recent New York Times article, citing data from Ohio:\n\nA survey by the Ohio State Medical Association found that some Ohio doctors began accepting Medicaid patients because of the rate increase in 2013. Ohio doctors who were already participating in the program said they had accepted more Medicaid patients after the rate increase. And almost 40% of Ohio doctors indicated that they planned to accept fewer Medicaid patients when the extra payments lapsed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that states that pay more for primary care in Medicaid do have more doctors accepting new patients. This chart from Health Affairs shows the correlation:\n\nThose are the reasons for concern\u2014but there are also reasons to think things might go okay, too. Medicaid patients tend to have just as good access to primary care as patients in private coverage. One 2012 study commissioned by the federal government found that Medicaid patients are equally as likely to have had a routine check-up in the past year as those with private insurance. The real challenges in access tend to happen when patients seek specialty care.\n\nAnd it's worth keeping in mind that there were thousands of doctors who saw Medicaid patients prior to the Affordable Care Act's pay bump. These are people who, even before they got a big raise, thought it made sense to see these patients at lower rates. That gives decent reason to think that these doctors will stick around after the pay increase disappears, too.",
    " Title: Homeland Security Secretary Kelly Announces Immigration Enforcement Changes Per Trump's Orders\n\nArticle:\n\nHomeland Security Secretary John Kelly has initiated a series of immigration enforcement changes in accordance with President Trump's executive actions from January. The changes aim to strengthen enforcement by expanding the categories of illegal immigrants targeted for deportation.\n\nIn a memo released Tuesday, Secretary Kelly stated, \"It is in the national interest of the United States to prevent criminals and criminal organizations from destabilizing border security.\" The memos prioritize criminal illegal immigrants and others for deportation, including those convicted or charged with \"any criminal offense,\" or who have \"abused\" any public welfare program.\n\nThe changes will not affect the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, also known as \"dreamers.\" However, DHS will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.\n\nThe memos also call for expanding the 287(g) program, which allows participating local officers to act as immigration agents, and ending \"catch-and-release\" policies under which illegal immigrants subject to deportation potentially are allowed to \"abscond\" and fail to appear at removal hearings.\n\nThe memos also outline the planning, design, and construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall. While congressional Republicans have vowed to fund the front-end costs associated with the wall, the memos hint at future efforts to potentially use money otherwise meant for Mexico.\n\nIt's unclear what timelines the secretary is setting for these objectives, and what budgetary and other constraints the department and its agencies will face. In pursuing an end to \"catch-and-release,\" one memo calls for a plan with the Justice Department to \"surge\" immigration judges and asylum officers to handle additional cases.\n\nThe DHS directives come as the Trump White House continues to work on rewriting its controversial executive order suspending the U.S. refugee program as well as travel from seven mostly Muslim countries. The order was put on hold by a federal court, and Trump's team is said to be working on a new measure.\n\nThe directives also come as the Trump administration faces criticism from Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocacy groups for recent ICE raids of illegal immigrants. DHS officials on Tuesday's conference call stressed that they are operating under existing law and denied an apparently erroneous news report from last week claiming National Guard troops could be utilized to round up illegal immigrants. That will not happen, an official said.\n\n\"We're going to treat everyone humanely and with dignity, but we are going to execute the laws of the United States,\" a DHS official said on the conference call.",
    " Title: FEMA Terminates Contract with Tribute Contracting LLC for Underdelivered Meals in Puerto Rico\n\nArticle:\n\nA New York Times investigation has revealed that Tiffany Brown, an Atlanta entrepreneur and self-described government contractor who owns Tribute Contracting LLC, drastically underdelivered on a $156 million contract awarded by FEMA to provide 30 million self-heating meals to Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.\n\nBrown, the sole employee of her company, only followed through on 50,000 meals, according to the Times. In an attempt to fulfill the contract, Brown hired an 11-person wedding catering company and a Texas nonprofit that had shipped food to a Houston food bank during Hurricane Harvey.\n\nThe contract was terminated by email on Oct. 19, after Brown failed to meet a deadline of providing the first 18.5 million meals. Carolyn Ward, a FEMA official who handled the contract with Brown's company, wrote in an email to Brown, seen by the Times, that the operation was \"a logistical nightmare.\"\n\n\"Do not ship another meal. Your contract is terminated,\" Ward wrote.\n\nA FEMA spokesman told the Times that other suppliers provided \"ample\" food and water for Puerto Ricans, and that Tribute's contract did not result in any missed meals.\n\nThis is at least the sixth government contract awarded to Tribute that has been canceled, according to the Times. Brown's company has been awarded dozens of contracts, but has failed to deliver on several, including four that required her to deliver food products to correctional facilities in the Federal Prison System.\n\nAt the time the FEMA contract was awarded, the Government Publishing Office had a ban on awarding contracts of more than $35,000 to Tribute until January 2019 due to a mishandled project.\n\nBrown is now fighting the FEMA contract termination and seeking a $70 million settlement. Her appeal argues that FEMA canceled her contract because the meals Tribute provided were packaged separately from their heating pouches, and claims that FEMA did not say the meals had to be self-heating.\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is investigating the Tribute contract. Committee Democrats criticized FEMA in a letter to committee chairman Trey Gowdy, stating that FEMA should have considered Tribute's history and lack of large-scale disaster relief experience before awarding the contract.\n\n\"Clearly, Tribute did not have sufficient financial resources of its own to support this contract,\" they wrote, according to the Times. \"FEMA should have raised serious questions about whether the company could meet the contract terms\u2014especially since the contract concerned such a critical need.\"\n\nIn the letter, Democrats highlighted the Tribute contract as the latest example of how FEMA was unprepared to handle the hurricane aftermath in Puerto Rico by not preparing contractors in advance.\n\n\"It appears that the Trump administration's response to the hurricanes in Puerto Rico in 2017 suffered from the same flaws as the Bush Administration's response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005,\" they wrote.",
    " Title: FBI Indictments Confirm Russian Interference in 2016 U.S. Elections, Says National Security Adviser\n\nArticle:\n\nThe national security adviser to President Donald Trump, H.R. McMaster, stated during the Munich Security Conference in Germany that the recently unveiled FBI indictments provide incontrovertible evidence of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. The indictment, led by special counsel Robert Mueller, alleges a sophisticated plot by 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies to wage \"information warfare\" against the U.S.\n\nThe indictment accuses the Russian nationals of setting a strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 presidential election. Tech giant executives, including those from Facebook and Twitter, testified recently on Capitol Hill that Russia indeed used social media to disrupt the 2016 White House race and sow discord among voters.\n\nThe indictment is the first filed against Russian nationals as part of Mueller's probe into whether Trump associates colluded with Russian officials during the 2016 elections. However, the Justice Department made clear that the indictment does not allege that any of the interference changed the outcome of the presidential race.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel probe, stated at a Friday press conference that \"there is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\"\n\nRussia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, dismissed the indictment, calling it \"just blabber.\" When asked about the indictments, Lavrov replied, \"I have no response. You can publish anything, and we see those indictments multiplying.\" He argued that U.S. officials also have said no country influenced the U.S. election results.\n\nThe 37-page indictment, signed by Mueller, details actions dating back to 2014. The defendants are accused of spreading derogatory information about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, denigrating Republican candidates Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and ultimately supporting Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders and then-Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nPresident Trump asserted on Friday that the indictment proved there was \"no collusion\" between his campaign and the Russians. \"Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President,\" Trump tweeted after the indictment was unveiled. \"The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong \u2014 no collusion.\"\n\nThe three entities charged in the indictment are Internet Research Agency LLC, Concord Management and Consulting LLC, and Concord Catering. The 13 Russians charged are Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin, Mikhail Ivanovich Bystrov, Mikhail Leonidovich Burchik, Aleksandra Yuryevna Krylova, Anna Vladislavovna Bogacheva, Sergey Pavlovich Polozov, Maria Anatolyrvna Bovda, Robert Sergetevich Bovda, Dzheykhun Nasimi Ogly, Vadim Vladimirovich Podkopaev, Gleb Igorevich Vasilchenko, Irina Viktorovna Kaverzina, and Vladimir Venkov.",
    " Title: Romney's Remarks on Obama Supporters Spark Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a video released on Monday, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney made comments about President Barack Obama's supporters that have sparked controversy. The video, posted on the website of Mother Jones, shows Romney speaking at a private fundraiser earlier this year.\n\nIn the video, Romney described many supporters of President Obama as dependent on government and unwilling to take responsibility for their own lives. He stated, \"There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president, no matter what... These are people who pay no income tax.\"\n\nRomney also said, \"I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\"\n\nDuring a hastily scheduled news conference in Costa Mesa on Monday night, Romney did not back away from his remarks. He said, \"It's not elegantly stated, let me put it that way. I'm speaking off the cuff in response to a question.\"\n\nThe comments could be read as unflattering to Obama supporters broadly and to millions of people who hold jobs and pay payroll taxes, but do not earn enough to pay the income tax. Some of these people receive tax benefits, such as credits for children, which wipe out their tax burdens.\n\nRomney's comments echoed ideas he has laid out elsewhere as central to his candidacy: that the federal government spends too much money and has unmoored the country from the principles of free enterprise and hard work.\n\nThe incident was reminiscent of Obama's remarks this summer, which were interpreted by Republicans as a disparagement of entrepreneurialism. Democrats said the president meant only that government spending on infrastructure and other programs is important to business owners.\n\nIn other contexts, the candidates have said these competing ideas go to the heart of the election, with Obama arguing for a government role in the economy and Romney saying government is too intrusive.\n\nIn 2008, Obama was also accused of offering a broad and unflattering characterization of voters during a fundraiser when he said people in small towns with high unemployment \"cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who are not like them.\"\n\nObama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, said it was \"shocking\" that Romney would say that \"half of the American people view themselves as 'victims' entitled to handouts... It's hard to serve as president for all Americans when you've disdainfully written off half the nation.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, the Romney campaign had pledged more policy specifics and rolled out a set of new TV ads, marking an effort by Romney to regain his footing amid signs that Obama is building a lead in national opinion polls and most battleground states.\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans have said Romney should lay out more policy specifics, such as which tax breaks he would scrap in order to pay for a 20% cut to tax rates he has proposed for all income brackets.\n\n\"We do think the timing is right, at this moment, to reinforce the specifics\u2014more specifics\u2014about the Romney plan,\" Romney adviser Ed Gillespie said.\n\nRomney did not offer new policy specifics in a speech Monday to small-business owners at the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. He said he would overhaul the legal immigration system. His comments dovetail with House Republicans' effort to pass legislation that would increase the number of visas for workers in fields like engineering and science. A vote is expected this week.",
    " Title: Contact Tracing: A Growing Presence in the U.S. Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the United States, a new development has emerged: the deployment of contact tracers to identify and monitor individuals who have tested positive for the virus. This tactic, which has proven useful in other countries, is intended to focus on actual vectors of infection rather than entire populations. However, the prospect of an army of government officials questioning citizens has raised concerns about privacy and potential abuse.\n\nThe National Association of County and City Health Officials estimates that at least 100,000 contact tracers will be needed to control the virus as communities reopen. New York state, ground zero for America's pandemic crisis, plans to put between 6,400 and 17,000 contact tracers in place. New York City's \"Test and Trace Corps\" will launch with 1,000 contact tracers, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nJohns Hopkins University, a leading institution in the field, offers a free, online, certificate-granting course in contact tracing through Coursera. The course covers not only the biology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the process of gathering information, but also ethical considerations, including privacy. However, it is state, city, and local government agencies, not Johns Hopkins University, that are managing the deployment of the contact tracers they train.\n\nIn the state of Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee's reopening plan, including an initial 1,371 contact tracers, has raised questions about privacy rights. The state requires restaurants to create a daily log of all customers and maintain that log for 30 days, including telephone/email contact information and time in. This has sparked concerns about the collection and storage of personal information.\n\nIn California, Robert Levin, the director of Ventura County Public Health, had to apologize after a contact tracing program announcement in which he gave the impression that individuals isolated would be taken out of their homes and placed in hotels or motels. This type of statement has contributed to public reluctance to share details of their shopping trips and social interactions with government-employed strangers.\n\nCooperation with contact tracers is voluntary, and refusal to share information with contact tracers is a patient's right. Across the country, public officials are urging cooperation, but enforcement would be challenging, as people can lie to government officials they do not trust. Bioethicist Jacob Appel notes that countries with authoritarian governments or high levels of social cohesion have successfully used contact tracing, but the U.S. does not possess either.\n\nThe success of contact tracing depends on winning the public's trust and cooperation. Public officials must demonstrate that they are deploying an army of helpful contact tracers and not intrusive \"cootie cops.\" If they can convince the public of the wisdom of their tactics and the innocence of their intentions, perhaps we can work together to resolve our health concerns.",
    " Title: Federal Reserve Lowers Economic Outlook, Hints at Delay in Interest Rate Hike\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Reserve lowered its economic outlook on Wednesday following a harsh winter that slowed the U.S. economy's growth, reducing the likelihood of an initial interest rate hike at the Fed's June meeting. In a statement following a two-day meeting, the Fed did not provide a clear signal of when it plans to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2006, but policymakers have indicated they expect to act this year.\n\nAs of 2:55 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 55 points, or 0.3%, to 18,056, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 5 points, or 0.3%, to 2110. The Nasdaq composite was down 17 points, or 0.3%, to 5038. Yields on 10-year government bonds rose above 2%.\n\nThe Fed stated that economic growth \"slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting transitory factors.\" Unusually cold weather, for example, hindered economic activity. The Fed expects the economy to rebound and grow at a moderate pace in coming months.\n\nWhile a June rate increase \"does not look very likely,\" it \"remains an option if the data suddenly turn much stronger than expected,\" according to Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist of High Frequency Economics. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics stated, \"it would take something quite spectacular to convince Fed officials to raise rates in June.\"\n\nThe Fed's statement noted that job growth \"moderated\" and household spending declined in recent weeks, though inflation-adjusted incomes \"rose strongly, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices.\" Business investment, however, \"softened\" and exports declined, the statement said. The Fed added that inflation continued to run below the Fed's target, \"partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports.\" Fed policymakers expect inflation \"to rise gradually toward 2% over the medium-term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects\" of low energy and import prices dissipate.\n\nA strong dollar has hurt manufacturers' exports, and the plunge in oil prices has led energy companies to slash investment. The government reported that the economy grew just 0.2% at an annual rate in the first quarter, down from 2.2% in the October-December period and below the modest 1% pace expected by economists. Meanwhile, inflation remains well below the Fed's annual 2% target, with the Fed's preferred measure, which excludes food and energy costs, rising 0.9% last quarter, the smallest increase since 2010. Employers added just 126,000 jobs in March, compared to average monthly gains of 269,000 in the prior 12 months.\n\nThe Fed reiterated that it will raise its federal funds rate \"when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back\" to the Fed's 2% target \"over the medium-term.\" The central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate near zero since the 2008 financial crisis, but with the economic recovery now almost six years old, the central bank has been preparing financial markets and consumers for a return to normal interest rate policy. Last month, the Fed dropped a pledge to be patient as it considers boosting the rate, signaling that it could make the move as early as June.\n\nMany economists say the Fed is unlikely to act until September at the earliest so it can assess whether the economy is regaining the momentum it had built last year. That timetable is consistent with Fed policymakers' median forecast in March as well as with recent speeches by Fed policymakers, including Fed Chair Janet Yellen.",
    " Title: Investigations Allege Abuse of Power and Misuse of State Department Resources by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has found himself at the center of a series of allegations involving potential abuse of power, disregard for accepted procedures, and misuse of state resources. The allegations, which have been reported by various news organizations, have cast a spotlight on Pompeo's actions during his tenure as Secretary of State.\n\nThe investigations allege a pattern of behavior that is familiar in the Trump administration. These allegations include possible abuse of power for personal gain, disdain and circumvention of accepted procedures, and a propensity to treat a government position as a personal fiefdom with little regard for both taxpayer money and common decency.\n\nOne of the most prominent allegations concerns luxurious dinners hosted by Pompeo and his wife Susan at the State Department's Diplomatic Reception Rooms. The dinners, which were paid for by taxpayers, were attended by a guest list that was more composed of Republican donors and activists than foreign diplomats and policy experts. According to NBC News, approximately 39% of the nearly 500 invitees were from Fox News.\n\nThe allegations took a more serious turn when it was revealed that President Donald Trump had announced his intention to fire the State Department's Inspector General, Steve Linick. Inspectors general are Senate-confirmed government officials charged with auditing and investigating potential instances of fraud and abuse in the government.\n\nPompeo acknowledged that he had asked Trump to fire Linick, but offered little explanation for the reason other than it should have happened sooner. He called claims that the firing was retribution for probes into his activities \"patently false.\"\n\nShortly after the announcement, Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, revealed that Linick was investigating Pompeo. Engel, along with Sen. Bob Menendez, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, opened a probe into the ouster, decrying \"the politically-motivated firing of inspectors general and the President's gutting of these critical positions.\"\n\nLater, NBC reported that Linick was investigating Pompeo's use of a State Department political appointee to conduct personal errands, such as walking his dog and picking up his laundry.\n\nWithin hours, the allegations grew more disturbing. Engel told CNN of another possible reason for Linick's firing. The inspector general was investigating the declaration of an \"emergency\" that Pompeo had cited one year ago as reason for bypassing the requirement that Congress approve an $8 billion sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia.\n\nEngel, who called the declaration \"phony,\" said Linick was conducting an investigation of it at his office's request. The New York Times reported that Pompeo had already answered written questions into that probe.\n\nThe NBC investigation identified the dog-walking staffer, whose name appeared in the emails NBC reviewed in connection with the so-called Madison Dinners. The staffer was the principal liaison between Pompeo's office and the protocol office that organized the dinners. \"Two administration officials told NBC News that Linick made some type of inquiry to the protocol office last week, before he was fired,\" NBC reported. \"One of the officials said Pompeo's office was then notified. \" Whether Linick was also investigating Pompeo's dinners remains unclear.\n\nThe details of the Madison Dinners, with their own logo embossed on State Department invitations, brought hundreds of people to the center of US diplomacy more than 20 times since Pompeo became Secretary of State. The majority of the guests came from the corporate world and conservative media and entertainment, along with Republican - only Republican - members of Congress. Among those wined and dined were Fox News' Laura Ingraham, Marjorie Dannenfelser, head of a prominent anti-abortion lobbying group, Bill Miller, head of a leading casino lobbying group, former Major League Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, Chick-fil-A Chairman Dan Cathy, a leading conservative donor, and others, in a detailed mailing list reviewed by NBC.\n\nSources told NBC that the State Department collected information about each guest, and that information was all forwarded to the private Gmail account of Susan Pompeo, the Secretary of State's wife. Whatever reason she had for receiving the data, it amounts to a treasure trove, should the Secretary of State decide to run for a Kansas Senate seat - or for President. If that is the purpose of the dinners and the emailing, it is a violation of the Hatch Act, which bans most federal employees from using their position for partisan political activities.",
    " Title: Pro-Democracy Movement Sweeps Hong Kong District Council Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nHong Kong's opposition pro-democracy movement has made unprecedented gains in the Chinese territory's district council elections, according to local media counts. Preliminary results indicate that 17 out of the 18 councils are now controlled by pro-democracy councillors. Despite fears the vote could be disrupted or cancelled due to the ongoing unrest, it proceeded peacefully.\n\nThe election was seen as a test of support for the government after months of protests and clashes. The government and Beijing had hoped the election would bring a show of support from the so-called \"silent majority,\" but this did not materialize. Instead, some significant pro-Beijing candidates lost their council seats.\n\nOne controversial pro-Beijing lawmaker, Junius Ho, who lost his seat, said, \"Heaven and earth have been turned upside down.\" Hong Kong's district councillors have limited political power and mainly deal with local issues such as bus routes and rubbish collection, so the district elections do not normally generate such interest.\n\nHowever, these polls were the first time people could express their opinion on embattled Chief Executive Carrie Lam's handling of the crisis, which was sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition law. Additionally, 117 of the district councillors will also sit on the 1,200-member committee that votes for the chief executive, so a pro-democracy district win could translate to a bigger share in choosing the city's next leader.\n\nA record 4.1 million people had registered to vote\u2014more than half the population\u2014and more than 2.9 million people cast votes. That's a turnout of more than 71%, against 47% in 2015. The weekend was also the first in months without any clashes between protesters and police.\n\nOver the past months, demonstrations and unrest had been gradually escalating. Police have at times used live rounds, wounding several protesters. Activists in turn have attacked police or in one case set alight a government supporter. It was unclear how much of the general population still supported the protesters, and authorities had been hoping the election would identify the protesters as a small group of fringe extremists.\n\nHowever, in many districts, young first-time candidates, many who had explicitly aligned themselves with the protesters, unseated established politicians backing the government. The hope from activists is that the overwhelming victory of anti-establishment parties will force the government to take protesters' demands more seriously.\n\nOutside the Yau Ma Tei North polling station, local residents lined up to gain entry so they could watch the vote count. The doors opened, and they poured into the public viewing area. Six months into an ongoing political crisis, people have lost faith in government institutions. They wanted to make sure that this process was fair and transparent.\n\nAs they waited for the total in their own district council to be tallied, they could see the numbers coming in from elsewhere on their mobile phones. By their facial expressions, it was clear they could not believe what was unfolding, and people cheered in astonishment as one surprising result came in after another. Nobody imagined such a comprehensive wipeout, and Carrie Lam's administration will no doubt come under renewed pressure to listen to the demands of protesters following such an overwhelming defeat for her and her allies.\n\nMore than 1,000 candidates ran for 452 district council seats, which, for the first time, were all contested. A further 27 district seats are allocated to representatives of rural districts. Pro-Beijing parties held the majority of these seats ahead of the election. In one of the biggest losses for the pro-Beijing camp, lawmaker Junius Ho\u2014one of Hong Kong's most controversial politicians\u2014suffered a shock defeat.\n\nJimmy Sham, a political activist who has recently risen to prominence as the leader of the Civil Human Rights Front\u2014a campaign group responsible for organizing some of the mass protest marches\u2014won a seat after running for the first time. Mr. Sham has also been attacked twice, once apparently with hammers. Photographs at the time showed him lying on the street covered in blood.\n\nAfter the vote, Mr. Sham said, \"We have to be leaders of the community that listens to people's voices and opinions.\" Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was barred from running in the elections, a move he referred to as \"political screening,\" but the pro-democracy candidate who replaced him has won.\n\nIn a tweet, Mr. Wong said the \"historic\" results showed that public opinion had not turned against the pro-democracy movement. Reflecting on her reported defeat, pro-Beijing lawmaker Alice Mak suggested Ms. Lam's administration was partly to blame. \"In the election campaign, pro-government candidates have been unfairly treated.

While the booming economy is expected to be a core pillar of the GOP's midterm messaging, it remains unclear whether the party will receive credit for the tax law, which has lagged in polls.\n\nIn response, GOP leaders on both sides of the Capitol are emphasizing a breadth of legislative achievements as they seek to convince voters to keep them in charge and not deliver majorities to Democrats. To bolster their case, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) point to a flurry of wide-ranging bills sent to President Donald Trump's desk last month.\n\nIn an interview with a media outlet late last month, McConnell highlighted last year's $1.5 trillion tax-cut package, but also pointed to increased spending for the military, 15 repealed regulations, and the confirmation of a conservative Supreme Court justice and 21 conservative circuit court judges. Ryan and his top lieutenants have made a similar pitch.\n\n\"We're doing more things this week to continue to establish our priorities,\" Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) told reporters Wednesday. \"It's not just lowering taxes for families, but it's taking care of our military and taking care of our veterans.\"\n\nIn another move meant to paint the portrait of Republicans hard at work, McConnell announced Tuesday he would cancel most of the August recess so that senators could work through spending bills and Trump's nominations before a Sept. 30 funding deadline. The decision has the added benefit of keeping dozens of Democratic senators off the campaign trail in August.\n\n\"We think we have a good chance of passing a number of appropriations bills,\" McConnell told reporters during his weekly news conference on Tuesday. \"In order to do that, and deal with this nominations backlog, we need to be here in August.\"\n\nIt remains unclear whether the GOP's messaging strategy will work, especially when accomplishments on Capitol Hill can be easily overshadowed by more dramatic developments coming out of the White House. The same week that Congress sent a trio of bills to Trump's desk, for example, the president dominated the news cycle by canceling a planned historic summit with North Korea.\n\nThe GOP Congress also has come up short on some of Trump's chief priorities, disappointing the president and his most fervent supporters. Despite majorities in both chambers and control of the White House, Republicans failed to repeal and replace ObamaCare or fund Trump's signature border wall. Trump has bashed Congress over the failure on the wall in particular, to the chagrin of Republicans, who think it shortchanges the accomplishments that have been secured.\n\n\"I'd like the president to talk about it more often and I believe he will going into the fall campaign,\" McConnell said of the GOP's successes. The effort to push a more aggressive Republican agenda could please some conservatives, who have said tax reform alone is not enough to run on in the midterms.\n\n\"You can't just rest on your laurels,\" Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, told a media outlet on Wednesday. \"You've got to keep fulfilling your promises to the American people.\"\n\nWhile the tax law's poll numbers have improved, GOP strategists point out that some voters may not see the benefits until next year. There are also concerns that the economic gains from the tax law could be wiped out after Trump slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports worldwide, including from the European Union, Canada, and Mexico. Trump has threatened to follow up with additional tariffs on foreign cars and has also talked about imposing new tariffs on imports from China.\n\nIt can be difficult to accomplish major policy items in election years, with less time on the legislative calendar and vulnerable members reluctant to take any tough votes. But in recent months, Congress has seen an uptick in activity, with Trump signing legislation to ease financial regulations, improve how veterans access health care, and allow terminally ill patients to try experimental drugs. The House, which also passed a bipartisan prison reform bill last month, plans to take up legislation next week to combat the nation's deadly opioid crisis\u2014an issue that resonates strongly in many communities around the country.\n\nCongressional leaders want to avoid passing another short-term funding patch this year and are hoping to move spending legislation through both chambers before the end of September. Since it is the last train leaving the station, lawmakers will surely push to attach a number of priorities to the legislation. But if there are poison pill amendments\u2014or if Trump refuses to sign any spending measure that doesn't contain money for his border wall\u2014it could bring Congress to the brink of another shutdown just weeks before the midterms. That could chip away at the GOP's argument that they are effective legislators.\n\n\"It could be a real mess if it leads to a shutdown,\" said Matt Mackowiak, a GOP strategist and opinion contributor for a media outlet. \"So there's still some political risk out there for Republicans.\"",
    " Title: President Obama to Announce 19 Separate Steps on Gun Control Without Congressional Action\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama is reportedly considering 19 separate steps on gun control that he can implement without congressional approval. These measures come as more ambitious proposals, such as a ban on military-style \"assault weapons,\" face resistance in Congress from various lawmakers and gun-rights groups.\n\nThe potential steps include stricter measures on gun trafficking, increased federal agency research on gun control, and providing schools with flexibility to use grants to enhance safety. According to the Associated Press, President Obama will reveal his proposals this week, with a mix of measures requiring congressional approval and steps he can implement independently.\n\nThe President has pledged to take significant action on gun violence following the shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, last month. Vice President Joe Biden, who is leading a task force on the issue, met with Democratic lawmakers on Monday and discussed some of the measures President Obama might consider.\n\nDuring the meeting, Vice President Biden did not specify which proposals the President would take up or present to the public this week. A ban on military-style \"assault weapons\" is one measure that is expected to encounter strong opposition in Congress. Figures such as National Rifle Association President David Keene and U.S. Senator John McCain (Arizona Republican) have predicted that such a measure would not pass through Congress.\n\nIn addition to the ban on \"assault weapons,\" Congress may also consider limiting high-capacity ammunition clips and implementing universal background checks for gun buyers. President Obama acknowledged on Monday the challenges of passing some of these items.\n\n\"Will all of them get through this Congress? I don't know,\" President Obama said. \"My starting point is not to worry about the politics. My starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works.\"",
    " Title: Justice Department Declines Appeal, McCabe Faces Possible Indictment for Alleged Lying to Internal Investigators\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, a frequent target of President Donald Trump's criticism, faces the prospect of an indictment after his attorneys were unsuccessful in persuading senior Justice Department officials not to pursue charges that he lied to internal investigators. Two anonymous sources familiar with the matter revealed on Thursday that the deputy attorney general declined an appeal from McCabe's lawyers aimed at preventing a prosecution.\n\nThe specifics of when or if the United States Attorney's Office in Washington, which has been leading the investigation, might announce charges remain unclear. McCabe's attorneys argue that he should not face charges on accusations that he lied to internal investigators about whether he had authorized a news media leak in the fall of 2016. McCabe has denied intentionally misleading anyone.\n\nAn indictment of McCabe would refocus public attention on the chaotic months of 2016 when the FBI was entangled in presidential politics through investigations touching both main contenders\u2014Democrat Hillary Clinton and Trump, her Republican opponent. While prosecutors are likely to try to keep a narrow focus on whether McCabe lied to investigators on particular dates, McCabe's attorneys are expected to argue that the prosecution is part of a political vendetta driven by the president.\n\nThey are likely to highlight the personal enmity between the two men, with Trump criticizing McCabe even before he took office and McCabe describing the president as a \"deliberate liar.\" McCabe's lawyers have said any false statements made to investigators were the product of a faulty memory, and that the interviews took place during a tumultuous time for the bureau as it investigated potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nMcCabe became acting director of the FBI after Trump fired former Director James Comey on May 9, 2017. McCabe has said his 2018 firing\u2014for what the Justice Department called \"lack of candor\"\u2014was politically motivated. He sued the Justice Department in August, saying officials had used the inspector general's conclusions as a pretext to rid the FBI of leaders Trump perceived as biased against him.\n\nThe investigation followed an October 2016 story in The Wall Street Journal that described internal debates roiling the FBI and the Department of Justice weeks before the presidential election about how aggressively the Clinton Foundation should be investigated. The article recounted a particularly tense phone call between McCabe and a senior Justice Department official about the investigation.\n\nThe inspector general's report said McCabe told internal investigators that he had not authorized anyone at the FBI to speak with the reporter, and he did not know who did. The report said McCabe ultimately corrected that account, and confirmed that he had encouraged the conversation with the reporter to counter a narrative that he thought was false\u2014namely, that he had been trying to stymie investigations into Clinton and the foundation.",
    " Title: Trump Secures Third Consecutive Victory in Nevada Republican Caucuses\n\nArticle:\n\nDonald Trump has won the Nevada Republican Presidential caucuses, marking his third consecutive victory in the primary race. With almost all votes counted, Trump received 45.9% of the vote, surpassing his two closest rivals, Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.\n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio finished second, narrowly edging out Texas Senator Ted Cruz. This result is unlikely to significantly boost the momentum of either candidate, ensuring both remain in the race.\n\nThe upcoming Super Tuesday contests, taking place in a dozen states next week, including several states across the South, the GOP's traditional stronghold, are next on the schedule. An uncharacteristically subdued Cruz warned supporters that it would be \"the most important night of this campaign.\"\n\nAccording to exit polls in Nevada, Trump carried evangelical Christians over Cruz, the core of the Texas senator's base. He also won among Hispanics, edging out his two Latino rivals. Trump won across every ideological group, every education group, every racial group, and both genders. He also won among both Republicans and independents.\n\nThe common theme among Trump's supporters is a shared concern and dissatisfaction with the state of the nation. Nearly 94% of caucusgoers expressed a negative view of the government, with six in ten describing themselves as \"angry.\" An equal number said they wanted the next president to come from \"outside politics.\"\n\nAt his victory rally in a Las Vegas hotel, Trump highlighted his success with various demographic groups, stating, \"We won the evangelicals, we won with young, we won with old, we won with highly educated, we won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated. We're the smartest people; we're the most loyal people.\"\n\nLooking ahead to the primaries and caucuses, Trump predicted, \"It's going to be an amazing two months. We might not even need the two months, folks, to be honest.\"\n\nTrump has already won decisive victories in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, vanquishing governors, senators, and a GOP dynasty. He has expanded the Republican electorate, contributing to record turnouts. He has forged the broadest-based coalition of any of his opponents.\n\nThe upcoming primaries and caucuses on Tuesday will test Trump's coalition, with contests from Massachusetts and Vermont to Georgia and Texas. At that point, nearly a third of Republican convention delegates will have been chosen. Two weeks later, with March 15 primaries in Florida, Ohio, and elsewhere, nearly two-thirds will be chosen.\n\nThe results of these contests will provide insight into questions such as whether a single rival can defeat Trump in a head-to-head matchup and the likelihood of a contested convention for the first time in four decades.",
    " Title: Obama's Strategy: Portraying Romney as a Third Term for Bush\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming presidential debate in Denver, President Barack Obama is expected to accuse Mitt Romney of representing a third term for George W. Bush, referring to Romney's policies as a continuation of the financial crisis. This strategy is part of Obama's carefully crafted approach to position Romney as a proponent of Bush's hands-off approach to taxes, spending, and regulation, which Obama believes led to the economic crisis.\n\nThe tactic mirrors Obama's successful strategy in the 2008 election against John McCain, where he attempted to associate McCain with the recent Republican administration. While not as direct, Obama's approach aims to remind voters of the negative aspects of recent Republican governance, a strategy that has been effective in reminding voters of the past Republican administration.\n\nAccording to a CNN poll last month, 62 percent of self-described moderates blame Bush and the Republicans for the country's economic troubles, while only 30 percent fault Obama and the Democrats. By indicting both parties for America's fiscal problems, Romney could distance himself from Bush and gain credibility with voters tired of Washington's politics.\n\nMichael Tanner of the Cato Institute suggests that such a strategy, known as \"triangulation,\" would be beneficial for Romney. Tanner states, \"It would blunt Obama's attacks on Romney wanting to return to the Bush policy. And it would help rally those tea party folks who don't think much of Bush or the Republican establishment.\"\n\nAnti-tax crusader Grover Norquist also supports this strategy, stating, \"The speech writes itself.\" The effectiveness of this strategy remains to be seen, as the debate is yet to take place.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Legislators Propose $100 Million Tax Incentive Package for Kimberly-Clark\n\nArticle:\n\nA proposed plan to offer Kimberly-Clark Corporation a $100 million tax incentive package to maintain its operations in Wisconsin has sparked debate over the concept of economic development and the role of government in business.\n\nIn January, Kimberly-Clark announced plans to cut 13% of its global workforce, potentially affecting up to 5,500 jobs nationwide and closing ten of its 91 manufacturing facilities, including two in Neenah and Fox Crossing, Wisconsin, which support 600 jobs.\n\nThe proposal, which is currently stalled in the state senate, would offer Kimberly-Clark a 17% tax credit for existing jobs paying between $30,000 and $100,000 annually, and a 15% capital-investment credit. This package is worth $100 million, a significant amount compared to the current Wisconsin tax credit of 7%.\n\nThe proposal has been met with criticism, with some arguing that it represents a form of central planning and market distortion. The Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty (WILL) has expressed concern that such incentives could set a dangerous precedent, leading to an increased role for government in the economy.\n\nRepublicans, who often advocate for minimal government intervention in the economy, have been criticized for their support of such incentives. The argument is that, in an effort to appear \"pro-business,\" they are engaging in what some consider to be \"crony capitalism.\"\n\nDespite the state's strong economy, with unemployment below 3%, wages rising, and business optimism up, the proposal to offer Kimberly-Clark a $100 million tax incentive package has been met with criticism. Critics argue that the proposal will retard growth, as workers who stay at Kimberly-Clark are denied the opportunity to fill open jobs at Wisconsin businesses with better long-term prospects.\n\nThe debate over the proposal highlights the ongoing discussion about the role of government in economic development and the potential consequences of using tax incentives to attract or retain businesses.",
    " Title: Second Presidential Debate at Washington University: Trump and Clinton Clash in Town-Hall Style Event\n\nArticle:\n\nThe second presidential debate, held at Washington University in St. Louis, saw a heated exchange between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump. The debate, moderated by Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz, was marked by accusations, counter-attacks, and a focus on controversial issues.\n\nThe debate came on the heels of a damaging tape revealing Trump boasting about his sexual advances towards women without their consent. Clinton declined to shake hands with Trump during their initial encounter at the debate venue. Throughout the debate, Clinton accused Trump of being unfit for the presidency and of lying, while Trump suggested that if elected, Clinton would face legal consequences.\n\nTrump, however, managed to regain some ground by putting Clinton on the defensive and reminding voters of issues they may not like about her. He cited Clinton's destruction of subpoenaed emails, her handling of the Benghazi incident, her stance on Syrian refugees, her wavering support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and her private versus public positions on various issues.\n\nOne of the most contentious moments of the debate was when Trump defended himself against allegations of misogyny, citing the women who had accused Clinton's husband, Bill, of sexual assault or rape. Trump had invited four of these women to a press conference before the debate.\n\nTrump also attacked Clinton for her role in the Democratic National Committee's alleged dirty tricks campaign against Bernie Sanders, her comments about \"deplorables,\" and her lack of action in creating jobs during her time as a senator for New York.\n\nIn the foreign policy segment of the debate, both candidates were asked about their plans for dealing with the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo. Trump's response was criticized for lacking specific solutions, while Clinton emphasized her experience in fighting terror and her commitment to children and families.\n\nBoth candidates were also asked about their Supreme Court nomination policies. Clinton expressed a desire to appoint justices who would support Roe v. Wade and marriage equality, and would work to overturn Citizens United and get dark money out of politics. Trump, on the other hand, stated that he would appoint justices who would defend the Constitution and uphold the Second Amendment.\n\nThe debate did not result in either candidate appearing noble or appealing, but Trump managed to regain some momentum after a difficult few days. The election, it seems, may come down to voters deciding whom they would rather have a beer with.",
    " Title: Iowa's Des Moines Register Endorses Clinton and Rubio Ahead of Presidential Caucuses\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Des Moines Register, the most prominent daily newspaper in Iowa, has endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Marco Rubio in the upcoming presidential caucuses, scheduled for February 1. In dual editorials, the paper praised Clinton's \"depth\" of \"knowledge and experience\" and Rubio's potential to \"chart a new direction\" for the GOP.\n\nThe Des Moines Register's editorial board acknowledged that Clinton is not a \"perfect candidate,\" citing her email controversy and changing stances on gay marriage and immigration. However, the board argued that Clinton is more qualified than both Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley. Regarding Rubio, the board argued that he still faces questions over his experience and ability to unite the party but could offer \"an uplifting message\" of a new American century.\n\nBoth campaigns quickly distributed the respective editorials to their supporters. However, strategists and observers have raised questions about the impact of the paper's endorsement, with some suggesting it could be counterproductive. The Register has been endorsing candidates ahead of Iowa's presidential caucuses since 1988, but this cycle's endorsements came amid an upside-down political atmosphere in which once-vaunted traditions have become unwelcome reminders of insiderdom.\n\nThe two Republican candidates most likely to win the caucuses, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, did not even bother to court the paper's endorsement. It is unclear whether they would have wanted it anyway. Republican strategists and political observers predicted that unlike in previous years, a Register endorsement would be an instant talking point for rivals, proof that the winners are aligned with a mainstream media outlet's moderate-to-liberal lean.\n\nThe biggest benefit from an endorsement would likely occur outside of Iowa, argued one veteran Iowa Republican strategist. For Rubio, who is seeking to run as an establishment-oriented alternative to Trump or Cruz, the endorsement could signal to voters in New Hampshire and more moderate enclaves that establishment Republicans are coalescing behind him. The endorsement enables him to say \"I\u2019m the establishment pick,\" and yeah, that\u2019s going to be really valuable,\" the strategist said.\n\nThe Democratic endorsement may be more influential since the paper's left-leaning editorial board tends to connect better with Democrats. The Register, who had almost entirely turned over since Clinton's last campaign, would have been hard-pressed to ditch Clinton, whom it backed over then-Sen. Barack Obama in late 2007. The paper that year described her \"readiness\" to lead the country. \"We believe as president she'll do what she's always done in her life: Throw herself into the job and work hard,\" the board wrote. \"We believe Hillary Rodham Clinton can do great things for our country.\"\n\nClinton won the endorsement, Yepsen noted, even though the paper's editorial board has almost entirely turned over since her last campaign. The Register's Saturday endorsements were its 10th and 11th since it first backed Democrat Paul Simon in 1988. These days, candidates can afford to do battle with prominent outlets. In previous caucus years, endorsements were more meaningful because candidates did not have 24/7 exposure, and a trusted editorial board was an important liaison to voters. Today, they're only good for a positive news cycle or two.\n\n\"Endorsements are like fool's gold,\" Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary to President George W. Bush, said. \"You can spend them the day they come out to get good press, but they don't change voter behavior.\" In the meantime, he said, the recipients' rivals will be working to spin the endorsement as a negative, especially on the Republican side, \"with the dislike of all things establishment this cycle.\"\n\nKevin Madden, a spokesman for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, said it's a particularly difficult year for newspaper endorsements to make an impact. \"Editorial endorsements are more of a conventional barometer of support or progress in a totally unconventional year,\" he said. \"It's less about being blessed by the hands of the establishment and more about their diminished ability\u2014due to a much more fractured media landscape\u2014to drive earned media attention and shape voter attitudes.\"\n\nOver the years, The paper has had mediocre luck at picking winners, and former New York Times data expert Nate Silver noted in 2011 that there's little evidence candidates even received a statistical benefit from the endorsement. That year, the paper endorsed Romney, who lost the Republican caucuses narrowly to Rick Santorum but ultimately became the party's nominee. But few see the needle moving much, regardless of the Register's decisions. \"In general, I just think newspaper endorsements are kind of an antiquity,\" Yepsen said. \"What it\u2019s worth is a little media buzz. The media writes about itself and the race kind of moves on.\"",
    " Title: Puerto Rico Governor Calls for Cancellation of Whitefish Energy Contract for Power Grid Reconstruction\n\nArticle:\n\nPuerto Rico's Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 has recommended the cancellation of a contract awarded to the small Montana-based firm, Whitefish Energy, for the reconstruction of the island's power grid. The head of the US-controlled island's power authority, Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (Prepa), has accepted the governor's recommendation and intends to terminate the deal.\n\nThe contract, worth $300 million, was given to Whitefish Energy, a company with limited experience in projects of such scale, without a public bidding process. As of Sunday morning, more than 70% of Puerto Ricans were still without power, over five weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated the power grid.\n\nGovernor Rossell\u00f3 has instructed Prepa to cancel the Whitefish contract and coordinate with the states of Florida and New York to reinforce the grid rebuilding brigades currently working on the island. Concerns have been raised about why Puerto Rican authorities did not request \"mutual aid\" from other public power authorities, as is typical during disasters in the US.\n\nIn response to the news, Whitefish Energy expressed disappointment in the decision, stating that it would delay the restoration of power on the island. The company maintains that it secured the contract in a legitimate manner.\n\nThe White House and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) distanced themselves from the deal last week. The company's headquarters are in the town of Whitefish, the hometown of US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. Mr. Zinke has denied any involvement or wrongdoing.\n\nEarlier this week, Fema denied allegations by Prepa that it had reviewed the deal. The contract states that \"Prepa hereby represents and warrants that Fema has reviewed and approved of this Contract.\" In a statement on Thursday, Fema stated, \"Any language in any contract between Prepa and Whitefish that states Fema approved that contract is inaccurate.\"\n\nFema also expressed \"significant concerns\" with how Prepa procured the contract and had \"not confirmed whether the contract prices [were] reasonable.\" It is unclear what will happen to any outstanding costs.\n\nInitially, Puerto Rican authorities stated that Fema would pay for the deal. They later said there was \"nothing illegal\" about the contract. Prepa and the Puerto Rican government are burdened with massive debts, with the power authority declaring bankruptcy in July.\n\nThe US House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Caribbean island, is also scrutinizing the contract. On Friday, top Democrats from that panel and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee sent a letter asking the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general to launch an investigation. The correspondence follows similar requests from other members of Congress to the interior department's inspector general.\n\nWalt Green, a former director of the US National Center for Disaster Fraud, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 earlier this week that it was \"impossible\" to say at this stage who was responsible for costs. \"Any dispute may result in appeals, administrative hearings, and lawsuits,\" he added.",
    " Title: Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to Deliver Democratic Response to State of the Union Address\n\nArticle:\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer will deliver the Democratic response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday night. The 48-year-old former prosecutor, who made history as the first female leader of the Democratic caucus in the Michigan Senate, was elected governor in 2018 after defeating GOP nominee Bill Schuette.\n\nIn 2016, Michigan, a battleground state, helped secure Trump's election victory over Hillary Clinton. During the January primary debate, Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) referenced Whitmer as a female candidate who had proven her ability to win against male competitors in various races across the country.\n\nWhitmer's election campaign focused on expanding healthcare and addressing \"dinner-table issues,\" which she described as the core of the Democratic Party's strength. In an interview with the Associated Press after her State of the Union announcement, Whitmer stated that voters in her state are more concerned with \"fundamentals,\" such as fixing deteriorating roads and offering job training for better-paying positions, rather than Trump's tweets.\n\nUpon announcing Whitmer as the Democratic choice for the rebuttal, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) praised her, stating, \"Whether it's pledging to 'Fix the Damn Roads' or investing in climate solutions, Governor Whitmer's vision for the future is exactly what this country needs, and I'm thrilled she is giving the Democratic response.\"\n\nWhitmer will deliver her response immediately following Trump's State of the Union address, which is scheduled for 9 p.m. ET on February 4.",
    " Title: \"Judge Napolitano: The Patriot Act and the Threat to Fourth Amendment Rights\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an analysis piece, Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, Fox News' senior judicial analyst, discusses the dangers to personal liberty posed by the USA PATRIOT Act, particularly sections 505 and 215, which he argues are weapons of mass surveillance and violate the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe article traces the historical context of the Patriot Act, highlighting its enactment in 2001, following the September 11 attacks, and the lack of thorough debate in Congress. Napolitano points out that these sections of the Act permit federal agents to bypass the requirements of the Fourth Amendment and issue their own search warrants, as well as allow designated federal judges to issue general warrants based on the old writs of assistance standard of governmental need.\n\nSince 2001, federal agents have reportedly issued over 300,000 of these search warrants, known as National Security Letters, to various entities, including financial institutions, telecom providers, and local and state governments. Napolitano argues that this concept of one federal agent authorizing another to seize records is antithetical to the Fourth Amendment and repugnant to the American Revolution.\n\nThe article also discusses the expiration of section 215 on March 15 and the potential for structural changes to the Patriot Act by congressional liberals, libertarians, and some conservatives. Section 215, which allows judges to issue general warrants based on the writs of assistance standard, has been criticized for its potential to infringe on privacy rights, as demonstrated by the secret court-ordered seizure of Verizon customers' telephone records in 2013.\n\nJudge Napolitano concludes that both sections 215 and 505 are threats to freedom and should be repealed, as they defy the Constitution and presume that personal rights are not inherent but granted by the government, which can take them back. The article ends with a call to action, encouraging readers to learn more about Judge Napolitano's reports on the subject.",

The court filing states that the FBI located Mifsud in Washington D.C., but did not have enough information to detain him due to misleading information provided by George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign volunteer who pled guilty to lying about Mifsud during the initial FBI interview in January 2017.\n\nPapadopoulos is scheduled to be sentenced on September 7, and the court filing recommends a prison sentence of zero to six months. The special counsel noted that a similar case resulted in a 30-day sentence.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, while working at a think tank in London, Papadopoulos met with Mifsud, a professor who teaches in Malta and circulates among think tanks in Europe, including Russia. At that time, the public was unaware that Russia had hacked and stolen thousands of emails from the Democratic Party, which would later be released through WikiLeaks.\n\nDuring their meeting, Mifsud told Papadopoulos that the Kremlin possessed \"thousands\" of Clinton emails, but the exact meaning of this statement remains unclear. Papadopoulos later lied about the meeting's timing, stating it occurred in February before he joined the campaign, instead of the actual April date.\n\n\"Rather than acknowledging these contacts and communications, the defendant concealed them from the FBI. He lied about their timing, extent, and nature,\" Mueller said in the court filing. The lies, the filing states, impeded the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nPapadopoulos' self-appointed mission in London was to set up a meeting between then-candidate Trump and the Kremlin. He asked Mifsud for contacts and spoke to a Russian woman with ties to the Foreign Ministry, but no such meeting occurred. Papadopoulos has not been charged with any collusion.",

    " Title: Trump's Standoff with Democrats Over Border Wall Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has reiterated his commitment to securing funding for the U.S.-Mexico border wall, potentially leading to a partial government shutdown if a deal cannot be reached by December 21. The ongoing standoff between the President and the Democrats has been a recurring theme since the previous budget impasse in 2018, which resulted in a $1.3 trillion Omnibus spending bill that did not include funding for the border wall.\n\nIn March, President Trump vowed never to sign such a bill again and called for a line-item veto for all government spending bills. In July, he pledged to fix the country's immigration system, even if it requires a government shutdown.\n\nDuring the last budget impasse, President Trump offered a surprisingly generous deal to congressional Democrats, agreeing to grant legal status to nearly a million DACA recipients in exchange for border wall funding. However, the Democrats rejected the offer, despite the $5 billion requested for the wall accounting for less than 0.004 percent of the amount ultimately appropriated.\n\nWith a potential partial government shutdown looming, President Trump now has an opportunity to secure border wall funding, a priority he has pursued since the beginning of his presidency. Senate Democrats have stated they will not accept more than $1.6 billion for border security, and they are threatening to withhold funding from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) if the President does not capitulate.\n\nHowever, a partial shutdown would not affect most federal employees, as about two-thirds of the federal government is already funded through a budget deal reached earlier in the year. In the event of a DHS funding lapse, Border Patrol and ICE agents would still be required to report for work, although they would not receive paychecks until a funding deal could be reached. History shows that Congress has always appropriated back pay for employees affected by previous shutdowns.\n\nThe Democrats are portraying a potential shutdown as a national catastrophe, but this is largely fearmongering intended to manipulate the public and the press. President Trump, aware of the essential nature of a border wall to national security, is unlikely to give up on this priority due to political expediency.",
    " Title: Top Democrats Criticized for Statements Perceived as Criticizing America\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, found himself in a national controversy this week after stating that America \"was never that great.\" The remark, made during a bill signing, has sparked criticism from both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nCuomo's statement was followed by a series of tweets from President Trump, who called it a \"career-threatening statement\" and predicted that \"his political career is over.\" Cuomo has since walked back the statement, claiming it was \"inartful.\"\n\nThe remark is the latest in a series of bolder statements from Democrats calling out what they see as injustices or inequalities in America. The Republican National Committee (RNC) has seized on these statements, with the RNC stating in an email blast that \"the only thing that seems to unite prominent Democrats these days is their collective bashing of America.\"\n\nIn a similar vein, 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was criticized for her statement that half of Trump supporters could be put into \"a basket of deplorables.\" The remark was widely perceived to have hurt her campaign, and many Trump supporters now wear the \"deplorable\" tag as a badge of honor.\n\nOther possible 2020 candidates have also made statements that appear to take a swing at America or large numbers of people in it. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) described things as \"savagely wrong\" in America and claimed there is a \"normalcy of injustice.\" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) stated that America's economic inequality is \"fundamentally immoral.\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) described America's criminal justice system as racist \"front to back.\"\n\nThe RNC has used these statements to argue that Democrats are out of touch, and it would appear that there isn't much support from the public for such statements. A 2016 Washington Post poll found that only seven percent of those polled said that America has never been great.",
    " Title: Grassroots Effort in Des Moines Pushes for Elizabeth Warren's Presidential Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nA grassroots campaign encouraging Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren to run for the Democratic presidential nomination is gaining momentum in Des Moines, Iowa. The campaign's headquarters is located in a small office park, marked only by a yard sign on a door.\n\nOn a recent weekday afternoon, approximately 20 volunteers gathered to strategize on how to persuade their friends, neighbors, and, most importantly, Senator Warren, to join the race.\n\nGordon Rowe, a retiree, shared his experience when discussing Warren with others, stating, \"They don't know who Elizabeth Warren is. I tell them they need to get involved. They are middle class too, and they need representation.\"\n\nThe term \"middle class\" is frequently repeated among Warren supporters. They believe Warren understands, represents, and will help rebuild the middle class. The conviction that Warren is fighting for them on issues such as income inequality and regulating Wall Street is the driving force behind the effort to draft her into the race, despite her repeated dismissals of a potential run.\n\nBlair Lawton, Iowa Field Director for the Run Warren Run campaign, stated, \"We totally take Senator Warren at her word right now. We know that right now she's not running, and if she was, we wouldn't have a reason for a draft campaign like this. Really, me and my staff's goal every day is to show her that she has support all across the state and a path to victory.\"\n\nThe campaign's activities include holding meetings to teach volunteers grassroots political techniques, setting up phone banks to call Iowa Democrats, and having Run Warren Run representatives attend small Democratic meetings across the state.\n\nBeth Farvour, a Run Warren Run regional field director, attended a meeting in Tipton, addressing the 40 or so Cedar County Democrats to explain why she thinks Warren is the best candidate for the Democratic nomination. The campaign is being funded by MoveOn.org, which has pledged to spend $1 million on the effort, and Democracy for America, which has contributed an additional $250,000.\n\nIn Iowa, the campaign has eight staff members who travel the state promoting her candidacy. Run Warren Run also has staffers in New Hampshire.\n\nAt this time, Warren's supporters, almost to a person, decline to address the possibility that Warren may stand by her word and not run for the White House.\n\nKatie Freerksen, a veterinarian technician who started volunteering three months ago, expressed optimism, stating, \"I think we can get her in the race.\"\n\nToria Pinter, a law student on medical leave, was drawn to Warren because of the senator's vocal call to lower the interest rates on student loans. Pinter emphasized that the campaign is not an anti-Clinton effort but a pro-Warren movement.\n\n\"The campaign is not about Clinton,\" she said. \"That's not what we are here to talk about. We are here to talk about Warren and how important she is to us because she embodies the ideals and issues that are important to us at the end of the day.\"\n\nLawton stated that even if Warren decides not to run, he believes there are long-term benefits from this campaign, including \"putting a big investment into the progressive community.\"\n\n\"I am confident every day if we do our job we get her to enter this race,\" he said. \"But also, you know, other goals, as well, on top of getting her to run: I want to make sure every time a campaign comes in we are leaving the community in a better place. So really what we are doing right now, by getting volunteers involved and training them, we are really helping to build the progressive movement across the state of Iowa.\"",
    " Title: Obama Administration's Iran Nuclear Deal May Lack Written Agreement by March Deadline\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing negotiations between the Obama administration and Iran over the latter's nuclear weapons program may result in a handshake agreement rather than a written accord by the self-imposed March deadline. This development, according to Western diplomats involved in the talks, is due to Iran's increasing resistance to a formal \"framework\" agreement at this stage, preferring a more general \"understanding\" followed by a final accord in June.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest has consistently downplayed the significance of the March deadline, stating that what is anticipated at the end of March is a \"political agreement.\" This political agreement, according to Earnest, would include specific commitments from Iran regarding its nuclear program and the operation of its facilities, as well as commitments to agree to historically intrusive inspections.\n\nHowever, the technical experts would then need to discuss the implementation of these political agreements, with the Obama administration anticipating that these technical negotiations would be resolved by the end of June. This means that whatever the Obama administration announces in the coming days will not be a real, binding written agreement but rather a \"political\" document for domestic consumption in the United States.\n\nFurthermore, the Khamenei regime does not acknowledge the existence of the March deadline, according to a senior administration official who was in Lausanne for the talks last week. The Obama administration had initially hoped to agree on specific limits by the end of March that would define the parameters of a more detailed, comprehensive agreement to be completed by the end of June. However, Ayatollah Khamenei, who has taken his own negotiators by surprise several times, stated that there would be only one agreement, leaving the United States and its allies in an uncomfortable position.\n\nThe March deadline, it seems, is intended to provide President Obama with an opportunity to declare victory in \"ending\" Iran's nuclear program before any actual deal is made. This allows the liberal media to heap praise on Obama and accuse anyone questioning the deal of wanting war with Iran. By the time the actual agreement is signed in June, Obama's legacy will be far too tied up in its \"success\" for any Democrat, even Hillary Clinton, to oppose it.",
    " Title: GOP Shifts Focus from Policy to Politics as Immigration Reform Stalls\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican Party's political strategy for the upcoming midterm elections appears to be centered on a bet that the Affordable Care Act will negatively impact Democrats, as comprehensive immigration reform and other significant legislative initiatives have been put on hold until after the elections.\n\nAccording to conservative reporters, including The Washington Post's Robert Costa, bipartisan deals on immigration reform, tax reform, and adjustments to the federal health-care law are unlikely to progress in the current Congress. Representative Devin Nunes (Calif.) stated, \"We can do a few things on immigration and work on our principles, but in terms of real legislating, we\u2019re unable to get in a good negotiating position.\"\n\nFrank Luntz, a Republican pollster who works closely with party leaders, added, \"It is an acknowledgment of where they stand, where nothing can happen in divided government so we may essentially have the status quo. Significant immigration reform and fundamental tax reform are probably not going to happen.\"\n\nWhile legislative activity slowing down ahead of an election is not unusual, the early transition from policymaking to politicking by one party, particularly when the other party is actively advancing a positive and popular agenda, is noteworthy. The Senate has already passed comprehensive, bipartisan immigration reform and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. If Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid uses the Senate to pass or force Republicans to filibuster additional bills, such as renewing emergency unemployment compensation, a Voting Rights Act patch, an equal pay bill, a minimum wage bill, and so on, it may appear awkward if the House has little to offer in return.\n\nHealth care might be the exception, as House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has expressed a commitment to passing an Affordable Care Act alternative this year. However, past experience suggests this intention may fizzle, leaving Republicans with full repeal\u2014a political loser\u2014as their official health care reform platform going into the midterms.\n\nThe electoral map, with Senate Democrats defending seats won in 2008 and the House in a midterm three years after they gerrymandered themselves a durable majority, may also contribute to inertia by making the GOP's strategy unfalsifiable. Even a bad GOP strategy will likely yield significant gains in the Senate and the retention of the House. If Republicans manage to flip the Senate, it will not matter whether it was a consequence of boring fundamentals rather than a wise political strategy. They will treat it as a vindication of anti-ACA absolutism anyway.\n\nIt is unusual for a party to put all their chips in one basket like this, so early in the cycle. This article aims to highlight this shift in strategy and its potential implications for the upcoming midterm elections.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Consider Trump Administration's Contraceptive Coverage Accommodation Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe left is urging the Supreme Court to overturn the Trump administration's accommodation policy regarding contraceptive coverage, which is a shift from the Obama administration's policy. The Obama administration's policy offered a workaround that pushed the cost of contraceptive care onto insurers and plan administrators, meaning that employers who objected to the coverage wouldn't have to pay for it but their employees would still be covered automatically.\n\nThe Trump administration's policy, which is currently under review, aims to allow employers with religious objections to opt out of providing contraceptive coverage. The heart of the case is whether the contraceptive mandate and the Obama administration's workaround impose a substantial burden on the religious beliefs of employers. However, if employers aren't providing the contraceptive coverage, there is no burden on them.\n\nUnder the Obama administration's compromise, objecting organizations were required to simply inform the federal government that they objected. The government would then work with the objectors' health insurers to offer cost-free contraception directly to their employees. Beyond giving notice, the objectors would have suffered no further involvement and paid nothing for any contraceptive care their employees received.\n\nCritics of the mandate argue that the mere act of giving notice would be intolerable, and that nothing short of offering full exemptions to practically any employer that wants one will do. They argue that federal law demands special care for the concerns of the faithful in striking a balance between religious liberty and governmental interests. The Obama administration accommodated all sides in good faith, and the court is being asked to respect this principled balance.\n\nEvery member of the Supreme Court's conservative majority has, in the past, expressed sympathy for religious objectors seeking exemptions from a generally applicable law. However, each has also expressed a desire to limit federal agencies' discretion to make policy. In the two Pennsylvania cases currently under review, several of the Court's conservative justices appeared to realize that these two goals are in tension.\n\nThe cases primarily ask whether the Trump administration has the power to give religious objectors a sweeping exemption, regardless of whether such an exemption is required by law. At least three of the Court's conservative justices, Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh, expressed concerns that the Trump administration may not have this power. In a 2019 opinion, Gorsuch proposed revising the largely defunct 'nondelegation doctrine', a constitutional doctrine briefly used in the 1930s to restrict Congress's power to delegate authority to the Roosevelt administration. While Gorsuch's opinion in that 2019 case, Gundy v. United States, is vague, it suggests the possibility of a cross-partisan coalition to strike down the broad exemption.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking President Trump's NATO Defense Spending Claims\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump reiterated his claims about NATO's European allies' defense spending during a breakfast meeting in Brussels on Thursday. According to NPR national security correspondent David Welna, Trump stated that many countries owe the U.S. a significant amount of money due to past unpaid bills. However, this claim is not accurate, as NATO is not like a club with annual membership fees, and there is no ledger that maintains accounts of what countries pay and owe.\n\nNATO members did make a commitment four years ago to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense by 2024. As of this year, only nine of the military alliance's 29 members are expected to reach that mark. Trump singled out Germany, the biggest economic power in NATO after the U.S., stating that Germany is only paying 1.25 percent of its GDP to defense, while the U.S. is spending 4.2 percent. This is partially true, as Germany indeed devotes only about 1.25 percent of its GDP to defense, but it has boosted defense spending the past two years.\n\nTrump also stated that the U.S. is spending 4.2 percent of GDP, but this is at odds with the Pentagon, which puts it at 3.3 percent. American University NATO scholar Garret Martin notes that the U.S. defense needs vastly surpass those of its European allies, as the U.S. is a global military power with global military commitments, while most European members of the alliance do not have the same level of global responsibilities.\n\nLast week at a rally in Montana, Trump made another claim about NATO funding, stating that the U.S. is paying for 70 to 90 percent to protect Europe. However, this claim is also inaccurate, as the U.S. pays 22 percent of a common budget that all NATO allies pay into, which is approximately $2.8 billion.\n\nTrump also sought to take credit for NATO allies spending more, stating that commitments have been made for over $40 billion dollars since the last meeting. While this is close to the truth, NATO reported yesterday that spending by European members has increased by $35 billion. American University's Martin notes that the higher spending continues a trend that predates Trump.\n\nNATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg pointed out that despite Trump's complaints about the U.S. spending too much, it is actually spending more than before. He stated that U.S. funding for military presence in Europe, the European Deterrence Initiative, has been increased by 40 percent. This spending was approved by Congress, where the Senate last night and the House today overwhelmingly approved resolutions backing NATO.",
    " Title: Trump and Pence Take Victory Lap for Carrier Job Retention Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nDonald Trump and Mike Pence will hold a rally in Indianapolis on Thursday to celebrate a deal with Carrier, a U.S. manufacturing company, to keep nearly 1,000 jobs in the United States instead of moving them to Mexico. The transition team of President-elect Trump claims the deal demonstrates Trump's commitment to protecting U.S. jobs and workers.\n\nKellyanne Conway, Trump's former campaign manager and top adviser, described the Carrier deal as a successful negotiation led by Trump that could be replicated once he takes office. Few details have been disclosed about the terms of the agreement, but it is believed that Carrier will keep about 850 jobs in Indiana and receive tax incentives from the state government.\n\nCarrier, which is owned by United Technologies, a larger company based in Connecticut with contracts with the U.S. government, issued a statement on Wednesday, stating that incentives offered by Indiana were \"an important consideration\" in its decision, but providing no further details.\n\nThe White House downplayed the news, stating that President Obama's policies had created more than 800,000 manufacturing jobs. However, Trump's team argues that the Carrier deal shows Trump can create a business-friendly climate that will stimulate economic growth at a faster pace than during the Obama years.\n\nJohn Feehery, a Trump supporter, Republican strategist, and columnist, praised Trump's use of the bully pulpit to keep American jobs in the U.S. Alice Stewart, a Republican strategist, said it was smart of Trump to demonstrate early that he can negotiate policies that will benefit the U.S. economy.\n\nFiscally conservative groups have yet to comment on the deal, but if Trump and Pence have offered any special concessions to Carrier, these groups may criticize the deal as corporate welfare. Brent Gardner, chief government affairs officer at Americans for Prosperity, stated that the particulars of the agreement have not been released, but the group's position on corporate welfare remains unchanged.\n\nThe deal has sparked debate over the use of incentives to keep U.S. companies from moving jobs overseas. Trump has argued against using incentives like low-interest loans and tax cuts to entice U.S. firms to stay put. However, some economists worry that Trump's willingness to negotiate one-on-one with companies could lead to other CEOs threatening to leave the country in exchange for better deals.\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) stated that he had no issues with Trump personally getting involved to prevent the outsourcing of jobs. Jordan said, \"My attitude is, if the president of the United States thinks it's in the best interest in the country, that's good that he's standing up and encouraging business to stay here and keep jobs here in the United States.\"",
    " Title: Marco Rubio: A Seabiscuit in the 2016 Republican Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2016 Republican presidential race, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida is positioning himself as a candidate with a compelling personal story, much like President Barack Obama eight years ago. Both men are young, first-term senators with eloquent speaking abilities and a desire to lead the United States.\n\nRubio, like Obama, is in a competitive race, and despite a stumble in the recent New Hampshire debate, he remains in a comfortable position behind the leaders, ready to make his move. As America seeks renewed hope and a sense of identity, Rubio's optimistic outlook and aspirations for a better future could propel him to the White House.\n\nThe current political climate is reminiscent of eight years ago, with a sense of anger in the campaigns of Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, and Bernie Sanders. However, beneath the surface, there is an undercurrent of optimism for a leader who will represent the dignity, decorum, and exceptional qualities of the United States.\n\nMarco Rubio has a personal connection to the American people, particularly those of Cuban descent, given his roots in Miami. His parents' struggle and his rags-to-riches story should inspire all ethnic groups, not just Latinos, much like President Obama's story did eight years ago.\n\nRubio is currently in third place, but the leaders, Cruz and Trump, are within his sights. To win the Republican nomination, Rubio could finish third in Iowa, second in New Hampshire, and first in South Carolina, maintaining his momentum all the way to the national convention. If his performance in the New Hampshire debate lands him lower than second, he has ample time to regain his stride and overtake the leaders.\n\nRubio has been articulate in addressing issues like immigration, healthcare, and national security, and he has provided more substantive details on his website than any of his opponents. Cruz has criticized Rubio for his involvement with the \"Gang of Eight,\" but seeking bipartisan support to solve problems is a trait of a great president, and Rubio should use that to his advantage.\n\nMarco Rubio is a compassionate, brilliant, articulate, focused leader who can rally America to a new era. Now is his time to sharpen his focus, take the lead at the end of the first turn, pace himself in the backstretch, and leave the others in his dust as he sprints to the finish line.",
    " Title: U.S. and Allies Extend Nuclear Talks with Iran for Seven Months\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States and its allies have extended nuclear negotiations with Iran for seven months, aiming to reach a comprehensive agreement that limits Iran's ability to produce nuclear weapons. The extension was announced on Monday following a yearlong effort that failed to reach a deal. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and other Western foreign ministers, who gathered in Vienna for a last-ditch diplomatic push, described the extension as the best way forward.\n\nThe new deadline is set for March 1, with a final agreement to follow four months later. The extension aims to address remaining issues, such as the number and type of centrifuges Iran should be allowed to operate, as well as the duration of constraints on Iran's nuclear program.\n\nCritics in the U.S. Congress have expressed concern that Iran is using the negotiations to buy time, with the new Republican-controlled Congress threatening to impose additional sanctions on Iran. Members of the new Congress have already suggested they may have enough votes to overturn an expected veto by President Barack Obama.\n\nIran's nuclear program remains frozen but intact, without any of the cuts sought by the U.S. During the negotiations, Iran continues to receive monthly payments of $700 million in frozen funds that began under the temporary nuclear deal agreed upon last year.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond stated that the sides are giving themselves until March to agree on a text \"that sets out in layman's language what we have agreed to do.\" Experts will then have four months to \"translate that into precise definitions of what will happen on the ground.\"\n\nNegotiators from both sides remain optimistic, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry praising his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, for his diligent and good-faith approach to the negotiations. Kerry expressed hope that the extension would allow the talks to proceed without sending messages that might be misinterpreted.\n\nIn Tehran, hard-liners may increase pressure on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to break off talks. However, the latest extension appears to have the approval of Khamenei, the ultimate arbiter in Iran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who has struggled to sell the idea of negotiating with the U.S. to hard-liners at home, pledged \"ultimate victory\" for the Islamic Republic in securing a favorable agreement.\n\nThe extension was met with frustration by some Iranian residents, despite Rouhani's positive spin. High school teacher Abbas Hoseini expressed concern that the West is pushing Iran toward Russia and China.",
    " Title: Gantz and Lieberman Agree to Collaborate, Threatening Netanyahu's Chances of Forming a Government\n\nArticle:\n\nIsraeli opposition leader Benny Gantz, head of the Blue and White Party, announced on Monday that he had agreed to work with Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the small Yisrael Beiteinu party, to form a new government following national elections last week. This development represents a new setback for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he grapples with maintaining power before his upcoming corruption trial.\n\nIn a statement, Gantz reported that he had a productive meeting with Lieberman, stating, \"We discussed questions of fundamental principle and determined that we will work together to assemble a government that will pull Israel out of the political deadlock and avert a fourth round of elections.\"\n\nIn last week's election, Israel's third in less than a year, Netanyahu's Likud party emerged as the largest party. However, with his smaller religious and nationalist allies, he secured only 58 seats in parliament, three short of the required 61-seat majority needed to form a new government. Netanyahu's opponents, led by Gantz, control a majority of seats. Yet, beyond their shared animosity towards Netanyahu, there are deep divisions between these parties, which include Lieberman's secular, ultra-nationalist party and the Arab-led Joint List.\n\nGantz's announcement with Lieberman marks a step towards unifying the anti-Netanyahu forces, though it remains unclear whether they can reach a final agreement, much less a deal with Arab politicians. Lieberman, in the past, has branded Arab political leaders as \"terrorist\" sympathizers.\n\n\"We'll continue to discuss the details, formulate our common objectives, and move forward,\" Gantz said.\n\nNetanyahu is determined to remain as prime minister as he prepares to go on trial on March 17. He has been charged with fraud, breach of trust, and accepting bribes in connection to a series of scandals that include accepting expensive gifts from wealthy friends and offering to exchange favors with powerful media moguls. Netanyahu's lawyers requested a delay in the start of the trial, saying they need more time to review evidence. Prosecutors on Monday said they oppose any delays.\n\nIsrael's president, Reuven Rivlin, must decide by next week who to choose as the prime minister-designate. The president typically chooses the candidate he deems has the best chance of forming a governing coalition. Netanyahu has defiantly insisted he won last week's election and accused his opponents of trying to \"steal the elections\" by aligning with Arab-led parties he claimed were hostile to the state. \"I promise you, I am not going anywhere,\" Netanyahu said over the weekend.",
    " Title: Obama Defends Use of Drones, Airstrikes in Counter-Terror Operations\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama on Friday defended the regular use of drones and airstrikes by his administration to target terror leaders or training camps in Somalia, Libya, and Yemen. He acknowledged that in the past, such strikes may have inadvertently resulted in civilian casualties, but stated that the procedures for approving such strikes have improved.\n\n\"There has been legitimate criticism that the legal architecture around the use of drone strikes or other kinetic strikes wasn't as precise as it should have been, and there's no doubt that civilians were killed that shouldn't have been,\" Obama said at a press conference following the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington. He added, \"What I can say with great confidence is that our operating procedures are as rigorous as they have ever been, and that there is a constant evaluation of precisely what we do.\"\n\nObama's remarks came after the U.S. military announced on Friday that it had conducted an airstrike the previous day targeting a senior terrorist leader in Somalia, Hassan Ali Dhoore, an operational commander of al-Shabab, an al-Qaeda-linked terror group. The Pentagon stated that Dhoore was involved in planning a number of attacks, including some that resulted in the deaths of three Americans.\n\nThe Pentagon said officials were still assessing the results of the operation to determine if Dhoore was killed in the strike, but noted that his death would be a \"significant blow\" to the terror group's operations and ability to conduct attacks. Dhoore was reportedly involved in the Dec. 25, 2014, attack on Mogadishu International Airport that killed several African Union personnel and a U.S. citizen, and the March 27, 2015, attack on the Maka al-Mukarram Hotel in Mogadishu that killed 15 people.\n\nLast month, the Pentagon launched a strike that killed up to 150 militants at a terrorist training camp in Somalia.",
    " Title: NBC News Anchor Brian Williams Admits to Fabricating War Story\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent admission, NBC News anchor Brian Williams has confessed to peddling a fabricated war story about himself, joining a list of notable figures who have embellished their war experiences. The story in question involves Williams' account of a helicopter incident during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nOver the years, Williams has provided varying accounts of the event, with his most recent version claiming that his helicopter was hit and forced down by enemy fire. However, in light of being called out for his fabrication, Williams admitted that it was a different helicopter that was hit, not his own.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident, as other notable figures have also been caught embellishing their war stories. In 1983, former President Ronald Reagan claimed to have filmed Nazi death camps as a U.S. Army photographer, a story that was later proven false due to his own admission of never leaving the country during World War II.\n\nDuring the 2008 campaign, then-Senator Joe Biden implied that he had experienced combat in Afghanistan, stating that his helicopter was \"forced down\" by enemy fire. However, it was later revealed that a snowstorm, not enemy fire, was responsible for the forced landing of Biden's helicopter.\n\nSimilarly, during the 2008 campaign, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed that she and her group landed \"under sniper fire\" at an airstrip in Tuzla. This claim was later retracted, with Clinton stating that she had \"misspoken.\"\n\nOther politicians, such as Senators Richard Blumenthal, George W. Bush, and Tom Harkin, have also been called out for fabricating their military records.\n\nThe dishonest portrayal of military service by politicians is generally accepted, but the public expects higher truth standards from members of the press. Williams, while not a field reporter, is still considered a journalist, and millions rely on him for truthful reporting. The public trusts him as a truth-teller, not a fabulist.\n\nThe human tendency to embellish stories is universal, and it seems that some journalists find it impossible to resist. As they tell their personal stories, they tend to add dramatic pauses and incorporate reactions from previous audiences, escalating the drama and making up details to further engage their audiences.\n\nWilliams' fabrication of his war story is a breach of the journalistic commandment against embellishment. This is evident in the timeline of his changing stories, as his early tellings were accurate but lacked the dramatic elements that he later added.\n\nThe allure of a hero's status can be irresistible, according to scholar W. Joseph Campbell, who has written extensively on media myths. It is possible that Williams stretched his mundane helicopter story into an exhilarating but false one due to feelings of guilt about having gone to war in the company of well-protected generals.",
    " Title: Indiana Governor Mike Pence Endorses Ted Cruz, Praises Donald Trump Ahead of Indiana Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIndiana Governor Mike Pence has announced his endorsement of Republican candidate Ted Cruz for the upcoming Indiana primary on Tuesday. In an interview on WIBC radio in Indianapolis, Pence praised Cruz as a \"principled conservative\" who has \"stood up for taxpayers\" in Washington and has shown \"strong, unwavering stand\" against abortion rights.\n\nHowever, Pence also went out of his way to praise Republican front-runner Donald Trump, commending him for giving voice to people's frustrations and for taking a stand for Hoosier jobs. Pence emphasized that his endorsement was not intended to sway the votes of Indiana Republicans, stating, \"I respect the right of every Hoosier in making their determination.\"\n\nPence began by acknowledging his respect for all three candidates, before commending Trump specifically. He expressed gratitude towards Trump for taking a stand for Hoosier jobs and for his voice in the national debate. Pence clarified that he was not against any candidate, but would be voting for Ted Cruz in the Republican primary. He also stated that he would work hard for whoever wins the Republican nomination in the fall.\n\nPence's endorsement is closely watched due to his potential re-election bid as a candidate this fall and his past speculation as a possible Republican presidential candidate. Cruz is hoping Pence's endorsement will give him a boost in the Hoosier State, where he is currently trailing Trump in recent surveys. Cruz was also helped by Scott Walker's endorsement in Wisconsin, which resulted in Cruz's only big-state primary victory in this campaign.\n\nIn Indiana, there are 57 delegates at stake on Tuesday. If Trump sweeps those delegates, his path to the nomination becomes clear and likely. Currently, he needs 42 percent of remaining delegates to win, which is achievable. If he wins all of Indiana's 57 delegates, that drops to 36 percent.",
    " Title: GOP Candidates Engage in Policy Discussion at Kemp Forum on Expanding Opportunity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from the heated rhetoric and controversial statements that have characterized much of the 2016 Republican primary race, several GOP candidates gathered at the Kemp Forum on Expanding Opportunity in Columbia, South Carolina, for a five-hour discussion focused on policy proposals. The event, moderated by Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott, provided a stark contrast to the recent campaign trail events of front-runners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, who did not attend the forum.\n\nThe forum, which was a welcome change for many candidates struggling to gain traction, featured a collegial back-and-forth discussion of policy proposals, including the earned income tax credit, charter-school education, and alleviating poverty. The event was a breath of fresh air, according to Ryan, who stated that it was a break for both the candidates and the press.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson shared the stage, with Ohio Gov. John Kasich boasting about his legislative background, claiming he was involved in writing the first set of welfare reform legislation.\n\nTrump and Cruz's absence and the contrasting tone of the forum were particularly noticeable after the two poll leaders' recent headline-grabbing statements. The night before the GOP poverty event, Trump held a boisterous rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, where he praised the capture of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, had a Muslim woman who silently protested during the event kicked out, and rallied the crowd with exclamations about his plans to \"knock the sh-- out of ISIS.\" Meanwhile, Cruz made headlines in Iowa when he likened spanking his daughter to the spanking Hillary Clinton could receive from voters.\n\nParticipants at the Kemp Forum, including Kasich and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, praised Ryan and Scott's efforts to engage in a substantive conversation more in line with a wonky Washington think tank discussion than the rough-and-tumble presidential campaign. Graham, who sparred with Trump before dropping out of the race last month, noted the difference in tone compared to Trump's rallies, stating, \"If you are real loud here, you are a jerk.\"\n\nThe forum was not without interruptions, as young immigration protesters disrupted the afternoon session with Kasich and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). The protesters, who were quickly escorted out by police, targeted Rubio's position on the country's immigration laws. However, the candidates remained composed, with Rubio responding, \"We're going to enforce our immigration laws, guys,\" and Kasich adding, \"We heard it. Thank you very much.\"\n\nThe candidates largely remained in sync during the forum, with Bush, Christie, and Kasich discussing their policy positions on block grants, marriage, and creating a work-based competency system. Christie also spent several minutes discussing the details of the earned income tax credit and how increasing the refundable tax credit incentivized poor people to seek employment.\n\nOverall, the Kemp Forum on Expanding Opportunity provided a unique opportunity for GOP candidates to engage in a substantive policy discussion, away from the heated rhetoric and controversial statements that have characterized much of the 2016 primary race.",
    " Title: What Happens to Campaign Contributions When a Presidential Candidate Drops Out?\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington Governor Jay Inslee and former Governor John Hickenlooper, both former presidential candidates, have recently dropped out of the race. As of June, both candidates raised nearly $8.5 million in campaign contributions from individual donors and Political Action Committees (PACs). The question arises as to what happens to these campaign contributions when a presidential candidate drops out of the race.\n\nAccording to the Federal Election Committee (FEC), any excess campaign funds cannot be used for personal use. However, the world of campaign finance is complex, and the use of excess funds is not always straightforward.\n\nIf a campaign has outstanding debt or expenses, part of a donor's contribution might be used to pay these off. This could mean paying salaries for campaign staff or even moving expenses. If a campaign has no accrued debt, part of the donation might be used for the candidate's future campaigns or allocated to other candidates, political action committees, or charities at the candidate's choosing.\n\nThere is a grey area regarding the definition of \"gifts.\" Candidates can use donations to purchase gifts, so long as they are not given to the candidate's family. The definition of a \"gift\" seems open-ended.\n\nTo ensure that donations are spent appropriately, one can research a campaign's spending throughout and after a presidential bid is over. \"Once a campaign has ended, a candidate's committee must continue to file FEC reports until the committee is terminated,\" a spokesperson for the FEC said in an email. \"So it's possible to track how the campaigns spend any residual funds they maintain.\"\n\nTo view these reports, visit the FEC database, search by a candidate's campaign name\u2014which typically consists of their last name, followed by \"For America\" or \"2020\"\u2014and scroll to the bottom of the page to find their expenses. For example, to find Inslee's campaign, search for \"Inslee for America.\" To find Hickenlooper's campaign, search for \"Hickenlooper 2020.\" You can search for any former presidential candidate's campaign from any other election, as well.\n\nThere are limits to these filings. For one, they are generally updated quarterly; if you donated to Inslee or Hickenlooper, you won't know how they're spending excess funds until September. Also, you'll have to do a lot of digging into candidates' expenses, and even then, you can't fully interpret a simple line item.\n\nNone of this should dissuade you from donating to a candidate of your choosing. In fact, it should provide incentive to vote for a candidate who promotes campaign finance reform, so that your future contributions are spent wisely.",
    " Title: Republican Anxiety Over Romney's Campaign Grows as Election Nears\n\nArticle:\n\nAnxiety among Republicans about the presidential race between Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama has spread beyond Washington, with concerns about Romney's campaign strategy and his own miscues affecting local candidates in tight races.\n\nRepublican strategists across the country have reported that their candidates are being questioned about Romney's remarks, creating a potential trap for those in challenging races.\n\nRomney has attempted to turn the issue against Obama, labeling the president as an advocate of wealth redistribution and emphasizing, \"My campaign is about the 100 percent of America.\" However, during a campaign stop in Florida on Thursday, Obama focused on Romney's \"47 percent\" comments.\n\n\"My thinking is maybe you haven't gotten around a lot,\" Obama said about Romney in an appearance at a Univision forum in Coral Gables.\n\nThere is a growing sense of frustration among Republicans that Romney has yet to take a commanding lead in any of the major battleground states, particularly North Carolina, which has the nation's fifth-worst unemployment rate, or Nevada, which has the highest jobless rate, 12 percent.\n\nIn Ohio, Florida, and Colorado, Republicans who support Romney's efforts have expressed concern that he is not campaigning enough in their states and that resources are not reaching vital counties.\n\n\"Could we use yard signs? Could we use information data?\" said A.J. Matthews, a Republican State Committee member from Hillsborough County, Florida. \"What would we most like from Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan? Visit us more.\"\n\nIn Ohio, some Republicans have expressed concern that Romney is not spending more money and appearing more frequently in rural counties where he needs a strong turnout to win the state\u2014and where his \"47 percent\" comments threaten to undercut support among working-class voters otherwise inclined to vote for him. A bus trip by Romney next week may address some of these worries.\n\nIn Colorado, Dick Wadhams, a longtime Republican strategist and former state party chairman, said he hoped to see Romney campaign harder for swing voters in suburban Denver, and he was pleased the candidate was planning to visit the state on Sunday, the first time in seven weeks.\n\n\"They want to vote against Obama, but they haven't quite come to the point where they're going to vote for Romney,\" said Wadhams, speaking of swing voters.\n\nWadhams and other party leaders said, however, that they were heartened by Romney's get-out-the-vote operations. Republicans say Romney's on-the-ground efforts are far superior to those of Senator John McCain in 2008.\n\nOfficials at the Romney campaign said they believed some of the concern in the tossup states was being created by what they described as hyped media reporting on Romney's latest missteps. The campaign has been meticulously thought out, they said, and its supporters have yet to see activity that, by design, was not scheduled to begin until near the end of the race.\n\n\"We're making some very strategic decisions,\" said Rich Beeson, the political director. \"And when we're coming down to the end, you'll see the governor everywhere he needs to be.\"\n\nRomney has yet to take command of any battleground states, according to polls, many of which show Obama with an edge. The Romney campaign has been focusing on Iowa as one of its more promising states, but an NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist College poll released Thursday evening showed Obama with an 8-point advantage there.\n\nIn a stop near Des Moines, Ann Romney said it was time for Republicans to stop second-guessing her husband. \"Stop it. This is hard,\" she told Radio Iowa. \"You want to try it? Get in the ring.\"\n\nThe president and his aides are aware that everything could change in an instant, particularly with three presidential debates looming, and said Democrats could not be complacent.\n\nBut for the first time in many months, Mr. Obama's job approval rating has reached 50 percent in several recent polls. He has taken the edge away from Romney on questions of who voters believe will be a better steward of the economy, which coincides with the release of modestly positive economic signals.\n\nConstruction of new houses and home sales have reached their highest levels in more than two years, new reports show, and the Census Bureau reported that the number of young adults living at home with their parents\u2014a vivid indicator of the personal effect of the recession on young people\u2014is dropping.\n\nYet the president must still contend with his campaign promises made four years ago, including his pledge to change Washington. When asked about that on Thursday during the Univision forum, he said change must come from the \"outside.\"\n\nSpeaking to supporters in Sarasota, Florida, Romney seized on the remark as an admission of failure, saying: \"The president today threw in the white flag of surrender. He went from the president of change to the president who can't get change.\"\n\nFor all of the open fretting among Republicans, several party leaders say Romney still has an opportunity to win over voters who are ready to reject Obama.\n\n\"Romney has not made the sale yet with the 5 or 10 percent that are undecided, and he very well could,\" said Mike DeWine, Ohio's attorney general. \"It's a very doable thing for Romney to win Ohio and very doable for him to win the race.\"\n\nAs Romney headed to an evening fund-raiser in West Palm Beach, Florida, a reporter asked if he would be campaigning more extensively.\n\n\"Ha, ha. We're in the stretch, aren't we?\" Romney said before promptly changing the subject and pointing to the sky. \"Look at those clouds. It's beautiful. Look at those things.\"",
    " Title: North Korea Launches Missile Over Japan, Renewing Tensions in the Region\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Trump stated Tuesday that \"all options are on the table\" following North Korea's launch of a missile over Japan, an action that immediately escalated tensions in the region after the regime seemed to de-escalate its threats against the U.S. and its allies just days prior.\n\nIn a written statement released by the White House, Trump said, \"The world has received North Korea\u2019s latest message loud and clear: this regime has signaled its contempt for its neighbors, for all members of the United Nations, and for minimum standards of acceptable international behavior.\"\n\nThe statement continued, \"Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime\u2019s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world. All options are on the table.\"\n\nIn a first, North Korea on Tuesday fired a midrange ballistic missile designed to carry a nuclear payload that flew over U.S. ally Japan and splashed into the northern Pacific Ocean. The distance and type of missile test seemed designed to show that North Korea can back up a threat to target the U.S. territory of Guam, if it chooses to do so, while also establishing a potentially dangerous precedent that could see future missiles flying over Japan.\n\nThe White House said that Trump spoke Monday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe about the \"grave\" North Korean threat. \"President Trump and Prime Minister Abe committed to increasing pressure on North Korea, and doing their utmost to convince the international community to do the same,\" the statement said.\n\nAny new test worries Washington and its allies because it presumably puts the North a step closer toward its goal of an arsenal of nuclear missiles that can reliably target the United States. Tuesday's test, however, looks especially aggressive to Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo.\n\nThe Pentagon told reporters that it was investigating the launch over Japan, adding: \"North American Aerospace Defense Command determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.\" U.S. officials said the Japanese military did not attempt to intercept the missile.\n\nSouth Korea's air force responded to North Korea's missile launch over Japan by conducting a live-fire drill involving powerful bombs, officials said early Tuesday. Four F-15 fighters dropped eight MK-84 bombs that accurately hit targets at a military field near South Korea's eastern coast, Seoul's presidential spokesman Park Su-hyun said. Each bomb has an explosive yield of a ton, according to the country's air force.\n\nTuesday's launch comes days after the North fired what was assessed as three short-range ballistic missiles into the sea and a month after its second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, which analysts say could reach deep into the U.S. mainland when perfected.\n\nTrump responded earlier this month by threatening Kim Jong Un's regime with \"fire and fury,\" touching off an escalating war of words. Kim eventually walked back threats to attack the U.S. territory of Guam, temporarily easing tensions -- until the latest round of provocations.",
    " Title: White House Refuses to Comment on President's Involvement in Justice Department's National Security Leaks Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the U.S. Justice Department investigates recent high-level national security leaks from the White House, a top adviser to President Obama, David Plouffe, refused to confirm whether the president will answer investigators' questions during an appearance on Fox News Sunday. The investigation, led by two career attorneys at the Justice Department, is focused on determining who leaked classified national security information to a New York Times reporter, resulting in a series of recent stories.\n\nThe leaks included details of a top-secret \"kill list,\" a list of targets for drone strikes assembled by the president's national security team, as well as information on a U.S. cyberattack on Iranian infrastructure and confirmation that American intelligence agencies had a mole inside al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nSome congressional Republicans and political pundits have speculated that the leaks were authorized by the White House to aid President Obama's re-election campaign by bringing his national security record back into the spotlight. However, the veracity of this theory remains unclear.\n\nSen. Joe Lieberman, Connecticut independent, expressed concern over the leaks, stating, \"In my opinion, an enormous amount of damage has been done to our national security.\" He further noted that the disclosure of cyberwarfare against Iran could lead to a retaliatory strike.\n\nMany on Capitol Hill, including Sen. Lieberman, believe the administration should appoint independent prosecutors to investigate the matter, rather than relying on investigators who report directly to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. The White House has thus far rejected these calls.\n\nDespite being pressed on the question, Mr. Plouffe would not confirm whether the president would agree to one-on-one interviews with the two investigators, as former President George W. Bush did during the probe into the public disclosure of former CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity. During that scandal almost a decade ago, Mr. Bush also instructed his entire staff to come forward with any information they had about the source of the leak, which turned out to be State Department official Richard Armitage.\n\nSen. Lieberman and others are now urging the administration to follow the Bush administration's playbook. \"I think the administration ought to do everything it can to eliminate any appearance that people in the administration leaked this highly classified information for political or other personal purposes,\" Mr. Lieberman said. \"If I were advising [the president], I'd say he should sit down and talk to the investigators.\"",
    " Title: Political Polarization in the United States: A Deepening Divide\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent correspondence between a Democrat and a Republican within an extended family has shed light on the deepening political polarization in the United States. The Democrat, in expressing concerns about the upcoming political season, noted that the family, consisting of around 50 or 60 members, has only a few known Republicans, suggesting a significant political imbalance.\n\nEvidence of this polarization can be found in various studies, such as the Pew Research Center's 2014 report based on interviews with 10,000 adults. The report reveals that the number of Americans expressing consistently conservative or liberal opinions has doubled over the past two decades, from 10 percent to 21 percent. The report also shows that ideological overlap has diminished, with 92 percent of Republicans being to the right of the median Democrat, and 94 percent of Democrats being to the left of the median Republican.\n\nThe report further indicates that many in the political center stay on the edges of the political process, while the most ideological make their voices heard. Two-thirds of consistent conservatives and half of liberals say most of their close friends share their political views. This finding, the report states, is \"shocking.\"\n\nThe divide between the two major political parties is not a new phenomenon, and its causes remain unclear. Some suggest that partisan news media and the internet have contributed to this polarization. The divide, according to National Journal's Ron Brownstein, is a \"durable standoff\" between a diverse, younger, urbanized, more secular Democratic coalition and a predominantly white, older, non-urban, and more religious Republican coalition.\n\nThe consequences of this political polarization are far-reaching, with personal attacks becoming vicious and unrestrained, and legislators voting along party lines. The divide is not going away, and it is unclear how to start dealing with the problem.\n\nIn personal relationships, it is natural to seek reinforcement by getting together with those who think as we do, even though we make token exceptions to read a few columnists from the other side to stimulate different perspectives. However, the deepening political polarization in the United States raises concerns about the future of the nation's political discourse and the potential consequences of the next presidential term, particularly in relation to Supreme Court appointments.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Intensify Trade War, Trump and Xi to Meet Amid Global Market Volatility\n\nArticle:\n\nThe trade war between the United States and China has escalated, with both countries imposing higher tariffs on each other's goods. U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Monday that he would meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next month at the G20 summit in Japan.\n\nChina announced earlier that it would impose tariffs on a range of U.S. goods, including frozen vegetables and liquefied natural gas. This move followed the U.S.'s decision last week to increase its own tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative's office later stated that it planned to hold a public hearing next month on the possibility of imposing duties of up to 25% on a further $300 billion worth of imports from China. Cellphones and laptops would be included in this list, but pharmaceuticals would be excluded, the office said.\n\nThe prospect of a no-holds-barred dispute between the world's two largest economies has rattled investors, leading to a sharp selloff on equities markets in the past week. A gauge of global stocks shed a further 1.9% on Monday, its biggest one-day drop in more than five months. China's yuan currency fell to its lowest level since December, and oil futures slumped.\n\nTrump said he would talk to Xi at the G20 summit and expressed optimism about the meeting, stating, \"Maybe something will happen. We're going to be meeting, as you know, at the G20 in Japan and that'll be, I think, probably a very fruitful meeting.\"\n\nSpeaking at a White House dinner gathering later, Trump said it should be clear in \"three or four weeks\" if a U.S. trade delegation's trip to Beijing two weeks ago was successful. \"I have a feeling it's going to be very successful,\" Trump said.\n\nChina's top diplomat, State Councilor Wang Yi, said during a trip to Russia that China-U.S. talks were not a \"one-way street\" and needed to be conducted on the basis of equality. \"Both countries' negotiating teams have the ability and wisdom to resolve each other's reasonable demands, and in the end, reach a mutually beneficial, win-win agreement,\" he said.\n\nThe comment period on the planned new tranche of U.S. duties, which covers 3,805 product categories, is much shorter than in previous rounds and could potentially leave Trump in a position to trigger those tariffs by the time he meets Xi.\n\nU.S. farmers are among those most affected by the trade war, with soybean sales to China plummeting, and U.S. soybean futures hitting their lowest level in a decade. Trump said on Monday his administration was planning to provide about $15 billion to help farmers whose products might be targeted.\n\nFarmers, who are a core political constituency for Trump's Republicans heading into the 2020 presidential and congressional elections, are growing increasingly frustrated with the protracted trade talks and the failure to reach an agreement. \"What that means for soybean growers is that we're losing,\" said Davie Stephens, president of the American Soybean Association, in a statement.\n\nChina also announced on Monday that it planned to set import tariffs ranging from 5% to 25% on 5,140 U.S. products on a $60 billion target list. These tariffs are set to take effect on June 1. China's finance ministry stated, \"China's adjustment on additional tariffs is a response to U.S. unilateralism and protectionism.\"\n\nIn the middle of the negotiations last week, Trump increased tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%. The move affected 5,700 categories of Chinese products, including internet modems and routers. Sources have said talks stalled after China tried to delete commitments from a draft agreement that its laws would be changed to enact new policies on issues from intellectual property protection to forced technology transfers.\n\nBeijing stated on Monday that it would never surrender to external pressure. Its state media kept up a steady drumbeat of strongly worded commentary, reiterating that the door to talks was always open but vowing that China would defend its national interests and dignity. State television said in a commentary that the effect of the U.S. tariffs on the Chinese economy was \"totally controllable.\"\n\nTrump has said he is in no rush to finalize a deal with China. He again defended the move to hike U.S. tariffs and said there was no reason why American consumers would pay the costs. Economists and industry consultants, however, maintain that it is U.S. businesses that will pay the costs and likely pass them on to consumers.\n\nU.S. tariffs last year triggered retaliation by China, which imposed 25% levies on $50 billion worth of U.S. products including soybeans, beef, and pork, and lower tariffs on a list of $60 billion in goods. Goldman Sachs economists said in a research note that new evidence showed the costs of Washington's tariffs on China last year had fallen entirely on U.S. businesses and households, with no clear reduction in prices charged by Chinese exporters. They said the effects of the tariffs had spilled over noticeably to the prices charged by U.S. producers competing with goods affected by the levies.",
    " Title: Sen. Doug Jones Announces Vote to Convict President Trump on Both Articles of Impeachment\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), considered one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats running in November, announced on Wednesday that he will vote to convict President Donald J. Trump on both articles of impeachment.\n\nIn a statement, Jones, who has been undecided on his voting decision for weeks, stated, \"After many sleepless nights, I have reluctantly concluded that the evidence is sufficient to convict the President for both abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\"\n\nThe Senate is set to vote on the two House-passed articles of impeachment: abuse of power over the delayed Ukraine aid and obstructing Congress's investigations into those actions. The votes are scheduled to take place on the same day as Jones's announcement.\n\nJones had previously expressed his indecision, telling reporters on Monday that he was \"getting there\" but still wanted to review notes and consult with colleagues. He sparked speculation last month that he could split his votes when he told USA Today that he had \"concerns\" about the House manager's second article of impeachment, which deals with alleged obstruction of Congress.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jones acknowledged that the second article \"gave me even more pause,\" adding that he \"struggled to understand\" the House's strategy. However, after careful consideration of the evidence, the public disclosures, the legal precedents, and the trial, I believe the President deliberately and unconstitutionally obstructed Congress by refusing to cooperate with the investigation in any way,\" Jones said.\n\nJones also stated that Trump's actions \"demonstrate a belief that he is above the law\" and, if left unchecked, would risk guaranteeing that no future whistleblower or witness would ever come forward and no future President would be subject to Congressional oversight.\n\nOn the first article, abuse of power, Jones said he was \"deeply troubled\" by the arguments from Trump's legal team. \"The President\u2019s actions placed his personal interests well above the national interests and threatened the security of the United States, our allies in Europe, and our ally Ukraine. His actions were more than simply inappropriate. They were an abuse of power,\" Jones said.",
    " Title: Biden's Claim of Lack of Oversight in Coronavirus Relief Effort Disputed\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring a virtual rally in Wisconsin on Wednesday, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden claimed that President Trump was implementing the coronavirus relief effort with \"no oversight, no IGs [Inspectors General], no accountability.\" However, several different methods of oversight for the coronavirus relief effort were created by the CARES Act.\n\nThe most significant oversight mechanism is the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, established by Section 15010 of the CARES Act. The committee's responsibilities include auditing the economic relief funds to prevent waste and abuse and ensuring the money is efficiently distributed. The CARES Act outlines the membership of the committee, which includes the inspectors general of several departments, as well as the inspectors general of the Small Business Administration and Tax Administration.\n\nThe CARES Act also established the special inspector general for pandemic recovery, a position tasked with conducting audits and investigations of the making, purchase, management, and sale of loans, loan guarantees, and other investments made by the Secretary of the Treasury under any program established by the Secretary under the Act. The position is currently vacant, with President Trump having nominated his senior associate counsel, Brian Miller.\n\nFurthermore, the CARES Act established the Congressional Oversight Commission, tasked with overseeing the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve's lending practices to create transparency about how the money is being used and determine the economic impact of the loans. The commission is made up of five members, with each party leader in the House and Senate appointing one member, and the leaders of each chamber picking a fifth member with consultation from the minority party leaders.\n\nPresident Trump's meddling with the inspectors general on the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee and his choice for a special inspector general have earned him criticism. Additionally, he has stated he disagrees with elements of the CARES Act oversight provisions, issuing a statement detailing which sections he would ignore. However, it is inaccurate to claim, as Biden did, that there is \"no oversight, no IGs [Inspectors General], no accountability\" in the coronavirus economic relief effort. Biden's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Immigration Bill Dismissed by White House as Non-Starter\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has dismissed a bipartisan immigration bill brokered by a group of lawmakers as a non-starter just hours before it is expected to be formally introduced in the Senate. The bill, to be introduced by Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain and Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons on Monday, aims to grant eventual citizenship to young undocumented immigrants who have been in the country since 2013 and came to the US as children. However, it does not address all of President Trump's stated immigration priorities, such as ending family-based immigration categories or the diversity visa program.\n\nThe bill does not immediately authorize the $30 billion that Trump is seeking to build the border wall, instead greenlighting a study of border security needs. The bill also seeks to address the number of undocumented immigrants staying in the US by increasing the number of resources for the immigration courts, where cases can take years to finish.\n\nThe bill is a companion to a piece of House legislation that has 54 co-sponsors split evenly by party. A White House official rebuffed the effort, telling CNN that it takes \"a lot of effort\" to write up a bill worse than the Graham-Durbin immigration bill, but somehow \"this one is worse.\"\n\nTrump tweeted about the latest immigration efforts on Monday, writing, \"Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal!\"\n\nDelaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons defended the bill in a conference call with reporters on Monday, calling it a \"strong starting place\" and a \"fresh start\" if other talks about immigration do not result in a compromise.\n\nThe White House has been aware of the legislation introduced by Texas Republican Rep. Will Hurd and California Democrat Rep. Pete Aguilar for weeks, with officials being informed while it was being drafted and with chief of staff John Kelly and legislative director Marc Short being briefed on the bill in meetings with members of Congress, including Hurd and Aguilar. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, of which Aguilar is a key member, has been especially supportive of the bill as a compromise, as have moderate Republicans.\n\nThe bill would create a \"smart wall\" where the Department of Homeland Security would gain \"operational control\" of the border by the end of 2020 through \"technology, physical barriers, levees, tools, and other devices.\" On family-based migration, the bill does not make explicit reference to sponsoring relatives, but the bill authors say that existing law would prohibit parents of these individuals who came to the US illegally to apply for a visa to come back without returning to their home country for at least 10 years before applying, and the bill does nothing to erase that requirement.\n\nSen. Coons said that Sen. McCain approached him about being a co-sponsor, saying that McCain is deeply concerned about the lack of future certainty for the military because of a budget impasse and the lack of a broader deal on immigration issues, and wanted to find a partner to introduce the Hurd-Aguilar bill in the Senate as part of that effort.\n\nSen. Coons also had some harsh words for the President, saying that despite the White House saying his proposal is the only one that can move forward, \"I'm sorry, that's not how the Senate works.\" He rejected White House criticism of his proposal and said the \"worst\" thing would be failing to act or only doing a one-year stopgap.\n\nSen. McCain said in a statement the new bill has \"broad support.\" The Senate is expected to turn to a floor debate on immigration soon, and Sen. Coons has been part of a group of bipartisan lawmakers that have been meeting for weeks to try to find a compromise that could pass the vote with more than the 60 votes needed to advance legislation, which would require members of both parties. Sen. McCain has been recuperating from cancer treatments but is a veteran of efforts to pass immigration reform.\n\n\"While reaching a deal can not come soon enough for America's service members, the current political reality demands bipartisan cooperation to address the impending expiration of the DACA program and secure the southern border,\" Sen. McCain said in the statement.",

    " Title: Supreme Court to Review Same-Sex Marriage Cases in Federal and California Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision last week to review two cases concerning same-sex marriage, Windsor v. United States and Hollingsworth v. Perry, has set the stage for a constitutional battle over the issue. The cases, which involve the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and California's Proposition 8, have both sides trying to interpret the court's decision and its implications for the legal battles ahead.\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court announced it will review Windsor v. United States, a case involving the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), and Hollingsworth v. Perry, a challenge to Proposition 8, the California voter-passed measure that ended gay marriage in the state in 2008. Four of the nine justices had to agree for a case to be heard.\n\nGay rights activists expressed cautious confidence that they can win both cases. James Esseks, litigation director of the American Civil Liberties Union Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender & AIDS Project, said, \"This is it \u2014 the Supreme Court marriage moment that the ACLU has been working towards for years. These cases are poised not just to take down DOMA and Prop 8, but to be the next building blocks for LGBT equality more broadly.\"\n\nTraditional-values groups are also heartened that the marriage issue will finally be heard, noting that gay marriages are still not recognized in more than 80 percent of the states. John Eastman, chairman of the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes gay marriage, said, \"Taking the case sends 'a strong signal that the justices are concerned with the rogue rulings that have come out of San Francisco, at both the trial court and appellate levels.' Had the Supreme Court agreed with [the rulings], it could have simply declined to accept the cases and let the decisions stand.\"\n\nSupreme Court oral arguments are expected to be held in late winter or early spring, with decisions issued by summer. The high court proceedings are likely to take on new urgency given the activity in states such as Washington, where voters last month rejected an initiative to overturn the state's gay marriage law. Same-sex couples will also be able to marry in Maine on Dec. 29 and in Maryland on Jan. 1.\n\nThe federal case was brought by the ACLU and other lawyers on behalf of Edith Windsor, a New York woman who married her longtime companion, Thea Spyer, in Canada in 2007. When Ms. Spyer died a few years later, their marriage was not recognized by the federal government because of DOMA, and Ms. Windsor, now 83, was forced to pay nearly $370,000 in federal estate taxes.\n\nThe Proposition 8 case asks whether the U.S. Constitution prohibits the people of California from defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman in their state. The American Foundation for Equal Rights (AFER) sued to overturn Proposition 8 on behalf of two same-sex couples. \"This case is about the fundamental constitutional right of all Americans to marry the person they love,\" said Theodore B. Olson, AFER's lead co-counsel with David Boies. The Supreme Court's decision to grant review in this case \"illustrates the national significance of marriage equality, and brings us closer to the day when every American will be able to equally enjoy the fundamental freedom to marry.\"\n\nAndy Pugno, general counsel for ProtectMarriage.com, the organization that put Proposition 8 on the ballot, said, \"Arguing this case before the Supreme Court finally gives us a chance at a fair hearing, something that hasn't been afforded to the people since we began this fight.\"",
    " Title: Republican Governors Shift Focus Away from Tax Cuts and Medicaid Expansion\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the United States, several Republican governors, who were elected in 2010 and are now in their second term, are deviating from traditional Republican orthodoxy by focusing on issues other than tax cuts and Medicaid expansion.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker, known for his conservative policies such as ending public-employee collective bargaining, is not pursuing a so-called right-to-work bill, which would further limit unions, as vigorously as he did in the past. Walker is also downplaying suggestions he made a year ago to deeply slash the income tax.\n\nIn Ohio, Governor John Kasich, another potential presidential candidate, is proposing to raise taxes on energy drilling companies to fund an income tax cut, despite opposition from a Tea Party faction in the General Assembly. Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan is advocating for higher gasoline taxes to improve roads, an idea that is unpopular among his conservative supporters.\n\nThe prospect of sweeping new tax cuts seems to have diminished, partly because incumbents have already enacted cuts in their first term, but also due to the cautionary example of Kansas. In Kansas, Governor Sam Brownback pushed for large business and income tax cuts in 2012 and 2013, promising that the loss of revenue would be made up by a business boom. Instead, revenues plummeted, the state faces a significant budget shortfall, and a backlash nearly cost Brownback, a Republican, re-election.\n\nIn Florida, Governor Rick Scott, who was sworn in on Tuesday, has outlined an agenda that includes spending billions more on schools, the environment, and transportation, a stark contrast to the $3.3 billion in education cuts during his first term and his rejection of billions in federal aid for high-speed rail.\n\nIn Arizona, the newly elected Republican governor, Doug Ducey, did not mention his campaign pledges to cut income taxes each year in his inauguration speech on Tuesday. This omission was not surprising, given that the state faces a substantial and growing budget deficit.\n\nSeveral Republican governors, including Bill Haslam of Tennessee and those in Wyoming and North Carolina, have announced their support for some form of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, arguing that it is fiscally smart to accept the billions of dollars in federal aid.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Affirms No Contact from FBI in Email Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner in the 2016 presidential race, stated on Sunday that she has not been contacted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the ongoing investigation regarding her use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State.\n\nDuring an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Clinton told moderator Chuck Todd, \"No, no, they haven't.\" When asked if FBI agents had reached out to her. Clinton added, \"But, you know, back in August, we made clear that I'm happy to answer any questions that anybody might have. And I stand by that.\"\n\nClinton expressed no concern that the investigation may not be concluded by the time the Democratic National Convention takes place in July. \"No, I'm not,\" she said when asked about her apprehensions. \"Because I do not think anything inappropriate was done. And so I have to let them decide how to resolve their security inquiry, but I'm not at all worried about it.\"\n\nClinton reiterated that sending emails from a private server while serving as Secretary of State was a mistake. \"So let me just say again, I sent emails to government employees on their government accounts,\" Clinton said. \"I had every reason to believe they were in the government system. It was a matter of convenience. I've said repeatedly, it was not the best choice. It was a mistake. But I think that anybody who's actually looked at this has concluded that I have now put out all of my emails. Go and ask others for their emails. Ask everybody else who's in public office. I'm the one who's done it, and I did it because I thought it was the right thing to do.\"\n\nRegarding the possibility of debating her Democratic rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton expressed confidence but did not commit to a specific date. \"I'm not the one negotiating it, that's going on between our campaigns,\" Clinton said.\n\nSanders has been pressing Clinton to debate. Sanders, a Brooklyn native, believes he has a chance to win New York, while Clinton, a New York resident and former U.S. senator from the state, expects to carry the Empire State. Sanders also expressed confidence that there will be a debate before the primary, stating on ABC's This Week on Sunday that he is \"confident\" there will be a debate before the primary.",
    " Title: Cellphone Video Shows Alleged Police Misconduct in Minnesota Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nA cellphone video capturing an alleged instance of police misconduct has surfaced this week, featuring a black man identified as 28-year-old Christopher Lollie. The incident occurred in a public space in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota, where Lollie was waiting to pick up his young children from New Horizon Academy.\n\nIn the video, a female police officer approaches Lollie and asks him to identify himself. Lollie, who had been sitting in the public area for 10 minutes, protests that he is not required to provide his name as he had not broken any laws.\n\n\"The problem is I'm black,\" Lollie interrupts. \"It really is, because I'm not sitting there with a group of people. I'm sitting there by myself, not causing a problem.\"\n\nA second officer then approaches the two, and attempts to touch Lollie. \"I've got to go get my kids,\" Lollie says, growing upset. \"Please don't touch me.\"\n\n\"You're going to go to jail then,\" the second officer replies. \"I'm not your brother. Put your hands behind your back, otherwise it's going to get ugly.\"\n\nShortly thereafter, the phone gets knocked out of Lollie's hands as the cops cuff him. One can then hear the sound of a taser charging and Lollie's screams as the cops tase him.\n\nAccording to the police report, two officers, Michael Johnson and Bruce Schmidt, were called to the First National Bank Building \"on a report of an uncooperative male refusing to leave.\" The identity of the female officer involved in the incident has not been disclosed.\n\nLollie, who had been attending New Horizon for about 9 months at the time, said his children were not present during the incident as their mother had not arrived yet. However, Lollie's children's classmates and teacher witnessed the event, he said. \"The teacher actually gave me a witness statement, stating that 'he was calm, he was not doing anything wrong, he was talking to them, and they just started assaulting him,'\" he said.\n\nSince then, Lollie said he fought the charges and, due to the teacher's statement and the footage from the building's security cameras, all charges against him were dropped as of July 31.\n\nLollie stated that he did not want to post the video until the charges were dropped. \"It hurts, it really does,\" he said. \"Because no matter what -- I could be the nicest guy in the world, talk with respect, I can be working, taking care of my kids, doing everything the model citizen is supposed to do -- and I still get that type of treatment.\"",
    " Title: NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Defends Employee's Freedom of Speech Amidst China-NBA Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nTOKYO (AP) \u2014 NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has stated that the league is not apologizing for Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey's tweet supporting anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, despite China's state broadcaster canceling plans to show two preseason games later this week.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday at a news conference in Tokyo before a preseason game between the Rockets and NBA champion Toronto Raptors, Silver emphasized that Morey, as an employee of the Houston Rockets, has the right to freedom of expression.\n\n\"Daryl Morey, as general manager of the Houston Rockets, enjoys that right as one of our employees,\" Silver said. \"What I also tried to suggest is that I understand there are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.\"\n\nAmong those consequences, China's state broadcaster, CCTV, announced it would not show the games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets, which were scheduled to take place Thursday in Shanghai and Saturday in Shenzhen. Basketball is popular in China, and the two teams, particularly due to LeBron James' stardom for the Lakers and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's co-founder Joe Tsai's ownership of the Nets, would have likely been a significant television draw.\n\n\"We are strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver's claim to support Morey's right to freedom of expression,\" CCTV said in a statement. \"We believe that any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.\"\n\nThe broadcaster is also reviewing all its cooperation and exchanges involving the NBA, according to a statement posted to CCTV Sports' official social media account.\n\nThe NBA is not the first major corporation to face criticism from China over political differences. Mercedes-Benz, Delta Air Lines, hotel operator Marriott, fashion brand Zara, and others have also encountered conflicts with China in recent years.\n\nSilver is scheduled to visit Shanghai on Wednesday and hopes to meet with officials and some of the league's business partners there in an effort to find common ground. He expressed hope that Chinese officials and fans would consider the totality of the three-decade-plus relationship between the league and their country and acknowledge political differences between the countries.\n\n\"I'm sympathetic to our interests here and our partners that are upset,\" Silver said. \"I don't think it's inconsistent on one hand to be sympathetic to them and at the same time stand by our principles.\"\n\nSilver also stated that the NBA did not expect CCTV to cancel plans to show the Lakers-Nets games. \"But if those are the consequences of us adhering to our values, I still feel it's very, very important to adhere to those values,\" Silver said.\n\nThe rift between China and the NBA began late last week when Morey tweeted a now-deleted image that read: \"Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\" in reference to months of pro-democracy demonstrations in the semiautonomous Chinese territory that has been mired in escalating violence between protesters and law enforcement.\n\nEfforts were made to defuse the impact; Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta stated that Morey does not speak for the Rockets, and Morey returned to Twitter on Monday in an attempt to clarify his message. However, damage was clearly done: At least one Chinese sporting goods company said it was no longer cooperating with the Rockets, NBA streaming partner Tencent\u2014which has a $1.5 billion contract with the league over the next five seasons\u2014said it would not show Rockets games, and a sports news website in China said it was no longer covering the team.\n\nFurther complicating the matter is the fact that China's best-known basketball player, Hall of Famer Yao Ming, spent his NBA career with the Rockets. Yao is now the president of the Chinese Basketball Association, which has suspended its relationship with the Rockets as part of the response to Morey's tweet. The CBA also canceled plans for Houston and Dallas G League affiliates to play preseason games in China later this month.\n\n\"I'm hoping that together Yao Ming and I can find an accommodation,\" Silver said. \"But he is extremely hot at the moment, and I understand it.\"\n\nA ceremonial NBA Cares event for an educational center in Shanghai with the Nets was canceled Tuesday, though the Nets participated in other events as scheduled. The Lakers were arriving in Shanghai Tuesday. Silver stated that NBA Cares would still honor its larger mission surrounding that event, including providing a gift of new computers.\n\n\"How can it be possible to carry out exchanges and cooperation with China without knowing China's public opinion?\" Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday. \"NBA's cooperation with China has been going on for quite a long time, so for what should be said and what should be done, they know best.\"\n\nSilver also released a statement before his news conference, stating that \"those who question our motivation\" should know that the NBA's stance is about more than business. Many U.S. lawmakers have called for the league to take action\u2014some even suggesting the games in China should be canceled by the NBA.\n\n\"We are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression,\" Silver said. \"I regret\u2014again, having communicated directly with many friends in China\u2014that so many people are upset, including millions and millions of our fans. At the end of the day, we come with basketball as an opportunity to sell dreams, sell hopes...that we are causing disruption in people's lives and that we are causing disharmony, that's something I regret.\"",
    " Title: Controversial Remarks by Obamacare Architect Jonathan Gruber Raise Questions for Democrats Ahead of Supreme Court Review\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of controversial remarks made by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Jonathan Gruber, who was a key architect of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), Democrats are facing questions about his role in their defense strategy as they prepare for another Supreme Court review of the health care law.\n\nGruber's comments, which surfaced recently, have been criticized as suggesting that the health care bill was intentionally written in a complex manner to avoid being labeled a tax by the Congressional Budget Office and to pass through Congress more easily. In 2012, Gruber stated, \"Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage...[and] that was really, really critical to get the thing to pass.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who, as speaker in 2009, posted an Obamacare \"myth buster\" citing Gruber, distanced herself from him this week, stating, \"I don't know who he is...He didn't help write our bill.\" However, she added that Gruber's comments were a year old and he had recanted them.\n\nGruber's comments about the health care law's subsidies have also caused controversy. In legal briefs submitted last year to a federal district court in Virginia, Obama administration attorneys cited Gruber in a case defending their ability to pay subsidies to enrollees regardless of whether they are part of state-run or federally run health care exchanges.\n\nThe Supreme Court decided this month to take up the case, King v. Burwell, after the challengers lost to the administration in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Neither the Justice Department nor the White House responded to questions about Gruber and his role in their legal strategy.\n\nSam Kazman, general counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which is funding the administration's opponents in the King case, said Gruber's 2012 remarks about subsidies bolster their own arguments. Gruber at the time stated that subsidies would flow only to states that set up their own exchanges, which would mean consumers in most states wouldn't be eligible for subsidies, potentially puncturing a big hole in Obamacare.\n\nIn a parallel case before the D.C. Circuit, the administration tried to downplay Gruber in its latest court filings. On Nov. 3, the Justice Department stated in a footnote that \"post-enactment statements by a non-legislator are entitled to no weight.\"\n\nGruber has made hundreds of thousands of dollars off Obamacare, serving as a consultant to the Department of Health and Human Services and to states that used health care grant money to pay him for his services.\n\nTimothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University who closely tracks the health care law, stated, \"This whole thing just puzzles me...He wasn't a legislator. He didn't write the bill. He didn't vote on the bill.\"",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Proposed Rule on Short-Term Health Insurance Plans to Increase Coverage and Reduce Costs for Taxpayers, According to Urban Institute Study\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration's proposed rule to make it easier for Americans to access short-term, limited duration (STLD) health insurance plans, which are exempt from the Affordable Care Act's regulations, could increase the number of insured Americans by 1.7 million while reducing costs to taxpayers, according to a study by the Urban Institute.\n\nOn February 20, the Trump administration released a proposed rule that would repeal an October 2016 regulation that restricted the availability of STLD plans. The proposed rule would allow these plans to last up to a year and permit guaranteed renewal of enrollment beyond that.\n\nCongressional Democrats have criticized the Trump administration's move, arguing that the availability of affordable plans outside of the ACA's risk pool could deprive the exchanges of essential revenues from healthy enrollees and increase premiums for those who remain.\n\nHowever, the Urban Institute's study demonstrates that the trade-off associated with the policy would be small. According to the report, 7.4 million on the exchanges eligible for tax credits would see no change in premiums. Furthermore, 4.2 million would enroll in STLD plans, whose premiums would be far below those for plans currently available on the exchanges.\n\nWhile there are roughly similar numbers of winners and losers, the scale of benefits far exceeds the costs. The report also estimates that Trump's proposal would reduce the number of uninsured Americans by 1.7 million, a finding the report buries by grouping those enrolled in STLD plans together with the truly uninsured.\n\nIn terms of the net fiscal impact of STLD deregulation, the Urban Institute finds that the reform would slightly reduce federal spending on health care for the nonelderly by $686 million, or 0.2 percent. These empirical findings suggest that the deregulation of STLD plans overall substantially reduces the cost of health insurance, covers more people, and slightly reduces the burden on taxpayers.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Lifts Ban on Lawsuits Against Foreign Companies Over Confiscated Cuban Properties\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration will allow lawsuits in U.S. courts for the first time against foreign companies that use properties confiscated by the Cuban government since Fidel Castro's revolution six decades ago. The policy shift, to be announced on Wednesday, could expose U.S., European, and Canadian companies to legal action and potentially harm Cuba's efforts to attract foreign investment.\n\nThe decision, explained by a senior U.S. official on Tuesday, is another sign of Washington's efforts to punish Havana over its support for Venezuela's socialist president, Nicolas Maduro. President Donald Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, will detail the administration's decision in a speech in Miami and announce new sanctions on Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, countries he has branded a \"troika of tyranny.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether such property claims will be acceptable in U.S. courts, and the European Union has already warned it could lodge a challenge with the World Trade Organization. The complete lifting of the ban could allow billions of dollars in legal claims to move forward in U.S. courts and likely antagonize Canada and Europe, whose companies have significant business holdings in Cuba.\n\nThe Cuban government did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the country's National Assembly, meeting over the weekend, declared the Helms-Burton Act \"illegitimate, unenforceable, and without legal effect.\" Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel criticized the United States for attempting to \"activate the hateful Helms-Burton Law,\" which he said aims to return Cuba to a state of being a \"slave nation of another empire.\"\n\nU.S.-Cuban relations have deteriorated since Trump became president in early 2017. A six-decade U.S. economic embargo on Cuba has remained officially intact. The Trump administration's decision follows threats by top aides to take actions against Cuba to force it to abandon Maduro, something Havana has insisted it will not do.\n\nThe administration will also begin full enforcement of Helms-Burton's Title IV, which requires the denial of U.S. visas to those involved in \"trafficking\" confiscated properties in Cuba. Among the foreign companies heavily invested in Cuba are Canadian mining firm Sherritt International Corp and Spain's Melia Hotels International SA. U.S. companies, including airlines and cruise companies, have forged business deals in Cuba since the easing of restrictions under former President Barack Obama.\n\nDefending the decision, the U.S. official said allowing lawsuits would cause only a \"bump\" in the business world but send a message of U.S. resolve against Havana. The administration is considering a range of options, including sanctions against senior Cuban military and intelligence officials over their role in Venezuela and the tightening of limits on U.S. trade with the island.",
    " Title: House Republicans, Senate Democrats Reach Budget Agreement, Face Backlash from Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan budget agreement negotiated between House Republicans and Senate Democrats on Wednesday has faced criticism from tea party groups and fiscal conservatives, prompting an unusually strong response from House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican. The deal, which was struck a day earlier by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, and Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, Washington Democrat, has been met with mixed reviews, with some industries and interests emerging as winners, while others have been labeled as losers.\n\nThe deficit-cutting deal, which includes some sweeteners for defense contractors and oil drillers, has been criticized for raising taxes in the form of higher fees, failing to restrain entitlement programs, and permitting new spending in the short term in exchange for vague promises of long-term cuts.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican, stated that Republicans sacrificed their biggest point of leverage - the tough \"sequester\" spending cuts that were already in force - in the rush to get a short-term deal that did not address the long-term costs of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bulk of the plan's deficit reduction would come in the final three years of the deal, while the new spending would happen over the next two years. The estimate followed news that the U.S. government ran a $135.2 billion budget deficit through the first two months of the year - well short of the $226.8 billion deficit the nation had built up by this time a year ago.\n\nThe Ryan-Murray agreement increases spending in 2014 to $1.012 trillion and in 2015 to $1.014 trillion and restores more than $60 billion in sequester spending cuts. The new spending is offset in part by lowering the cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees, requiring higher pension contributions from recently hired federal employees, and raising fees on travelers collected by the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nIndustries and interests that emerged as winners in the final deal included the Pentagon and the defense industry, where much of the defense-related sequester cuts were restored, and the energy industry, which won expanded rights for joint drilling along the U.S.-Mexico border and in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIndustries and interests that emerged as losers in the final deal were quick to make their unhappiness known. The National Treasury Employees Union launched a pre-emptive strike against the proposal, saying federal employees had suffered enough under pay freezes and furloughs. The National Nurses United took issue with the cuts aimed at federal workers, especially nurses working in Veterans Affairs hospitals.\n\nMany liberal lawmakers said the federal budget should not be balanced on the backs of federal workers and that the bill could have trouble passing if it does not extend unemployment insurance for the 1.3 million Americans who are set to get kicked off the rolls before the end of the year.\n\nDespite conservative unhappiness and tepid reviews from many House Democrats, the proposal could be voted on in the House as early as Thursday, and Mr. Ryan said Wednesday on CNN that he is confident he has the votes to pass the bill. Mr. Boehner used unusually pointed language in hitting back at conservative opponents of the deal, charging that critics opposed the agreement even before knowing what was in it.",
    " Title: Suspect in New York and New Jersey Bombings Captured in Shootout with Police\n\nArticle:\n\nAuthorities have apprehended Ahmad Khan Rahami, the primary person of interest in the Saturday night blast in New York's Chelsea neighborhood and the explosions in New Jersey's Seaside Park on Saturday morning and a foiled bomb attack Sunday night near a train station in Elizabeth, NJ. The capture occurred after a gun battle with police that was initiated when officers found Rahami, a 28-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, sleeping in the doorway of a bar in Linden, NJ.\n\nThe manhunt for Rahami began Monday morning as part of a dragnet launched by officials in search of the suspect. A bar owner in Linden spotted a man sleeping in his doorway and called the police. An officer confronted the man around 10:45 a.m., and soon recognized him as Rahami, officials said. Rahami pulled out a gun and shot the officer, identified by the Linden mayor's office as Angel Padilla, in the abdomen. Padilla was wearing a bulletproof vest.\n\nA second police officer, identified as Investigator Pete Hammer, had a bullet graze his head. Both officers were expected to recover. Rahami was shot at least once in the leg and was eventually brought down and captured alive, Union County Prosecutor Grace Park said. He was taken to University Hospital in Newark where he underwent surgery.\n\nRahami was charged late Monday in Union County with five counts of attempted murder of a police officer. He was being held on $5.2 million bail and remained at a hospital. It was not known if Rahami had an attorney, as messages left with phone numbers listed for family members by the Associated Press were not returned. Federal charges in the bombings have yet to be filed.\n\nLinden, the city where Rahami was captured, is about four miles from Elizabeth, where Rahami was last known to have lived. The FBI conducted a raid at his apartment, located above a fried chicken restaurant, on Monday morning. Elizabeth is also the city where investigators discovered five suspicious devices, one of which exploded while a bomb squad robot tried to disarm it, near a train station on Sunday night.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio noted during a Monday news conference that authorities were not currently searching for any other suspects. The assistant director of the FBI's field office in New York, William Sweeney Jr., said \"there is no indication that there's a cell\" in the area.\n\nFollowing the Chelsea explosion, which injured 29 people, on West 23rd Street at 8:30 p.m. on Saturday, police found a second, unexploded device four blocks away. The device was described as a pressure cooker with wires and a phone attached. The contraption, which bore a resemblance to the bomb used in the 2013 Boston Marathon attack, was placed in a plastic bag.\n\nAuthorities found Rahami's fingerprint on the unexploded bomb discovered on West 27th Street. Authorities were still searching for two people who removed that bomb from a duffle bag after it had allegedly been placed on the street by Rahami. The pair placed the device in a plastic bag and then walked off with the duffel bag. Police said the individuals were only considered witnesses.\n\nThe Chelsea bombing came 11 hours after a pipe bomb exploded about 80 miles south in a New Jersey garbage can near the route of a charity 5K race. That explosion occurred in Seaside Park, a borough about 60 miles from Elizabeth. No one was injured in that blast. Runners were slated to be near the location of the explosion when it went off, but the race was delayed after an unattended backpack was discovered.\n\nAuthorities said the New York and New Jersey bombs used flip phones as detonators. Several media outlets also reported the New York bombs contained shrapnel consisting of ball bearings and BBs. Local and federal officials said Rahami had not been on law enforcement's radar before the explosions, and the FBI said they had no knowledge of Rahami receiving any weapons or explosives training overseas.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg Clash Over Campaign Financing During CNN Town Hall\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring a CNN town hall on Tuesday night, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders criticized fellow candidate Michael Bloomberg's wealth and his decision not to contest in the early primary states, while declining to indicate whether he would accept financial support from Bloomberg in the general election.\n\nCNN's Anderson Cooper introduced the topic, stating, \"Tomorrow night, for the first time, you'll be on a debate stage with the former mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, perhaps you've heard this. Two polls out today show that he's your closest competition.\" Cooper then asked Sanders if he considered Bloomberg the biggest threat to his nomination.\n\nSanders responded, \"This is what I do know and this I feel very strongly about. You know, Mr. Bloomberg has every right in the world to run for president of the United States. He's an American citizen. But I don't think he has the right to buy this election... I think it's a bit obscene that we have somebody who, by the way, chose not to contest in Iowa, in Nevada, in South Carolina, in New Hampshire where all of the candidates \u2013 we did town meetings, we were talking to thousands and thousands of people, working hard \u2013 he said, 'I don't have to do that. I'm worth $60 billion. I have more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans. I'll buy the presidency.'\"\n\nLater in the town hall, an audience member asked Sanders if he would accept help from billionaires like Bloomberg if nominated, to which Sanders declined to answer the question multiple times.\n\nSanders differentiated his campaign financing from Bloomberg's, stating that he has received more campaign contributions, 7 million, from more Americans, 1.5 million, than any candidate in the history of the United States. He added that his average contribution is $18.50 and that his campaign is building the strongest grassroots movement in the modern history of the country.\n\nCooper pressed Sanders on the issue, asking if he would accept money from Bloomberg if he did not win the nomination. Sanders responded that he would support the democratic nominee vigorously, but did not commit to accepting financial support from Bloomberg.\n\nCooper followed up, asking if Sanders would accept the money or not if Bloomberg offered it. Sanders responded that he had already stated his position, which is that if Bloomberg wins, he will support the democratic nominee. Cooper then asked if Sanders was unsure if he would take the money or not, to which Sanders refused to answer, and Cooper concluded the discussion.",
    " Title: House Republicans Propose Plan to Address Potential Obamacare Subsidy Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republicans have outlined a plan to maintain the current level of subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) for all beneficiaries, regardless of their state of residence. The plan, which is still in development, allows states to opt out of Obamacare starting in 2016, with the option to receive block grants to manage their residents' health insurance as they see fit.\n\nThe block grants and subsidies, including those for states that remain in Obamacare, will expire in 2017, necessitating the replacement of the law by the next president and Congress. The Supreme Court is currently considering a case that could rule on the legality of the subsidies, with a decision expected as early as Thursday.\n\nRepublicans in the House have been working to finalize a plan in response to the potential Supreme Court ruling. Representative Charles W. Boustany Jr. (Louisiana Republican) described the plan as a \"good start.\" Senate Republicans are also discussing their own plans, including extending subsidies through 2017 and allowing states to opt out of Obamacare if the subsidies are discontinued.\n\nThe GOP-led Congress has been critical of the Affordable Care Act, with some members advocating for the repeal of its insurance mandates on individuals and employers. The House proposal, which has not been finalized, would repeal these mandates, a move that is likely to be met with opposition from supporters of Obamacare who argue that the mandates are crucial for balancing risk pools and keeping premiums manageable.\n\nThe House plan would use a budget process known as \"reconciliation\" to pass the legislation, allowing it to bypass a filibuster in the Senate and pass with a simple majority. However, the president could still veto the plan. Some lawmakers have expressed reservations about extending the subsidies beyond the current year, fearing it sends the wrong message to voters after years of efforts to repeal the entire law.\n\nThe Supreme Court case, known as King v. Burwell, challenges the legality of providing subsidies in states that did not establish their own health insurance exchanges. The administration argues that the subsidies were intended to cover all residents, while opponents claim they were meant to exclude states that did not set up their own exchanges. More than 6 million Americans could lose subsidies if the court rules against the administration.",
    " Title: U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry Addresses Allegations of Secret Iranian Uranium Enrichment Facility\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry has stated that a potential nuclear deal with Iran could be jeopardized if recent allegations from the Iranian dissident group, National Coalition of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), regarding a secret uranium enrichment operation at a facility near Tehran prove to be true.\n\nDuring a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Wednesday, Mr. Kerry revealed that U.S. officials were aware of the site prior to this week, but it has not been identified as a nuclear facility. He stated, \"It is a facility that we are well aware of, which is on a list of facilities we have. I\u2019m not going to go into greater detail.\"\n\nMr. Kerry added, \"But these things are obviously going to have to be resolved as we go forward.\"\n\nThe NCRI claimed on Tuesday that the underground facility, known as \"Lavizan-3,\" has been used for clandestine nuclear research since 2008 and for uranium enrichment with advanced IR-2m and IR-4 centrifuge machines. The veracity of the NCRI's claim was not immediately verifiable, and the group has a controversial history in Washington. However, the group is known for having deep sources inside Iran's nuclear community and is credited with making game-changing revelations about Tehran's activities in the past.\n\nNotably, during the early 2000s, similar NCRI claims exposed the existence of Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment facility and the Arak heavy-water plutonium facility, two operations that have been at the center of international scrutiny and distrust of Tehran since then.\n\nRep. Brad Sherman (D-California) noted to Mr. Kerry on Wednesday that \"the MEK sometimes gives us accurate information.\" Mr. Sherman added, \"They are the ones that told the world about the Iranian nuclear program. They now say that there\u2019s a secret facility at Lavazza 3.\"",
    " Title: South Korea's Response to Coronavirus Outshines China's: Transparency, Testing, and Civil Society\n\nArticle:\n\nSouth Korea's approach to managing the coronavirus outbreak has been hailed as a success story, contrasting with China's response, which has been criticized for denial, cover-ups, and missteps. The South Korean government, in collaboration with its civil society, has implemented a strategy focusing on education, transparency, and mobilizing citizens, without resorting to China's tactics of mass home detention, forced labor, or censorship.\n\nSouth Korea's most effective weapon against the virus has been rapid and extensive testing. The country is currently testing 15,000 people daily, according to government figures, with 210,000 South Koreans tested since January 3, compared to approximately 6,500 tests completed in the United States by Tuesday morning. South Korea's testing has resulted in a reported 7,513 confirmed cases and 54 deaths, a mortality rate of 0.71 percent.\n\nThe number of daily confirmed cases has been steadily declining, from 686 on March 2 to just 131 on Tuesday, according to government figures. The government has deployed 53 drive-through sample collection stations, allowing drivers to get tested without physical contact with anyone.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in stated on March 1 that the government is waging an \"all-out response\" after raising the crisis alert to the highest level. South Korea's civil society has voluntarily pitched in, with major events canceled, church services moved online, and citizens avoiding the city of Daegu, where the majority of cases are, without turning the entire city into a prison.\n\nSome of South Korea's measures have been controversial, such as tracking confirmed coronavirus patients using GPS and creating a live map of their locations without their names. However, this approach seems less invasive than the use of surveillance drones to take people's temperatures and spray disinfectant, as is being done in several parts of China.\n\nTo stop the export of the virus, South Korea has implemented a three-step detection system at Incheon International Airport, with extra screening measures for passengers headed to the United States. Seoul aims to give other countries confidence in doing business with South Korea and admitting South Koreans. The focus is on transparency and openness, not Beijing's pattern of distortion and distraction.\n\nThe World Health Organization's joint mission report with China credited Beijing for mobilizing government agencies and devoting scientific attention to the problem. However, the report also noted that the Chinese people, not their government, deserve much of the credit for the country's exceptional containment measures.\n\nImagine if Beijing had practiced openness, transparency, and public education seven or eight weeks earlier. The epidemic might never have become as severe as it is now. While China's draconian police-state measures may work, only if one ignores the massive suffering they cause.\n\nSouth Korea's response is stronger because it is open to criticism and examination. This openness is likely to improve South Korea's economic situation faster, along with its public health. The approach is also working politically for President Moon Jae-in. Trump might want to consider this before stating that the coronavirus will \"just go away,\" as he did on Tuesday.\n\nDemocracies strike a balance between personal liberty and government responsibility. South Korea's values are not what make them vulnerable; they are what make them strong. The only thing they have to do is live up to them.",
    " Title: FBI Interview Summaries Suggest Attempt at Email Classification Deal Between State Department and Clinton Aides\n\nArticle:\n\nDocuments released by the FBI as part of interview summaries surrounding the Clinton emails case suggest an attempt at a deal between Patrick Kennedy, a senior aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Bureau, whereby classified emails on Clinton's unsecured bathroom server would have their status altered in Clinton's favor in exchange for more favorable treatment of FBI officials in overseas postings at embassies.\n\nAccording to a report by The Weekly Standard's Stephen Hayes, a senior FBI official in the international operations division described conversations with Kennedy about the classification of emails. The official stated that his section of the FBI had attempted to contact Kennedy repeatedly over several months in the spring of 2015, but Kennedy did not return the calls.\n\nIn the late spring or early summer of 2015, the FBI official reported to work to find a note indicating that Kennedy had called. According to the FBI summary, Kennedy wanted help. The FBI official spoke with Kennedy and Kennedy raised the possibility of keeping at least one Clinton email from public disclosure by obtaining a \"B9\" exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, a rarely used exemption that refers to \"geological and geophysical information and data.\"\n\nOne email in particular concerned Kennedy, and according to the FBI summary, providing a B9 exemption \"would allow him to archive the document in the basement of the Department of State never to be seen again.\" The FBI official told Kennedy that he would look into the email if Kennedy would authorize a pending request for additional FBI personnel in Iraq.\n\nA summary of an interview with the section chief of the FBI records management division provides further evidence of Kennedy's attempts to have the classification of some sensitive emails changed. The FBI records official, whose job includes making determinations on classification, told investigators that he was approached by his colleague in international operations after the initial discussion with Kennedy. The FBI records official says that his colleague \"pressed\" him to declassify an email \"in exchange for a quid pro quo,\" according to the interview summary. \"In exchange for making the email unclassified, State would reciprocate by allowing the FBI to place more agents in countries where they are presently forbidden.\" The request was denied.\n\nThe FBI has \"explained\" these events by saying that the bargained-for exchange never took place, and the FBI agent with whom Kennedy was communicating has since retired. State Department spokesman Mark Toner made the absurd claim that these conversations were a \"normal part of the classification process\" \u2014 as though it's \"normal\" to reclassify documents that are part of an investigation into criminal misuse of state secrets in favor of the governing party's presidential nominee.\n\nThis isn't acceptable, to be charitable. This communication took place amid Hillary's denials that any classified material was sent or received on her email, which her former employees still working at State \u2014 including Kennedy \u2014 knew to be a lie. And rather than give the public the truth, which wouldn't come out until much later, after she had won the Democrat nomination, Kennedy was working to remedy her false denials by making a lie true.\n\nFurthermore, he was offering essentially a bribe to the FBI in order to procure more favorable field on which the Clinton email investigation would play out. This isn't some ho-hum bureaucratic deal-making at work \u2014 or if it is, it illuminates precisely how like the Third World the corruption in Washington has become.\n\nConsider what would happen if the middle manager or legal counsel at XYZ Corporation, whose CEO is under FBI investigation, were to offer perks and valuables to FBI agents individually or collectively as a quid pro quo for a reframing of the investigation. We all know how that would go \u2014 the charges would pile up, the offender in question would be quickly dismissed, the corporation would be dragged through the mud, and the CEO would be accused of directing the attempted bribe.\n\nIn this case, there is no evidence Hillary Clinton was behind Kennedy's offers \u2014 but we also don't know how hard investigators have looked. After all, this horse-trading didn't happen when Hillary was wrapping up her affairs at State in 2012; it happened last year when the FBI investigation was ramping up. One assumes Kennedy understood the stakes at hand, and one assumes he's smart enough to know how best to butter his own bread as a Clintonite.\n\nAnd given Kennedy's role as the Clintons' fixer at State, you would expect that he would be the primary individual put to the squeeze in any investigation of the email scandal. Kennedy, after all, was involved in the questionable political hiring of Clinton IT tech Bryan Pagliano to a nonpolitical State Department job; Pagliano was the man who set up Hillary's private server and ended up getting immunity in the investigation.\n\nBut yes \u2014 Toner and the rest of the Democrat stooges disguised as federal bureaucrats are correct. For those of us rubes in the hinterlands, this might seem a flagrant example of an out-of-control government, but for our betters inside the Beltway, it's a Tuesday. And they wonder why we increasingly recoil from consent to be governed by them.",
    " Title: Raheem Kassam and Laura Loomer Discuss Social Media Censorship at CPAC\n\nArticle:\n\nRaheem Kassam, a former editor for Breitbart and a fellow at the Claremont Institute, discussed the Left's campaign to silence conservative voices on social media at the 46th annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Kassam's temporary Facebook ban this week, which he believes was an attempt to intimidate him, has gained attention, with Donald Trump Jr. tweeting in support.\n\nKassam, the author of \"No Go Zones: How Sharia Law Is Coming to a Neighborhood Near You,\" sees the social-media crackdown on conservatives as evidence that the Left is frightened. \"If the other side wasn't afraid, they wouldn't be coming down so heavy-handed on people,\" Kassam said in an interview near Radio Row at CPAC.\n\nKassam anticipates that if President Trump is re-elected next year, there will be serious legislation about this issue, potentially in the form of a Digital Bill of Rights. The suppression of online free speech has become apparent, with instances such as Instagram (owned by Facebook) deleting a post by Donald Trump Jr. in February.\n\nAnti-conservative censorship online has escalated, with major social media platforms targeting prominent conservatives for censorship. In 2016, Twitter banned Stacy McCain's account without providing a reason, and since then, the Left's online suppression of dissent has increased.\n\nLaura Loomer, a Trump supporter who was banned from Twitter in November after criticizing newly elected Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar, discussed her role in a recent investigation of Omar at a CPAC press conference. Loomer asserted that pressure from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which has connections to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, was responsible for Twitter's banning her.\n\nLoomer also shared a brief video interview with Donald Trump Jr. at CPAC, which she posted to her Instagram account. In the interview, Trump Jr. responded to Loomer's question about taking action against social-media censorship by saying, \"It's time.\"\n\nIf Kassam's analysis is correct, the recent campaign of online censorship may signal that leftists in Big Tech are acting out of fear that they are losing the Internet battle against Trump's supporters. The stakes in this issue could not be higher, as the suppression of free speech online has significant implications for the 2020 presidential campaign and the future of political discourse.",
    " Title: Kentucky Senate Candidates Dodge Questions in Debate, Raising Questions About Political Calculus\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the first and only debate for the marquee Kentucky race for the U.S. Senate, incumbent Republican Mitch McConnell and his Democratic challenger, Alison Lundergan Grimes, each evaded a high-profile question from the moderator. The question about their evasions is: What is the political calculus behind it, and will it hurt them?\n\nThe debate's focus on evasion began with Ms. Grimes, the Kentucky Secretary of State, who, in an interview with The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Ky., refused to answer a question about whether she voted for President Obama four times.\n\nSenator McConnell, who is unpopular in Kentucky, has equated Grimes with the president. In the newspaper interview, she danced around the simple question, saying the election is not about the president but about jobs, and that she was a delegate in 2008 for Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nGrimes was criticized from both the left and the right, and the left-leaning host of NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Chuck Todd, said she \"disqualified herself.\"\n\nOn Monday, Grimes provided a more detailed response, explaining that, as secretary of state in charge of elections, she has to stand up for the right to a secret ballot. \"If I, as chief election official, don't stand up for that right, who in Kentucky will?\" she asked KET television moderator Bill Goodman.\n\nIn the past, Grimes has said she voted for Mrs. Clinton in the 2008 primary. The downside of revealing her vote now is that her words can be used in a McConnell ad against her.\n\n\"Grimes apparently has made the calculation that it's better to not answer the question than it is to answer it and have the words 'I voted for Obama' used against her in a seven-figure television ad buy,\" said Courier-Journal political reporter Joseph Gerth in an email.\n\nSome argue that Grimes' evasion is not significant, as her voting for Mr. Obama is assumed. \"Sometimes candidates get a question where there is no winning answer, and they are better off just letting it ride,\" says Stephen Voss, a political scientist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington.\n\nSimilar evasion was observed in Senator McConnell's response to a question about climate change, a relevant issue in a state that relies on the coal industry for electricity and jobs. In the past, the senator has remarked, \"I'm not a scientist,\" so he cannot delve into climate change's causes.\n\nWhen asked on Monday whether he stands by his \"not a scientist\" position and whether he believes in discussing climate change, the senator brushed past the question.\n\n\"There are a bunch of scientists who feel that this is a problem,\" he answered. However, the main thing to understand is that his job is \"to fight for coal jobs in our state, and this administration has destroyed 7,000 of them,\" he added.\n\nMcConnell's political calculus is similar to Grimes's. He \"has decided that not answering whether climate change is man-made is better than siding against the fossil fuel industry that has contributed millions to his political committees, or siding with climate-change deniers,\" says Mr. Gerth.\n\nSome observers think this deflection doesn't matter much, either. The reason is that the two candidates are both pro-coal, so \"this isn't a voting issue,\" says Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community at the University of Kentucky in Lexington.\n\n\"The whole question of climate gets ignored because they're both embracing coal,\" Mr. Cross explains.",
    " Title: Obama's Israel Visit: A Trust-Building Trip Amidst Tension and Peace Process\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama landed in Israel this morning, marking his first visit to the country as president. During a welcoming ceremony at Tel Aviv airport, Obama stated, \"I see this visit as an opportunity to reaffirm the unbreakable bond between our nations, to restate America's unwavering commitment to Israel's security, and to speak directly to the people of Israel and to your neighbors.\"\n\nNPR's Larry Abramson, who is at the airport, reported that Obama was welcomed by Israeli President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The leaders reaffirmed the \"unbreakable alliance\" between the countries, according to Larry.\n\nObama is currently on a tour of Israel's Iron Dome, the country's missile defense system, which the United States has helped fund. Later today, he will head to Jerusalem, and tomorrow, he will cross into Ramallah in the West Bank.\n\nThe New York Times reports that Obama does not arrive in the region with grand plans to revive stalled peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians. Instead, the president is seeking to make a connection with the Israeli people, many of whom view him with a jaundiced eye after four years in which he sparred with Mr. Netanyahu over issues like Iran and the Jewish settlements in the West Bank.\n\nThe highlight of the trip will be a speech Obama will deliver to students at the Jerusalem International Convention Center on Thursday. The Washington Post reports the president is expected to reassure Israel of the United States' commitment to its security as Israel \"seeks to counter threats from Iran and protect its people in the midst of civil war in neighboring Syria.\"\n\nLarry described this as a \"trust-building visit.\" He said, \"Even though both sides insist there are no problems between the two countries, the fact is there has been some tension.\"\n\nPresident Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently concluded a 45-minute press conference where they addressed the peace process, Iran, and Syria. During the press conference, President Obama was asked by NBC's Chuck Todd why peace talks stalled during his first term. Obama responded, \"I did not promise to bring peace to the Middle East; instead, I said I would start on the process immediately.\"\n\nNetanyahu was asked directly whether Israel and the United States believed that Iran was a year away from producing a nuclear weapon. Netanyahu said the countries \"share information and we share the same assessment on the schedule.\"\n\nPresident Obama stated that \"each country has to make its own decision\" when it comes to war. However, he believed that on the question of Iran, there was \"still time to solve this diplomatically.\"\n\nOn Syria, President Obama defended the United States, saying it has done a lot to try to bring the conflict to a resolution. \"I have made clear the use of chemical weapons is a game changer,\" Obama said. His team, he added, is currently trying to assess whether the Syrian government has used those weapons.\n\n\"Israel will have no greater friend than the United States,\" President Obama said during an appearance with Israeli President Shimon Peres. Peres, for his part, told Obama that his vision of peace for the region can be accomplished. He said he believed Obama when he said, \"peace is not only a wish but a possibility.\"\n\nObama and Peres met at Peres' presidential home and discussed the Arab Spring, Iran, and the peace process. They opened their meeting with a planting ceremony. Obama brought Peres a magnolia tree from the White House garden. \"This is the work of generations,\" Obama said about peace. He framed that quote with a story from the Talmud about Honi and the carob tree. The tree yields carobs 70 years after it's planted. So what's the point of planting one, if you may never eat its fruits? Honi asks a man. The man tells him that when he came into the world, his father and grandfathers had planted carob trees for him to enjoy. The man said he was planting carob trees for his children and grandchildren.",
    " Title: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Approves Pompeo's Nomination for Secretary of State\n\nArticle:\n\nMike Pompeo, the current CIA director, won a favorable vote on Monday from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, paving the way for his confirmation as secretary of state as early as this week. The unexpected support came after Senator Rand Paul, who had previously been opposed to Pompeo, changed his stance following personal appeals from President Donald Trump.\n\nSenator Paul's surprising change of heart on Pompeo came after multiple conversations with Trump and assurances that the nominee views the war in Iraq as a mistake and wants to wind down the U.S. presence in Afghanistan. In a statement, Paul stated, \"President Trump believes that Iraq was a mistake, that regime change has destabilized the region, and that we must end our involvement with Afghanistan. Having received assurances from President Trump and Director Pompeo that he agrees with the president on these important issues, I have decided to support his nomination to be our next Secretary of State.\"\n\nTrump praised Paul after the libertarian's change of heart on Pompeo, according to a pool report, saying Paul \"never let me down.\" The final vote count on Pompeo's nomination in the committee was 11-9, with Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) agreeing to vote \"present\" to expedite the nominee's progress to the floor.\n\nSenator Paul's change of position on Pompeo, whom he had indicated he would oppose as recently as last Thursday, came minutes before the nominee's scheduled vote in the committee. Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) appealed to potential Pompeo supporters by observing that the nominee, a veteran House Republican, has forged a notably close bond with Trump.\n\nPompeo is expected to win confirmation from the full Senate later this week with unified GOP support and backing from a handful of vulnerable Democrats. Among the Democrats who have announced their support for Pompeo are Senators Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).\n\nActivists on the left who have pushed Democrats to oppose Pompeo, citing his past statements regarding Islamic leaders and other politically volatile stances, lauded the committee's minority for staying united in opposition. Elizabeth Beavers, foreign policy manager at the liberal group Indivisible, said in a statement, \"We were glad to see Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hold firm and say that an Islamophobic, anti-woman, climate change-denying, pro-torture war hawk is an unacceptable choice to serve as our country\u2019s secretary of state.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Military Bases Increase Security Levels Due to Terror Threats\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense has increased the security conditions at military bases across the country to \"Force Protection Bravo\" due to growing concerns about terror threats, officials confirmed to CNN on Friday. This level is the third-highest threat level on a five-tier scale used by the Department of Defense.\n\nThe announcement was not a response to a specific threat but rather a result of several recent incidents, U.S. military officials stated. One such incident involved a jihadist linked to the Garland attack tweeting the name and address of a U.S. military officer connected to the military's Syrian rebel training program.\n\nThe tweet, published on an account connected to British-born jihadist Junaid Hussain, was sent out a few days before the attack on a cartoon exhibit and appeared to encourage an attack on the address. Hussain is believed to have been messaging with Elton Simpson, one of the two attackers of the Texas event, and had been urging Simpson to take action.\n\nThis followed the publishing of the names and addresses of about 100 military members on ISIS-connected accounts several weeks ago. FBI Director James Comey stated on Thursday that there are thousands of ISIS followers online in the U.S.\n\n\"We have a general concern, obviously, that ISIL is focusing on the uniformed military and law enforcement,\" Comey told reporters on Thursday.\n\nThe order to upgrade the threat level was signed by Admiral William Gortney, head of the U.S. Northern Command, which oversees all U.S. military installations in the continental U.S. The security order affects 3,200 sites, including bases, National Guard facilities, recruiting stations, and health clinics, a Pentagon official said.\n\nCaptain Jeff Davis, spokesman for the U.S. Northern Command, or NORTHCOM, stated, \"We have the same concern about the potential threat posed by violent homegrown extremists.\" The change in threat level status could mean more checks of vehicles entering bases and more thorough identity checks of all personnel.\n\nThe order to raise the force protection level to Bravo also applies to all National Guard installations, recruiting stations, and ROTC detachments. However, a U.S. military official acknowledges it will be difficult for the ROTC detachments to do much more than security awareness.\n\nIn addition, security was recently raised at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, in response to a perceived threat to the base security. The threat was never deemed credible, but it came after another security concern at a base in Delaware used by Vice President Joe Biden when he flies home.\n\nOn Friday, Wright-Patterson announced that the Air Force museum, which is part of the base, was canceling a planned Friday night concert and was stopping tours that were regularly offered until further notice. The base said this was \"due to elevated security measures.\"\n\nSince NORTHCOM was established in October 2002, the threat level has reached Bravo on four occasions: Feb. 9, 2003, amid concerns al Qaeda was planning attacks on American targets; Dec. 21, 2003, when officials were concerned about attacks during the holiday season; May 1, 2011, in the aftermath of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden; and the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. It reached \"Delta,\" its highest level, on Sept. 11, 2001, Pentagon officials told CNN at the time.",
    " Title: Photographer Ellen Shub's Work and the Alteration of a Historical Photograph at the National Archives\n\nArticle:\n\nLast month, photographer Ellen Shub passed away at the age of seventy-three near Boston. Known for her work as a chronicler of social protest, Shub's photographs, published in alternative and movement media, served as a historical record of protests and demonstrations throughout the years.\n\nIn 1975, Shub captured a photograph of a woman holding a placard that read \"No more back room back alley abortions.\" In 1981, at a Boston rally for the Equal Rights Amendment, she photographed a woman with a sign that read \"59c\" \u2013 the amount of money a woman made for every dollar earned by a man. In 2004, during the Republican National Convention in New York, Shub took a picture of a protester with a large sign that read \"Dissent is the highest form of patriotism \u2013 Thomas Jefferson.\" In 2014, at a rally in Boston, she photographed a young man holding a sign that said \"# Icantbreathe.\"\n\nShub's intention in taking such text-centric pictures was to create a historical record. Her medium was photographs published in alternative media, including gay and lesbian newspapers, feminist newspapers, and city weeklies. These papers served as amendments to the historical narrative, providing a record of what was also said, also written, and also seen.\n\nRecently, the Washington Post reported that the National Archives had altered a photograph from the 2017 Women's March on Washington. The word \"Trump\" was blurred on a sign that originally read \"God Hates Trump.\" In other signs in the same picture, the words \"vagina\" and \"pussy\" were removed.\n\nIn response to the Post's initial inquiry, the Archives offered two arguments and one excuse. The excuse was that the altered photograph was not part of a current exhibition at the Archives, tracing a hundred years of the suffragist movement, but merely a display that advertised the show. The arguments were that the words referring to female anatomy may strike visitors as \"inappropriate\" and, separately, that the Archives are a \"non-partisan, non-political federal agency.\"\n\nThe altered photograph, from the 2017 Women's March on Washington, on display at the National Archives Research Center, on January 17th. Photograph by Salwan Georges / The Washington Post / Getty\n\nThe Post and others who picked up the story noted that the director of the Archives, David S. Ferriero, was appointed by Obama. This is an important point, as it provides a measure of how far we, as a society, have drifted under President Donald Trump. By the third anniversary of his inauguration, an organization created for the purpose of creating a historical record\u2014and headed by someone who is not a Trump appointee\u2014has falsified the historical record.\n\nHannah Arendt, in her 1967 essay on truth and politics, warned of the danger of trying to create politics in the absence of shared reality. She wrote, \"Facts and events are infinitely more fragile things than axioms, discoveries, theories\u2014even the most wildly speculative ones\u2014produced by the human mind; they occur in the field of the ever-changing affairs of men, in whose flux there is nothing more permanent than the admittedly relative permanence of the human mind's structure.\" In the case of the National Archives and the Women's March, a swift media reaction was probably instrumental in correcting the record\u2014if that is actually the outcome of whatever remedies the Archives has selected. However, Arendt warns us that history lost, even if only temporarily, is still, indeed, memory lost.",
    " Title: Ecuador Delays Decision on Edward Snowden's Asylum Request for Up to Two Months\n\nArticle:\n\nThe former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden remains in transit at a Moscow airport, according to Russian officials, as Ecuador announced that it could take up to two months to approve Snowden's political asylum bid. Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Patino, stated that the decision process could take as long as it took for the approval of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's asylum, who has been residing in Ecuador's embassy in London for over a year.\n\nSnowden is wanted by the US government for leaking top-secret information on US surveillance programs to The Guardian, The Washington Post, and a Hong Kong-based newspaper. The US revoked his passport, but he managed to flee Hong Kong on Sunday. Ecuador denies granting Snowden special travel documents, according to Reuters.\n\nInitially, Snowden was expected to leave Russia on Monday on a flight to Cuba, but he did not board the plane. Some speculate that Snowden has already left the Moscow airport and is making his way toward Ecuador's embassy there.\n\nEcuador has faced criticism for offering Snowden asylum, with some calling for the US to cut off aid to the country. National security analyst Aaron Cohen told Fox News that the US has given millions of dollars in aid to Ecuador over the past five years and may potentially be harboring someone responsible for one of the most massive intelligence leaks in history.\n\nEcuador has received $144.4 million in US aid over the past five years, according to Fox. Some speculate that Ecuador is taking its time considering the asylum application in order to come across as seriously weighing the legal implications of Snowden's asylum request, while others point to the media attention Ecuador garners while the decision is pending.\n\nEcuador's embassy official Efra\u00edn Baus stated that Snowden's application will be reviewed responsibly, as are the many other asylum applications that Ecuador receives each year. Ecuador does have an extradition agreement with the United States, but makes exceptions for political crimes, according to The \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nSteve Striffler, a Latin America specialist at the University of New Orleans, wrote on CNN that Ecuador's President Rafael Correa is not offering Snowden asylum for political points but is instead taking a principled stance. Correa's openness to individuals like Assange and Snowden, as well as his decision to close a US military base in Ecuador, is part of an effort to deepen Ecuadorian sovereignty while strengthening Latin America's ability to limit the influence of the United States in the region.\n\nHowever, Ecuador has faced criticism for its apparent irony in supporting freedom of information while deterring expression at home. The country recently passed a media law that contains provisions to clamp down on criticism by the press, according to Reporters without Borders. Correa has called reporters there \"rabid dogs\" and \"assassins with ink,\" according to the Monitor.\n\nThere could be some immediate political and economic consequences for Ecuador if it does indeed grant Snowden asylum, as well. The renewal of preferential treatment for trading certain products including roses and tuna is on the table, reports The New York Times. Michael Shifter of the Inter-American Dialogue told the Times, \"The risks are enormous\u2026 It would bring the United States down very hard on him.\" Others, however, say preferential treatment was already at risk of not being renewed.",
    " Title: ABC News Allegedly Suppressed Jeffrey Epstein Story, Sparking Trust Issues in Media\n\nArticle:\n\nA video released this week has raised questions about the integrity of ABC News, as anchor Amy Robach was caught on tape discussing how the network allegedly suppressed a story that could have exposed Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire who was later convicted of sexually abusing underage girls.\n\nIn the recording, Robach expressed frustration over the network's decision not to air her interview with Virginia Roberts, a woman who had alleged that Epstein had sexually abused her. Robach stated, \"I've had this interview with Virginia Roberts... We would not put it on the air. I was told, 'Who's Jeffrey Epstein? No one knows who that is. This is a stupid story.' Then the palace found out we had her whole allegations about Prince Andrew and threatened us a million different ways... And then Alan Dershowitz was also implicated in it because of the planes.\"\n\nEpstein, a wealthy money manager with close ties to many top establishment figures, was indicted for his alleged crimes in 2007. However, with the help of high-profile lawyers, he negotiated a 13-month sentence with former U.S. Attorney and later Trump Labor Secretary Alex Acosta.\n\nThe Epstein case highlights the growing divide between society's elites and the general public. If the super-wealthy and super-connected can get away with sexually abusing young girls with minimal punishment, the system is clearly broken.\n\nAfter the footage was released, Robach issued a statement, saying her past comments were \"a private moment of frustration.\" ABC claimed they did not run the interview because they \"could not obtain sufficient corroborating evidence to meet ABC's editorial standards about her allegations.\"\n\nHowever, ABC's claims of a lack of \"corroborating evidence\" are difficult to accept, given that the same network ran uncorroborated reports about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at the time, peddled by now-disgraced Democratic activist and lawyer Michael Avenatti. The discrepancy in treatment suggests bias.\n\nThere is one further explanation for the disparate treatment: politically partisan bias. Avenatti's claims were made against Kavanaugh, a Republican. The claims against Epstein potentially implicated former President Bill Clinton. ABC's lead news anchor is George Stephanopoulos, Bill Clinton's former staffer.\n\nCBS News, MSNBC, and CNN responded to the Robach video by largely ignoring it. ABC, in addition to their clearly bogus statement, responded by searching for the whistleblower who released the video. Reports indicate that ABC found the whistleblower was working at CBS, and CBS followed up by firing the whistleblower.\n\nTaken together, we have all three major U.S. television broadcast networks implicated to some degree in covering for alleged rapists. This, along with similar allegations against NBC News and journalist Ronan Farrow regarding their handling of the Harvey Weinstein case, has led to a significant loss of trust in the news media. A recent Gallup poll found that 69% of Americans have lost trust in the news media over the past decade. Based on these recent events, that number may now be closer to 100%.",
    " Title: Trump Expresses Optimism Over North Korea's Nuclear Disarmament Following Historic Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump, following his historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, expressed optimism that the North Korean leader will begin the process of dismantling his country's nuclear program \"virtually immediately.\" The summit took place in Singapore, and the two leaders signed a document stating Pyongyang would work toward \"complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\"\n\nIn an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Trump stated, \"I just think that we are now going to start the process of denuclearization of North Korea, and I believe that he's going back and will start it virtually immediately \u2013 and he's already indicated that, and you look at what he's done.\"\n\nThe historic agreement came after the two leaders held several meetings throughout the day. When asked by a reporter if Kim agreed to denuclearize, Trump responded, \"We are starting that process very quickly.\"\n\nTrump also stated at a press conference that he will be ending joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea. He added that Kim agreed to destroy a \"major\" missile testing site, but did not offer specific details.\n\nThe joint declaration states that the U.S. has committed to providing \"security guarantees\" to Pyongyang. The extent of these guarantees remains unclear.\n\nWhether the unpredictable North Korean leader will follow through on his commitments remains unclear, but Trump sounded optimistic as he left the summit. He told \"Hannity\" the two of them \"got along from the beginning\" and Kim understood the need to dismantle his nuclear program.\n\nThe summit, which almost didn't happen, represented a remarkable turnaround from the tension between Washington and Pyongyang last summer when Trump and Kim exchanged a war of words, with the American president warning the dictator of \"fire and fury.\"\n\nTrump told Fox News, though, that \"without the rhetoric we wouldn't have been here.\"\n\n\"So I think the rhetoric, I hated to do it, sometimes I felt foolish doing it, but we had no choice,\" he said.\n\nAs for what happens next, Trump insisted, \"I think he's gone back to get this done. He wants to get it done.\"\n\nDuring a gaggle later in the day with reporters on Air Force One, Trump said he trusts Kim but the U.S. would have to \"check\" to ensure denuclearization occurs.\n\n\"We're going to have to check him. And we will check him very strongly. But he has a plan total and complete,\" Trump said. \"He's got a total plan. It will get done.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he had any concerns about Kim, the president insisted Kim \"wants to get it done.\" He added, \"And we should all want that to happen.\"",
    " Title: GOP Presidential Candidate Ben Carson Defends Flat Tax Plan, Discusses Foreign Policy and Controversial Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nGOP presidential candidate Ben Carson defended his flat tax plan on Fox News Sunday, stating that it is \"condescending\" to suggest that poor people cannot pay taxes. The 63-year-old Carson, who grew up poor in Detroit before becoming a pioneering pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins University, argued for the proportional tax, which he likened to the biblical concept of tithing.\n\nUnder Carson's plan, individuals making $10 billion a year would pay $1 billion in taxes, while those making as little as $100 would pay $1. \"That's pretty darn fair if you ask me,\" Carson said. He countered criticisms that a flat tax rate would disproportionately burden low- and middle-income families, stating that his numbers are closer to 10-15 percent.\n\nCarson proposed cutting out loopholes and increasing revenue through other means, such as utilizing America's energy resources, revamping corporate taxes, and bringing in overseas money through a tax holiday. He estimated that these measures would generate $2 trillion in revenue.\n\nIn addition to discussing his tax plan, Carson was asked about his foreign policy views. When asked about a statement on his website that \"all options\" should remain open for dealing with Russia, Carson confirmed that this would include military action, but emphasized that it would not be his first option. He also stated that he would handle Ukraine differently than President Barack Obama has, citing Ukraine's promise of defense against Russian invasion in exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons.\n\nCarson also addressed two controversial statements he has made in the past. In a 2014 interview with Breitbart.com, Carson suggested that Americans feel intimidated by their own government due to potential IRS audits and job interference. He also compared Obamacare to slavery in a 2013 speech, stating that it fundamentally changes the relationship between the people and the government.\n\nRegarding his statement last week that, as president, he would not have to enforce \"judicial law,\" Carson clarified on Sunday that the president or executive branch is obligated to carry out the laws of the land, as provided by the legislative branch according to the Constitution.",
    " Title: 18 Democratic Attorneys General Sue Trump Administration Over ObamaCare Payments\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of 18 Democratic attorneys general, along with the District of Columbia, have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following the White House's decision to end payments to health insurers under the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare). The lawsuit was filed in a federal court in California. The states involved in the lawsuit are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.\n\nThe states argue that President Trump's decision to halt the payments constitutes an attempt to undermine the health and well-being of the country. They are seeking a court order to compel the Trump administration to make the next payment to insurers, scheduled for October 18. In a separate court case, the Justice Department notified a federal appeals court in Washington on Friday that the payment \"would not occur.\"\n\nA federal judge has found that Congress never properly approved the payments. The subsidies have continued under Obama and Trump until now, despite prior Trump threats to block them. The money goes to companies for lowering out-of-pocket costs like co-payments and deductibles for low- and middle-income customers. It will cost about $7 billion this year.\n\nCongressional Democrats have vowed to press for a bipartisan deal to restore the money by the end of the year. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized Trump's move to end the payments, calling it a \"spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every corner of America.\"\n\nPresident Trump, in response, told conservative activists at the Values Voter Summit that his move would pressure Democrats to negotiate major changes in the law. He also reiterated his belief that his move would ultimately be \"just as effective\" and \"maybe even better\" than repealing ObamaCare.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters that Trump's \"threats and bullying are not going to work.\" He expressed optimism about forcing money for the cost-sharing reductions into a massive spending bill Congress is expected to approve late this year.\n\nDemocrats believe they would have little difficulty reaching a bipartisan deal, citing support for the payments by some Republicans and polls showing the public would blame the GOP for any failure. Some Republicans privately agree. Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who heads Senate Democrats' campaign committee, said, \"Now, President Trump has his fingerprints all over the knife.\"\n\nSens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) have been seeking a deal that would reinstate the payments for two years. In exchange, Republicans want \"meaningful flexibility for states\" to offer lower-cost insurance policies with less coverage than Obama's law mandates.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he is willing to back the payments if they are \"part of a transition from Obamacare to something else\" with greater state flexibility than Alexander and Murray are discussing. Another conservative leader, Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), said the payments should be revived \"under no circumstance.\"\n\nSome GOP leaders have expressed openness to continuing the payments, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has said he wants them accompanied by significant changes. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) said this summer that the payments should be continued, citing their impact on premiums. Moderates like Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said halting the payments would make insurance costs \"unaffordable for some people.\" Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) tweeted that the cuts \"will mean more uninsured in my district.\"",
    " Title: Senate Leaders Negotiate Government Reopening and Debt Ceiling Extension, but Deal Remains Elusive\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his Republican counterpart, Sen. Mitch McConnell, have initiated discussions on a potential deal to end the two-week-long government shutdown and provide the Treasury Department with sufficient borrowing authority to avoid a potential default this month. However, the specifics of the agreement are still under negotiation, and all sides have cautioned that the deal is not finalized.\n\nThe proposed agreement includes funding the government for several months and granting President Obama the necessary authority to raise the debt ceiling into the next year. The House and Senate would then appoint negotiators to work towards a broader budget deal in the interim.\n\nHowever, the exact dates for the debt and spending extensions, as well as additional provisions such as delays or restrictions on the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), are still under negotiation, according to aides.\n\nEven if Reid and McConnell reach an agreement, it remains unclear whether the deal can pass through the GOP-controlled House, where some conservatives have expressed skepticism.\n\nRep. Tim Huelskamp, a Kansas Republican, stated, \"When you're giving 98, 99 percent of Obamacare, I don't see how that would ever pass over here, if indeed it passes the Senate.\"\n\nThe mere prospect of a deal that would provide the government with more borrowing room sent the stock markets higher on Monday.\n\nPresident Obama had initially invited the top party leaders to the White House for talks on Monday afternoon, but he later canceled the meeting, stating it was more appropriate for Reid and McConnell to continue their negotiations.\n\nFor his part, the president visited a local food bank, Martha's Table, where some furloughed federal workers were volunteering. President Obama said \"some progress\" had been made, but he cautioned, \"We'll see if the progress is real.\"\n\nThe Treasury Department has stated it will run out of borrowing room on Thursday, leaving it with only cash on hand to pay bills. This cash could last a couple of weeks, or it could be exhausted almost immediately, according to analysts.\n\nThe deal's details, particularly regarding the length of the stopgap funding bill, the amount of borrowing authority to be granted, and the potential changes to Obamacare, are still under negotiation.\n\nSen. Susan M. Collins, a Maine Republican, had proposed delaying a tax on medical devices, a move that has bipartisan support. However, Democratic leaders and the White House have resisted changes to President Obama's Affordable Care Act, leaving Republicans to search for another concession on this subject, which is what sparked the conservative revolt against the spending resolution and debt ceiling in the first place.\n\nThe White House has been adamant that the government should reopen and the debt ceiling should be raised without any conditions, repeatedly comparing Republican demands on Obamacare to hostage-taking and terrorism.\n\nHouse Republicans remain a significant hurdle, and conservatives have expressed reservations about the Senate deal.

Boustany Jr., a Louisiana Republican, stated, \"I think we'll have a hard time with our conference, with a number of members, because of the lack of Obamacare features in that.\"\n\nBoth party leaders in both houses are discussing strategy, such as which chamber should move first and how many House Democrats would be needed to pass the deal there.",
    " Title: Analysis of American Identity and Politics in the 21st Century\n\nArticle:\n\nThe aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks marked a period of national unity and shared identity among Americans. However, as the years passed, this unity seemed to dissipate, giving way to a fragmented society characterized by identity politics.\n\nIn the article, the author suggests that the unity experienced in 2001 was a response to the attacks, which the author refers to as a \"powers of darkness.\" The author argues that this unity was a manifestation of the American identity, and that it took effort to bring about. The author notes that previous events, such as the Vietnam War, Watergate, and the Clinton years, had created deep national divisions.\n\nThe author contrasts the unity of 2001 with the current state of American society, where group identity is the primary focus. The author states that identity politics is the new brand of politics, with each constituency asserting its demands over the needs and rights of others. The author notes that while there have always been divisions in American society, the current indisposition to cut slack for anyone besides oneself is the main and most frightening feature of today's politics.\n\nThe author expresses concern over the current generation of collegians, who may have a provisional regard for free speech and other freedoms. The author also notes the elimination of Confederate monuments, the war on free trade, and the secularization of society as examples of the linkage between identity politics and the erosion of American ideals.\n\nThe author concludes by stating that the American ideal of freedom to pursue legitimate interests is turning off people who view themselves and their group as uniquely deserving or put-upon. The author is writing a book about moral restoration in the 21st century.",
    " Title: Did the Republican National Convention Provide Mitt Romney a Poll Bounce?\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican National Convention appears to have provided Mitt Romney with a poll bounce, although the magnitude of the increase is small. The exact extent of the post-convention boost is subject to interpretation, depending on the specific polling data analyzed.\n\nAccording to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, Romney experienced an overall improvement in his image among voters but no significant change in the number of voters who intend to cast their ballots for him. The poll showed Romney steadily improving in likeability and other positive-image features.\n\nRasmussen Reports' data showed a six-point swing in Romney's favor following the Republican National Convention. Prior to the convention, Romney trailed President Barack Obama by two points, but now holds a four-point lead. This poll also showed Romney surging ahead by two points in 11 key swing states.\n\nGallup published data prior to the Tampa convention indicating that the GOP had slightly bolstered its image compared to 2008, while Democrats' favorability has declined by double-digits over the same period. This information is relevant as it informs partisan sample breakdowns as pollsters attempt to measure the composition of the 2012 electorate and predict the election's outcome.\n\nAdditionally, Rasmussen Report's data showed that the number of Americans who consider themselves Republicans jumped nearly three points in August, with 37.6% of Americans identifying as Republicans. This is the largest number of Republicans ever recorded by Rasmussen Report since monthly tracking began in November 2002.\n\nAn update to the article mentions a snap poll of Florida voters that seems to bode well for Romney. However, it is important to note that holiday weekend polling is notoriously unreliable.\n\nOverall, while the exact impact of the Republican National Convention on Mitt Romney's poll numbers is subject to interpretation, it is clear that the convention helped Romney's image among voters.",
    " Title: Sanders and Buttigieg Address Abortion Rights in Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring a town hall event on MSNBC, Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate, stated that being pro-choice is an essential part of being a Democrat. This response contrasts with Sanders' stance in 2017, when he campaigned for Heath Mello, a mayoral candidate in Omaha, Nebraska, who was labeled \"anti-abortion\" for supporting a bill requiring doctors to inform women of their ultrasound rights.\n\nIn 2017, a piece in Salon argued that Sanders' endorsement of Mello indicated that he views reproductive rights as negotiable. However, Sanders' support for Mello does not necessarily reflect a pro-life worldview.\n\nDuring a Fox News town hall, another Democratic presidential candidate, Pete Buttigieg, was asked if he would support more moderate platform language to include pro-life Democratic voters. Buttigieg did not provide a direct answer, instead focusing on the importance of personal autonomy and the woman's right to make decisions about her own body.\n\nPro-life Democrats have repeatedly asked presidential candidates if there is room for them in the party, and their responses have been largely negative. At least Sanders has been forthcoming in his response, telling pro-life Democrats not to waste their time.",
    " Title: Obama Campaign Outspends Romney Campaign in June, but Faces Challenges in Polls and Favorability Ratings\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's re-election campaign outspent Mitt Romney's campaign 2 to 1 in June, according to campaign reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. The Obama campaign spent $70.8 million, including about $38 million on television advertising, while Romney and the Republican National Committee spent $38.8 million, including about $11 million on television advertising.\n\nDespite the significant spending, the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee have less cash on hand than Romney and the Republicans, according to polls that show a head-to-head race. The first round of polls after President Obama's Bain attacks against Mitt Romney has not been favorable for the White House. In the new New York Times/CBS poll, Romney holds a 47 to 46 percent lead, and Obama is stuck at 47 percent in recent polls by Fox News and NPR.\n\nVoters appear to be processing the worsening economic news belatedly, and their pessimism shows. In the CBS/NYT poll, Obama's job approval dropped to 44 percent, with only 39 percent approving of his economic performance - down five points from April. For the first time since January, more voters now think the economy is getting worse. Nearly two-thirds of voters now place some blame on the president for the weak economic conditions, with 34 percent giving him \"significant\" responsibility, and an outright 52 percent majority of independents believe Obama will \"never improve\" the economy.\n\nAnother red flag for Team Obama is the president's crumbling favorability ratings, a troubling departure from his previous strength. In the CBS/NYT poll, Obama is underwater on the favorability question, generally his strong suit, by double digits. More Americans are developing a poor overall perception of Obama the man, independent from their misgivings about his leadership. Obama's favorability with independents is 28/52, with Romney actually above water at 32/31.\n\nThe media should be asking whether Obama's Bain attacks are hurting Obama rather than how much they are hurting Romney. Another related nugget, reported by the Weekly Standard over the weekend, is that the Obama campaign spent nearly $93,000 to rent a large arena for his big May re-elect kickoff event in Columbus, but ended up with thousands of empty seats. Hyped expectations, disappointing results, huge expenditures, and resulting deficits - these are not numbers that victories are made of.",
    " Title: International Sanctions on Iran Lifted After Compliance with Nuclear Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nInternational sanctions on Iran have been lifted following the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) confirmation that Tehran has complied with a nuclear deal aimed at preventing it from developing nuclear weapons. The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, stated that the deal would contribute to improved regional and international peace and security.\n\nThe landmark deal between Iran and world powers was agreed upon last July. The lifting of sanctions will unfreeze billions of dollars of assets and allow Iran's oil to be sold internationally. The IAEA confirmed that its inspectors had verified that Iran had taken the necessary steps, including drastically reducing its number of centrifuges and dismantling a heavy-water reactor near the town of Arak, both of which could be used in creating nuclear weapons.\n\nIran has maintained that its nuclear program is peaceful, but some US Republicans and other opponents of the deal argue that it does not do enough to ensure the country cannot develop a nuclear bomb. US Secretary of State John Kerry has ordered that US nuclear-related economic sanctions against Iran be lifted.\n\nSpeaking in Vienna, Mr. Kerry said Iran had \"undertaken significant steps\" that many people \"doubted would ever come to pass.\" He added, \"I thank God for this blessing and bow to the greatness of the patient nation of Iran.\"\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani tweeted, \"Today, as a result of the actions taken since last July, the threat of a nuclear weapon has been reduced.\" US Secretary of State John Kerry stated, \"Today, as a result of the actions taken since last July, the United States, our friends and allies in the Middle East, in the entire world are safer because the threat of a nuclear weapon has been reduced.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated, \"Even after signing the nuclear deal, Iran has not relinquished its ambition to obtain nuclear weapons, and continues to act to destabilize the Middle East and spread terror throughout the world while violating its international commitments.\" US Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan stated, \"Today, the Obama administration will begin lifting economic sanctions on the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism.\"\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond stated, \"Years of patient and persistent diplomacy, and difficult technical work, have borne fruit as we now implement the deal.\" Earlier on Saturday, it emerged that Iran had released Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and three other Iranian-American prisoners in an apparent prisoner swap with the United States.\n\nPresident Barack Obama will provide more details of the releases later, Mr. Kerry said. A fifth American, Matthew Trevithick, was also released on Saturday. The IAEA has installed a device at the Natanz plant to monitor Iran's uranium enrichment activities in real time, in order to verify that uranium enrichment levels are kept at up to 3.67% as agreed in the deal with world powers. The organization's head, Yukiya Amano, is to visit Tehran on Sunday for meetings with President Rouhani and other officials.\n\nIn July 2015, Iran agreed to a landmark nuclear deal with six world powers to limit its sensitive nuclear activities for more than a decade in return for the lifting of crippling sanctions. The US is confident the agreement will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran says it has the right to nuclear energy and stresses that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only. The sanctions have cost Iran more than $160bn in oil revenue since 2012 alone. Once they are lifted, the country will be able to resume selling oil on international markets and using the global financial system for trade. Iran has the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world, and the energy industry is braced for lower prices. Iran will also be able to access more than $100bn in assets frozen overseas.",
    " Title: Biden Suggests AOC and Progressive Democrats Don't Represent Future of Democratic Party\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with Axios, which will air this weekend on HBO, former Vice President Joe Biden has criticized the rise of progressive Democrats and the label of \"Democratic socialists,\" suggesting that they do not represent the future of the Democratic Party.\n\nDuring the interview, Biden disputed the notion that the Democratic Party has moved leftward following Hillary Clinton's loss to President Donald Trump in 2016. He claimed that the media's portrayal of the Democratic voter base as more liberal and left-leaning is inaccurate.\n\nWhen asked about the rise of progressive Democrats and the \"Democratic socialist\" wing of the party, Biden demurred, stating, \"You guys got it all wrong about what happened. It\u2019s just bad judgment. You all thought that what happened was the party moved extremely to the left after Hillary. AOC was a new party. She\u2019s a bright, wonderful person. But where\u2019s the party? Come on, man.\"\n\nBiden also suggested that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) appeal to a narrow segment of voters who are more vocal but do not represent the Democratic base as a whole. He stated, \"The party\u2019s not there. The party\u2019s not there at all,\" referring to where Warren and Sanders fall on the political spectrum. Biden reportedly added that he believes both Warren and Sanders have misread Democratic voters and are appealing to the wrong segment of primary voters.\n\nBiden's comments are not new, as he has long maintained that he is a more moderate choice for the Democratic nominee. However, this is a significant development in that Biden has mentioned Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez by name, calling out the up-and-coming \"Democratic socialist\" wing of the party directly, and suggesting that members of the \"squad\" and their allies are a small segment of a larger Democratic party and not the future of the Democratic party as Ocasio-Cortez and her Justice Democrats insist.\n\nSanders and Ocasio-Cortez seem to be presiding over a static element of the Democratic Party, and both Sanders and Warren are vying for the same group of potential primary voters\u2014mostly young, white, highly educated voters in urban centers. However, until now, most of the candidates targeting the middle\u2014Biden and South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, included\u2014have resisted the urge to suggest the progressive left isn't part of the party.\n\nThe good news for Biden is that his newfound opposition to a leftward moving party may play well with voters in early primary states like Iowa, South Carolina, and Nevada, where progressive ideas, like Medicare for All, don't seem to be resonating with voters.",
    " Title: Obama Urges House to Approve Comprehensive Immigration Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has called on House lawmakers to approve comprehensive immigration reform, stating that the current system is \"not fair.\" In a speech on Thursday, he expressed his belief that it is the right time to address the issue and urged lawmakers to \"go get it done.\"\n\nThe president's call comes as the legislative calendar is short for him to get his priorities acted on this year, following a 16-day government shutdown. House Republican leaders have indicated they still intend to hold an immigration debate this year, but they do not plan to take up the comprehensive reform plan approved by the Senate.\n\nThe Senate bill, which grants a pathway to citizenship for an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, is supported by President Obama, who believes it would be beneficial for the economy and the country. He urged Republican leaders to disregard the politics of the issue and take action.\n\n\"I'm not running for office again; I just believe this is the right thing to do,\" Mr. Obama said. \"What we can't do is just sweep the problem under the rug one more time. Let's not delay, and let's do it in a bipartisan fashion.\"\n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, has expressed opposition to the president's wishes, with his spokesman, Brendan Buck, stating that the House will not consider \"any massive, Obamacare-style legislation that no one understands.\" Instead, the House is committed to a \"common sense, step-by-step approach\" to immigration reform.\n\nThe spokesman added that the House is working towards a reform that would boost the economy and that they hope the president will work with them, not against them, as they pursue this approach.",
    " Title: MIT Media Lab Director Resigns Amid Epstein Donation Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an email sent on Saturday to MIT's provost, Joi Ito, the director of the Media Lab, announced his resignation as director, professor, and employee of the Institute, effective immediately. The resignation follows an article in The New Yorker detailing the Media Lab's efforts to conceal its relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender.\n\nThe internal emails, shared with The New York Times by a former Media Lab employee, reveal the handling of donations made and solicited by Epstein over the years, including a $2 million gift from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. In an email from October 2014, six years after Epstein's conviction, Ito wrote that the gift from Gates was \"directed by Jeffrey Epstein.\" A development official at the Media Lab, Peter Cohen, wrote in a subsequent email, \"For gift recording purposes, we will not be mentioning Jeffrey\u2019s name as the impetus for this gift.\"\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Gates stated that Epstein was introduced to Gates as a person interested in increasing philanthropy. The statement further clarified that Epstein did not direct any programmatic or personal grant-making for Gates and that any claim to the contrary is false.\n\nGates, one of the world's richest men and most generous philanthropists, is among several powerful individuals facing scrutiny for their connections to Epstein. This list includes President Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Britain's Prince Andrew, high-profile scientists, business executives, and financiers such as Leslie Wexner, the CEO of L Brands, and Leon Black, the founder of Apollo Global Management. R. Alexander Acosta, a former federal prosecutor involved in the 2008 plea agreement with Epstein, stepped down as labor secretary after the deal was heavily criticized.",
    " Title: COVID-19 Patients Face Mental Health Risks Due to Hospital Isolation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has filled hospitals with critically ill patients, has led to another challenge for some survivors: mental health issues. The stress, loneliness, and fear experienced by patients, often magnified by invasive treatment procedures, place them at a high risk for disorders such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), according to some medical experts.\n\nLoneliness, a combination of thinking, feeling, and behaving, can affect everyone during a pandemic, as many people maintain physical distance from each other. Ami Rokach, a clinical psychologist and psychology teacher at York University in Toronto, states that loneliness can have a significant impact on psychological and physical health.\n\nHowever, there are some indications that people's resilience and increased use of communication technology may be helping to lessen the broader impact of the pandemic on loneliness, according to Martina Luchetti, an assistant professor at Florida State University College of Medicine. While further research is needed, Luchetti's recent study found that distancing measures did not increase loneliness in the general public as expected.\n\nFor COVID-19 patients, the situation is different. With the exception of giving birth, many hospitals do not allow adults to bring a support person due to fears of infection and a limited supply of personal protective equipment. Martha A.Q. Curley, a professor of pediatric nursing at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, describes the situation as \"heart-wrenching\" to watch, as people who have lived together for decades cannot be with their loved ones when they are ill, transition through the illness, or when they die.\n\nSome COVID-19 survivors may experience PTSD, which can last for years without treatment. Anthony King, a professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Michigan, explains that most people feel anxiety with the uncertainty of COVID-19, but some experience PTSD due to trauma and a \"threat to life or threat to physical integrity.\"\n\nThe chance that someone may experience PTSD may be exacerbated by patient isolation while fighting the disease. Long-term studies of past serious outbreaks found PTSD is much higher in patients than in the general population. In one study, one-fourth of 90 SARS patients had PTSD 30 months after the outbreak, and 15.6% had a depressive disorder.\n\nResearch has shown that many Intensive Care Unit (ICU) survivors experience trauma, particularly with procedures like intubation. Curley also points out that reports of post-intensive care syndrome are growing after patients with COVID-19 are discharged, which can be further complicated by the fact that family members do not know what the patient went through.\n\nFour doctors argue in a New England Journal of Medicine perspective piece that new guidelines should enable more regular telecommunication between isolated patients and their families. Curley suggests steps can be taken to safely allow a family member into the ICU with a COVID-19 patient. Family facilitators can help with the careful screening, preparation, and support needed to undertake this goal, she says.\n\n\"We need to think of ways to make this happen. It will be different within each system, it will be different with each patient, but we ought to not just create a rule that families are not allowed,\" Curley adds.\n\nIn conclusion, isolated and faced with uncertainty and fear, some COVID-19 patients are at risk for trauma that experts say should be screened for and addressed at all stages of healthcare.",
    " Title: AP Declares Hillary Clinton Winner of Democratic Primaries; Sanders Accuses Media of Rushing Judgment\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Associated Press has declared former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the winner of Tuesday's Democratic presidential primaries, citing her acquisition of the 2,383 delegates required to clinch the party's nomination. The announcement was made before the primaries began, with superdelegates tipping the scale in Clinton's favor.\n\nClinton, in a speech to supporters, expressed gratitude for the support and urged voters to cast their ballots in the six states holding primaries on Tuesday, including California, the largest. \"We're going to come out of the primary even stronger to take on Donald Trump,\" she said.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders' campaign, however, has accused the media of prematurely declaring Clinton the winner. Michael Briggs, Sanders' spokesperson, stated, \"It is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer. Secretary Clinton does not have and will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to secure the nomination.\"\n\nSanders' campaign has vowed to spend the time until the convention, on July 25, attempting to convince superdelegates that he is the stronger candidate. Despite the apparent shift in momentum, Sanders' influence on the Democratic Party remains significant, particularly on economic issues and the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nSanders has advocated for changes in the Democratic Party's platform, including explicit references to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands and recognition of a Palestinian state. He has also appointed pro-Palestinian representatives to the platform committee, including those who support the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which aims to delegitimize the Jewish state.\n\nThe potential changes in the party's platform have sparked controversy, with pro-Israel Democrats expressing concern that such changes would be met with resistance. However, recent data from the Pew Research Center suggests a shift in sympathies among liberal Democrats, with a majority now sympathizing with the Palestinians for the first time in a decade.\n\nThis division could lead to a contentious fight at the Democratic National Convention over the party's stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Even without such a fight, the growing divide among Democrats could indicate a potential shift in the party's support towards greater sympathy for Palestinians and potentially less support for Israel in the future.",
    " Title: Wildfires in Australia's East Coast Trapped Residents, Caused Fatalities and Destroyed Properties\n\nArticle:\n\nWildfires burning across Australia's two most populous states, Victoria and New South Wales, trapped residents of the seaside town of Mallacoota in apocalyptic conditions on Tuesday, December 31, 2019. The fires, which are feared to have destroyed many properties and caused fatalities, have been a devastating part of Australia's fire season that started early due to an unusually warm and dry winter.\n\nAbout 4,000 residents in Mallacoota, located in Victoria state, fled towards the water Tuesday morning as winds pushed an emergency-level wildfire towards their homes. The smoke-filled sky shrouded the town in darkness before turning an unnerving shade of bright red.\n\nAs of Tuesday, approximately 5 million hectares (12.35 million acres) of land have burned nationwide over the past few months, with 12 people confirmed dead and more than 1,000 homes destroyed. Nearly 100 fires were burning across the state of New South Wales, which is home to Sydney.\n\nNew South Wales state Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons described this wildfire season as the worst on record and painted a bleak long-term picture. \"We've seen extraordinary fire behavior,\" he said Tuesday. \"What we really need is meaningful rain, and we haven't got anything in the forecast at the moment that says we're going to get drought-breaking or fire-quenching rainfall.\"\n\nThe wildfire crisis has reignited debate about whether Prime Minister Scott Morrison's conservative government has taken enough action on climate change. Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas.\n\nMorrison, who has been criticized as a climate change skeptic, conceded earlier this month that \"climate change, along with many other factors,\" has contributed to the wildfires. The prime minister faced criticism for going on a family vacation to Hawaii in December during the crisis. He eventually cut his trip short and publicly apologized.\n\nLate Tuesday, Mallacoota was saved by changes of wind direction, but authorities said \"numerous\" homes were lost. Residents returning home were urged to boil tap water before drinking it. Forest Fire Management Victoria said the wildfires had put heavy demands on tap water that is affecting the supply of water.\n\nStranded residents and vacationers were reported to be sleeping in cars on New Year's Eve, while gas stations and surf clubs transformed into evacuation areas. Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews had earlier announced plans to evacuate the trapped people by sea. There were grave fears for four missing people. \"We can't confirm their whereabouts,\" Andrews told reporters Tuesday.\n\nAndrews has requested assistance from 70 firefighters from the United States and Canada, while Australia's military sent air and sea reinforcements. Victoria Emergency Services Commissioner Andrew Crisp confirmed \"significant\" property losses across the region. More than 115 communities across Victoria remained under emergency warnings Tuesday night.\n\nSome communities canceled New Year's fireworks celebrations, but Sydney's popular display over its iconic harbor controversially went ahead in front of more than a million revelers. The city was granted an exemption to a total fireworks ban in place there and elsewhere to prevent new wildfires.\n\nFire conditions in Victoria and New South Wales worsened after oppressive heat Monday mixed with strong winds and lightning. Police in New South Wales said Tuesday that two men\u2014a 63-year-old father and 29-year-old son\u2014died in a house in the wildfire-ravaged southeast town of Cobargo, and a 72-year-old man remained missing.\n\n\"They were obviously trying to do their best with the fire as it came through in the early hours of the morning,\" New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said. \"The other person that we are trying to get to, we think that person was trying to defend their property in the early hours of the morning.\"\n\nOn Monday, a firefighter was killed when extreme winds flipped his truck. Samuel McPaul, 28, was the third volunteer firefighter in New South Wales to have died in the past two weeks. He was an expectant father.\n\nMore than 130 fires remain burning across New South Wales, with five at an emergency level. Authorities warned that power would be out for 24 hours along the fire-ravaged south coast of the state.",
    " Title: Vice Presidential Debate: Biden and Ryan Prepare for a Substantive Showdown\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the vice presidential debate between Vice President Joe Biden and Representative Paul Ryan approaches, anticipation mounts for the highly anticipated event taking place tonight in Danville, Kentucky. The debate, which will likely be widely watched, serves as an important table-setter ahead of the second presidential debate on Tuesday in New York.\n\nThe pressure is particularly intense on Vice President Joe Biden, following President Barack Obama's lackluster performance in last week's presidential debate, which moved Republican nominee Mitt Romney into a national polling lead. Republicans have been eagerly anticipating this confrontation for months, believing that Ryan, the Republican ticket's No. 2, has the intellectual firepower to make gaffe-prone Biden appear foolish.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, believe Biden will come well-prepared and be able to expose what they see as the duplicity of the Romney-Ryan ticket, which has appeared to shift positions in recent days on issues such as abortion, education, and tax policy.\n\nThe vice presidential debates are often quickly forgotten, but this one will likely be widely watched and at the very least serve as an important table-setter in advance of the second presidential debate. \"It will be very substantive, with probably two of the most substantive vice presidential candidates we've ever had,\" says David Carney, a Republican consultant. \"I think Biden's performance, in an ironic way, will put more pressure on [President] Obama for the next debate.\"\n\nFour years ago, the vice presidential debate between Biden and Republican Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska actually drew higher TV ratings than any of that year's presidential debates. This one also will draw considerable attention.\n\nBiden's task tonight is different from what it was four years ago. Then, he essentially ignored Palin in favor of attacking Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP nominee. This time, he'll still want to concentrate most of his fire on the other party's presidential candidate, but he will doubtless also use Ryan as a target. As the House Budget Committee chairman, Ryan is the architect of a spending plan that Democrats warn would gut domestic programs and threaten entitlements such as Medicare.\n\n\"Where Gov. Romney muddied the water, I think the vice president will try to clarify it,\" says Jared Bernstein, who served as an economic adviser to Biden in the White House. \"He's going to link the political agendas and the policy agendas so the electorate has a much better understanding than they did from the first debate.\"\n\nSince his selection as running mate, Ryan has served as the loyal soldier, shying away from some of the implications of his own budget and declaring that Romney sets the policy for the ticket. But if Democrats accuse the Republicans of duplicity, Republicans counter that Democrats have mismanaged the economy and do not have a record worth running on and so are relying on scare tactics.\n\nThe vice presidential debate will be a strong contrast between Paul Ryan's actuarial style and Joe Biden's storytelling, tell-it-like-it-is campaign style. Ryan, who was born two years before Biden was first elected to the Senate, needs to show he has some \"gravitas,\" says David Yepsen, director of a public policy institute at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. Republicans from Romney on down have tried to downplay expectations for Ryan's performance in recent days, pointing out that he has not engaged in a campaign debate since he first ran for Congress 14 years ago.\n\nTed Kaufman, a longtime Biden aide who succeeded him in the Senate after his ascension to the vice presidency, says Ryan will be ready. \"Ryan will do a good job,\" Kaufman says. \"Anyone who has been a member of Congress for 14 years knows how to present their positions well and how to challenge the positions of the other side.\"",
    " Title: Russian Forces Allegedly Involved in Eastern Ukraine Offensive, Escalating Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko convened an emergency security meeting today as pro-Russia rebels launched a new offensive in eastern Ukraine. The escalation comes amid mounting evidence of direct Russian military involvement in the conflict.\n\nThe town of Novoazovsk, previously unaffected by the violence, was shelled hours after a landmark meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents on Tuesday. Pro-Russian rebels reportedly drove Ukrainian forces out of the town on Wednesday, with some Ukrainian soldiers in full retreat and refusing to fight. Associated Press reporters were barred by separatists from entering Novoazovsk today.\n\nThe new southeastern front raises concerns that the separatists may be attempting to create a land link between Russia and the annexed Crimea Peninsula. If successful, it could give them or Russia control over the entire Sea of Azov and the gas and mineral riches believed to be contained within. Ukraine has already lost approximately half its coastline, several major ports, and significant Black Sea mineral rights following Russia's annexation of Crimea in March.\n\nIn Mariupol, a city of 450,000 about 30 kilometers (20 miles) to the west, a brigade of Ukrainian forces arrived at the airport Wednesday afternoon, while deep trenches were dug on the city's edge a day earlier.\n\nThe BBC reports that the incursion could serve as a means to divert Ukrainian troops from Luhansk and Donetsk, where they have made headway against pro-Russian separatists in recent months.\n\nUkraine accused Russia this week of sending heavy weaponry into southern Ukraine to aid pro-Russian rebels. National security spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko stated that Russian soldiers crossed as far as 30 miles beyond the border in armored personnel carriers and a truck this week.\n\nThe prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People\u2019s Republic acknowledged today that there are Russian servicemen fighting alongside pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Alexander Zakharchenko claimed there are between 3,000 and 4,000 Russian volunteers fighting with the rebels, with some being retired Russian military personnel.\n\nAccusations of direct Russian involvement in Ukraine have prompted Western governments to impose sanctions against Russia, despite Moscow's repeated denials. Russia refers to the crisis in Ukraine as a national issue that must be resolved internally.\n\nThe Obama administration this week accused Russia of moving artillery and air defenses to aid pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine. \"These incursions indicate a Russian-directed counteroffensive is likely underway,\" said Jen Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman. Psaki criticized Russia's \"unwillingness to tell the truth\" about its military's role in Ukrainian territory.\n\nInternational leaders, including those from France, Germany, and NATO officials, have expressed alarm. \"I think there's a shift here that we may be witnessing, very recently, from largely covert, ambiguous, deniable support to what appears increasingly to be flat-out, overt and obvious [support], and with the only form of ambiguity being that the Russians... claim it is not happening,\" a NATO diplomat told reporters in Brussels on the condition of anonymity.\n\nNATO officials are expected to give a briefing today on the situation in Ukraine. French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande stated this week that if Russian soldiers are in Ukraine, \"it would be intolerable and unacceptable.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Russian President Vladimir Putin for clarification on the Kremlin's involvement.\n\n\"The latest reports of the presence of Russian soldiers on Ukrainian territory must be explained,\" Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert said of the call. \"She [Merkel] emphasized Russia's major responsibility for de-escalation and watching over its own frontiers.\"\n\nA report by the UN found that the death toll in eastern Ukraine over the past month grew to at least 36 people killed each day.

    " Title: Poll Results and the Tight Presidential Race Between Obama and Romney\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent poll indicates that 57 percent of likely voters believe America is in decline, with a significant plurality believing the country has worsened over the past years. Despite this, the race between President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, remains tied.\n\nThe poll, as reported by Chris Stirewalt, digital politics editor for \u2588\u2588\u2588, shows that Obama is upside down on his overall job approval and lags on his handling of the economy, the number one issue this year by 12 points. By an almost 20-point margin, respondents said they would rather the federal government leave them alone than lend them a hand.\n\nWhen asked whether it was fair to say Obama wants to make Americans more dependent on the government, 53 percent said yes, and only 44 percent said no. This is a dire slate for any incumbent Democrat, particularly bad for one whose major liabilities relate to spending too much and intervening too much while failing to revive the consistently crummy economy.\n\nThe race's tightness is surprising given the poll results, as Obama's major liabilities are well-defined. The effort to define Romney has been nearly as successful, with the central emphasis of the Obama campaign being to make Romney an unacceptable alternative.\n\nThe poll reveals that 10 percent of respondents are undecided or have rejected the major party choices. This group strongly disapproves of the president's performance but doesn't seem very pleased with the GOP nominee either. While Obama suffers a 12-point deficit on personal favorability among these voters, Romney's rating stands at a whopping negative 28 points.\n\nEvery re-election campaign is about the electorate answering two questions: Do we want to keep the guy we have, and is the person running to replace him a plausible pick? As we prepare for the two-week convention kick-off for the fall campaign, it is clear that Obama has failed the first question. With 74 days until the election, there isn't a way for the president to turn public sentiment in favor of his administration.\n\nThe president and his team have focused on personal attacks on Romney for nearly five months. As Vice President Joe Biden often says, \"Don't compare us to the almighty, compare us to the alternative.\" The central emphasis of the Obama campaign has been to make Romney an unacceptable alternative. But given all of the slashing and bashing so far, Romney is still hanging on.\n\nRespondents in the poll were 6 points less inclined to believe Romney wanted to make the rich richer but neglect everyone else \u2013 a charge that is the ethos of the Obama campaign \u2013 than they were the Republican charge that Obama is seeking greater government dependency.\n\nThe other big knock on Romney is that he is more interested in political expedience than principle. While nearly 60 percent said Romney would \"say and do just about anything to get elected,\" Obama scored just as poorly.\n\nThe danger for the president is that he has succeeded in his goal of stoking resentment against Romney, but he has also made himself into a very typical politician in the eyes of the electorate. This creates a scenario in which fed-up moderates and independents declare a pox on the houses of both candidates and sit out the election.\n\nObama has been seeking this kind of base-versus-base election and his long, negative campaign has helped shove people into their respective camps sooner than usual. The president's team believes that the power of incumbency combined with a superior turnout operation will allow them to win a narrow victory.\n\nHowever, the alarming sign for the blue team is this: The president has failed to close the voter intensity gap for month after month. Romney supporters lead Obama supporters 64 percent to 54 percent on the question of whether it is \"extremely important\" for their candidate to win. In a tie race, that would mean victory for Romney.\n\nThe president is trying to ring as many alarms for Democrats as he can. Talking about abortion is a risk for Democrats, who have seen public sentiment move away from their support for elective abortions. But Obama needs to get his voters marching. Maybe not the way they were in 2008, but enough not to get badly out-hustled.\n\nFor Romney, the next week is all about reintroducing himself to a crabby and skeptical electorate. The first step came with his selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate, helping cast Romney as a serious man and a serious fiscal conservative. The effort continues today in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in which Romney told the story of his 25-year career as a corporate turnaround artist. He explained how he could use the same skills to remake the federal government, thereby stimulating the lagging economy. And it will continue through the next week and through his acceptance speech in Tampa on Thursday. The message will be the same one we always expected from Romney: competency, accomplishment, and steadiness. It's not sexy, but it's certainly a plausible presidential pedigree. Obama failed to land the kill shot on Romney before this final phase of the campaign begins. If he wants to win, Romney needs to make the most of the next week.",
    " Title: Philippines Impounds North Korean Freighter in Response to Global Sanctions Over Nuclear Test and Missile Launch\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Philippine government has impounded a North Korean freighter, the Jin Teng, in Subic Bay and plans to deport its crew, according to the official Philippines News Agency. This action comes in response to North Korea's recent nuclear test and missile launch, and the subsequent global community's imposition of new sanctions.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council voted this week to impose an array of new sanctions in response to what it called \"violation and flagrant disregard\" of previous resolutions. The vote was unanimous, including from longtime North Korean foes such as the United States and Japan, as well as Russia and China, who have been less adversarial to the regime.\n\nResolution 2270 mandates that other countries \"should inspect cargo within or transiting through their territory\u2014including airports, sea ports, and free trade zones\u2014that was destined for or originating from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\" It also makes special mention of calling out any \"evasion of sanctions\" by various parties.\n\nThe Jin Teng is one of 31 vessels operated by Ocean Maritime Management, which is named in the U.N. resolution as being \"subject to the asset freeze.\" Documents show that all 21 of the Sierra Leone-flagged ship's crew are North Korean nationals.\n\nThe freighter arrived Thursday in Subic Bay from Indonesia with a load of palm kernels, according to state news. Coast guardsmen also found minor safety violations like faulty emergency light bulbs, a lack of fire hoses, corroded air vents, and inadequate accommodations for crew, according to Philippines Coast Guard spokesman Armand Balilo.\n\nA team from the United Nations may also inspect the Jin Teng, according to Quezon. Regardless, the Philippine government will report its findings to that world body.\n\nSuch actions\u2014this ship seizure, specifically, and stronger sanctions, generally\u2014seem to have done little to deter North Korea's muscle flexing, bellicose talk, and nuclear ambitions.\n\nNorth Korea has continued and, if anything, escalated its threat to potentially deploy a nuclear weapon. On Friday, state news agency KCNA reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country's \"nuclear warheads need to be ready for use at any time.\"\n\nThis rhetoric came out a day after the news agency reported tests of a new multiple-launch rocket system. The extent to which these tests refer to a launch of \"short-range projectiles\" chronicled one day earlier by the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff is unclear.\n\nPyongyang has long boasted about its nuclear ambitions, as long as countries like South Korea and the United States have sought to derail them. The issue has only furthered the isolation of North Korea, a communist, closed-off state led for decades by the authoritarian Kim, his late father, and his grandfather.\n\nA chief concern is not only that Pyongyang will develop effective nuclear warheads but that they'll pair them with missiles that can strike targets around East Asia and perhaps beyond. North Korea has even repeatedly threatened to attack the United States, including saying last August that it would do so \"with tremendous muscle.\" A state television report in 2015 mentioned that such strikes could reach the American mainland.\n\nThere are strong doubts North Korea currently has the technology to mate a nuclear warhead to a missile that could travel 5,000 miles and hit the U.S. West Coast. However, much is still unknown about Pyongyang's military potential, and there's no disputing its bravado.\n\nOne anti-nuclear advocate thinks a lot of the talk is intended for internal consumption, to help Kim consolidate power, and is not proof of his military's abilities. \"To me, right now, it's a lot of bluster,\" said Philip Yun, executive director of the Ploughshares Fund, a group that calls for nuclear disarmament. \"For them to deliver on a threat, they have to have intent and they have to have capability. And quite frankly, I do not think they have both.\"",
    " Title: Former President Obama's Speaking Fees Under Scrutiny as Climate Change Address Fee Remains Unclear\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer President Barack Obama's speaking engagements have come under scrutiny as the fee for his upcoming climate change address in Milan remains undisclosed. The organization hosting the May 8-11 Italian summit, Seeds & Chips, and Obama's team have declined to reveal the amount he is being paid for the event.\n\nWhile a publication estimated the total cost for all 3,500 tickets to the event on food innovation and climate change at a potential $3.2 million, this figure is believed to be the total cost for the tickets, not Obama's speaking fee. The Express replaced an earlier story with an updated one that made no mention of any speaking fee, and representatives for Obama did not respond to Fox News' request for comment. Michela Gelati, a spokesperson for Seeds & Chips, told Fox News that they did not have the information.\n\nThe secrecy surrounding Obama's potential payday comes after he raised eyebrows by signing on for two lucrative speaking engagements that seemed to contradict his image as a champion of the 99%. In late April, it was reported that Obama would receive $400,000 for a talk on healthcare at a Wall Street conference run by Cantor Fitzgerald, a big Wall Street firm.\n\nEric Schultz, a spokesman for Obama, defended the former president, stating, \"With regard to this or any speech involving Wall Street sponsors, I'd just point out that in 2008 Barack Obama raised more money from Wall Street than any candidate in history -- and still went on to successfully pass and implement the toughest reforms on Wall Street since FDR.\"\n\nObama's spokesman added that the former president will continue to give the occasional speech but will devote much of his time to writing his book and \"focusing his post-presidency work on training and elevating a new generation of political leaders in America.\"\n\nLess than a week after news broke about his planned speech at the Cantor Fitzgerald conference, The New York Post reported that Obama was paid another $400,000 for his appearance at the A&E Networks advertising upfront at The Pierre Hotel in New York City.\n\nWhile Obama's speaking fees may be nothing new for a former president, he has also come under scrutiny for allegedly using his tax-exempt Obama Foundation as a money generator. Critics warn that the operation is starting to look like the controversial Clinton Foundation, which took in tens of millions of dollars and sparked \"pay-to-play\" accusations. In an apparent effort to avoid such comparisons, Obama said in January that he would not accept contributions from for-profit entities, federal lobbyists, or foreign nationals or agents while in office.\n\nIt is not uncommon for former presidents to earn significant speaking fees after leaving the Oval Office. Harry Truman refused to give speeches for money and called the practice exploitative, but that did not stop Gerald Ford, who was the first president known to take advantage of the speaking circuit after leaving office in 1977, earning as much as $40,000 per speech. Bill Clinton, who normally charges between $250,000 and $500,000 per engagement, was paid a whopping $750,000 to give a talk in Hong Kong in 2011, while his successor, George W. Bush, has reportedly made somewhere between $20 million and $35 million in speaking fees since he left office in 2009. Shortly after leaving office in 1989, Ronald Reagan was paid around $2 million to go on a speaking tour of Japan.",
    " Title: Harry Reid Plans 2016 Reelection Bid Amidst Republican Anticipation\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has announced his intention to run for reelection in 2016, three years ahead of the scheduled election. This announcement comes as Republicans eagerly anticipate the November 2016 elections, marking the end of President Barack Obama's tenure.\n\nReid, a controversial figure among Republicans due to his inflammatory rhetoric and hardball tactics during the government shutdown, is reportedly preparing for a potential onslaught from the GOP. In an interview last week, the 73-year-old senator confirmed his plans to run for a sixth term.\n\nThe senator is reportedly ramping up his campaign organization and seeking commitments from aides to stay with him through 2016. He is also spending more time fundraising, traveling to locations such as New York and Southern California. If GOP Governor Brian Sandoval of Nevada is reelected next year, he will be in the middle of a second term in 2016, potentially positioning him as a rival for Reid's Senate seat.\n\nReid warned a potential GOP opponent, stating, \"If he wants to run midterm, let him. I would remind him and everybody else that doesn't work very well. Anytime anyone who is a governor leaves midterm, it just doesn't work very well.\"\n\nReid's polarizing nature has increased due to his pugnacious stance during the shutdown fight. His strategy has been successful in keeping Democrats together, a challenging task given the political climate. Removing him from his position as the powerful majority leader has become a leading Republican campaign pitch in the run-up to the 2014 midterms, two years before he will be the top GOP target in the country during his own race.\n\nWhether Reid is merely posturing to avoid being viewed as a lame duck remains to be seen. He could ultimately change his mind and decide not to run for a sixth term. Alternatively, his decision could be influenced by changes in the political landscape, such as a potential Republican takeover of the Senate in 2014 or the loss of his majority leader title, which he has held for over six years.\n\nReid is optimistic about Democrats' prospects in 2014, even believing the party may gain seats next year. He attributes the Republicans' handling of the government shutdown as a factor in the GOP's weakening position.\n\nWhen asked if he was bluffing about running in 2016, Reid responded, \"I guarantee you that I haven't spent all that money [just] to show strength during the shutdown. To have a campaign operation that I have is not easy.\"\n\nThanks to August fundraising swings in Nevada's Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas, as well as Southern California, Reid's campaign and political action committee account raised over $600,000 in the third quarter, surpassing the $407,000 he raised during a similar period in 2010. At a similar point in the last cycle, Reid had raised $5.6 million, compared to the $5.5 million he has raised so far this cycle.\n\nDespite the potential for an even stronger GOP target in 2016 than in 2010, when Reid managed to secure a victory despite suffering low approval ratings and a national Republican effort to oust him, Reid is expected to remain a significant target for the GOP. Reid has been criticized for his constant derision of the Republican party, using words like \"extreme\" and \"anarchists\" to describe conservative Republicans in the House and Senate. He has also been vocal in his criticism of the GOP's relentless drive to dismantle Obamacare.\n\nReid's tactics during the shutdown fight have further solidified his status as a thorn in the side of the GOP. Reid has publicly disclosed private conversations he had with House Speaker John Boehner to make the case that the Ohio Republican had backed off an earlier agreement to pass a government funding bill with no policy restrictions attached. After Boehner publicly demanded killing federal dollars for health coverage of lawmakers and their staff, a series of private emails between top Reid and Boehner aides were leaked to the media, detailing Boehner's secret maneuvering for those very same subsidies.\n\nNot only has Reid ridiculed the GOP strategy to tie Obamacare to the shutdown fight, but he has also refused to schedule votes on House GOP bills to fund popular agencies and programs one at a time. Additionally, despite Boehner's demands, Reid refuses to negotiate with Republicans until they agree to pass a Senate bill to keep the government open until mid-November.\n\nThese actions have driven Republicans to frustration, with Rep. Tom Rooney (R-FL) stating, \"He's the most uncompromising politician I've encountered in the past five years. He's the guy more than anybody that thwarts progress.\" When asked about some of his rhetoric, Reid seemed to acknowledge his reputation for gaffes but was unapologetic about his tough talk.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Adds 288,000 Jobs in April, Unemployment Rate Drops to 6.3%\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. economy added 288,000 jobs in April, marking the strongest month for job growth in two years, according to the Department of Labor. This figure surpassed economists' forecasts, causing stocks to rise following the news, although they have since fallen back. The unemployment rate decreased to 6.3%, down from 6.7% in March.\n\nThe severe winter had previously hindered various economic statistics, including the housing market, retail sales, and manufacturing. The jobs numbers for February and March were revised higher on Friday, indicating that the economy has moved past the winter lull.\n\nHowever, the unemployment rate, derived from a survey of households, paints a more discouraging picture. This data shows a decrease in the number of Americans joining the labor force and a decline in the number of people reporting employment. These trends led to the unemployment rate's decrease to 6.3%, its lowest level since September 2008.\n\nA Department of Labor spokesperson noted that the drop in participation is not due to discouraged workers leaving the labor force, but rather to fewer young people entering the job market for the first time and more seniors retiring and staying that way. Participation also decreased among the prime working-age population, which is a concerning sign, according to Diane Swonk, chief economist for Mesirow Financial.\n\nEconomists advise against drawing overly optimistic conclusions from a single month of data. They emphasize that the big picture remains the same. The employment data can fluctuate from month to month, and while this month's report is above expectations, it is still consistent with the recent trends in the labor market.\n\nThe jobs recovery has been ongoing for four years, and long-term unemployment remains elevated, with 3.5 million people out of a job for six months or more. Economists estimate it could take at least another two years until the job market returns to its pre-recession health, when the unemployment rate was around 4% to 5%.\n\nThe positive aspect of the recovery is that it is now broad-based across many industries. For instance, professional and business services is one of the strongest sectors for job growth, adding 75,000 jobs in April and over 660,000 jobs over the past 12 months. Many of these jobs are likely to be office jobs paying mid- to high-level wages.\n\nRetail, restaurants and bars\u2014traditionally low-wage industries\u2014have also experienced strong job growth, and blue-collar industries like manufacturing and construction are on the upswing. The only major sector that continues to cut jobs is the federal government, which has reduced 83,000 positions over the past 12 months.",
    " Title: Sen. Dianne Feinstein Discusses Potential Hillary Clinton Presidency and Foreign Policy Expertise\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) discussed the potential presidency of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her foreign policy expertise. While not issuing a formal endorsement, Feinstein expressed her belief that a Clinton presidency would result in a top foreign policy expert in the White House.\n\nWhen asked about the recent comments by Karl Rove regarding Clinton's health, Feinstein called Rove's questioning of Clinton's cognitive abilities a \"pathetic\" attempt to sway voters against the most talked-about Democratic Party candidate for 2016.\n\nWhen Candy Crowley, the interviewer, pressed on the legitimacy of Rove's underlying question about Clinton's health, Feinstein responded, according to Mediaite, \"That she has sustained brain damage? That's legitimate?... In my view, she's in the prime of her political life. She has all the elements of a good leader, plus the fact\u2014and this is not to be underestimated\u2014she is enormously attractive to people. She carries the torch for women, who are the majority of votes in this country, very strongly and holds it very high. I think people respond to her.\"\n\nFeinstein then referenced Clinton's upcoming book as a means of highlighting her foreign policy background. \"I think the book will likely carry a good bit of her thinking on various big issues, certainly foreign policy, certainly the Secretary of State, and we would have someone in the White House who would have a real background in foreign policy,\" Feinstein said, according to Mediaite.\n\n\"I think that's critical at this point in the world with Russia expanding, with Africa becoming real problems from a terror point of view, and on and on and on,\" she added. The specifics of Clinton's book and its contents were not discussed in the interview.",
    " Title: Testimony of Fiona Hill and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: U.S.-Ukraine Relations and Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nIn March 2019, the situation at the U.S. embassy in Ukraine and U.S.-Ukraine relations underwent significant changes. The priorities of security, economy, and justice, as well as U.S. support for Ukrainian democratic resistance to Russian aggression, were overshadowed by a political agenda promoted by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and a group of officials with a direct channel to the White House.\n\nDuring a hearing, Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council (NSC) senior director for Europe and Russia, stated that some members of the committee seemed to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against the U.S. in 2016, and that Ukraine may have been responsible for the attack. Hill emphasized that this narrative was a fictional one, perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services.\n\nHill also mentioned that the hold on the security assistance may have been lifted, but there were still unfulfilled demands, such as a meeting with the president in the Oval Office. She added that this situation might still persist.\n\nRegarding Rudy Giuliani's actions, Hill stated that his remarks were explosive and incendiary, and that he was pushing forward issues and ideas that would likely cause problems for the U.S. She also mentioned a confrontation with Ambassador Sondland and expressed her irritation with him for not coordinating effectively.\n\nHill was asked about the accusations against Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who served as a National Security Council (NSC) expert on Ukraine. In response, Hill stated that she and her colleagues felt it was deeply unfair to suggest that Vindman, as an immigrant, was not loyal to America.\n\nDuring the hearing, Hill also discussed a conversation with Ambassador Sondland, in which he proposed a deal involving a meeting with the president in exchange for Ukraine announcing investigations into 2016 and Burisma. Hill cut off the deal when she realized that Burisma was a code for the Bidens, as Giuliani was promoting this narrative publicly.\n\nWhen asked if her boss, Ambassador John Bolton, described Giuliani as a \"hand grenade,\" Hill confirmed that he did. She explained that Bolton meant that Giuliani's actions and the narrative he was promoting would backfire.\n\nThe hearing concluded with Hill's statement that it was time for the ongoing impeachment inquiry to end, and she thanked the committee for their service. During the hearing, Hill was given the opportunity to respond, and she emphasized that all witnesses who testified under a legal obligation also felt a moral obligation to do so, and that they came as fact witnesses to ensure the American people could make informed choices in the 2020 presidential election without fear.",
    " Title: YouTube Investing Mid-Six-Figure Sum in TYT's Digital-First Local News Online Course\n\nArticle:\n\nGoogle-owned YouTube is investing a significant sum, reported to be in the mid-six-figures range, in The Young Turks (TYT) to launch an online course called TYT Academy. The course focuses on the creation of digital-first local news. This investment is part of YouTube's $25 million commitment to news efforts, which is part of the $300 million Google News Initiative announced in 2018.\n\nAs one of YouTube's most successful publishers with 4.6 million subscribers on its main account and millions of followers across its affiliated channels, TYT is a logical fit for this type of investment. The new class features a two-track video series, with each containing eight videos. Users will take short quizzes along the way, and must pass a final exam after completing each track to earn a TYT Academy certificate.\n\nThe first track covers journalism tactics and responsibilities, while the second track focuses on best practices for online video production across multiple online platforms, not just YouTube. For now, the course is in a trial period, with TYT planning to expand the program more broadly after first testing it with 10-15 people. The goal of the class is to engage everyday people in digital media so that they can help report on their local communities.\n\nWhile TYT takes a strong progressive position as an outlet, Steven Oh, TYT\u2019s Chief Business Officer and the creator of TYT Academy, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 on a phone call that TYT is \"not interested in cranking out journalists who share our political viewpoint whatsoever.\"\n\nFacebook has also invested in online news courses from publishers. In December, \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that Facebook would be funding an online deepfakes course for newsrooms by Reuters. The videos for this course, which have been online for about two months, appear to be nonpartisan, but it's notable that YouTube is investing in a course from TYT, which has a progressive bent. Facebook has said that it will include partisan publishers like Breitbart in its news tab, but has not necessarily paid Breitbart. The company has not released a list of all of the publishers who are being paid.",
    " Title: Idaho Wedding Chapel Owners Face Legal Action for Refusing to Perform Same-sex Weddings\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo Christian ministers, Donald and Evelyn Knapp, who own the Hitching Post Wedding Chapel in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, are facing potential legal action for refusing to perform same-sex weddings, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court on Friday. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a legal organization, is representing the Knapps.\n\nThe lawsuit states that the wedding chapel is registered with the state as a \"religious corporation\" limited to performing \"one-man-one-woman marriages as defined by the Holy Bible.\" However, the chapel is also registered as a for-profit business, not as a church or place of worship. City officials argue that this means the owners must comply with a local nondiscrimination ordinance, which prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and applies to housing, employment, and public accommodation.\n\nCity Attorney Warren Wilson reportedly told The Spokesman-Review in May that the Hitching Post Wedding Chapel would likely be required to follow the ordinance. He also told television station KXLY that any wedding chapel that turns away a gay couple would in theory be violating the law, potentially facing a misdemeanor citation.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Wilson confirmed that even ordained ministers would be required to perform same-sex weddings if they refused. If they refused, Wilson reportedly told the ministers that they could be fined up to $1,000 and sentenced to up to 180 days in jail.\n\nUntil last week, gay marriage was not legal in Idaho. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an order on May 13 allowing same-sex marriages to commence in Idaho on Oct. 15. Two days later, the Hitching Post received a telephone call inquiring about a same-sex wedding ceremony, which they declined, putting them in violation of the law. City officials did not respond to requests for an interview or to requests from local news outlets.\n\n\"The government should not force ordained ministers to act contrary to their faith under threat of jail time and criminal fines,\" said Jeremy Tedesco, the ADF attorney representing the Knapps. \"The city is on seriously flawed legal ground, and our lawsuit intends to ensure that this couple's freedom to adhere to their own faith as pastors is protected, just as the First Amendment intended.\"\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom also filed a temporary restraining order to stop the city from enforcing the ordinance. \"The Knapps are in fear that if they exercise their First Amendment rights they will be cited, prosecuted, and sent to jail,\" Tedesco said.\n\nThe lawsuit comes at a time when similar incidents are occurring across the country, with the city of Houston issuing subpoenas demanding that five Christian pastors turn over sermons dealing with homosexuality and gender identity.\n\n\"Government officials are making clear they will use their government power to punish those who oppose the advances of homosexual activists,\" said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. \"Americans are witnesses to the reality that redefining marriage is less about the marriage altar and more about fundamentally altering the freedoms of the other 98 percent of Americans.\"\n\nThe incidents in Houston and Coeur d'Alene are the latest examples of a disturbing trend in the culture war, with direct attacks on clergy. \"Government officials are making clear they will use their government power to punish those who oppose the advances of homosexual activists,\" Perkins said. \"No one should be discriminated against, but have you noticed that any time a city passes a 'nondiscrimination' ordinance, it's the Christians who wind up being discriminated against?\"",

Known as Mrs. Ronald Reagan, she was a close confidant and played a significant role in her husband's career and presidency.\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan died in 2004, an ABC News report stated that \"their love story has always been a part of the presidential story.\" The New York Times described Mrs. Reagan as a \"fierce guardian of her husband's image, sometimes at the expense of her own.\"\n\nReagan biographer Craig Shirley wrote in his book Last Act: The Final Years and Enduring Legacy of Ronald Reagan, \"They were best friends and soul mates, and his letters over the years left no doubt as to the depth of their mutual love.\" Shirley once said in an interview, \"Mrs. Reagan was a balm to him, and he hated being on the road without her. His diaries recount on several occasions how much he missed her when she was traveling.\"\n\nThe world may not have had the man who won the Cold War if it was not for the driving force of Nancy in his life. Michael Deaver, a Ronald Reagan aide, once said, \"Without Nancy, there would have been no Governor Reagan, no President Reagan.\"\n\nRonald and Nancy Reagan met in 1949 when Ronald was the head of the Screen Actors Guild. They married three years later, and their bond was deep and a driving force behind Ronald Reagan's relentless and successful political career.\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 1994, Nancy became his primary caretaker until his death in 2004. Throughout that time, she remained a guardian of his legacy.\n\nToday, the nation mourns the loss of Nancy Reagan, a true example of integrity and grace.

    " Title: White House and Presidential Candidates Face Criticism Over Pay Equity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a demonstration of equal pay for women on Tuesday, President Barack Obama declared the day as National Equal Pay Day, symbolizing the number of days a woman needs to work in a year to earn as much as her male counterpart did in the previous year. The President stated that on average, full-time working women earn 78 cents for every dollar earned by men, with women of color facing a more significant disparity.\n\nHowever, an analysis of White House salaries from last July revealed a 13% pay gap between male and female staffers, with female staffers earning less on average. During her time in the U.S. Senate, Hillary Clinton, a leading presidential contender, also faced criticism for paying women in her office 72 cents for each dollar paid to men, according to an analysis by the Washington Free Beacon. The report found a gender gap of 28% between the median annual salary for female staffers and men between 2002 and 2008.\n\nSupporters of Clinton argue that she was a consistent advocate for equal-pay legislation in the Senate and was an original sponsor of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, signed by President Obama in 2009 to expand workers' rights to take pay discrimination cases to court.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz stated Tuesday that Democrats are \"proud to fight for equal pay every single day.\" In 2009, women at the White House were paid on average $72,700, while male staffers were paid $82,000. By 2014, women staffers earned $78,400, compared to the average male salaries of $88,600. White House aides have stated that men and women staffers who hold the same job description are paid the same, but there are more men in higher-paying jobs.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) attacked GOP presidential candidates on Tuesday over their pay-equity policies, criticizing former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, and others for either downplaying the importance of the issue or enacting policies that were said to be unfavorable to female workers.\n\nIn Congress, Democrats are offering the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would allow employees to share information about their pay and file lawsuits against an employer. On the Republican side, a coalition of four senators, led by Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska, has offered an amendment to the bill that would prohibit retaliation against employees for discussing salaries and provide grants to states to create industry-led partnerships to address disparities of opportunity.",
    " Title: House Approves Strict Syrian and Iraqi Refugee Background Check Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday that aims to block Syrian and Iraqi refugees from entering the country unless they pass stringent background checks. The bill received near unanimous support from Republicans, with 47 Democrats also voting in favor, despite a last-minute effort by the Obama administration to persuade House Democrats to oppose the Republican-written bill.\n\nWith 289 \"yes\" votes, the bill secured a veto-proof majority for the measure, marking a significant loss for the White House, which has expressed concerns about the bill's potential impact on the refugee resettlement process. The vote was a rebuke of President Barack Obama by House Democrats who felt that the administration failed to make a compelling case for why they should vote against the Republican-authored bill, given the political implications of doing so.\n\nNew York Democrat Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney stated, \"I think a lot of us went in with open minds and really wanted to understand the administration's position on this. It is offensive to me that we would stigmatize refugees...but if you read the bill, what you find is that you have a pretty simple certification process sitting on top of an existing and extensive screening process that most of us believe works pretty well.\"\n\nThe bill, known as the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, requires the FBI, Homeland Security Department, and the director of national intelligence to certify to Congress that any refugee from Syria or Iraq is \"not a threat to the security of the United States\" before being allowed to settle in the United States. President Obama has proposed allowing 10,000 Syrian refugees to enter the country this year, as part of the Western response to the wave of refugees fleeing Syria's bloody civil war and Islamic State-related violence.\n\nThe measure faces an uncertain future in the Senate, with Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) stating that the Syria bill will not make it to Obama's desk. Senators are likely to attempt to attach the measure as a rider to the government spending bill that Congress has to address in December.\n\nConservative House Republicans have signaled they will not vote to support December's so-called omnibus bill unless it includes beefed-up provisions for vetting Syrian refugees. Meanwhile, House Democrats are calling for a budget bill free of all contentious policy riders.\n\nThe final vote was 289-137, with House Democratic leaders urging their colleagues to oppose the legislation but not formally whipping votes. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) made an informal whip count Wednesday night to gauge where the caucus stands.\n\nThe White House dispatched Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson to Capitol Hill to speak with Democrats just hours before the House vote. However, their presentation did not receive wide support in the room, with multiple sources stating that the administration officials' \"in the weeds\" presentation did not sway many Democrats.\n\nRep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.), who voted for the bill, said he was not swayed by Johnson's pitch to Democrats that the Homeland Security Department doesn't have time to certify refugees. \"If you look at the bill, it's hard to see how it's as awful as the administration is portraying it as,\" Peters said.\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) stated that White House officials did not make an effective pitch during the meeting with Democrats, urging them to drop their opposition to the Republican bill. \"It's one more assurance that those coming into the country are screened,\" Connolly said of the GOP-sponsored measure. \"That seems to me not an imprudent measure under the circumstances.\"",
    " Title: John Kasich's 2016 Presidential Campaign: A Look Back\n\nArticle:\n\nJohn Kasich's 2016 presidential campaign, while not particularly successful, was a replay of former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman's unsuccessful 2012 bid for the Republican nomination, as both shared a campaign architect, the GOP strategist John Weaver. Despite a strategy that may have been more effective for Kasich than for Huntsman, it was not enough to secure the nomination or even come close.\n\nInitially, Kasich's strategy seemed plausible, as he placed second to Donald Trump in New Hampshire, the nation's first primary and second nominating contest. However, with a significant focus on New Hampshire, Kasich lacked infrastructure for the rest of the campaign and was insignificant in the South Carolina primary. By the time the campaign reached his home state, Kasich was effectively out of the running. He won only Ohio, and closed out the campaign with fewer delegates than Senator Marco Rubio, who dropped out on March 15.\n\nKasich's pitch to voters was that, amid a field of volatile and unpredictable characters like Trump and radicals like Ted Cruz, he was an old-style conservative who could also win swing states like Ohio. His policy theme, if one could be discerned, was his advocacy for a balanced-budget amendment, a vague promise tied to his work on balancing the national budget while in the U.S. House in the 1990s. The extent of his involvement in that work was a subject of debate.\n\nHowever, some of Kasich's other policy stances were at odds with much of the Republican Party. As governor, he accepted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, a move that was criticized by conservatives. He justified his decision by invoking faith, stating, \"When you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he\u2019s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small. But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer.\"\n\nMany of Kasich's former colleagues viewed his image as a soft, cuddly, friendly politician with skepticism, recalling a more irritable, angry Kasich. The problem was that Republican primary voters in 2016 did not want a sane, rational nominee; they wanted a Trump.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Faces Challenge in Meeting 21 Million Obamacare Enrollment Target for 2016\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's administration is facing a significant challenge in enrolling more than 21 million Americans in Obamacare exchange plans next year, as per budget projections, marking the next major test for the health care law. As of June, the Department of Health and Human Services reported 9.9 million customers who have bought plans through the federal HealthCare.gov portal and a handful of state-run exchanges.\n\nThis figure places the administration ahead of its own estimates for 2015 but is less than half of what the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected for 2016, indicating the work that officials have ahead as the next round of enrollment begins in less than two months. Industry analysts view the CBO's estimate for next year as \"overly optimistic\" and a \"stretch,\" suggesting it will take more time for the law to attract that many people onto the Web-based markets.\n\nOpen enrollment for the third go-around of Obamacare's exchanges begins on November 1, and the administration is counting on winning over millions of customers who did not sign up in the first two years but could be pressured by the increasing pain of the \"individual mandate\" tax assessed on those who forgo health insurance.\n\nThe tax during the first year was $95 or 1% of income above the filing threshold\u2014a relatively minor bite. This year, the penalty will be $325 or 2% of income, and by 2016 it will be $695 or 2.5% of income.\n\n\"The substantial increase in penalties under the individual mandate next year is a big wild card,\" said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy organization. \"We're in uncharted territory here about how effective these bigger penalties will be in nudging people to get insured.\"\n\nThe individual mandate was included in the Affordable Care Act of 2010 to ensure enough healthy Americans signed up, spreading out the costs for higher-risk customers. A divided U.S. Supreme Court upheld the mandate in 2012 as an appropriate use of Congress' taxing power.\n\nHowever, congressional Republicans are still intent on scrapping the health care law, and may use a fast-track budget procedure known as \"reconciliation\" to take a swing at it. GOP leaders say they may not be able to eviscerate the law through the budget, but they plan to repeal the individual mandate.\n\nEven as it struggles to meet the 2016 enrollment projection, the Obama administration is on track on other measures, including a CBO estimate that 17 million fewer people lack insurance this year because of the health care law. Under political duress, the White House let customers transition to compliant plans to keep President Obama's notorious promise that people who like their plans can keep them under his law.\n\nThe Health and Human Services has begun to set its own, more modest goals for exchange enrollment, ignoring CBO's guess of 12 million for 2015 and setting the mark at 9.1 million enrollees. So far, it's besting its less ambitious goal. The agency says it is doing its own evaluation of the marketplace and will likely announce its enrollment targets for 2016 before signups begin in November.\n\n\"At this point, the Congressional Budget Office's projected enrollment total for 2016 seems overly optimistic,\" Mr. Levitt said. \"Enrollment may reach that level eventually, but I doubt it will happen by next year.\"",
    " Title: Republican Opposition to Obama's Cuba Policy Threatens Normalization Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's plan to normalize relations with Cuba has faced opposition from Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill, potentially hindering the new relationship with the communist country. Just hours after Obama announced a prisoner swap with the Cuban government for two Americans, Republicans began discussing ways to prevent changes to the U.S.-Cuba relationship.\n\nRepublicans have proposed measures such as denying Obama funds to reopen an embassy in Havana, stalling the nomination of a potential ambassador, voting down a bill to open up travel more widely, and ignoring requests from the White House to lift a decades-old embargo. With Republicans set to control the Senate next year, they would be in a strong position to implement some of these plans. However, even if they cannot fully stop Obama, who has some authority to act without Congress, the dispute will provide another opportunity for the president's Hill rivals, including 2016 likely hopefuls Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, to question his use of executive action\u2014a theme Republicans had already planned to take on next year regarding Obama's moves on immigration and Obamacare.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) stated on Twitter Wednesday, \"I will do all in my power to block the use of funds to open an embassy in Cuba. Normalizing relations with Cuba is a bad idea at a bad time.\"\n\nIn a White House address on Wednesday, Obama announced that he would direct Secretary of State John Kerry to review Cuba's place on a list of state sponsors of terrorism, reestablish an embassy in Havana, and ease travel restrictions. Obama also stated that the U.S. would increase remittance levels, expand commercial sales, and exports.\n\n\"We will end an outdated approach that for decades has failed to advance our interests,\" Obama said. \"Neither the American nor the Cuban people are well-served by a rigid policy that is rooted in events that took place before most of us were born.\"\n\nRepublicans will control the Senate starting in January, giving them the power to block presidential nominations. Already, a number of influential Republicans vocal on foreign affairs, including Graham, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Rubio (R-Fla.), and Cruz have stated their staunch opposition to Obama's plans.\n\nObama also called on Congress to pursue legislation that would lift the 50-year embargo against goods and travel to Cuba. However, Speaker John Boehner stated he would not allow any Cuban-U.S. relations to be revisited in the House.\n\nIncoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he would defer the upper chamber's response to Cuba policy changes to Rubio, who criticized Obama for threatening U.S. national security concerns.\n\nSome Republicans have already cast doubt on the Obama administration's legal authority to roll back some travel restrictions and allow increased numbers of Cuban cigars to be brought into the U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) stated that action by Obama \"may be in direct violation of Helms-Burton that specifically states that all political prisoners must be released and free and fair elections must be held before establishing a diplomatic relationship.\"\n\nThe incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Tennessee Republican Bob Corker, gave few details on Wednesday on what his panel would do to halt any of Obama's proposals.\n\n\"The new U.S. policy announced by the administration is no doubt sweeping, and as of now, there is no real understanding as to what changes the Cuban government is prepared to make,\" he said. \"We will be closely examining the implications of these major policy changes in the next Congress.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats were mixed in their response to Obama's plans. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the current chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, was highly critical of Obama's proposals. However, House Minority Nancy Pelosi hailed Obama's \"new chapter.\"\n\n\"It is clear that policy of isolating Cuba is serving neither the interests of the American people nor the democratic aspirations of the Cubans,\" Pelosi said. \"We must acknowledge our policy towards Cuba is a relic of a bygone era that weakens our leadership in the Americas and has not advanced freedom and prosperity in Cuba.\"",
    " Title: The Impact of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) on Federal Budget: A Long-term Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has been a subject of debate among politicians regarding its impact on the federal budget. Democrats argue it will lead to savings, while Republicans claim it could lead to increased deficits.\n\nInitially, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the Affordable Care Act, passed in March 2010, would reduce deficits by over $100 billion in the first decade and significantly more in the second decade, equating to half a percent of economic growth. This could potentially mean reducing deficits by more than $1 trillion.\n\nHowever, the CBO's estimate assumes the law will be implemented exactly as written, which may not be sustainable over a long period. The CBO itself noted that the ACA would \"put into effect a number of policies that might be difficult to sustain over a long period of time.\"\n\nSeveral changes have already been made to the law, and more are being proposed. For example, there is a push to repeal Obamacare's tax on medical devices, expected to raise about $30 billion over the next decade. There is also concern that Congress may struggle to adhere to various cost-containment provisions in the law.\n\nIf lawmakers continue to make changes, the potential deficit reduction could be compromised. For instance, if they phase out key provisions intended to restrain spending growth in Medicare and do not implement a policy to slow the growth of health insurance subsidies, deficits could increase.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office conducted a long-range simulation that included these and other assumptions about the broader budget. In such a scenario, deficits would increase by 0.7% of GDP over the next 75 years, primarily due to increased spending on Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and subsidies offered on the health insurance exchanges.\n\nThe impact of Obamacare on the federal budget remains uncertain, as it is a complex law with various components that phase in and out over time. The growth in national health spending, of which federal spending is a significant part, has fallen to a record low rate. Part of this slowing is attributed directly or indirectly to the ACA, but the exact extent is unclear.\n\nThe growth rate is expected to rise in the next few years as more people become insured under Obamacare. It remains to be seen whether the new health insurance exchanges will attract a diverse pool of enrollees and generate enough competition to fulfill the law's promise of providing affordable health care for most Americans.\n\nJoshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a deficit watchdog group, is optimistic about Obamacare's long-term impact on the country's fiscal outlook due to the changes hospitals, doctors, and insurance companies are already making to slow cost growth. However, he expresses concern about the potential for Congress to interfere and disrupt these efforts.\n\nGordon stated, \"Underneath this surface fight over Obamacare, there's a huge amount of change and consensus on different ways to slow down health care costs and shift to a value-based health care system.\" The uncertainty lies in the potential for Congress to disrupt this progress.",
    " Title: McConnell Calls for Roy Moore to Step Aside Amid Sexual Misconduct Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has called for GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore to \"step aside\" following sexual misconduct allegations against him. During a tax reform press conference in Louisville, Ky., McConnell stated, \"I think he should step aside.\"\n\nThe Washington Post published a story last week detailing allegations that Moore pursued relationships with teenage girls, including an account from Leigh Corfman, who said she had a sexual encounter with Moore in 1979 when she was 14 years old and he was 32. The report also included accounts from three other women who said Moore attempted to court them around that time, when they were between 16 and 18 years old.\n\nMoore, in a tweet on Monday, said McConnell is the person who should step aside. \"He has failed conservatives and must be replaced,\" Moore said, using the hashtag \u201c DrainTheSwamp.\u201d\n\nIf Moore withdraws from the Senate race, Republicans are stuck with his name remaining on the ballot. The deadline for the party to remove Moore's name from the ballot passed in October, though Republicans could mount a write-in challenge. Republicans have also floated trying to move back the December special election date.\n\nMcConnell said Monday that the party is exploring a write-in bid, though he declined to say specifically who would be the candidate. When asked if Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who Moore defeated in the GOP primary runoff, would be the write-in candidate, McConnell added, \"We'll see.\"\n\nMoore has denied wrongdoing and threatened to sue The Washington Post, arguing the story is politically motivated and aimed at damaging him ahead of the December special election.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) have also called on Moore to step aside, with Collins stating, \"I believe the individuals speaking out against Roy Moore spoke with courage and truth, proving he is unfit to serve in the United States Senate and he should not run for office.\"\n\nRepublicans are increasingly retreating from the Alabama Senate candidate, with Alabama Republicans publicly defending Moore and warning that if he left the race it would hand the Senate seat to Democratic candidate Doug Jones. Despite the blowback nationally from Republican officials and lawmakers, Moore is using the backlash in his fundraising appeals, saying that \"establishment Republicans are colluding with the Obama-Clinton Machine.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Foreign Policy and Terrorism: A Political Analysis of the 2016 Presidential Debate and Paris Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Paris attacks in 2015, where over 100 people were killed by ISIS-related terrorists, former President Barack Obama stated that ISIS was \"contained.\" This statement sparked controversy, as some liberals argued that the attacks in Paris demonstrated the success of Obama's approach, as ISIS was forced to resort to such attacks to gain attention.\n\nDuring the 2016 Democratic debate, candidates discussed foreign policy and terrorism. Bernie Sanders reiterated his belief that global warming is the greatest threat to humanity and the root cause of terrorism in the Middle East. Martin O'Malley expressed his intention to bring 60,000 Syrian refugees into the U.S., despite some refugees being involved in the Paris attacks. The White House Deputy National Security Advisor confirmed that the refugee importation plan would proceed as planned.\n\nThe Republican Party is traditionally less successful in domestic policy elections, but excels in foreign policy. The American public appears to favor a President who is willing to take decisive action against terrorists without being overly idealistic. The Democratic Party has been criticized for being naive and delusional in their approach to foreign policy.\n\nHillary Clinton, a Democratic candidate, has faced criticism for her foreign policy proposals. John Podhoretz noted that her policy solutions are a jumble of contradictory statements. She stated that ISIS must be \"rooted out\" and implicitly criticized Obama for containing ISIS, while also stating that it cannot be an American fight. She emphasized the importance of American leadership, but also downplayed the U.S.'s responsibility in the fight against ISIS.\n\nIn a surprising turn, Clinton suggested that Syria's dictator, Bashar al-Assad, should take the lead in the fight against ISIS, despite his role in the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of his own people and the refugee crisis in Europe.\n\nThe Republican Party's focus on foreign policy and their willingness to take decisive action against terrorists has been well-received by the American public. The Democratic Party's approach to foreign policy, particularly in regards to ISIS, has been criticized for being naive and delusional. The debate over the best approach to terrorism and foreign policy continues to be a contentious issue in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.",
    " Title: Historic Milestone: 100 Women in U.S. Congress for the First Time\n\nArticle:\n\nTuesday's midterm elections marked a significant milestone in American politics as the number of women in Congress will reach 100 for the first time in the nation's history. This milestone, however, highlights the fact that more than 80% of the country's federal legislators are still men.\n\nThe increase in female representation will be approximately 1%, with women making some gains but not significantly altering the gender imbalance. The low number of women with political power in Washington is a concern, as it is far lower than in most advanced democracies.\n\nAccording to Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, women tend to enter politics because they want to solve a problem or address a policy issue, while men often run for political careers. This difference in motivation may contribute to the gender imbalance in Congress, as women who want to make a difference may look elsewhere when Congress fails to serve as a place for solutions.\n\nOther factors contributing to the gender imbalance include the challenges of raising vast sums of money, entering politics later in life, and the incumbent advantage that preserves the status quo. It is important to note that when women do run, they win in similar numbers as men, and women in Congress tend to function as consensus builders.\n\nThere have been several firsts for women in this election cycle. The Senate will have its first female combat veteran, Joni Ernst, who will join a small group of women veterans now serving in the House. Ernst is also the first woman from Iowa to be elected to Congress.\n\nAnother notable first is Mia Love, the first black woman ever elected to Congress as a member of the Republican Party. Love, a 38-year-old Haitian-American convert to Mormonism, ran for office in Utah as a champion of conservative self-reliance.\n\nThe story of women in American politics is one of persistent and very-slowly-eroding inequality. To break this pattern, more women need to run on both parties. Each victory is a sign to other women that politics is a field where they can succeed, and, as it happens, success for women would give the entire country, Democrats and Republicans, a real reason to celebrate.",

Clinton describes an uncomfortable encounter during a debate where Trump followed her closely, invading her personal space.\n\nClinton writes, \"We were on a small stage, and no matter where I walked, he followed me closely, staring at me, making faces. It was incredibly uncomfortable. He was literally breathing down my neck. My skin crawled.\"\n\nThe book discusses Clinton's decision to remain calm and continue with the debate rather than confronting Trump directly. Clinton states, \"I kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off.\"\n\nThe book has received criticism for its focus on Clinton's personal experiences and perceived obsession with sexism. In the book, Clinton references a speech by David Foster Wallace, \"This Is Water,\" to discuss the challenges of recognizing sexism, particularly in politics.\n\nClinton's book tour has sparked debate about her focus on her own experiences rather than the Democratic Party's future. The book offers insights into Clinton's perspective on various issues, including government's role in solving problems and the importance of the White House as a symbol of the nation. However, the book's intended insights are not the ones that have received the most attention.\n\nThe book has been met with mixed reviews, with some praising Clinton's candidness and others criticizing her focus on personal experiences rather than the broader political landscape. The book serves as a recollection of the 2016 election, offering a unique perspective on one of the most contentious and closely watched elections in American history.",
    " Title: CBS Debate Moderator Elaine Quijano Criticized for Perceived Bias in Vice Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe vice presidential debate on Tuesday, October 4, at Longwood University was marked by a perceived bias from moderator Elaine Quijano, according to conservative critics. The debate, which was moderated by Quijano, the CBS News anchor, was compared to a \"Groundhog Day\" scenario, with the moderator asking tough questions primarily to the Republican candidate, Vice Presidential nominee Mike Pence, while allowing Democratic nominee Senator Tim Kaine to interrupt at will.\n\nQuijano started the debate by asking Kaine about the public's perception of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's trustworthiness. However, she reserved most of her tough questions for Pence, asking him eight questions compared to just one for Kaine.\n\nThe New York Times acknowledged Quijano's bias, stating, \"Elaine Quijano, the moderator, helped Mr. Kaine along, opening one question with a recitation of Mr. Trump\u2019s statements.\" However, the Times later deleted that quote and eliminated any reference to the moderator in the story.\n\nConservatives, including Michael Barbaro of The New York Times and Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post, praised Pence's performance, with Cillizza listing Pence among the debate's \"winners.\" Even MSNBC's Chris Matthews, known for his pro-Democratic leanings, described Pence as \"eloquent,\" \"excellent,\" and \"looking like a grown-up.\"\n\nThe debate's bias was also evident in the social media comments from left-leaning outlets such as Fusion, which posted over 30 tweets pushing Kaine or attacking Trump/Pence, while only giving 10 tweets to Pence's message.\n\nQuijano's performance was compared to that of NBC's Lester Holt, who moderated the first presidential debate, and CNN's Jake Tapper, who will moderate the next debate, on October 9. Tapper, who is also a CNN anchor, admitted that Pence had won the debate, but questioned whether the media coverage would shift in the following days.\n\nDespite the perceived bias, Quijano did have some moments of fairness, such as when she asked Kaine to allow Pence to speak when they were both talking over each other. However, the total number of interruptions during the debate is expected to be a topic of discussion in the coming days.\n\nThe third and final debate between the vice presidential candidates will take place on October 9, with CNN's Anderson Cooper joining Quijano as a moderator.

    " Title: Minimum Wage Increase: CBO Report and Its Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe debate over increasing the minimum wage has gained significant attention, with proponents arguing that it is a viable solution to address low-wage worker issues, income inequality, and poverty. The policy is attractive due to its off-budget mechanism, which allows the government to distribute funds down the income scale without creating a politically vulnerable welfare program or incurring new debt.\n\nRecently, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an analysis concluding that a phased-in $10.10 minimum wage, as proposed by President Obama, would have a modest but real disemployment effect. The CBO projected that at $10.10, the minimum wage would reduce employment between a trivial amount and 1 million jobs by the end of 2016, with a best estimate of 500,000 jobs lost relative to a scenario with no increase.\n\nConservatives, who oppose any minimum wage increase, were elated with the CBO's findings, using it to support their claim that a $10.10 minimum wage is a job killer. However, the report's impact is large enough to command attention without inviting a ton of second-guessing, making it challenging for Democrats to spin away the findings.\n\nEconomist Austin Frakt offers a wise perspective on the minimum wage: if increasing the minimum wage entailed no downside, there would be no reason not to set it at an infinity-jillion dollars. Similarly, if establishing a minimum wage entailed no upside, the only reasonable argument would be to set it at $0.00. If the minimum wage entails both, then it should be set somewhere in between.\n\nWhile there may be concerns about the disemployment effect, the case for a $10.10 minimum wage is strong. According to the CBO, a $10.10 minimum wage would lift about twice as many people out of poverty (900,000) as it would leave without a job, and increase wages for nearly 20 times more people (16.5 million) than that.\n\nMoreover, a higher minimum wage could mitigate some of the consequences of Obamacare that conservatives find distressing. People who earn higher wages are less likely to quit their jobs, and when wages increase, they slide up the Affordable Care Act's means-tested benefit scale. In states that have expanded their Medicaid programs, a higher minimum wage would draw a significant number of new eligibles into the exchanges, creating savings for the federal government. In states that have refused to expand Medicaid, a higher minimum wage would pull people out of the coverage gap and make them eligible for tax credits on the exchanges, albeit at a cost to the federal government.\n\nWhile it is possible to increase the minimum wage beyond the point at which the costs outstrip the benefits, $10.10 is not that point. Conservatives, by contrast, overwhelmingly oppose having a minimum wage altogether, ignoring ancillary benefits such as those related to Obamacare and unemployment compensation.\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum wage debate is complex, with valid arguments on both sides. However, the CBO report's findings do not necessarily disprove the benefits of increasing the minimum wage, and ancillary benefits such as those related to Obamacare and unemployment compensation should be considered. The argument for a $10.10 minimum wage is strong, and the counterargument, while present, is not without its own inconsistencies.",
    " Title: Obama Proposes Community College Initiative, Tax Credits, and New Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama proposed a $60 billion initiative over a decade to fund community college education, along with a series of new tax credits aimed at the middle class. The proposals include a $500 tax credit for families with two working spouses, a $2,500 annual subsidy for college expenses, and a tripling of an existing tax break for college costs, up to $3,000.\n\nThe President emphasized the need to reconsider the approach towards child care, stating, \"It's time we stop treating child care as a side issue, or as a women's issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.\"\n\nIn foreign policy matters, Obama expressed a desire to shift the United States' approach towards Cuba, stating that the current strategy has been ineffective. He also expressed support for engaging in diplomatic talks with Iran to prevent nuclear weapon development and opposed new sanctions before these talks have concluded.\n\nThe President also called for legislation to strengthen protections against cyberattacks, citing recent high-profile cyberattacks, such as the one against Sony Pictures, which his administration attributed to North Korea. He emphasized the need for such legislation to protect the nation and its economy from foreign cyber threats.\n\n\"No foreign nation, no hacker should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids,\" Obama said. \"If we don't act, we'll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable. If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Reaffirms Justification for Syria Strikes, Threatens Further Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement at the United Nations on Friday, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley reiterated the Trump administration's position on the U.S.'s missile strikes on a Syrian airbase earlier this week in response to a chemical weapons attack that resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians, including children.\n\nHaley stated, \"We are prepared to do more, but we hope that won't be necessary.\" She echoed President Trump's call for \"all civilized nations to stop the horrors taking place in Syria and demand a political solution.\"\n\nHaley also argued that the responsibility for Syria's use of chemical weapons extends not only to President Bashar Assad, but to his allies in Iran and Russia. She suggested that Russia, entrusted with ensuring the removal of such weapons from Syria, may be knowingly allowing chemical weapons to remain in the war-torn country, or may be incompetent in its efforts to remove them.\n\nRussia, in response, has condemned the U.S. missile strikes and has promised to further bolster Syria's anti-aircraft defenses.\n\nAt an earlier meeting this week, Haley had hinted at the possibility of a unilateral U.S. strike against Syria, warning that \"when the international community fails in its duty to act collectively, there are times when states are compelled to take their own action.\" She reiterated this sentiment, stating, \"The indiscriminate use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians is one of those times.\"\n\nThe article does not provide specific details on what additional action the U.S. might be considering.",
    " Title: Traditional Conservative Newspaper Endorsements of Hillary Clinton Spark Backlash and Subscription Losses\n\nArticle:\n\nOver the past month, several traditionally conservative newspapers in the United States have endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, prompting backlash and subscription losses. The Cincinnati Enquirer, which hadn't endorsed a Democrat in nearly a century, and The Arizona Republic, which had only backed Republican presidential candidates in its 126-year history, have faced angry letters, subscription cancellations, and, in the case of The Arizona Republic, a death threat.\n\nThe Arizona Republic, in a scathing editorial this week, portrayed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as unqualified and not a true conservative. The Enquirer's editors acknowledged that breaking with a century-long tradition could lead to an uproar. Peter Bhatia, Enquirer editor, stated that the decision to endorse Clinton was an important part of the conversation when considering the paper's legacy and the potential backlash from readers. Since the endorsement last week, the paper has received angry letters and subscription cancellations \"in the triple digits.\"\n\nThe backlash, presumably from ardent Trump supporters, is not surprising, according to analysts. Trump has made anti-media sentiment a central theme of his campaign, and the billionaire businessman can dismiss Clinton endorsements as proof that the establishment, which includes top news outlets, is against him.\n\nThe Enquirer was aware that its Clinton endorsement could strengthen Trump's support, but felt obligated to make a statement about the presidential race. At least a dozen major American newspapers have endorsed Clinton, but none has backed Trump. Libertarian Gary Johnson has secured at least four major endorsements, including those of the Richmond Times-Dispatch and the New Hampshire Union Leader.\n\nIn addition to The Arizona Republic and the Cincinnati Enquirer, the Dallas Morning News and USA Today have also broken decades of precedent in their presidential endorsement decisions. USA Today, in its 34-year history, had never endorsed any presidential candidate, and it still technically didn't in Thursday's editorial calling Trump \"unfit for the presidency.\" It urged readers to vote, whether for Clinton or a third party, or in down-ballot races\u2014 \"just not for Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe Morning News, which hadn't endorsed a Democrat since World War II, was more explicit, urging readers this month to back Clinton. \"Clinton has made mistakes and displayed bad judgment, but her errors are plainly in a different universe,\" the Morning News editorial board wrote. \"Trump's values are hostile to conservatism.\"\n\nSince the Sept. 7 editorial, the paper is reporting a drop in subscriptions. In Arizona, Republic editors have lost subscribers and received at least one death threat, though this hasn't caused them to rethink their decision. \"We know we're doing the right thing,\" Phil Boas, director of the paper's editorial page, told The New York Times.\n\nWhile endorsements clearly are having an impact on newspaper subscriptions, there are questions about how much they affect the presidential race itself. Analysts say endorsements, in a broad context, do little to change the trajectory of a race, though they may play a role in pulling some voters away from long-shot third-party candidates.\n\n\"Newspaper editorials might also have an impact on those thinking of voting Libertarian or Green,\" said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University and formerly a top reporter and editor at Iowa's Des Moines Register. \"A lot of thoughtful voters are thinking about those options now, and a newspaper editorial might encourage them to stick with one of the candidates who actually has a chance of winning rather than casting a protest vote.\"",
    " Title: Democrats Push for Gun Purchases Ban by Terror Suspects, Face Opposition from Republicans and NRA\n\nArticle:\n\nCongressional Democrats are attempting to garner support for an initiative to prevent gun purchases by terror suspects, capitalizing on the same public concerns about security that contributed to the Republican's House victory. The Democratic push, led by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), is likely to face opposition from the National Rifle Association (NRA) and congressional gun-rights advocates, primarily Republicans, who have historically thwarted firearms restrictions.\n\nIf Republicans, who control Congress, block votes on the proposal, Democrats hope to gain political capital by appealing to voters' anger. In a statement released Friday, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) stated, \"By leaving this terrorist loophole open, Republicans are leaving every community in America vulnerable to attacks by terrorists armed with assault rifles and explosives purchased legally, in broad daylight.\"\n\nSenator Feinstein's bill aims to compile a list of known and suspected terrorists, likely drawing from existing government databases. Federally licensed gun dealers would be prohibited from selling firearms to individuals on this list if government officials believed they intended to use the weapons for terrorism.\n\nCurrently, gun dealers are prohibited from selling to 10 categories of people, including convicted criminals or those with severe mental illness. However, people on the government's terror watch lists, including those barred from air travel, are not automatically disqualified from purchasing weapons from gun dealers. The FBI is notified when a background check for the purchase of firearms or explosives generates a match with the watch list, and agents often use this information to intensify surveillance on suspects.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2014, individuals on one terror watch list underwent background checks to buy guns 2,233 times and were allowed to make the purchase 91 percent of the time, according to a March report by the Government Accountability Office, an investigative agency of Congress.\n\nNRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker noted that there have been numerous instances of innocent people mistakenly added to terror lists. She also accused Democrats of exploiting heightened public alarm following last week's attacks in Paris, which claimed at least 130 lives and for which the Islamic State, which has also threatened the U.S., has claimed responsibility.\n\nFeinstein's measure mirrors legislation proposed by the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) over the last decade and by Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) for a long time. None of these measures has ever received a vote. Feinstein introduced her bill in February, but last week's mass killings in Paris have injected new life into terrorism and public safety as top-tier political issues.\n\nJust Thursday, Republicans took advantage of voters' security concerns and pushed legislation through the House preventing Syrian and Iraqi refugees from entering the U.S. until the administration tightens restrictions on their entry. Forty-seven Democrats voted for the bill, disregarding a veto threat by President Barack Obama, who said the current screening system is strong and accused Republicans of playing on panicked voters.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) did not respond directly when asked Thursday if he favored barring people on terror lists from buying guns. \"We are just beginning this process of reassessing all of our security stances,\" he said.\n\nDonald Stewart, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), said McConnell has not stated whether he would be open to a vote on Feinstein's bill. However, opposition from Republicans and some Democrats to curbing firearms runs deep, and such legislation would require support from 60 of the 100 senators. Democrats could not attain that margin even when they had a Senate majority in the months after the 2012 massacre of 20 first-graders and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nThough the Senate had showdown votes on gun curbs in early 2013, it did not revisit the issue as the 2014 elections approached, and Reid opted to protect vulnerable Democrats from potentially angering constituents. The GOP-run House has held no votes on major gun control measures since the Newtown killings.\n\nIn addition to Feinstein's bill, a measure by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) would bar gun sales to foreigners in the U.S. from the 38 countries from which visitors need not have visas.",
    " Title: GOP Lawmakers and Benghazi: Unanswered Questions and Allegations of a Cover-up\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator John McCain, a prominent Republican lawmaker, has been vocal in his pursuit of answers regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack, which resulted in the deaths of four Americans. In a recent interview on Meet the Press with David Gregory, McCain expressed his belief that there are still unanswered questions about the incident and suggested a cover-up of information related to the deaths of the four Americans.\n\nDuring the interview, McCain questioned Gregory about the importance of the Benghazi incident, asking if he cared that four Americans had died. Gregory responded by asking for clarification on the nature of the cover-up McCain was referring to.\n\nThe crux of the interview centered on a list of questions that McCain believes have not been answered, including what actions the president took and whom he spoke to on the night of the attack, why individuals evacuated from the consulate the following day were not interviewed immediately, and why the president continued to claim uncertainty about whether the attack was a terrorist attack for two weeks during the 2012 campaign.\n\nMcCain also questioned whether the president's statements during the campaign were an attempt to maintain the narrative that Al-Qaeda had been decimated and that the situation in that part of the world was stable. McCain stated that the lack of answers to these questions is a fact, and that reaching conclusions would require receiving the answers.\n\nIt is unclear from the provided text whether Gregory responded further to McCain's questions or provided his own perspective on the matter. The transcript of the interview was obtained from NewsBusters.",
    " Title: James Comey's Book Raises Questions About Credibility as Witness in Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of his dismissal by President Trump last year, former FBI Director James Comey has become a key witness for Special Counsel Robert Mueller in the ongoing investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 election. Comey's written accounts of his interactions with Trump, including the president's requests for loyalty and for the FBI to drop its investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, form the core of Mueller's inquiry into potential obstruction of justice.\n\nThe release of Comey's book, \"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\" has sparked a new crisis for the White House and raised questions about Comey's credibility as a witness against the president. The book, in which Comey compares Trump to the Mafia bosses he once prosecuted, has been met with criticism from the Republican National Committee, which launched an offensive against the book, challenging Comey's credibility.\n\nThe Republican National Committee's website features a critical section titled \"Lyin' Comey,\" which includes tweets from Trump and comments from lawmakers questioning Comey's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State. Former FBI assistant director Ron Hosko suggested that the book may open the door to criticism that Comey wrote the dramatic account merely to enrich himself.\n\nIn an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588, Comey characterized the book project as \"an obligation to try to drive a healthy conversation\" about leadership and ethics. He stated that the good he hopes to come out of the book is to offer a vision to people, especially young people, about what ethical leadership is.\n\nIn the book, Comey defended the timing of the book's publication in the midst of the Russia inquiry and before the release of a Justice Department inspector general's examination into the FBI's handling of the Clinton email investigation, which Comey oversaw. Comey told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he did not consult Mueller about the timing of the book's publication.\n\nPatrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor, said that although there is less risk in limiting a witness's public statement about an ongoing case, Comey's story has been the subject of a full, public Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. Cotter stated that unless there are glaring inconsistencies in Comey's testimony, what he told the special counsel, and in his book, he does not see a problem. Cotter added that any argument related to a financial incentive could fall flat.\n\nCotter concluded by stating, \"In a perfect world, you would put witnesses in a cryogenic chamber and only let them out when it's time to testify. That's not the world we live in.\"",
    " Title: Gina Haspel Confirmed as First Female Director of CIA, Splitting Senate Along Party Lines\n\nArticle:\n\nGina Haspel, a veteran spy and career operations officer, has been confirmed as the first female director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) following a 54-45 vote in the Senate. The confirmation vote, which saw six Democrats join Republicans, was the closest for a CIA nominee in the nearly seven decades that a Senate nod has been required.\n\nHaspel, 61, is a native of Kentucky but grew up around the world as the daughter of an Air Force serviceman. She has spent nearly all of her 33-year CIA career in undercover positions, working in Africa, Europe, and classified locations globally. Haspel was tapped as deputy director of the CIA last year and served under former CIA director Mike Pompeo until President Donald Trump moved him to secretary of state.\n\nHaspel was backed by many in the CIA rank-and-file and was robustly supported by senior intelligence officials, including six former CIA directors and three former national intelligence directors. National Intelligence Director Dan Coats said Haspel has integrity and both frontline and executive intelligence expertise.\n\nOpponents argued that it was not right to promote someone who supervised a covert detention site in Thailand where terror suspects were waterboarded, an interrogation technique that simulates drowning. They said the U.S. needed to slam closed what was one of the CIA's darkest chapters that tainted America's image with allies abroad.\n\nSeveral senators said Haspel was not forthcoming in answering questions about her role in the torture program or the CIA's decision to destroy video-taped evidence of the sessions. They also had questions about her rejection of the now-banned techniques.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a floor speech that Haspel \"offered up almost the classic Washington non-apology.\" He asked how the Senate could take seriously Haspel's \"conversion on torture?\"\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said the world was watching the confirmation vote, which he called a \"referendum on torture.\" He said the so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" the CIA used at black sites, including slamming detainees against walls and confining them in coffin-shaped boxes, amounted to \"government-sanctioned torture.\"\n\nHaspel has vowed never to restart such a program and says her \"strong moral compass\" would prevent her from carrying out any presidential order she found objectionable. That was enough to coax some senators into the \"yes\" column. However, Leahy said he still questioned her judgment and lamented that she has never publicly condemned torture as \"immoral.\"\n\nHe wondered aloud what Haspel would do if she's asked to do something that goes against America's core values. \"Should we trust that she will have the moral compass to stand up and say 'No?'\" he asked. \"Based on what we've seen, I do not.\"\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said the nomination was not just about Haspel, but the U.S. grappling with its past mistakes. \"The bottom line is this: No one has ever been held accountable for the torture program and I do not believe those who were intimately involved in it deserve to lead the agency,\" Feinstein said before casting her vote against Haspel.\n\nSince Trump nominated Haspel, her confirmation has been clouded by debate over the CIA's former interrogation program. A protester in the Senate visitor gallery briefly disrupted speeches ahead of the vote with shouts against the CIA.\n\nThree Republicans opposed her: Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is battling cancer and did not vote; Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky; and Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona. Six Democrats, however, were heartened by her pledge to never restart harsh interrogation programs, even if Trump requested. They said they voted for Haspel because they thought her experience was essential in confronting today's threats from U.S. adversaries like Russia, North Korea, China, and Iran.\n\nAmong Democrats supporting Haspel were several up for re-election this fall in states where Trump is popular, including Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, and Sen. Bill Nelson in Florida. Also voting yes were Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking member of the intelligence committee.\n\n\"This has not been an easy decision,\" Warner said, adding that he'd met and talked with Haspel many times in the past several weeks. He said he's convinced that Haspel could and would stand up to Trump, who has voiced support for waterboarding and has said \"torture works.\"\n\nAfter the vote, human rights groups quickly issued statements denouncing the confirmation and the now-defunct program. \"The Senate has now rewarded that atrocious conduct by promoting someone that reportedly administered it to lead one of the government's most powerful agencies,\" said Daphne Eviatar at Amnesty International USA.",
    " Title: Fed Rate Hike in June Unlikely After Weak May Jobs Report\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Reserve's potential interest rate hike in June has been put on hold following a disappointing May jobs report, which showed a significant drop in job creation compared to economists' expectations. The U.S. Department of Labor reported that only 38,000 jobs were created in May, the lowest number since September 2010.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, led by Chairwoman Janet Yellen, had been signaling that an interest rate hike could occur in the coming months, potentially as early as June, if the job market and economy continued to perform well. However, the weak jobs report has led to a reevaluation of the Fed's plans.\n\nSteven Ricchiuto, chief economist at MSUSA, described the jobs report as \"horrible,\" while Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at EverBank, called it \"very weak.\" Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, referred to the jobs number as a \"bombshell.\"\n\nThe weak jobs report has led to a significant decrease in the likelihood of a June rate hike. According to futures markets tracked by the CME Group, the odds of a June hike have plummeted to about 4%, down from 19% before the data was released.\n\n\"This is the weakest number of workers added in almost six years,\" Gaffney said via email. After the disappointing jobs report was released, the chances of a July hike also decreased, from close to 60% to 34%.\n\nThe market reaction was swift. Stocks dipped as investors became concerned about a potential slowdown in job creation, which is negative for the economy. Bond yields fell, and investors piled back into U.S. government bonds as the threat of an imminent Fed rate hike faded. The U.S. dollar weakened as the Fed's rate-hike timetable was pushed back.\n\nWhile the unemployment rate did tick down to 4.7%, this decrease is mainly due to \"another big drop in the labor force,\" according to Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. Yellen is scheduled to speak on Monday, and Wall Street will be closely listening for more insight on the Fed's thinking.\n\n\"Yellen should provide more insight on the Fed's thinking Monday,\" Ashworth said via email.",
    " Title: Facebook Removes Pages Linked to Russian Activity, Stirring Controversy Among Political Activists\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook has removed 32 pages from its platform, citing \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" that may be linked to Russia. Among the pages removed was an event page for a counter-protest to a white nationalist march in Washington D.C., organized by Black Lives Matter DC. The removal of the page has caused concern among organizers, who fear it may suggest they are linked to Russian election meddling.\n\nOrganizers of the \"No Unite the Right 2 - DC\" protest told The Associated Press that they have set up a new event page, as the initial page was being organized before the first page was created. However, they fear the damage has already been done. \"Our participation may take a hit because people are trying to find out what's legit and what's not,\" said organizer April Goggans. \"We've had to 'prove we exist.'\"\n\nFacebook stated that administrators of a page called \"Resisters\" were connected with those from other legitimate pages that helped drum up support for the protest. \"These legitimate Pages unwittingly helped build interest in 'No Unite Right 2 \u2013 DC' and posted information about transportation, materials, and locations so people could get to the protests,\" Facebook said in a statement.\n\nAndrew Batcher, an organizer for the Shut It Down DC coalition, said the event page created by \"Resisters\" was taken over and controlled by \"a lot of real people doing real work.\" Batcher told The Associated Press that he has not seen any evidence that any administrator for the \"Resisters' page was a \"bad actor.\"\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill have linked the 32 pages in question to Russia, with a spokesman for Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley stating that Facebook had informed his office \"that a limited group of Russian actors has attempted to spread disinformation using its platform and that the affected groups are affiliated with the political left.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported that Facebook also detected coordinated activity around the #AbolishICE campaign, a left-wing movement to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The issue highlights a broader difficulty social media sites now have in identifying Russian actors. While the intelligence community has concluded that Russia meddled in the election through online activities, Russia's meddling has not been limited to pro-Trump activities, especially this election cycle.\n\nThe issue points to a broader difficulty social media sites now have in identifying Russian actors.

    " Title: Republican Representative Cole Advocates for Bipartisan Tax Deal with Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma has urged his colleagues to vote to extend the Bush tax rates for all but the highest earners before the end of the year, suggesting that such a move would not violate the anti-tax pledge by Grover Norquist and would strengthen the Republican position in the ongoing tax debate.\n\nIn a private session on Tuesday, Cole argued that this move would not violate the anti-tax pledge and that he is not alone in his stance within Republican circles. He made his case during a meeting of the House GOP whip team earlier in the day.\n\nCole's position is notable given his reputation as a staunch Republican, having served as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee and holding other official posts within the party. He suggested that such a bipartisan deal could provide cover for other Republicans looking to avoid the fiscal cliff and secure tax cuts for most taxpayers before the end of the year.\n\n\"I think we ought to take the 98 percent deal right now,\" Cole said, referring to freezing income tax rates for all but the top 2 percent of earners. \"It doesn't mean I agree with raising the top 2. I don't.\"\n\nInstead, Cole proposed that Republicans should fight the president over tax rates for the top earners after everyone else is taken care of. This approach, he argued, would remove the president's argument that Republicans are holding up tax cuts for all but the top earners.\n\n\"Some people think that's our leverage in the debate. It's the Democrats' leverage in the debate,\" Cole said.\n\nCole indicated that he is likely to support his leadership when a package is put on the floor, but he also suggested that there are other lawmakers in his camp, as well as others who have been willing to listen. He was adamant that his approach would not violate the Norquist pledge, as Republicans would be voting to lower taxes for most people and doing nothing\u2014which would result in an increase\u2014for the rest.\n\n\"I don't see that as a violation of my pledge,\" he said.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Conservative Majority Leans on Textualism in Close Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Supreme Court has been leaning on a conservative interpretation of statutes, known as textualism, in closely divided cases this term. The justices have settled challenges involving the rights of workers, immigrants, prisoners, and patent owners by meticulously defining the meaning of words such as \"for,\" \"shall,\" \"any,\" and \"other,\" along with \"satisfy\" and \"salesman.\"\n\nJustices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito have authored a series of 5-4 decisions that rely on textualism, a philosophy championed by the late Justice Antonin Scalia. President Trump, who appointed Gorsuch as Scalia's successor, had promised to select justices who would adhere to this approach.\n\nPaul Clement, a former U.S. solicitor general who has argued more than 90 cases at the Supreme Court, noted, \"The terms of the debate have shifted. You don't want to walk into the court without a textualist argument.\"\n\nLast week, Gorsuch refused to read into the National Labor Relations Act any rules for handling legal disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act. In his opinion for the court, Gorsuch held that employers can insist that workers settle labor disputes individually through arbitration.\n\nIn a dissent led by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the liberal justices argued that the NLRA guarantees workers the right to unionize, bargain collectively, and \"engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\" The judicial dispute boiled down to the word \"other\" \u2013 Gorsuch declaring it must be related to union membership or collective bargaining, while Ginsburg contended the law \"speaks more embracively.\"\n\nIn another 5-4 decision written by Gorsuch last month, the court ruled that an administrative board created to review patents cannot pick and choose which parts of a patent to review. The law passed by Congress, according to Gorsuch, is \"both mandatory and comprehensive.\"\n\nIn dissent, Ginsburg called Gorsuch's conclusion a \"wooden reading\" of a law that Justice Stephen Breyer described as \"technical, unclear, and constitutes a minor procedural part of a larger administrative scheme.\"\n\nIn February, Gorsuch's 5-4 opinion for the court held that under federal law, prisoners who win civil rights suits must pay up to 25% of their award \"to satisfy\" attorneys' fees. Lower court judges cannot limit a prisoner's contribution, the court said.\n\nIn dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that the law allows judges to limit the amount prisoners must pay. The phrase \"to satisfy\" does not necessarily mean in full, she said, citing other contexts ranging from credit card payments to college course credits.\n\nSupreme Court experts say Gorsuch's addition has merely returned the court to Scalia's brand of textualism. Irving Gornstein, executive director of the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown University Law Center, stated, \"The court is no more textualist than it was when Scalia was on the court. The only thing that has changed is that one textualist has been replaced by another.\"\n\nHowever, Jeffrey Fisher, co-director of the Stanford Law School Supreme Court Litigation Clinic, said, \"Gorsuch seems to be trying to put some fresh wind in the sails of textualism. And it seems he\u2019s having some success.\"\n\nJustices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas also stuck to the letter of the law in recent 5-4 rulings. Alito ruled that illegal immigrants can be detained indefinitely while their cases are reviewed, rather than given intermittent bail hearings.\n\nIn a second case involving workers' rights, Thomas's 5-4 ruling found that service advisers at car dealerships can be excluded from the Fair Labor Standards Act's wage and hour protections because their duties are akin to salesmen and partsmen, who are specifically excluded.\n\nElizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, said, \"There\u2019s going to be a battle about what is actual textualism. And the liberals aren\u2019t giving up that fight.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Signs Executive Order to Address Social Media and Big Technology Companies\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced his intention to sign an executive order on Thursday, aiming to regulate social media and big technology companies. The move follows a fact-check on a tweet by the president regarding mail-in voting by Twitter.\n\nThe president is invoking section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a provision that aims to protect free speech by shielding providers from liability for the content they host. The section states, \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"\n\nThe executive order seeks to add regulations to section 230, limiting the liability protections for companies that editorialize or censor content or speech. The president also plans to instruct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to monitor reported political bias. President Trump has criticized Twitter for fact-checking his tweet about mail-in voting, while alleging that the platform has not previously addressed propaganda from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nThe White House tweeted, \"Today, I am signing an executive order to protect and uphold the free speech and rights of the American people.\" Bloomberg QuickTake reported that Trump described social media companies as currently receiving an \"unprecedented liability shield.\"\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr has partnered with President Trump in this effort. Barr contends that the new order does not repeal section 230, but rather an accountability measure to ensure the law is interpreted correctly. Section 230 has faced criticism from both Republicans and Democrats, who argue that the law allows social media companies to avoid the responsibility to ensure truth is present online.\n\nThe executive order is expected to be challenged in court on its constitutionality.",
    " Title: Cautious Optimism Surrounds Immigration Overhaul Amidst Stalled Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nA broad immigration overhaul, which includes a 13-year path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants residing in the United States illegally and stricter border security measures, has passed the Senate with bipartisan support in June. However, this legislation has largely stalled in the Republican-controlled House, where Speaker John Boehner has rejected negotiations with the Senate over its comprehensive bill.\n\nSenator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a key negotiator of the Senate bill, expressed cautious optimism, stating, \"This is obviously a long, hard road, but I think since August, the number on the other side vehemently opposed has stayed the same, the number who think it should go forward has grown, and numbers in the wide middle are less opposed than they used to be. But that doesn't guarantee an outcome one way or another.\"\n\nRepublican Party leaders, backed by business groups, have emphasized the necessity of an overhaul to repair their political position with Latino and other immigrant voters. Former Chief of Staff to Speaker Boehner, Barry Jackson, is now consulting for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which supports an overhaul that expands high-technology visas and guest worker programs.\n\nImmigration is less of a concern during midterm elections, when immigrants are less likely to vote, and House members in safe districts are somewhat insulated from the influence of more moderate swing voters. The biggest threats to Republicans often come from primary challenges by more conservative candidates who argue that changing the immigration status of those in the country illegally amounts to amnesty for lawbreakers.\n\nRepresentative John Carter, Republican of Texas and one of the Gang of Eight House members who attempted to forge a bipartisan overhaul, told Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call that an election year is not the time to press forward, stating, \"Immigration is a very, very contentious issue.\"",

The vacation, which ended on January 4, was filled with leisure activities such as golf, dining at high-end restaurants, snorkeling, and a private visit to a zoo.\n\nThe president reportedly received daily presidential briefings, including the \"threat matrix\" - secret guidance culled from intelligence agencies about global hotspots. He also issued a statement about the ailing former first lady Barbara Bush, participated in a conference call about Sudan, signed a few bills, called senators about a contentious bill, and received updates on terrorist attacks in Russia.\n\nThe cost of the vacation, including the rental of a beach house in Kailua, Hawaii, which typically rents for $3,500 per day, and the travel on Air Force One, has been estimated to cost taxpayers around $4 million. This estimate includes the rental of at least seven homes in the area, according to watchdog.org.\n\nThe president played golf with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, his teenage son Max, and White House aide Marvin Nicholson at the Marine Corps base at Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course. He also engaged in eight gym workouts, two family hikes, two beach trips, and a visit to Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve, where they snorkeled with parrotfish and green sea turtles. The preserve was closed to the public during the Obamas' visit.\n\nThe first couple has met with U.S. troops once but have not attended church services, even for Christmas.

Prepares for Second Unite the Right Rally as Businesses and Transportation Services Take Stance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn anticipation of the second Unite the Right rally scheduled for Sunday in Washington D.C., white supremacists and white nationalists may face challenges in finding transportation and dining options. The rally marks the one-year anniversary of the violent white supremacist events in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nOn Saturday, police in Charlottesville blocked off streets and mobilized hundreds of officers downtown as a precaution. A group of 20 Antifa protestors marched through downtown Charlottesville, holding a flag that read \"Antifascist action.\"\n\nIn preparation for the rally near the White House, ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft have informed drivers they have the right to refuse service to passengers who harass or threaten them. The Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington has also provided a toolkit to restaurateurs, informing them of their legal rights to refuse service to white nationalists and other political fringe groups.\n\nRally organizer, Jason Kessler, obtained a permit for Lafayette Park across from the White House, expecting 400 supporters to show up. The first \"Unite The Right\" rally in Charlottesville on Aug. 12, 2017, resulted in violent clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters, with one person being killed when a white supremacist drove into a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\nUber has reminded its drivers in the Washington region of community guidelines and their right to refuse service to disrespectful or threatening passengers. Several restaurant owners have stated they are threatening to refuse service to those participating in the rally or planning to close altogether.\n\nAirbnb has also threatened to ban users who participate in the rally. Ellen Kassoff Gray, owner of Equinox restaurant near the White House, and several other restaurant owners have stated they would refuse service to those who espouse hate.\n\nTwitter has suspended numerous accounts associated with the Proud Boys, a controversial right-wing group, for violating Twitter's policy against \"violent extremist groups.\" A number of non-verified accounts for various Proud Boys chapters were also suspended.",
    " Title: President Trump Hosts \"Celebration of America\" as Eagles Disinvitation Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy, President Donald Trump disinvited the Philadelphia Eagles, the Super Bowl LII champions, from a White House event on Tuesday. Instead, the White House is hosting a \"Celebration of America\" event.\n\nThe White House decision to disinvite the team marked the end of speculation over whether the Eagles would visit the White House in some capacity. The team reportedly wanted to send a small group of players.\n\n\"We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P.M. The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus. Honoring America! NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms!\" Trump tweeted early Tuesday.\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney criticized Trump, calling him \"not a true patriot\" and a \"fragile egomaniac\" over the move.\n\n\"Disinviting them from the White House only proves that our president is not a true patriot, but a fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one wants to attend,\" Kenney said in a statement.\n\nLast month, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the league would fine teams and league personnel who do not \"stand and show respect for the flag and the anthem.\" Goodell said the league unanimously agreed to the vote, though San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York abstained. The new overhaul does allow players to remain in the locker room for the anthem.\n\nTrump has praised the new policy, but his Eagles decision -- and swipe Tuesday at those who stay in the locker room -- reflects ongoing tension between his White House and players protesting police violence by sitting out the national anthem.\n\nTrump also used his Twitter account Tuesday to note past events the White House has held with other championship teams.\n\n\"We have had many Championship teams recently at the White House including the Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Penguins, New England Patriots, Alabama and Clemson National Champions, and many others. National Anthem & more great music today at 3:00 P.M.,\" Trump tweeted, adding minutes later that \"@NASCAR and Champion @MartinTruex_Jr were recently at the White House. It was a great day for a great sport!\"",
    " Title: House of Representatives to File Lawsuit for Release of Fast and Furious Documents\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States House of Representatives is expected to file a lawsuit in the coming weeks to compel the Justice Department to release additional documents related to the Fast and Furious gun-tracking operation. The decision follows a resolution passed by the Republican-led House on Thursday, which found Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for failing to provide further documents to congressional investigators.\n\nSpeaker of the House, John Boehner (R-Ohio), stated on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" that \"The American people have a right to know what happened.\" The criminal contempt resolution opens the door for the House to call on the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia to bring the case before a grand jury. However, Deputy Attorney General James Cole informed Boehner in a letter on Friday that the agency would not prosecute, stating that Holder's failure to release the documents does not constitute a crime.\n\nThe second, civil contempt resolution grants the House the ability to ask a court to compel the Justice Department to hand over the documents. President Obama has already asserted executive privilege over the documents in question.\n\nThe investigation into the Fast and Furious operation, led by Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has spanned 16 months. The non-defunct Operation Fast and Furious was run out of an Arizona field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which is under the Justice Department.\n\nThe operation involved putting roughly 2,000 assault guns into the hands of arms dealers, then allowing the guns to cross the U.S.-Mexico border with the expectation they would resurface at crime scenes and lead agents to organizers of Mexican drug cartels. Two of the weapons were found at the site of the 2010 shooting death of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.\n\nRecently, Rep. Issa has focused on a February 2011 letter from the Justice Department to Congress that falsely stated ATF made \"every effort\" to interdict the illegally purchased guns and stop them from going into Mexico. White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew described the Justice Department's decision not to prosecute Holder as based on a Reagan administration memo and characterized the House's continued efforts as \"political\" and a \"fishing expedition.\"",
    " Title: Clapper Criticizes Trump's Openness to Foreign Opposition Research, Cites Double Standard in Dossier Case\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the release of George Stephanopoulos' exclusive interview with President Donald Trump, former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, appeared on Anderson Cooper 360 to discuss the president's comments regarding his willingness to listen to foreign opposition research. During the interview, Clapper and Cooper focused on Trump's statement that he would be open to receiving such information if it were presented to him.\n\n\"It's certainly interesting. I've run out of adjectives to describe a reaction to this. Incredible, amazing, stunning, and disturbing that the president would advocate for this use of accepting information provided by a foreign country, notably a foreign adversary,\" Clapper told Cooper. \"And, in doing so, completely overlooking the fact that this could, will be, probably would be, disinformation. In other words, completely phony. And to endorse that, and in doing so endorse, undercut the FBI, and its director, it's just incredible. I can't get over the duplicity of it.\"\n\nClapper also addressed the double standard he perceived in the handling of the infamous dossier, compiled by a former British spy, during the 2016 election. \"Here's all this criticism about the infamous dossier and you can't use it because it's not valid. You can't accept it. That's, and in this case, okay. And we're looking in the future here. We're not talking about the past,\" Clapper added.\n\nClapper argued that opposition research is a common practice in every campaign during every election, and candidates have the right to conduct such research. However, he emphasized that the government has an obligation to independently verify the information in such documents, especially when it comes to obtaining FISA warrants based on the information.\n\n\"Journalists\" at BuzzFeed and The Washington Post were criticized by Clapper for not independently verifying the information in the dossier, and for accepting it as fact because it was damaging evidence against Trump. Clapper suggested that there were political motives in not vetting Steele's information.\n\nAccording to Cooper, this is Trump's \"clarion call\" for information from foreign countries, particularly Russia, in the upcoming 2020 election. \"They're [Russia] going to repeat what they did in 2016. They're going to repeat it in 2020,\" Clapper said. \"And now, what President Trump has done, is encourage them to do so. Again, it's just, it's just stunning.\"",
    " Title: Planned Parenthood Affiliates Return $80 Million in PPP Loans Due to Ineligibility\n\nArticle:\n\nThirty-seven Planned Parenthood affiliates have returned a total of $80 million in loans received from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) after the Small Business Administration (SBA) determined that they were not eligible for the coronavirus stimulus payouts. The SBA is reaching out to each involved affiliate to explain that affiliates of larger organizations with more than 500 employees are not eligible for PPP distributions.\n\nThe Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PFFA) alone has over 600 employees, making it ineligible for PPP distributions. For instance, a Planned Parenthood affiliate in Metropolitan Washington (PPMW) will receive a letter stating that although it self-certified that it was eligible for a $1,328,000 PPP loan, it will need to return the money.\n\nIn August 2020, PPMW's president and CEO, Laura Meyers, promised not to accept federal funds from the Trump administration after the White House banned Planned Parenthood clinics from making abortion referrals to continue receiving federal funds. However, PPMW requested funds from the Trump administration just months later.\n\nThe SBA warned of \"severe penalties\" for incorrect or false eligibility certifications by PPP recipients. Incorrect eligibility certifications could result in criminal or civil sanctions if the SBA determines borrowers made knowingly false statements. The SBA letter explained that PPFA affiliates were covered by the PPP affiliate rules, as PPFA's bylaws require a certification by the PPFA board, and each affiliate is governed by written bylaws that conform to PPFA policies.\n\nThe largest single government loan was a $7.5 million allotment to the Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties in California. One Planned Parenthood affiliate received a loan but declined it.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who serves as chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, called for an immediate investigation on Tuesday evening. Rubio stated that there is no ambiguity in the legislation that passed or public record around its passage that organizations such as Planned Parenthood, whose parent organization has close to half a billion dollars in assets, is not eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program.\n\nIn January 2020, Planned Parenthood reported a record-high number of abortions and government funding for 2018-2019. Planned Parenthood claimed that abortion constituted just a small percentage \u2013 4 percent in 2018-2019 \u2013 of its services, and that federal funds did not go directly to abortions.\n\nNinety-eight percent of PPP loans have been less than $1 million, with an average loan of $118,000. Canceled or returned funds can be used during future PPP rounds.\n\nRepublicans have resisted reported efforts from some Democrats to push abortion-related spending amid the pandemic. In March 2020, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was reported to have tried to include federal funding for abortion in the coronavirus stimulus bill.",
    " Title: Alabama Senate Passes Near-Total Abortion Ban, Sending Measure to Governor's Desk\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Alabama Senate on Tuesday evening passed a legislation that effectively bans nearly all abortions in the state, sending the measure to Governor Kay Ivey's (R) desk for signing into law. The bill, which passed by a 25-6 margin, would ban abortions in virtually all instances, including for victims of rape and incest, and would only permit the procedure if necessary to save a mother's life.\n\nAnyone performing an abortion could be punished by 10 to 99 years in prison, but no criminal charges would be filed against a person undergoing the procedure. The legislation was tabled last week due to a shouting match that erupted on the Senate floor after an exception for cases of rape and incest was removed from the bill.\n\nState Rep. Terri Collins (R), who sponsored the bill, told The Washington Post she empathized with survivors of rape and incest but that the exceptions were specifically left out so that the law would be strong enough to force a federal court battle.\n\nThe bill's proponents hope the legislation, along with abortion restrictions in other states, will set up a Supreme Court battle that will see the overturning of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion.\n\nAs of now, sixteen states have passed or are currently considering abortion bans once a fetal heartbeat is detected about six weeks into pregnancy. Four states have approved so-called heartbeat abortion laws. However, Alabama's is without a doubt the most restrictive abortion law in the country.\n\nState Sen. Vivian Figures (D) told The Washington Post before the bill was considered, \"If I were them, I would be making plans to leave Alabama. Who is going to stay in a state like this?\"\n\nThe pro-abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America swiftly condemned Tuesday's vote and expressed concern that the current makeup of the Supreme Court puts Roe v. Wade at risk after the Senate confirmed President Trump's two nominees.\n\n\"Alabama just passed a law that is a total ban on abortion, criminalizing the act and punishing women and doctors. Anti-choice Republicans no longer even pretend to respect the law or the women that it protects. When this dangerous and demeaning law passed, Republicans stood up and applauded, while women wept,\" NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue said in a statement.\n\nWhen women stood up in record numbers to fight Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, propelled by his alarming record and Trump's promise to nominate jurists committed to criminalizing abortion and punishing women, we were told we were 'hysterical' because Roe was settled law. Not six months later, we are battling measures where the stated goal is exactly that: outlawing abortion,\" she added, referring to the newest Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh.",
    " Title: Traveling to Damascus Offers Insight into Syrian Conflict's Impact on a Muslim Shrine\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the Syrian capital of Damascus, the ongoing civil war has left many residents with a profound sense of hope for the preservation of the city's historical sites, particularly the Muslim shrine of Sayida Zeinab. This shrine, dedicated to the granddaughter of the Prophet Muhammad, remains a beacon of hope and unity for the city's residents, despite the ongoing conflict.\n\nA local doctor, who requested anonymity, spoke of his deep affection for Sayida Zeinab, stating, \"We love Sayida Zeinab. We like Sayida Zeinab. We respect Sayida Zeinab.\" The doctor, who has worked in the area for 25 years, offered to guide visitors to the shrine, which is located in a Shiite neighborhood and is surrounded by guards due to fears of potential destruction by Sunni extremist rebels.\n\nThe doctor explained that the shrine is significant to all Muslims, though the Shiite sect maintains the shrine. He expressed concern that Sunni extremist rebels, who allegedly hold Wahhabi beliefs, may target the shrine due to their opposition to shrines and their austere interpretation of Islam.\n\nThe Syrian government, led by President Bashar Assad, has consistently portrayed the rebels as foreign terrorists. While not all Sunni rebel groups oppose Shiites, it is clear that some are extremist Sunnis, and this fear has led Shiites and other minority groups to align with Assad's regime.\n\nThe area surrounding the shrine is heavily contested, with ongoing fighting nearby. Despite this, the doctor stated that he has never missed a day of work at the nearby hospital.\n\nUpon reaching the shrine, visitors are greeted by a series of military checkpoints and a golden dome, which stands out amidst the battle-scarred city. Inside the courtyard, walls adorned with elaborate blue tiles display messages of support for Assad's government.\n\nInside the shrine, pilgrims can pay their respects at Sayida Zeinab's tomb. One young mother, with a baby in her arms, shared her reasons for supporting the government: \"Because I saw by my own eyes, because I saw by my own eyes how the army saved us and the rebels want to kill us.\"\n\nThe guards of the shrine include men from Lebanon, who are allies of Assad and members of the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah. They believe Syria has become the battleground for a proxy war between Shiite Iran and Sunni Arabs, including the rulers of Saudi Arabia. Local men, such as a former sheep dealer who joined a volunteer defense force, also serve as guards.\n\nInside the golden dome, visitors find a room adorned with mirrored tiles, reflecting the brilliance of the space. The doctor who guided the visit expressed a desire for a revolution that would bring about positive change, but not at the cost of the country's destruction.\n\nIn Syria's elections, Assad has always been the only candidate, making it a yes-no referendum on his rule. The challenge for Syria's rebels is to present a plausible alternative\u2014a new system of government in which terrified Syrians might believe.",
    " Title: Afghan Immigrant Ahmad Khan Rahami Arrested in Connection with New York and New Jersey Bombings\n\nArticle:\n\nAn Afghan immigrant, Ahmad Khan Rahami, wanted in connection with bombings that occurred in New York City and a New Jersey shore town was captured Monday following a gun battle with police. Rahami, a 28-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen from Afghanistan, underwent surgery for a gunshot wound to his leg, and two officers were wounded but not critically in the shootout.\n\nThe arrest took place just hours after police issued a bulletin and photo of Rahami, who lived with his Muslim family in an apartment in Elizabeth, New Jersey, above a fried-chicken restaurant owned by his father. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, the chief federal prosecutor in New York, stated that New Jersey officials will likely bring charges against Rahami for the police officers' shooting, while federal authorities consider their own charges.\n\nOn Saturday night, a shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bomb similar to those used in the Boston Marathon attack exploded in New York's Chelsea section, wounding 29 people, none seriously. An unexploded pressure-cooker bomb was found blocks away. Earlier that day, a pipe bomb exploded in Seaside Park, New Jersey, before a charity race to benefit Marines. No one was injured. Then on Sunday night, five explosive devices were discovered in a trash can at an Elizabeth train station. Investigators are still gathering evidence and have not publicly tied Rahami to those bombs.\n\nWith Rahami's arrest, officials stated they have no indication of more bombs or suspects to find, though they cautioned that they are still working to understand Rahami's connections. His motive remains unclear, according to New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill. William Sweeney Jr., the FBI's assistant director in New York, said there are no indications Rahami was on law enforcement's radar at the time of the bombings.\n\nAs for how investigators zeroed in on Rahami as a suspect, three law enforcement officials stated that clues included a fingerprint lifted from one of the New York sites and \"clear as day\" surveillance video from the bombing scene that helped identify Rahami. The officials spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case.\n\nFive people were pulled over Sunday night in a vehicle associated with Rahami, but were questioned and released. The law enforcement officials stated at least one of Rahami's relatives was in the car, which appeared headed toward Kennedy Airport in New York after coming from New Jersey.\n\nLinden Mayor Derek Armstead stated the break in the case came late Monday morning, when the owner of a bar reported someone asleep in his doorway. A police officer went to investigate and recognized the man as Rahami, police and the mayor said. Rahami pulled a gun and shot the officer - who was wearing a bulletproof vest - in the torso, and more officers joined in a gun battle that spilled into the street, police Capt. James Sarnicki said.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations, a national Muslim advocacy group, welcomed Rahami's arrest. The organization and the Afghan Embassy in Washington condemned the bombings. Around the time Rahami was captured, President Barack Obama was in New York on a previously scheduled visit for a meeting of the U.N. General Assembly. He called on Americans to show the world \"we will never give in to fear.\"\n\nRahami lived with his family on a busy street a few miles from the Newark airport. An AP reporter went to the building that houses the family's restaurant and home, but it was cordoned off. Rahami's father, Mohammad, and two of Rahami's brothers sued the city of Elizabeth in 2011 after it passed an ordinance requiring their restaurant, First American Fried Chicken, to close early because of complaints from neighbors that it was a late-night nuisance. The Rahamis charged in the lawsuit that they were targeted by neighbors because they are Muslims. The lawsuit was terminated in 2012 after Mohammad Rahami pleaded guilty to blocking police from enforcing the restrictions on the restaurant.\n\nRyan McCann, of Elizabeth, stated that he often ate at the restaurant and recently began seeing the younger Rahami working there more. \"He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy, that's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home,\" McCann said.\n\nOn Sunday, a federal law enforcement official stated the Chelsea bomb contained a residue of Tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. One of the five devices found at the Elizabeth train station exploded while a bomb squad robot tried to disarm it. No one was hurt.\n\nLuck and some scavengers played a role in the investigation: Two homeless men grabbed a backpack left on a trash can near the Elizabeth train station, only to discover it contained several apparent pipe bombs. They quickly reported the find to police, said Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage.\n\nOn Saturday, two men walking down a street in New York saw a suitcase on a sidewalk, opened it, discarded the pressure cooker they found inside, and walked off with the bag. Later that evening, after the blast in Chelsea, state troopers found the unexploded device.",
    " Title: West Virginia Governor Invites Virginia Counties to Secede Amidst Political Differences\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a proposal dubbed \"Vexit,\" West Virginia's Republican Governor Jim Justice has extended an invitation to Virginia counties discontent with their liberal state government in Richmond to secede and join West Virginia. The invitation was made during a press conference with Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr. at a community college in Martinsburg, West Virginia on Tuesday.\n\n\"If you're not happy where you're at, come on down,\" Justice said. \"If you're not truly happy where you are, we stand with open arms to take you from Virginia or anywhere you may be. We stand strongly behind the Second Amendment, and we stand strongly for the unborn.\"\n\nThe proposal comes after Virginia Democrats regained full control of the government in Richmond last fall, leading to changes in gun laws and abortion restrictions. Since taking office this month, the new government has dismantled laws protecting gun rights and is reportedly proposing to repeal the state's right-to-work law, which would force workers to join a union and pay dues.\n\nThousands of gun owners concerned about their freedom gathered for a rally on the Capitol grounds in Richmond on January 20th to lobby against the proposed legislation. Fearing the loss of their freedoms, citizens have flooded city council meetings all over the state, resulting in 91 of Virginia's 95 counties declaring themselves Second Amendment Sanctuaries.\n\nThe idea of Virginia counties seceding to another state is not new, as West Virginia became a state in 1863 by seceding from Virginia, which had seceded from the United States.\n\nWhen asked for a reaction to West Virginia's proposal that Virginia counties join their state, Virginia Democrat Governor Ralph Northam's office responded, \"It sounds like it's an election year in West Virginia.\" Virginia Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw (D) described the secession proposal as \"preposterous,\" suggesting West Virginia should focus on fixing its high poverty rate.\n\nMinority leader in the House of Delegates, Todd Gilbert, told reporters that many Virginians are not happy with the Democrat agenda, but Republicans are not retreating from the political fray in Richmond. However, he did seem to appreciate West Virginia's offer.\n\n\"We're nowhere near done fighting for our values here in the Commonwealth,\" Gilbert said. \"Democrats have been in power for less than two months and they're already raising taxes, working to let violent felons out of jail early, and punishing law-abiding gun owners. We think Virginians will have a significant case of buyer's remorse very soon. That being said, it's always nice to have options.\"\n\nHowever, concern by Virginia conservatives over the leftist tilt of their state government is not going away. Jerry Falwell, Jr. stated, \"What's happening in Virginia right now is a tragedy in the making. Democrat leaders in Richmond, through their elitism and radicalism, have left a nearly unrecognizable state in their wake, and they are using their power to strip away the God-given rights held by every person in the state, despite their due protections under the US Constitution.\"\n\nIt remains unclear whether the proposal for Virginia counties to secede and join West Virginia will become a reality. Lawyers consulted by Falwell reportedly stated that secession would be a difficult process, requiring petition drives, referendums, and the consent of Congress and both states. For their part, lawmakers in West Virginia have already introduced formal resolutions inviting parts of Virginia to join their state.",
    " Title: Seismic Activity in North Korea Determined as Natural Event, Not Nuclear Test\n\nArticle:\n\nSouth Korean and Chinese monitors have concluded that the seismic activity in North Korea on Saturday was a natural event and not a nuclear test. The Korea Meteorological Administration reported a magnitude 3.0 earthquake in North Hamgyeong Province, an area where North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3.\n\nThe seismic activity occurred in Kilju, near the site of the previous nuclear test. However, the Korea Meteorological Administration and China's Earthquake Networks Center, as well as officials with The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, have assessed the activity as natural.\n\nAn official from South Korea's weather agency stated, \"The quake is presumed to have occurred naturally,\" according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. They added, \"A sound wave, which is usually generated in the event of an artificial earthquake, was not detected.\"\n\nThe seismic activity was reported against a backdrop of growing tension over North Korea's nuclear and missile intentions. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has vowed to take the \"highest-level\" action in response to President Trump's threat to \"totally destroy\" North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nNorth Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said in New York on Thursday that Pyongyang may consider its most powerful test of a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean. \"This could probably mean the strongest hydrogen bomb test over the Pacific Ocean,\" he told reporters in response to a question about what action the North Korean regime might take against the U.S.\n\nMeanwhile, China announced on Saturday that it will limit exports of petroleum products to North Korea starting in October under the terms of the latest U.N. sanctions passed in response to North Korea's sixth nuclear test.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Distance Themselves from Obama in Midterm Campaign Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the midterm elections, the White House and Senate Democrats are devising a comprehensive campaign strategy to navigate the unpopularity of President Barack Obama in several competitive states. According to a source speaking with nearly every incumbent and aspiring Democratic Senate candidate, only a handful of candidates expressed a desire for Obama to campaign with them.\n\nAlaska Sen. Mark Begich stated, \"I don't care to have him campaign for me. I'd rather he come up to see where his policies aren't working. He's wrong on ANWR, we've had struggles to try to get our permits done down in the southeast for our timber industry. I want to show him how important the military is in Fairbanks.\"\n\nThe president's unpopularity could potentially cost Democrats the Senate, as vulnerable incumbents require the full resources of the White House to maintain the majority. To mitigate this, the White House and party leadership are exploring strategies to deploy Obama and his team in a manner that minimizes complications for Democrats in states like Colorado, Georgia, or Kentucky, where his polls are unfavorable.\n\nPresident Obama has committed to half a dozen Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fundraisers for 2014, with the first two expected in the coming weeks in New York and the Washington suburbs. He is also planning to attend fundraisers for the Senate Majority PAC. Vice President Joe Biden, first lady Michelle Obama, and former President Bill Clinton will take the lead in campaigning, while Obama remains distant.\n\nIn an interview, Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, who is trying to defend his seat, downplayed the role any surrogate would play in his campaign, despite Clinton's involvement in fundraising. \"I don't get people to come and campaign for me very often,\" Pryor said. \"To me, in Arkansas, people don't vote for you because somebody else says vote for you.\"\n\nVice President Biden was a previously unreported attendee in an Oval Office meeting last week with Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, DSCC Chairman Michael Bennet, and DSCC Executive Director Guy Cecil. The White House is also reportedly debating how and where to deploy Michelle Obama.\n\nIn 2012, many of Michelle Obama's events on behalf of the president's reelection were focused on voter registration, and she could help promote turnout and energize the Democratic base without endangering candidates by a close connection to the president, particularly in states like New Orleans, where local turnout could make the difference for Sen. Mary Landrieu.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the Senate majority whip, reported that Obama told Senate Democrats at a meeting at Nationals Park last week that he understands his health care law will be used as the \"No. 1 attack tool\" on Democrats by the Koch Brothers. Obama also acknowledged that his popularity may be lower in some states, stating, \"I can help many of you, even in states where I'm not popular with everyone. I can still help, and I'm willing to do everything I can.\"\n\nThe president is still likely to campaign at some point later this year, although decisions regarding his travel schedule have yet to be made. He has a busy travel schedule in February and March focused on international affairs, including a California summit with the king of Jordan, trips to Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Vatican City, where he'll meet Pope Francis.",
    " Title: US Officials Believe Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 Was Likely Shot Down by Iranian Missile\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. officials believe that Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was likely shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, according to multiple reports on Thursday. The incident occurred shortly after Iran fired a barrage of ballistic missiles at U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq in response to a U.S. drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, former head of the IRGC Quds Force.\n\nDefense officials told Newsweek and others that the plane was probably shot down by accident, as Iran's surface-to-air missile systems were likely active at the time of the crash early Wednesday. The plane, which was made by Boeing, crashed outside the Iranian capital of Tehran, killing all 176 people on board.\n\nU.S. officials told Newsweek, Reuters, and other outlets that the incident was likely an accident, as anti-aircraft systems were likely active at the time of the crash. CBS News reported that U.S. intelligence detected anti-aircraft radars turning on before the crash and that satellites detected two infrared blips, thought to be SA-15 missiles, that were quickly followed by another blip, the suspected aircraft explosion. CNN confirmed CBS and Newsweek's reporting, and U.S. officials told The Associated Press that it was \"highly likely\" that the aircraft was downed by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said on Thursday that he did not believe that the passenger jet went down as a result of a mechanical error. \"It was flying in a pretty rough neighborhood,\" the president said. \"Someone could have made a mistake.\" Trump added, \"I have a feeling that \u2014 it's just some very terrible, something very terrible happened, very devastating.\"\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday afternoon that Canada also had intelligence and evidence from multiple sources indicating \"that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile.\" He added that \"this may well have been unintentional\" and expressed a desire for a full investigation.\n\nImages appearing to show Tor missile fragments, said to have been found outside Tehran, have been circulating on social media. A video making the rounds appears to show the moment a missile struck the Ukrainian aircraft. Iran has denied responsibility, with Iranian media, citing state officials, arguing that the missile theory is \"scientifically impossible\" and \"illogical\" because several domestic and foreign flights were in Iran at the same altitude of 8,000 feet.\n\nUkrainian investigators are considering several possibilities, including the plane being shot down, an engine explosion due to a technical malfunction, a terrorist attack on the flight, or even a collision with an unmanned aerial vehicle. Oleksiy Danylov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, wrote on Facebook earlier Thursday that Ukrainian investigators were considering several possibilities.",

Since then, Carl Chinn, a statistic compiler, has documented over 1,000 violent attacks on churches, synagogues, and other houses of worship, with more than 150 such incidents occurring this year.\n\nChinn, who began compiling these statistics in 1999, has identified the attack on Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, as the worst attack on an assembled congregation in American history. Tim Miller, a nationally recognized expert in church security, shares Chinn's concerns, stating that violence directed against churches has been growing over the past decade and fears the Charleston massacre could be the beginning of a series of similar incidents.\n\nMiller, a retired Marine, former Secret Service agent, police officer, and counter-intelligence officer, leads a team that includes former Homeland Security agents, FBI agents, and special-ops personnel. He shifted his focus to church and non-profit security three years ago, recognizing that the same threats previously experienced overseas are now present in the United States.\n\nChurches are considered soft targets, and Miller believes the Charleston massacre should serve as a wake-up call. He expressed concern that the suffering experienced in such incidents is unimaginable. Miller's team helps churches prepare for potential violence while maintaining a welcoming environment for those seeking solace.\n\nThe challenge lies in balancing the need for security with the welcoming nature of houses of worship. As the Old Testament Book of Nehemiah suggests, \"We prayed to our God and posted a guard.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Navy to Proceed with Review of SEAL Eddie Gallagher's Status Despite Presidential Support\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Navy announced on Thursday that it will move forward with an administrative review board hearing to consider the potential expulsion of Special Operations Chief Eddie Gallagher from the Navy SEALs, despite President Donald Trump's support. Gallagher and three supervising officers were informed of the hearing, scheduled for December 2.\n\nIn a tweet earlier Thursday, President Trump stated, \"The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin.\" He also added, \"This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!\" The Trident Pin is a symbol of membership in the SEALs.\n\nIn July, Gallagher was acquitted of murdering a wounded Islamic State militant in Iraq in 2017, but he was convicted on the single charge of posing with the body of the dead prisoner. Last week, Trump restored Gallagher's rank after he had been demoted to petty officer first class. However, the president did not pardon Gallagher for his offense.\n\nIn a statement issued late Thursday, Rear Adm. Charlie Brown, Chief of Information, said, \"The Navy follows the lawful orders of the President. We will do so in case of an order to stop the administrative review of SOC Gallagher's professional qualification. We are aware of the President's tweet and are awaiting further guidance.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to an NPR request for comment on the tweet.\n\nGallagher's lawyers claim that Navy brass is seeking to expel him from the SEALs in retaliation for Trump's reversal of his demotion. They have filed a complaint with the Navy Inspector General, alleging that Naval Special Warfare Commander Rear Adm. Collin Green is defying the president.\n\n\"How can Admiral Green credibly preach about preserving good order and discipline while publicly flouting the orders of the commander in chief?\" Gallagher's attorney Timothy Parlatore said, as quoted by the Associated Press.\n\nIf a review board decision goes against Gallagher, he can then appeal to the Navy's Personnel Command.",
    " Title: Vatican Concludes Doctrinal Assessment of Leadership Conference of Women Religious\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Vatican has announced an end to the doctrinal overhaul of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR), marking the conclusion of a five-year process that began in 2012. The Vatican's announcement on Thursday signifies a perceived shift towards a more merciful church under Pope Francis, as reported by NPR's Sylvia Poggioli.\n\nDuring their annual visit to Rome, LCWR leaders met with Pope Francis, a meeting described by David Gibson of Religion News Service as another indicator of the thaw in relations. Both parties agreed to maintain silence towards the media for the next month, and the joint statement and final report issued Thursday seemed to represent a quiet and merciful end to the contentious period between the women religious and the Vatican.\n\nThe Rev. James Martin, SJ., editor at large of the Jesuit magazine America, stated in a Facebook post that the LCWR agreed to implement some changes, mainly regarding speakers and liturgies at its annual conventions. However, overall, the operations of the LCWR remain intact.\n\nJoshua J. McElwee, writing in the National Catholic Reporter, described the news as bringing an end to an especially contentious period between the women religious and the Vatican. The investigation of the LCWR, which began in 2012 under Cardinal William Levada, the previous head of the Vatican's theological watchdog, was initiated due to concerns that the umbrella group representing most American nuns had strayed from church doctrine and adopted \"radical feminist\" views. The investigation called for a five-year doctrinal overhaul of the group.\n\nSister Simone Campbell, head of the Catholic social justice lobby Network, told NPR at the time that the investigation came \"like a sock in the stomach.\" A separate Vatican investigation into U.S. nuns ended last December with the Vatican expressing appreciation for the dedicated work of nuns in education, health, and among the poor.",
    " Title: Obama's 2014 Remarks on Asylum Seekers Resemble Trump's New Regulations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the Democrats have criticized President Donald Trump for new asylum regulations aimed at addressing the escalating humanitarian crisis at the southern border. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) described the regulations, which mandate migrants to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, not their preferred country, as \"illegal\" and \"cruel.\"\n\nHowever, a 2014 video featuring former President Barack Obama sheds light on the evolution of the Democrats' stance on asylum issues. In the video, Obama stated that poverty and crime are not valid reasons for granting asylum. He explained that under U.S. law, refugees are admitted based on specific criteria, and asylum status is not typically granted due to economic need or dangerous living conditions.\n\nObama further clarified that the U.S. asylum-request pipeline may not be equipped to handle a large-scale humanitarian asylum crisis. He emphasized that accommodating a large number of additional migrants would not necessarily be feasible.\n\nThe context of Obama's comments is traced back to a meeting at the White House in 2014 with Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina, and El Salvadorian President Salvador Sanchez Ceren. The meeting was held to discuss a migrant crisis that was affecting Central America, Mexico, and the U.S., particularly the surge of unaccompanied migrant children that overwhelmed U.S. immigration resources.",
    " Title: Actor Mehcad Brooks Features in Center for Reproductive Rights' Video Celebrating 40th Anniversary of Roe v. Wade\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights, an organization advocating for the legalization of abortion through legal means, has released a video to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade. The video features actor Mehcad Brooks, known for his roles in USA Network's \"Necessary Roughness\" and HBO's \"True Blood.\"\n\nThe video's release has sparked debate, with some arguing that the involvement of men in the abortion debate is unnecessary, while others view the video as a celebration of the procedure. The video's message has been interpreted as suggesting that men can disregard their responsibilities as fathers due to the availability of abortion.\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights' choice of Mehcad Brooks for the video has raised questions, given the organization's history and the controversial views of Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, who was an advocate for birth control and abortion. Sanger's writings have been criticized for expressing racist views, including a belief in the need to limit the reproduction of certain racial groups.\n\nThe video has also sparked discussion about the high rate of abortions in the black community. According to data from the Guttmacher Institute and the U.S. Census, black women make up 13% of the female population in the United States, yet they account for 30% of the abortions performed.\n\nThe video has been met with criticism for its tone, with some viewing it as glorifying and belittling the serious nature of abortion, a medical procedure with potential lifelong psychological consequences. The Center for Reproductive Rights and Mehcad Brooks have not commented on these criticisms.\n\nThe debate surrounding the video will continue tonight, with the issue being discussed on Fox News' \"Hannity\" at 9:40 pm EST.",
    " Title: SBA Anticipates Imminent Exhaustion of Paycheck Protection Program Funds\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Small Business Administration (SBA) has announced that the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a relief initiative aimed at supporting small businesses financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, may run out of funds as early as Wednesday. As of April 15, 1.3 million loans have been approved, totaling nearly $300 billion.\n\nAccording to reports, the $349 billion allocated to the PPP program is nearing depletion. This development was first reported by Jennifer Jacobs on Twitter, stating that sources indicate the SBA expects to exhaust the funds imminently, possibly even this afternoon.\n\nThe Senate originally legislated $350 billion for the small business sector, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has advocated for additional funding since last week. However, Senate Democrats have blocked this effort. Senate Republicans have proposed a clean bill to legislate an additional $250 billion to the program.\n\nIn a tweet on April 13, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed concern over the delay in funding, stating, \"Small businesses in rural areas should have access to funds even if they're not customers of larger banks. Small banks & funds should be able to provide this help NOW. Small businesses shouldn\u2019t have to wait while well-connected banks dole out $$ to favored clients.\"\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer have accused the Republican party of causing the funding delay, while the GOP has countered that the hold-up was orchestrated by Democrats. Pelosi, in a tweet on April 15, stated, \"The Paycheck Protection Program is a crucial tool for protecting workers across the country \u2013 yet serious flaws are keeping far too many small businesses from receiving the resources they need. The @ SenateGOP must stop blocking commonsense solutions that put # FamiliesFirst.\"\n\nThe lack of additional funding for the PPP program could result in further economic distress for small businesses, emphasizing the need for Congress to collaborate and swiftly legislate additional funds to support this vital program.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking President Obama's Affordable Care Act Insurance Pledge\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's pledge that individuals could keep their insurance policies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been a subject of controversy in recent weeks, with numerous stories about policy cancellations across the country. However, a closer examination of the situation reveals that the issue is more complex than it appears.\n\nFirst, it is crucial to understand that the ACA grandfathered all individual policies that were in place at the time the law was enacted. This means that plans that were active at the time President Obama was advocating for the bill could still be offered, even if they did not meet all the ACA's standards.\n\nThe policies being terminated due to non-compliance with the ACA's minimal standards were all plans introduced after the passage of the ACA. Insurers introduced these plans knowing they would not meet the standards that would take effect in 2014. Insurers may not have informed their clients at the time they sold these plans that they would not be available after 2014 because they had designed a plan that did not comply with the ACA.\n\nIf insurers did not inform their clients that the new plans would only be available for a short period, the blame would seem to rest with the insurance companies, not the ACA. President Obama did not promise people that he would keep insurers from developing new plans that do not comply with the ACA's provisions.\n\nIn addition to the new plans that did not comply with the ACA's terms, there have been complaints that the grandfathering was too strict. For example, insurers can only raise their premiums or deductibles by a small amount above the rate of medical inflation. As a result, many of the plans in existence at the time of the ACA are losing their grandfathered status.\n\nIn this case, it is wrong to view insurers as passive actors who are being forced to stop offering plans because of the ACA. The price increases charged by insurers are not events outside of the insurers' control. If an insurer offers a plan with many committed buyers, it would presumably be able to structure its changes in ways that are consistent with the ACA. If it decides not to do so, this is presumably because the insurer has decided that it is not interested in continuing to offer the plan.\n\nAs a practical matter, there are many plans that insurers will opt to drop for market reasons that may or may not have anything to do with the ACA. It's hard to see how this could be viewed as a violation of President Obama's pledge. After all, insurers change and drop plans all the time. Did people who heard Obama's pledge understand it to mean that insurers would no longer have this option once the ACA passed?\n\nIf Obama's pledge was understood as ensuring that every plan that was in existence in 2010 would remain in existence, then it would imply a complete federal takeover of the insurance industry. This would require the government to tell insurers that they must continue to offer plans even if they are losing money on them and even if the plans had lost most of their customers. This would at the least be a strange policy. It would be surprising if many people thought this was the meaning of President Obama's pledge.\n\nFinally, there will be many plans that insurers will stop offering in large part because of the changed market conditions created by the ACA. For example, last week the Washington Post highlighted a plan for the \"hardest to insure\" that was being cancelled by Pathmark Blue Cross of Pennsylvania. This plan is likely being cancelled because it is unable to compete with the insurance being offered through the exchanges. The exchanges charge everyone the same rate regardless of their pre-existing health conditions. A plan that is especially designed for people who have serious health conditions would almost certainly charge a far higher rate. If these high-priced plans no longer exist because they can not compete with the exchanges, would this mean that President Obama had broken his pledge?\n\nOn closer inspection, the claim that President Obama lied in saying that people could keep their insurance looks like another Fox News special. In the only way that the pledge could be interpreted as being meaningful, the pledge is true. The ACA does not eliminate plans that were in existence at the time the bill was approved.\n\nIf we want to play Fox News, President Obama also promised people they could keep their doctor. Since 2010, tens of thousands of doctors have retired or even died. Guess the pledge that people could keep their doctor was yet another lie from the Obama administration.",
    " Title: Vice President Pence to Meet with Mexican Officials Amidst Tariff Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nVice President Mike Pence is set to meet with top Mexican officials on Wednesday, as the Trump administration and Mexico engage in negotiations to avoid the implementation of proposed tariffs on Mexican goods. The tariffs, which could escalate to 25 percent by October, were announced by President Trump last week in response to increasing levels of illegal migration.\n\nTrump stated during a press conference in London on Tuesday that the tariffs are likely to be imposed as scheduled, casting doubt on a quick resolution during the meeting at the White House. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard is leading the Mexican delegation, with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also expected to attend.\n\nEbrard told reporters on Tuesday that the delegation has been preparing for the meeting, which was quickly convened with Pompeo over the weekend. \"What Mexico must do and we are doing is to prepare,\" said Ebrard. \"We have our strategy on how to coexist with what sometimes can be unpredictable.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has been vague about the specific steps Mexico would need to take to prevent the tariffs from taking effect, adding to the confusion surrounding the situation. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who has advocated for the tariffs, suggested they may not need to take effect at all.\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an interview that the administration wants to see Mexico help create a \"vast reduction\" in illegal crossings by tightening security on its border with Guatemala, expanding intelligence sharing with U.S. law enforcement agencies, and cracking down on migrants crossing its northern border with the U.S.\n\nThe economic and diplomatic tensions could slow or halt progress toward the president's North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) revision, which Pence has previously vowed would be approved by this summer. The trade pact was signed by the leaders of all three countries last year but must still be ratified by their legislatures. The U.S. and Mexican governments have both started the formal legislative process, but consideration could be delayed with the tariffs in place.\n\nThe private sector added just 27,000 jobs in May, according to a key study, a sign the president's multifront trade war is beginning to have an effect. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday the central bank is \"closely monitoring\" the situation and indicated it could respond by slashing interest rates in order to prevent widespread damage.\n\nMexico recently became the U.S.'s largest trading partner. Last year, the U.S. imported $346.5 billion in goods from Mexico, according to the U.S. trade representative. Automakers, agricultural companies, and retailers are expected to be hit hardest by the duties, which will be paid for by U.S. importers, who often pass along the cost to consumers.",
    " Title: Boehner Criticizes Obama's Budget Proposal, Citing Lack of Bipartisan Effort\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has criticized the budget President Barack Obama is set to unveil, stating that it takes no steps towards finding common ground with Republicans, despite the president's offer to cut federal entitlement spending.\n\nIn a press release, Boehner expressed his disapproval, stating, \"If the president believes these modest entitlement savings are needed to help shore up these programs, there's no reason they should be held hostage for more tax hikes. That's no way to lead and move the country forward.\"\n\nThe president's proposal, as described to CNN and other news outlets by senior Obama administration officials, includes changes to Social Security and Medicare, similar to an offer Obama made to Boehner during the fiscal cliff negotiations in December. This would include a cut of $400 billion to Medicare over a decade.\n\nBoehner responded, \"The president and I were not able to reach an agreement late last year because his offers never lived up to his rhetoric. Despite talk about so-called balance, the president's last offer was significantly skewed in favor of higher taxes and included only modest entitlement savings. He said he could go no further toward the middle, and that's why his last offer was rejected.\"\n\nThe reported entitlement program changes have also received criticism from left-leaning groups who argue the changes would hurt vulnerable individuals.\n\nObama's budget also includes tax increases, which Republicans say is a non-starter since taxes were increased on wealthy individuals as part of the final fiscal cliff deal.\n\n\"In the end, the president got his tax hikes on the wealthy with no corresponding spending cuts,\" Boehner wrote. \"At some point we need to solve our spending problem, and what the president has offered would leave us with a budget that never balances. In reality, he's moved in the wrong direction, routinely taking off the table entitlement reforms he's previously told me he could support.\"\n\nBoehner suggested further that Obama's so-called charm offensive was to little avail on budget matters. \"When the president visited the Capitol last month, House Republicans stated a desire to find common ground and urged him not to make savings we agree upon conditional on another round of tax increases. If reports are accurate, the president has not heeded that call,\" Boehner said.\n\nRepublicans have roundly criticized Obama for missing the February deadline for submitting his budget proposal. The proposal could be released next week, White House officials have said.\n\nThe Republican-led House has previously passed a proposal drafted by Budget Chairman Paul Ryan. It was a budget not warmly received by the Democratic Senate or the White House.",
    " Title: Trump-Erdogan Meeting Fails to Resolve NATO Ally Dispute Over Air Defense Systems\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan failed to reach an agreement during their meeting at the White House on Wednesday, November 13, regarding Turkey's decision to accept delivery of a Russian air defense system that has strained relations between the two NATO allies.\n\nThe Turkish president stated he might consider using the U.S.-made Patriot system in addition to the Russian S-400 system. Trump said they would continue working on the issue. Trump acknowledged the S-400 acquisition as creating \"very serious challenges\" for the U.S., expressing hope for resolving the situation.\n\nThe dispute over the competing air defense systems is a significant source of tension between the two countries. Turkey has also faced criticism for its incursion into Syria last month, targeting Kurdish forces that fought alongside the U.S. against the Islamic State. Additionally, Turkey has been criticized for repressing political opponents, journalists, and others.\n\nIn response to the Turkish military offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria, Erdogan stated, \"We're just fighting terrorists, period. If you don't fight back, you will have to pay a very hefty price.\"\n\nThe leaders' news conference, following a meeting with Republican lawmakers at the White House, provided Trump an opportunity to counter the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry. Trump stated he did not watch a minute of the televised hearings, which he called a \"hoax.\"\n\nRepublicans and Democrats in Congress expressed disapproval of Trump's meeting with Erdogan. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) described the meeting as \"mindboggling\" and \"appalling\" after the invasion of Syria. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) stated that significant concerns remain regarding both the S-400 and the attack on the Kurds, who \"have risked a lot to stand with America\" and battle the Islamic State.\n\nDuring the news conference, Trump jokingly suggested that Erdogan should only call on a friendly Turkish reporter. When Erdogan called on a female Turkish reporter, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) was overheard whispering to someone seated next to him, \"She's the only reporter left over there\" in Turkey.\n\nTwo Democratic senators have introduced legislation denouncing Turkey's targeting of journalists, political opponents, dissidents, minorities, and others. They claim the Turkish government has imprisoned over 80,000 Turkish citizens, closed more than 1,500 non-governmental organizations on terrorism-related grounds, and dismissed or suspended more than 130,000 civil servants from their jobs.",
    " Title: New York Financial Regulator Proposes Cybersecurity Measures to Protect Against Potential \"Armageddon-Type\" Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nBen Lawsky, head of New York's Department of Financial Services (DFS), has expressed concerns about the potential for a large-scale cyber attack on Wall Street firms that could have far-reaching effects on the broader economy. In a speech at Columbia Law School on Wednesday, Lawsky stated, \"We are concerned that within the next decade, or perhaps sooner, we will experience an Armageddon-type cyber event that causes a significant disruption in the financial system for a period of time.\"\n\nIn response, Lawsky is considering new regulations to compel banks and insurance companies regulated by DFS to enhance their cybersecurity measures. DFS has regulatory oversight over numerous New York-licensed banks and insurance companies, including Goldman Sachs, MetLife, and Barclays.\n\nTo prevent a catastrophic cyber attack, Lawsky plans to incorporate cybersecurity into the grades DFS assigns to the banks and insurance companies it regulates. Financial firms \"care deeply\" about their grades because they can impact their ability to pay dividends or acquire other companies, Lawsky said.\n\nLawsky also suggested implementing multifactor authentication systems for employees of DFS-regulated financial firms, stating that single-step passwords are outdated. Additionally, he may require banks and insurance companies licensed by DFS to secure guarantees from third-party vendors that their security meets certain standards.\n\nLawsky's call for enhanced cybersecurity follows a report last week by Moscow-based security firm Kaspersky Lab, which warned of a group of international cybercriminals who have stolen up to $1 billion from 100 banks across 30 countries by infiltrating their internal systems.\n\nIn his speech, Lawsky also addressed the issue of money laundering, proposing new regulations to improve detection of suspicious transactions. He suggested random audits for DFS-licensed banks to assess their effectiveness in flagging such transactions. Lawsky may also require bank executives to certify that their money transaction monitoring is up to par to better protect against terrorism and other crimes.\n\nLawsky's office has discovered that some banks do not take the monitoring of financial transactions seriously, as evidenced by the recent controversy surrounding British bank Standard Chartered, which was accused by Lawsky of ignoring money laundering. In August, the bank agreed to settle its dispute with DFS by paying $300 million and cutting off dealings with certain customers flagged for their suspicious transactions.\n\nLawsky stated that DFS caught Standard Chartered by comparing the company's flagging of suspicious transactions with its own system for finding suspicious activity. \"We basically ran the company's transactions through our own filtering system and compared the results,\" Lawsky said, noting that regulators typically rely on self-reporting from the firms they oversee.\n\n\"What regulators have not done is actively tested the effectiveness of the filtering systems banks are using,\" Lawsky said. \"That needs to change.\"",
    " Title: Democrats and Republicans Prepare for 2018 Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2018 midterm elections are expected to be crucial in determining the party in power for the subsequent election cycles. The outcome remains uncertain, with tight polling in numerous states leaving the question unanswered until Election Day in November. However, one fact is clear: Democrats face an uphill battle due to the 33 Senate seats up for grabs, with Democrats currently holding 22 of them, while Republicans hold just eight. Independents hold the remaining two seats.\n\nIn response to this challenging situation, Democrats are reportedly enlisting high-profile figures for support. Former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, are among those being called in to assist. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, admitted last week that Democratic Senate candidates welcome the support of Obama and the Clintons.\n\nAccording to Hollen, Clinton has already been reaching out to campaigns. The twice-failed presidential candidate started \"Onward Together\" last year, an organization focused on electing Democrats nationwide. Hollen stated, \"I think she's going to continue to reach out to candidates and let them know that she's ready to help in any way that she can. These are really conversations that go on between Secretary Clinton or President Obama and the particular campaign.\"\n\nIn the House of Representatives, every seat is up for grabs during each election cycle. If Democrats aim to regain control of the House, they have significant work ahead, as Republicans currently hold a 42-seat majority.\n\nHowever, in California, the situation appears chaotic for Democrats running for the House. The New York Times reports that national Democrats are pouring millions of dollars into congressional races to prevent a self-inflicted disaster that could jeopardize their chances of taking control of the House. The issue stems from the large number of Democrats running in important primaries, causing national party leaders to fear losing seats or being less competitive compared to the more organized Republicans.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Tasked with Proposing Obamacare Replacement, Despite Resistance\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has assigned three Republican senators the task of developing a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, if the courts rule against it. This move is seen as a prudent contingency plan, but Republican senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have expressed reluctance to take up this assignment.\n\nThe Senate is expected to wait for a potential deal between the White House and Democrats on health care before addressing the issue, according to Republican strategists. This strategy is based on the assumption that it is more advantageous for the party to focus on criticizing Democratic proposals rather than presenting their own health care plan.\n\nHowever, this strategy may not be effective, as many Republicans running for office in 2020 have already expressed a desire to replace Obamacare. The Republican administration is also advocating for the abolition of the health law in court. Democrats can easily accuse Republicans of seeking to eliminate a health law relied upon by millions of Americans.\n\nIf the lawsuit against Obamacare fails, it is unlikely that a conservative health care plan could pass through a Democratic-controlled House. Additionally, there is limited chance that a conservative plan could serve as the basis for a bipartisan compromise. This was a similar situation during the Obama administration, when Republicans chose not to settle on a health care plan due to concerns about enacting legislation they had no way to pass.\n\nThe key innovation of Obamacare was the centralization of health insurance regulation in Washington, D.C., which led to a decrease in choice and an increase in costs. Republicans tasked with replacing Obamacare should work to undo this centralization, according to the article.\n\nOne proposed solution is for the federal government to remove many of Obamacare's regulations and redirect the money currently flowing to Obamacare's exchanges and Medicaid expansions to state governments. State governments would then determine how to spend the money to meet their residents' health care needs.\n\nUnder this proposal, states could use a portion of the Obamacare money to buy insurance for able-bodied Medicaid recipients above the poverty line, while prioritizing those who are disabled, below the poverty line, or both. States could also allow Medicaid recipients to use a share of the Obamacare money to buy insurance on the private market.\n\nRepublican officeholders are encouraged to contribute their ideas to modify this basic template or propose a wholly different idea. The article concludes that it is important for Republicans not to simply hold off the next Democrat-led lurch to the left for a few years, and for conservatives not to let them. President Trump's challenge to his party is seen as a welcome one.",
    " Title: Senate to Vote on Federal Reserve Audit Legislation in 2015\n\nArticle:\n\nAfter years of being blocked by former Democratic leader Harry Reid, the Senate will finally have a chance next year to vote on legislation to audit the Federal Reserve's decision-making. The push for a full audit of the country's central bank has been led by Sen. Rand Paul and others, and has the backing of the new Republican majority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell.\n\nDespite overwhelming support in the House, where the legislation has passed twice, the bill is not a sure thing in the Senate. The Federal Reserve itself is pushing back against the audit, with Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen stating earlier this month that the Fed remains opposed to stricter oversight of its monetary policy decisions.\n\nFor supporters in Congress, the fight is a matter of constitutional prerogatives and good governance. They argue that the Federal Reserve oversaw trillions of dollars of stimulus during the 2009 Recovery Act, while the Act's spending and tax cuts totaled $800 billion.\n\nIn the House, legislation calling for an audit has passed twice, including most recently in September on a 333-92 vote. All but one Republican, and more than half of the Democrats in the chamber, voted for the legislation. However, former Democratic leader Harry Reid refused to give the bill floor time in the Senate, bottling it up in both 2012 and 2014.\n\nWith the GOP netting nine seats in November's elections, delivering control over the floor schedule to Sen. Mitch McConnell and undercutting Mr. Reid's power, the change in Senate leadership presents the best opportunity yet to get a stand-alone vote on \"Audit the Fed.\" However, Norm Singleton, vice president of policy at Campaign for Liberty, cautions that it is not a \"slam dunk.\"\n\n\"This is popular with 75 percent of the American people, but it's not popular among Wall Street; it's not popular among banks; it's not popular among foreign central banks,\" Mr. Singleton said. \"These hold a fair amount of sway among both parties, so just to say that a change in party necessarily means we'll be able to move Audit the Fed - it's better odds now than we've had before, but it's not a slam dunk.\"\n\nSen. Paul's spokesman, Sergio Gor, confirmed that they will make sure the bill is available for the new Congress. \"It will be among the first pieces of legislation to be introduced as soon as the new Congress convenes in January,\" Mr. Gor said. \"Transparency at the Federal Reserve remains a top priority for Senator Rand Paul.\"\n\nCongress established the Federal Reserve nearly a century ago. The system, which consists of a board of governors and 12 regional banks, acts as lender of last resort to the country's banking system, and it is charged with fighting inflation and promoting economic growth and employment. The interest rates it sets have a direct impact on the rates that banks charge consumers.\n\nThe audit legislation would grant the Government Accountability Office, Congress's chief investigative arm, the power to retroactively review the Fed's decision-making, particularly on monetary policy. Ms. Yellen and her defenders argue that giving the GAO audit powers could amount to having their decisions scrutinized almost in real time, which they say could influence the closed-door deliberations by the Fed.",

Trump accused Schiff of being a \"big liar and leaker\" in Washington, and claimed that Schiff illegally leaks confidential information from closed committee hearings.\n\nIn response, Schiff tweeted, \"Mr. President, I see you've had a busy morning of 'Executive Time.' Instead of tweeting false smears, the American people would appreciate it if you turned off the TV and helped solve the funding crisis, protected Dreamers or... really anything else.\"\n\nTrump did not provide evidence that Schiff has illegally leaked confidential information. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday morning.\n\nDemocrats plan to offer a motion at a Monday business meeting to release their counter-memo to the Republican memo, which alleges that the FBI improperly used information paid for in part by Hillary Clinton's campaign to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant for then-Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. Trump has said the memo \"totally vindicates\" him in the Russia probe.\n\nLast week, Republicans blocked a Democratic attempt to release their memo at the same time as the memo spearheaded by Chairman Devin Nunes of California. Republicans have since said they would vote to release the Democratic memo, drafted by Schiff.\n\nIn a separate tweet, Trump praised Nunes, calling him a \"man of tremendous courage and grit\" and suggesting that he may be recognized as a \"Great American Hero\" for his actions.\n\nThe four-page GOP memo, which was declassified and released last Friday, has sparked a political firestorm, with Democrats accusing the Republicans of cherry-picking information to support their narrative of FBI surveillance abuses. The Democrats' counter-memo is expected to rebut the Republican document. If approved by the committee, the matter would be sent to Trump, who would have five days to object to its release.",
    " Title: Trump Defends Steel Tariffs, Faces Criticism from Allies and China\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has defended his decision to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, stating that \"trade wars are good and easy to win.\" The tariffs, which will be 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, have been met with criticism from manufacturers and trade partners in China and Europe. The formal order is expected to be signed next week.\n\nIn a tweet on Friday, Trump said, \"When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win.\" The details of the planned action, including any product or country exemptions, have not been disclosed.\n\nThe planned tariffs, justified on the basis of cut-price metal imports hurting American producers and national security, have raised the prospect of tit-for-tat curbs on American exports and higher prices for domestic users. While the practical impact may yet turn out to be limited, the political environment for global trade has taken a turn for the worse.\n\nThe response in China, the world's largest steel producer, has been muted. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying merely said in Beijing that China urges the U.S. to follow trade rules. Industry insiders, however, have been less restrained. Wen Xianjun, vice chairman of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, said the U.S. measures \"overturn the international trade order.\"\n\nU.S. allies, seeing their industries threatened, have responded with bafflement and dismay. Some also panned the idea that metal imports pose a threat to national security. Japan's Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko said, \"Steel and aluminum imports from Japan, which is an ally, do not affect U.S. national security at all.\"\n\nThe European Union has vowed to \"react firmly\" with World Trade Organization-compliant countermeasures, while Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of steel to the U.S., said the measures were unacceptable. Australian Trade Minister Steve Ciobo called the move \"disappointing\" and said his country is seeking an exemption.\n\nThe tariffs could potentially level the unfair playing field that has persisted for years, making it easier for American companies to expand and hire workers, according to Trump. However, U.S. companies that use aluminum for manufacturing and packaging, such as beer brewer MillerCoors and candymaker Hershey Co., have said operations would be hurt by the tariffs.\n\nThe impact of the step hinges in part on which nations will be affected, and until the final scope of the tariffs and the response from global trading partners is known, it's hard to say it's the start of a tit-for-tat trade war. The move risks provoking retaliation, particularly from Beijing, which has already launched a probe into U.S. imports of sorghum and is studying whether to restrict shipments of U.S. soybeans.",
    " Title: Senator Marco Rubio Warns of Potential ISIS Attack on U.S. Homeland\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Marco Rubio (R-FL) has issued a chilling assessment suggesting that the jihadist ISIS insurgents, currently dominating parts of Iraq, will eventually launch attacks on the United States. Rubio, a member of the Senate's Foreign Relations and Select Intelligence Committees, believes that President Barack Obama's use of military force to protect American diplomats and military personnel in Iraq is not sufficient.\n\nIn his statement, Rubio warns that if decisive action against ISIS is not taken now, it will not only be Iraqis and Syrians who suffer, but Americans as well, due to a potential terrorist attack on the U.S. homeland or on U.S. personnel overseas. Rubio draws a parallel to the Clinton administration's handling of al-Qaeda in the 1990s, stating that terrorist groups, once established, use safe havens to launch attacks on the United States and its interests.\n\nRubio asserts that ISIS, with thousands of foreign fighters, many from the West, will not rest after taking the Kurdish capital of Irbil or Baghdad. He asserts that ISIS's expansionist ideology will lead it to attack U.S. allies in the region and eventually Europe and the United States.\n\nSenator Rubio calls for an increase in military and humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi government, as well as the Kurdistan Regional Government. His warning echoes that of Senate Intelligence Committee chair Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who has also expressed concern about ISIS's recruitment of fighters in Western countries and the potential threat they pose to European and American cities.\n\nFeinstein has called for a broader military campaign against ISIS, stating, \"It takes an army to defeat an army, and I believe that we either confront [ISIS] now or we will be forced to deal with an even stronger enemy in the future.\" She concludes, \"Inaction is no longer an option.\"",
    " Title: Clinton Accuses Trump of Inviting Alt-Right Movement, Ties Campaign to Racist Ideology\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech in Reno, Nevada on Thursday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton accused Republican nominee Donald Trump of inviting the \"alt-right\" movement into the political landscape. Clinton described the alt-right as an emerging racist ideology, characterized by anti-Semitic, white supremacist, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, and anti-women views.\n\nThe alt-right, primarily an online movement, uses websites, chat boards, social media, and memes to disseminate its ideology. The Star of David image that Trump was criticized for retweeting was reportedly first posted on an alt-right message board. The movement's members are predominantly young, white men who identify as champions of their own demographic, with their greatest points of unity lying in what they are against: multiculturalism, immigration, feminism, and political correctness.\n\nNicole Hemmer, a University of Virginia professor and author of a forthcoming book on the right, explained on NPR's Morning Edition that the alt-right views political correctness as the greatest threat to their liberty. They believe that saying racist or anti-Semitic things is not an act of hate, but an act of freedom.\n\nThe alt-right movement differs from traditional conservatism in several ways. Its origins can be traced to many conservatives' opposition to the policies of President George W. Bush, particularly the U.S. invasion of Iraq (alt-righters are strictly isolationist). They are also suspicious of free markets, a key tenet of conservatism, as they believe that business interests can often be in conflict with their higher ideals\u2014those of cultural preservation and homogeneity.\n\nTwo self-proclaimed leaders of the alt-right movement, Allum Bokhari and Milo Yiannopoulos of Breitbart, have outlined a manifesto of sorts for the group's beliefs and alliances. They claim that \"beltway conservatives\" despise alt-right adherents more than Democrats or progressive liberals. Instead, they see themselves as \"natural conservatives,\" with an \"instinctive wariness of the foreign and the unfamiliar.\"\n\nLast week, Trump announced that Stephen Bannon, chairman of Breitbart News Network, which Bannon has called \"the platform for the alt-right,\" would be his campaign's new chief executive. Hemmer stated that by putting Breitbart at the forefront of his campaign, Trump has elevated the alt-right. However, Hemmer suspects that Trump\u2014and the majority of his supporters\u2014do not pledge allegiance to the alt-right movement. Instead, they see Trump as a means to spread their ideas.\n\nClinton is expected to continue drawing a link between Trump and the alt-right in the minds of voters, reminding them that whatever the new moderate face of Trump might be, there are the things he has said and the implications of those statements, as well as the people he has brought into his campaign.",
    " Title: Federal Health Care Exchange Enrollment Reaches 100 as of October 2, According to House Oversight Committee Documents\n\nArticle:\n\nAccording to documents provided to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, 100 Americans had successfully enrolled in the federal health care exchange by October 2. The documents, which were posted online Thursday, also indicate that the six enrolled individuals were issued policies from five different insurance companies.\n\nThe notes from a \"war room\" meeting at the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance, which is part of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, underscore the beleaguered debut of the online marketplace. The documents show that Healthcare Service Corporation had two enrollments, while approximately 100 enrollments had taken place since the launch of the federal exchange by the next meeting held that afternoon.\n\nJoanne Peters, a Health and Human Services spokeswoman, stated that the department declined to release the number of Americans who have been able to successfully enroll in the exchange. \"We will release enrollment statistics on a monthly basis after coordinating information from different sources such as paper, online, and call centers, verifying with insurers and collecting data from states,\" Peters said.\n\nPeters reiterated that a slow start does not mean that the exchange will not boast a healthy roll call by the deadline to enroll. \"We have always anticipated that the pace of enrollment will increase throughout the enrollment period,\" Peters said. Citing the quiet pace at which Massachusetts residents registered for that state's health program, the spokeswoman remained confident that enrollment totals would tick up as more people learned about the exchange.\n\nHHS remains focused on providing accurate enrollment totals and cannot yet give those figures due to collection issues. \"We have had more than 20 million visitors to the Marketplace, showing an overwhelming interest in Americans learning more about their options for affordable health care,\" Peters said.",
    " Title: Republican Presidential Aspirants Criticize Hillary Clinton at New Hampshire GOP Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the New Hampshire city of Nashua, the Republican presidential candidates gathered for a two-day summit over the weekend, with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, being the main topic of discussion. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul delivered the strongest criticism of Clinton, focusing on her handling of the situation in Libya, particularly the 2012 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi.\n\n\"I think her dereliction of duty, her not doing her job, should forever preclude her from holding high office,\" Paul said.\n\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker suggested that Clinton's shopping habits may have left her out of touch with the average American. \"I doubt the presumptive nominee for the other party has ever been to Kohl's before,\" he said.\n\nHillary Clinton is scheduled to visit New Hampshire on Monday and Tuesday, but for the weekend, the political world's focus was on the Republicans in Nashua. The Republican candidates primarily attacked Clinton and President Obama, while calling for a freer economy and stronger foreign policy.\n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio managed to weave a compelling narrative, tying his Cuban immigrant parents' pursuit of the American dream to his efforts to save it for his daughters. Rubio positioned 2016 as a \"referendum on our national identity,\" saying that his children and their generation would be \"the first to inherit a diminished country from their parents.\"\n\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush attempted to assuage primary voters concerned about a potential Clinton-Bush general election, stating, \"I don't see any coronation coming my way, trust me.\"\n\nThe field's policy differences were on display, with Paul taking on his own party over Libya, advocating that the United States should never have waded into the conflict there in the first place. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, in particular, advocated a more muscular role in the Middle East.\n\nFormer Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina's speech was devoid of substance but managed to catch attention with her allusion to the Monica Lewinsky scandal and a rebuke of a Dallas businesswoman's comment that only men should be elected President.\n\nThe candidates' stage presence varied, with Bobby Jindal being considered the most forgettable speaker, while Donald Trump managed to both insult the audience and win their applause with his comments about running for president.\n\nOverall, the Republican candidates used the summit to criticize Hillary Clinton, attack President Obama, and present their visions for a stronger economy and foreign policy.",
    " Title: Justice Department Declines to Investigate Trump-Zelensky Call, Citing Lack of Evidence for Quid Pro Quo or Campaign Finance Violation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced that it will not investigate the July phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which prompted a formal impeachment inquiry into allegations of a quid pro quo scheme. In a statement on Wednesday, DOJ spokesperson Kerri Kupec stated, \"Relying on established procedures set forth in the Justice Manual, the Department's Criminal Division reviewed the official record of the call and determined, based on the facts and applicable law, that there was no campaign finance violation and that no further action was warranted.\"\n\nDuring the call, Trump repeatedly asked Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, over allegations that the former vice president used his position to help a Ukrainian energy company avoid a corruption probe soon after Hunter was appointed to its board of directors. On Tuesday, Trump admitted that he temporarily withheld military aid from Ukraine that was intended to help the country ward off Russian aggression, prompting suspicion of a quid pro quo scheme. If a quid pro quo deal was struck, it may constitute a campaign finance law violation since a foreign national, Zelensky, would have been providing Trump's campaign assistance in the form of opposition research on his chief political rival, Joe Biden.\n\nThe White House on Wednesday released a partial transcript of the call, which revealed Trump did in fact ask Zelensky to help Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani investigate Biden's influence in firing a Ukrainian prosecutor. The whistleblower complaint from an anonymous member of the intelligence community was submitted to the Director of National Intelligence's inspector general and subsequently sent to the DOJ in August.\n\nAn Office of Legal Counsel opinion released by the DOJ on Wednesday said the whistleblower complaint was not an \"urgent concern\" and challenged the idea that the complaint must be sent to the congressional intelligence committees. However, Senate Republicans on Tuesday unanimously approved a non-binding measure proposed by Democrats calling on the Trump administration to turn the complaint over to Congress.",
    " Title: President-elect Trump Steps Down from Business Empire to Focus on Presidency, Announces Cabinet Picks and Job Creation Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has announced his decision to step down from his multi-million dollar business empire to focus on his role as the nation's new commander in chief. In a tweet before dawn on Wednesday, Trump stated, \"I will be leaving my great business in total to fully focus on running the country in order to make America great again.\"\n\nTrump explained that he felt it was important, as president, to avoid any conflict of interest with his various businesses. The news comes as the Trump transition continues, with more cabinet picks, a Twitter firestorm, and a significant win on job creation.\n\nAmong the latest cabinet selections are Steven Mnuchin for treasury secretary, who, if confirmed by the Senate, will play a key role in shaping Trump's tax policy. Wilbur Ross, a Wall Street financier, was chosen to lead the Commerce Department. Elaine Chao, who served as labor secretary under George W. Bush and is the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky), was announced as the secretary of transportation.\n\nRobert Johnson, the founder of BET, was offered a post but declined, stating that, as an entrepreneur, he did not want to enter government bureaucracy. Johnson also said he has never considered Trump to be a racist or anti-African-American.\n\nThe biggest question at present is who will be selected for the position of secretary of state. Trump has been meeting with potential candidates for this role, with Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn) commenting, \"The secretary of state's role is so important to a president. He needs to choose someone that he is very comfortable with.\"\n\nTrump also had an elegant dinner with Mitt Romney on Tuesday, despite Romney's criticism during the campaign. Romney has since praised Trump for his victory in the election and his \"message of inclusion.\"\n\nGeneral David Petraeus, former CIA director, is also under consideration for the top diplomat position.\n\nTrump caused a Twitter storm on Tuesday with a tweet stating, \"Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag -- if they do, there must be consequences, perhaps loss of citizenship or a year in jail.\" The Supreme Court has ruled that flag burning is constitutionally protected speech.\n\nIn addition to job creation efforts, Trump is also making progress on other key campaign promises, such as repealing the Affordable Care Act, fixing the immigration system, and strengthening the economy by cutting taxes and government regulations and bringing back jobs. The air conditioning company Carrier Corp. has reached a deal with the president-elect to keep nearly 1,000 jobs in Indiana, fulfilling a campaign promise.",
    " Title: Federal Court Unseals Fusion GPS Bank Records, Reveals Details of Payments and Projects\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal court in Washington, D.C., unsealed documents in a lawsuit over Fusion GPS's bank records on Tuesday, providing new details of payments made last year to the opposition research firm that commissioned the infamous Trump dossier. The documents also shed light on requests made by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence about payments that Fusion GPS made to journalists.\n\nThe records, unsealed in response to a ruling made last week by Richard Leon, a federal judge in the district court in Washington, D.C., reveal transactions between two law firms that Fusion GPS worked with last year on two Russia-related projects.\n\nPerkins Coie, the law firm that represented the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), paid Fusion GPS a total of $1,024,408 between May 24, 2016, and Dec. 28, 2016, according to the records. The largest payment was made just before the election, with Perkins Coie making a $365,275 payment to Fusion GPS on Oct. 28, 2016. A payment made to Fusion in late-December is later than previously thought.\n\nThe transaction list does not show payments that Fusion made to Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the dossier. Fusion reportedly paid Steele a total of $168,000 for his work, which lasted from June 2016 until the election.\n\nThe records show that Fusion was also paid $523,651 by the law firm BakerHostetler between March 7, 2016, and Oct. 31, 2016. Fusion worked for BakerHostetler to investigate Bill Browder, a London-based banker who helped push through the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law vehemently opposed by the Kremlin.\n\nBakerHostetler represented Prevezon Holdings and its owner, a Russian businessman named Denis Katsyv. Katsyv and Prevezon sought to limit the impact of the Magnitsky sanctions.\n\nGlenn Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter and Fusion GPS founding partner, compiled the research for the anti-Browder project. He worked closely with Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who also showed up at the infamous Trump Tower meeting held on June 9, 2016. Simpson's research ended up in the Trump Tower meeting in the form of a four-page memo carried by Veselnitskaya. She also shared Simpson's work with Yuri Chaika, the prosecutor general of Russia.\n\nSimpson testified this week that he did not know that Veselnitskaya provided the Browder information to Chaika or to Donald Trump Jr., the Trump campaign's point-man in the Trump Tower meeting. Simpson also stated that he did not know that Veselnitskaya had visited Trump Tower until it was reported in the press earlier this year.\n\nThe unsealed documents also reveal details of the House committee's requests for records related to Fusion's payments to journalists. The document shows that the committee sought records related to \"five Fusion payments to research and Russia expert [name redacted]\" and the production of three additional payments. The committee also seeks records \"related to Fusion's payments to journalists who have reported on Russia issues relevant to its investigation.\"\n\nIn a memo filed Tuesday, lawyers for the House panel stated they are seeking transactions related to nine payments made to \"three individual journalists...each of whom have reported on and/or been quoted in articles regarding topics related to the Committee's investigation, some of which were published as recently as October 2017.\" The names of the journalists are redacted in the filing.\n\nIt is not clear from the requests whether Fusion GPS paid active journalists for their work. The firm is known to employ a stable of former reporters. Simpson and his two founding partners, Peter Fritsch and Thomas Catan, worked together at The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe unsealed filings show that Fusion argued against releasing records related to payments to journalists. In a Nov. 3 declaration, Fritsch argued that \"transactions between Fusion GPS and certain journalists...are not pertinent to work related to Russia or Donald Trump.\" And in a Nov. 2 email to the Intel committee's legal team, Levy argued that \"records related to payments to the journalists and 'individuals' are protected by the First Amendment and confidentiality, and they are not pertinent.\"",
    " Title: Justice Department Drops Charges Against John Edwards\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Justice Department has decided not to retry former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards following a federal judge's declaration of a mistrial in his corruption case two weeks ago. The department filed an \"order for dismissal\" on Wednesday in the U.S. District Court in North Carolina, dismissing the remaining five counts against Edwards on which the jury had been deadlocked.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer defended the department's decision to prosecute the case, stating, \"We knew that this case -- like all campaign finance cases -- would be challenging. But it is our duty to bring hard cases when we believe that the facts and the law support charging a candidate for high office with a crime.\"\n\nThe jurors could not reach a unanimous verdict on five of the six counts of the indictment, and the government respects their judgment, according to Breuer. Edwards was already found not guilty on one other count.\n\nEdwards' attorneys, Abbe Lowell, Allison Van Laningham, and Alan Duncan, welcomed the decision in a joint written statement. They asserted that while Edwards had admitted to his sins, he did not violate any campaign law nor did he imagine that any campaign laws could apply.\n\nJudge Catherine Eagles declared a mistrial two weeks ago after the jury was unable to reach a verdict on most of the counts alleging Edwards accepted illegal campaign contributions. Prosecutors had tried to prove that hush money sent to his mistress by wealthy donors during the 2008 presidential campaign constituted illegal donations. Edwards' lawyers, however, claimed the money was meant to hide his affair from his wife Elizabeth, who has since died of cancer, and not from voters.\n\nEdwards stated after the trial that while he does not believe he did anything illegal, \"I did an awful, awful lot that was wrong.\"",
    " Title: Republican Senator Jeff Sessions Accuses Obama Administration of Failing to Enforce Century-Old Immigration Law\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, has accused the Obama administration of failing to enforce a century-old law meant to prevent immigrants from taking root in the United States to live on government welfare. The administration reported that no one was cited for this violation last year.\n\nSessions stated that \"virtually no one\" is being examined before they enter the country to determine if they will immediately begin to depend on government welfare. He emphasized that any immigration reform package \"has got to end that.\"\n\nLast week, Sessions presented new statistics from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that he described as a startling trend. DHS reported that relatively few immigrants are being turned away on the grounds that they are likely to become a \"public charge\" - individuals who depend on welfare programs - despite a 100-year-old law that is supposed to prevent this.\n\nThe department, citing \"data entry quality,\" reported that it did not have complete information on how many immigrants became public charges. However, DHS conducted a case-by-case review for the bulk of fiscal 2012, and found just one instance where this claim was leveled at an immigrant. \"However, the charge was later withdrawn,\" DHS reported.\n\nFurther, DHS reported that only a tiny fraction of people are rejected on these grounds when seeking entry under a program that allows admission for 90 days for travelers from certain countries. Between fiscal 2005 and most of fiscal 2012, a total of 9,796 were denied - a fraction of a percent of those admitted. State Department figures for visa applications showed a similar trend, with just 0.068 percent of visa applications denied on these grounds in fiscal 2011.\n\nSessions has been vocal about this issue for months. He and other Republican senators earlier wrote to the departments of Homeland Security and State arguing that a bedrock principle of immigration law is that \"those who seek citizenship in this country ought to be financially self-sufficient.\"\n\nThe senator suggests the immigration system has produced a lopsided result in which high-skill immigrants are turned away while those who end up absorbing more taxpayer dollars than they contribute stay.\n\nRecent studies show welfare spending on immigrant-headed households is relatively high. A Center for Immigration Studies report found that 36 percent of these households were using \"at least one major welfare program\" in 2010 - compared with 23 percent of other households.\n\nSessions' office states that the number of non-citizens on food stamps has increased significantly in recent years. The conservative Heritage Foundation claims low-skill immigrant households take in roughly $20,000 more in government benefits every year than they pay in taxes.\n\nSessions suggests the government is fueling this trend. He previously criticized long-running U.S. Department of Agriculture radio \"novelas\" that depicted people being pressured into going on food stamps. The ads were later discontinued. The senator is also drawing attention to the WelcomeToUSA.gov site that provides information on a host of taxpayer assistance programs for immigrants, including Medicare, food stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and others.",
    " Title: Treasury Lifts Sanctions on Three Russian Companies Tied to Oleg Deripaska, Maintains Sanctions on Oligarch\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department announced on Wednesday that it will remove sanctions imposed on three Russian companies, United Co. Rusal PLC, EN+ Group PLC, and JSC EuroSibEnergo, due to their ownership or control by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. The companies were placed on the U.S. sanctions list in April.\n\nThe Treasury Department stated that the companies agreed to a sweeping deal centered on severing Deripaska's ties with them, resulting in their removal from the blacklist. The removals, expected to take place in 30 days, are based on a change in factual circumstances \"in line with longstanding U.S. sanctions precedent\" that \"is not intended to significantly alter U.S. foreign policy.\"\n\nThe Treasury Department had issued licenses at least six times since April, allowing the companies to continue operating while they worked with the U.S. government to reach a satisfactory divestment plan. The deal would be a binding agreement between the companies and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the Treasury's sanctions office.\n\nThe agreement requires Deripaska to reduce his ownership stake in EN+ from 70% to 44.95%, and he is prohibited from increasing his stake. In reducing his stake, Deripaska won't receive cash for his shares nor from future dividends issued by the companies, according to the agreement.\n\nEN+ is \"the linchpin\" underlying the sanctions designations on all three companies, as Deripaska has virtually no direct ownership in Rusal and none at all in EuroSibEnergo. The agreement also requires sweeping governance changes, including limiting Deripaska's voting rights in EN+, creating a 12-person board mostly independent of him, and committing him to severing his ability to control the company.\n\nEN+ will continue to control Rusal through a 56.88% stake, and it will retain the right to nominate the chief executive. EN+ also will use that majority control to create a 14-person board, most of whom will have no ties to Deripaska. Rusal's current chairman will step down, with the new chair held by one of the new directors. EuroSibEnergo, which is wholly owned by EN+, will provide the Treasury with monthly certifications they are not acting on behalf of Deripaska.\n\nThe companies will face severe consequences if they fail to comply with the agreement, including being put back on the sanctions list, according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. \"OFAC maintains the ability under the terms of the agreement to have unprecedented levels of transparency into operations,\" he said.\n\nDavid Murray, a vice president at consulting firm Financial Integrity Network who previously served as the director of Treasury's illicit finance office, commented that the deal provides a roadmap for other companies to pursue sanctions removal if they're not actively involved in illicit conduct. \"What we have is an outline of expectations that OFAC may have for other companies targeted solely because they're owned or controlled by someone on the sanctions list,\" Mr. Murray said.\n\nAluminum prices, which fell to a 16-month low before the sanctions announcement was made Wednesday, could head lower once the sanctions are lifted. Some analysts had predicted aluminum prices would rise again in 2019, based in part on the sanctions against Rusal, the world's second-largest aluminum producer. \"If (the sanctions) had not been solved, at least half of Rusal's production would have had to shut down,\" said Lloyd O' Carroll, an independent analyst for the metals industry. \"That's not happening now.\"",
    " Title: Town Hall Debate Format Presents Challenges for President Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nThe town hall-style debate, popularized by former President Bill Clinton in 1992, is set to feature President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in the upcoming presidential debate. However, the town hall format presents a distinct disadvantage for President Obama, according to Chris Arterton, a professor of political management at George Washington University.\n\nDemocratic partisans are expecting more passion from President Obama, perhaps not as intense as the vice presidential debate, but more than he displayed in the first presidential debate. The challenge lies in the fact that the town hall format requires the president to engage Romney in a more confrontational manner while simultaneously responding to the person asking the question.\n\nAlan Schroeder, a journalism professor at Northeastern University, agrees that it will be a balancing act for the president. The town hall format is more conversational, with a greater emphasis on dialogue with the questioner. Candidates are known for dodging questions and delivering rehearsed political soliloquies, but ignoring a working mother of two from Red Hook would not be an option in a town hall setting.\n\nIn a town hall debate, responsiveness to the question is a key measurement, according to Schroeder. Candidates also need to navigate the physical space and adapt to the different format, which includes being seated and moving around more freely.\n\nIn 1992, Clinton's town hall performance was marked by his engagement with the audience, walking around more freely, and being more responsive. This year, both Romney and Obama need to directly engage the citizen asking the question and respond in a way that showcases their understanding of grassroots politics.\n\nHowever, the town hall debate format has become more controlled since the days of Bush-Clinton, with no more random questions. Candidates now have to write their questions on a piece of paper, and the moderator chooses the question, with the questioner not allowed to depart from their written question or follow up. This has led to debates being less spontaneous, as seen in the 2008 town hall debate between Obama and GOP nominee Sen. John McCain, which Schroeder described as one of the dullest presidential debates in history.\n\nThe tussle over control of the format is ongoing, with CNN anchor Candy Crowley, who will moderate the debate, raising hackles on both sides for suggesting she may take a more active role in the questioning. As the debate approaches, President Obama may need to change his tactics while still maintaining a consistent image. In 2000, Vice President Al Gore changed his style from debate to debate, according to Arterton, and people struggled to get a fix on who he was.",

The protester demanded they leave the establishment and the country, and later followed McConnell to his car, throwing his to-go box out the door.\n\nCarlson, in his interview, accused the mainstream media of mirroring the Democratic Party's political objectives and presenting news in line with the party's talking points. He also suggested that the Democratic Party is not in control of its \"crazy people on the street\" who are committing acts of violence.\n\nWhen asked about alleged violence on the political Right, Carlson stated that while there are extremists on all sides, there are currently no groups of conservatives engaging in the same level of disruptive behavior as those on the Left, such as screaming at Democratic lawmakers in restaurants, on airplanes, or in airports, or smashing Starbucks windows and blocking traffic.\n\nCarlson's comments come as part of a broader discussion on the country's heated politics, which he addresses in his new book, \"Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution.\"",
    " Title: Leaked GOP Proposal Offers Detailed Look at Obamacare Replacement Plan\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, a leaked draft proposal has provided the most comprehensive and specific glimpse to date at the long-awaited Obamacare replacement plan from the Republican Party. The document, while not a finalized piece of legislation, offers a roadmap for the GOP's approach to overhauling the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.\n\nThe leaked proposal eliminates many of the market-distorting provisions contained within the ACA, such as the individual mandate to purchase insurance, and subsidies that reduce the incentives for those outside the labor force to remain there. Instead, the plan would establish tax credits based on age, not income, to help uninsured patients afford private insurance plans.\n\nThe plan also scales back or eliminates some of the ACA's most burdensome tax provisions, including the Medicare surtax on wages and self-employment income. It eliminates federal Medicaid expansion by 2020, but preserves capped payments to states based on the number of enrollees in states that expanded Medicaid already.\n\nThe plan also includes grants to states that would allow them to experiment with programs designed to increase coverage rates or reduce premiums. This approach, according to conservative healthcare wonk Avik Roy, represents a departure from the ACA's federally-driven mandate bonanza and could help create a wider array of available coverage, including cheaper options, and stabilize the risk pools that the ACA is ruining.\n\nHowever, the plan also includes elements that appear to partially mimic or tweak the ACA's existing provisions. For instance, the proposal still prohibits insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, so long as those people have maintained continuous coverage. This, according to Roy, strongly incentivizes consumers to obtain coverage without imposing an individual mandate tax, which is repealed under this plan.\n\nThe draft GOP plan also faces criticism for its approach to tax credits, with some arguing that the proposed amounts are flawed. The proposal also entails critical reforms to Medicaid (through a form of flexible block-granting) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), and pumps billions into a modernized version of high-risk pools.\n\nOverall, the GOP plan represents a significant shift from the ACA, with the core of the troubled law being removed and replaced with a system that massively curtails burdensome federal mandates and taxes, and offers more flexibility and discretion to the states. However, it's important to note that the eventual legislative language is likely to be different from the draft document, and debates, negotiations, and legislative mark-ups are expected to iron out the disputes and details.\n\nIn related news, some of the nation's most vulnerable Senate Democrats are reportedly avoiding town hall meetings, according to a report by ABC News. This development comes as media chatter about town hall meetings on healthcare is all the rage these days. Conservatives are encouraged to attend these events and make phone calls to their members' offices to help stiffen GOP spines in the face of intense, and sometimes coordinated, liberal opposition.",
    " Title: Young People Favor Same-sex Marriage, but Marriage Rates Decline Among Straight Couples\n\nArticle:\n\nDavid Frum, a well-known commentator, has highlighted a shift in public opinion regarding same-sex marriage, stating that 80% of Americans under 30 support it. However, he poses a larger question about the future of marriage in general. Frum suggests that children born to single parents face longer odds in life compared to those born to married parents.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments this week in two same-sex marriage cases. Regardless of the court's decision, the widespread support among young people for same-sex marriage seems inevitable. However, Frum notes that while young straight Americans support marriage for same-sex couples, they are increasingly opting against marriage for themselves.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly half of American children, 48%, are now born to unmarried women. This trend is particularly prevalent among women without college degrees and of all races, as unwed motherhood has become the norm.\n\nFrum refers to this trend as the \"crisis of the American family.\" He argues that children born to single parents face more challenges in life, including lower chances of college completion, increased likelihood of prison involvement, and less likelihood of forming marriages themselves.\n\nA new study by ThirdWay.org suggests that the impacts of single parenthood are particularly intense for boys, with less significant effects on girls. However, Frum emphasizes that these are not absolute rules, as there are always exceptions.\n\nThe root of this issue, Frum suggests, is the decline of male wages relative to female wages. He cites a quote from Michael Greenstone, an MIT economist, who states, \"I think the greatest, most astonishing fact that I am aware of in social science right now is that women have been able to hear the labor market screaming out 'You need more education' and have been able to respond to that, and men have not.\"\n\nFrum also references a quote from Harvard's Christopher Jencks, a left-leaning academic, who states, \"Single-parent families tend to emerge in places where the men already are a mess.\"\n\nThe article discusses the need to address the single-parenthood problem, suggesting that men without a college education need to be made less of a \"mess.\" Frum argues that the decline of mass-production industries has put pressure on the roles and incomes of working-class and middle-class men. The expansion of government and service industries has opened new opportunities for women, of which working-class and middle-class men seem less able to avail themselves.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that it's important to note that men in full-time work continue to earn more than women in full-time work. However, it also acknowledges a widening divergence between the family patterns of the college-educated top one-third and those of the non-college-educated bottom two-thirds. Frum suggests that the family life of the bottom two-thirds is the family policy challenge of the 21st century, and the debate over same-sex marriage is no longer the pressing issue it once was. Instead, the focus should shift to ensuring that the next generation of American children enjoys the more equal chances and wider opportunities from a more universal commitment to marriage.",
    " Title: Romney's Wife Reveals Vice Presidential Search Includes Female Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney's wife, Ann Romney, has disclosed a significant detail about her husband's vice presidential search, revealing that he is considering a female candidate. In an interview with CBS News, Ann Romney stated, \"We've been looking at that, and I love that option as well.\" She added that there are several individuals under consideration for the position.\n\nDuring the interview, Ann Romney also expressed her belief that President Obama and the Democrats will \"do everything they can to destroy Mitt.\" She warned Mr. Obama, saying, \"Not when I'm next to him, you better not.\" Mitt Romney did not comment on this characterization of Mr. Obama's strategy during the joint interview.\n\nThe Romneys gave a rare joint interview while spending time with their family at their lakeside estate in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. The interview was conducted during a week-long holiday, a break from the campaign trail, and a chance for Romney to contemplate his campaign strategy before the pre-convention push.\n\nSpeculation is high about whom Romney will choose as his running mate, with several names circulating in Republican circles. These include Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman.\n\nAnn Romney also outlined her requirements for a running mate, stating that the person should be \"someone that obviously can do the job but will be able to carry through with some of the other responsibilities.\" She added that the person should be someone who will have her husband's support, someone he will enjoy being around, and someone who shares a similar personality type.\n\nFour years ago, Sen. John McCain selected then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a little-known conservative, to be the first female on a Republican presidential ticket. The selection led to questions about Palin's readiness to be president and criticism of an inadequate vetting process. This year, Romney has stated that preparedness to be president is his top requirement for a vice president.\n\nThe Romneys' vice presidential search is ongoing, with the self-imposed deadline for picking a running mate \"before the convention\" approaching. The Romneys' campaign has not provided further details about the status of the search.",
    " Title: Understanding the Rise of Mass Incarceration in America: A Look at the National Research Council Report\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is witnessing a growing movement towards reducing mass incarceration. Both the federal government and state governments are scrutinizing the number of individuals they send to prison and the lengths of their sentences. However, the question remains: how did the U.S. prison population grow so significantly over the past 40 years?\n\nA National Research Council report from 2014 debunked two common misconceptions about the causes of the increase, offering two primary reasons: increased efficiency in prosecution and lengthened prison sentences.\n\nThe report found that the rise in incarceration could not be attributed to crime rates increasing. Crime rates have varied over the past forty years, and do not seem to have a substantial impact on the prison population, regardless of the direction of crime rates. The report also found no evidence that harsher prison sentences deter crime.\n\nIt was not due to better policing leading to more arrests\nPolicing has evolved significantly since the beginning of the mass-incarceration era, and most of these changes have been designed to make policing more effective. This implies that police are better at apprehending criminals today than they were thirty years ago.\n\nHowever, the NRC report showed that since 1980, the ratio of arrests per crime\u2014in other words, the proportion of crimes that police were able to find and arrest suspects for\u2014stayed relatively constant. Based on the arrest-to-crime ratio, the authors wrote, \"no increase in policing effectiveness occurred from 1980 to 2010 that might explain higher rates of incarceration.\"\n\nIt was because people who got arrested were more likely to go to jail\nWhile the arrest-to-crime ratio is a rough measure of police effectiveness, the prison-to-arrest ratio is a rough measure of the efficiency of the prosecution and court process. The NRC report found that prosecution has become more efficient, and this was a significant reason for the explosion of the incarcerated population.\n\nWhy are people who get arrested more likely to end up in prison now than they were thirty years ago? Part of it is that more crimes now require a prison sentence than in 1980, so more of the people who are found guilty of crimes end up having to go to prison for them (rather than getting probation or a fine).\n\nPart of it is also that most people who get convicted of crimes these days never even go to trial\u2014they just plead guilty in exchange for a shorter prison sentence. This makes it much easier for prosecutors to move cases through the courts. Of course, efficiency is not necessarily the same as effectiveness\u2014in theory, the point of prosecution should be to determine whether the person committed a crime or not, not to convict and sentence as many people as possible.\n\nBut whatever the merits of the way prosecution works, the authors concluded it was a big reason for the rise of mass incarceration. In fact, during the 1980s, it was the biggest reason, before being overtaken by the last and most important factor.\n\nIt was because people who went to prison served more time\nThe biggest reason the prison population exploded, especially after 1990: more people were in prison for longer periods of time. This is also largely due to changes in sentencing policy. States and the federal government added lots of new mandatory minimum sentences in the 1980s and 1990s, which forced people convicted of a given crime to serve a certain number of years in jail.\n\nOne particularly harsh kind of mandatory minimum sentence was imposed as \"three-strikes\" laws, which forced a criminal convicted of his third felony to serve a long prison sentence (between 25 years and a life sentence). States and the federal government also passed \"truth-in-sentencing\" laws, particularly in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which forced inmates to serve a large amount of their prison sentences (typically 85 percent) before being eligible for parole.\n\nUltimately, the NRC report's authors said, the common denominator in both of the big causes of mass incarceration\u2014more prisoners per arrest, and longer sentences per prisoner\u2014is the harsher sentencing policies of the 1980s and 1990s. That means that sentencing reform policies that some state governments have been pursuing, and that members of Congress in both parties have proposed, are a good place to start when it comes to reducing mass incarceration\u2014even if they are not a panacea.",
    " Title: Politicians Distance Themselves from Cliven Bundy's Controversial Racial Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nNevada rancher Cliven Bundy's recent comments about the welfare of African Americans during slavery have sparked a wave of criticism and distancing from politicians, particularly those in the Republican party. Bundy's remarks, which were reported by The New York Times, have been echoed by other conservative figures such as Ted Nugent and Phil Robertson.\n\nIn an interview with reporters, Bundy questioned whether African Americans were better off as slaves or on government subsidies. \"They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton,\" Bundy said. He later added, \"And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom.\"\n\nBundy, who gained notoriety for his much-publicized land dispute with the federal government, defended his comments as idle thoughts. In an interview with \"The Peter Schiff Show,\" he said, \"In my mind I'm wondering, are they better off being slaves, in that sense, or better off being slaves to the United States government, in the sense of the subsidies? I'm wondering. That's what. And the statement was right. I am wondering.\"\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a potential 2016 presidential GOP contender, was among those who distanced themselves from the controversy. \"His remarks on race are offensive and I wholeheartedly disagree with him,\" Paul said in a statement. Republican Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada also condemned Bundy's comments.\n\nThe Republican National Committee called Bundy's comments \"completely beyond the pale\" and \"100% wrong on race.\" Mark Anthony Neal, an African-American studies professor at Duke University, suggested that Bundy's comments represent a cultural tension in some segments of America. \"We are looking at some of the 'last white men standing,'\" Neal said, referring to demographic shifts that show minorities now represent more than half of the nation's population born in 2010 and 2011, according to the most recent census data.\n\nPolitical experts say that Bundy's comments, along with those of Nugent and Robertson, speak to a politically active fringe element in America. Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University, said, \"What this reflects is that there are groups of people who have not been accepted by politically correct circles and have never learned to frame their comments in a palatable fashion. They take pride in that.\"\n\nThe comments have put politicians who have previously embraced figures like Bundy, Nugent, and Robertson in an awkward position. For instance, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, the Republican nominee for governor, took heat for allowing Ted Nugent to appear at a campaign event this year. Abbott's campaign said it did not endorse Nugent's comments. Other potential presidential candidates, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and the state's governor, Rick Perry, also distanced themselves from Nugent's remarks.",
    " Title: White House Invokes Executive Privilege Over 'Fast and Furious' Documents in Congressional Contempt Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing dispute between the Obama administration and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee over the 'Fast and Furious' operation has escalated, with reports indicating that the White House is asserting executive privilege over documents subpoenaed by the committee. The development comes just before a committee hearing, where lawmakers are expected to vote on whether to cite Attorney General Eric Holder for contempt of Congress for failing to turn over the documents.\n\nThe hearing, which is to be webcast here, is scheduled to take place amidst the news that the committee will proceed with the Republican majority's plan to cite Holder for contempt. The 'Fast and Furious' operation came to public attention following the December 2010 death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent, Brian Terry. Two guns connected to the botched gun-trafficking operation were found near Terry's body, sparking two congressional probes and an ongoing investigation by the Justice Department's inspector general.\n\nDuring a hearing on June 7, Holder faced questioning from Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) and other Republican lawmakers. Issa asked Holder if his department was aware of the tactics used in the flawed gunrunning operation, and Republicans accused him of not being forthcoming and not complying with subpoenas.\n\nAs of the time of this report, the committee has not yet voted on the contempt citation. Members are still arguing along partisan lines, with Republicans advocating for and Democrats opposing the contempt citation of Holder. If the committee does vote to hold Holder in contempt, the contempt citation would then go to the full House. The Associated Press reports that if the matter does progress to a federal case against Holder, past examples suggest it may not get that far.\n\nThe lawmakers are still in session, and no vote has been cast as of yet. Committee members are still giving their opening statements, with Republicans stating that the Obama administration has been resisting efforts to obtain information about 'Fast and Furious,' and Democrats arguing that the administration has cooperated fully.\n\nAt the start of the hearing, Issa stated that the committee did not set out to hold Holder in contempt, but rather to \"get the information the committee needs to complete its work.\" He described the assertion of executive privilege as \"untimely\" and \"not spoken of last night\" during negotiations between committee staffers and Justice Department officials.",
    " Title: Republican Greg Gianforte Wins Montana Congressional Race Amid Assault Allegation\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican Greg Gianforte has been declared the winner in the Montana congressional race, defeating Democrat Rob Quist despite an election-eve altercation with a journalist that led to a misdemeanor assault charge. The Associated Press called the race for Gianforte more than 2\u00bd hours after polls closed at 8 p.m. MDT, with 83 percent of precincts counted.\n\nGianforte led Quist by a margin of 50.3 percent to 43.9 percent, with Libertarian Mark Wicks receiving 5.8 percent of the vote. In his victory speech, Gianforte stated, \"Tonight, Montanans are sending a wake-up call to the Washington DC establishment.\"\n\nThe day before the election, Gianforte was charged with misdemeanor assault after allegedly body-slamming a reporter from Britain's Guardian newspaper. The incident occurred when the reporter asked Gianforte about the Congressional Budget Office's analysis of the GOP's healthcare bill. Three newspapers in the state rescinded their endorsements of Gianforte in response to the incident.\n\nGianforte apologized to the reporter, Ben Jacobs, during his victory speech, stating, \"That is not the person that I am and it is not the way that I will lead in this state.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have both expressed disapproval of Gianforte's behavior, but have stopped short of calling for him to step down or be barred from the GOP conference.\n\nThe victory gives Republicans a 239-193 majority in the House. The party is eager to capitalize on the wave of anti-Trump sentiment among progressive activists, but the Gianforte incident could cause headaches for GOP lawmakers. Democrats are now 0 for 2 in special election races, having also lost the April special election in the 5th Congressional District in Kansas.\n\nLooking ahead, both parties will turn their attention to the June 20 special election in Georgia's 6th Congressional District, where Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel are in a tight race. The outcome of this race will be closely watched as a potential indicator of the political climate in the lead-up to the 2018 midterm elections.",
    " Title: The Importance of Political Discussion at Thanksgiving: A Call for Conservative Families to Engage\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the holiday season approaches, numerous media outlets have been advising against discussing politics at the Thanksgiving dinner table. However, some argue that this is a missed opportunity for conservative families to engage with their liberal relatives, particularly those who have moved to coastal cities or attend college.\n\nIn many American families, Thanksgiving is a time to reflect on shared values and bond over generations. This year, even Bernie Sanders is reportedly preparing his progressive followers on how to navigate political discussions with family members.\n\nFor conservative families, the Thanksgiving table can serve as a unique opportunity to engage with relatives who may hold different political views, especially those who have moved to liberal strongholds or are currently attending college. These individuals may not often encounter conservative viewpoints, making the family dinner table a valuable platform for open dialogue.\n\nThe term \"bubble\" is not used here in hyperbole, but rather to represent the closed-off mindset of American progressivism in coastal cities and on college campuses. In places like New York City, where the labor movement is seen as too centrist and avowed Socialists are a political force, conservative viewpoints may be scarce. On college campuses, students may be exposed to an unparalleled and unmitigated rage of the American left, where \"cancel culture\" and groupthink overshadow academic debate.\n\nConservative families are encouraged to use this opportunity to share their perspectives, discuss the reasons for their political beliefs, and engage in open dialogue. This can include sharing personal stories, discussing the role of religion in their lives, and explaining the benefits of their political ideologies.\n\nFurthermore, families are encouraged to discuss the economy, the role of law enforcement, and the presidency. While it is expected that political differences may lead to heated discussions, it is essential to remember that these opportunities for open dialogue are rare and valuable.\n\nIn conclusion, the Thanksgiving dinner table can serve as a unique platform for conservative families to engage with their liberal relatives and share their perspectives. By discussing their personal stories, the role of religion, the economy, law enforcement, and the presidency, conservative families can help their relatives understand their viewpoints and foster open dialogue.",
    " Title: TV Newsrooms Adapt to Trump Presidency, Anticipate Unprecedented Coverage\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing Donald Trump's election as the 45th President of the United States, newsrooms across the country are reevaluating their coverage strategies to accommodate the unpredictable nature of the incoming administration.\n\n\"This changes everything,\" says Phil Griffin, president of MSNBC. \"We left the studio at 4 a.m., and we knew there was a whole other world of storylines and changes that are going to happen.\"\n\nMajor TV news operations were bracing for a ratings decline as the historic and contentious election wound down. CNN had its highest online traffic ever on Election Day, and the election was a distinct revenue driver for its parent company, Time Warner, this year. However, the company was warning as early as summer that its ratings would drop next year.\n\nThe unexpected victory of Trump, who defied most polls, has left TV networks to quickly reassess their coverage plans and story ideas. \"There are so many different threads that we'll pursue that we didn't imagine three days ago,\" Griffin says. \"It's an amazing story about what's going on in this country.\"\n\nThe first 100 days of any presidency are typically exciting, particularly when a new party takes over in Washington, D.C. The transition, with politicians jockeying for key Cabinet positions, is a horse race of its own kind. However, Trump, the inexperienced politician suddenly leading the federal government, adds multiple and substantive layers to the story.\n\n\"You've got a more dynamic transition in place,\" says Chris Isham, CBS News' Washington bureau chief. \"He's not a predictable Republican, not in the way of previous administrations.\"\n\nGauging Trump's comfort level with the press, already underway, has been as challenging as pinning down his stance on issues. Reporters who have known him for years speak of his accessibility and willingness to banter. Yet he's also sought political advantage in bashing the mainstream media.\n\n\"Let's see how much access he grants,\" says Chris Ariens, editor of TVNewser. \"He's not the candidate anymore. He's not going to be calling into Fox and Friends.\"\n\nOne of the first major interviews Trump granted after the election was to 60 Minutes, which will air Sunday. Jeff Fager, executive producer of 60 Minutes, said the show had planned on pursuing an interview with the president-elect regardless of the election outcome, but because so much of Trump's governing philosophy and policy specifics are unknown, it heightens the urgency.\n\n\"It's not about good TV. It's about how we can help people better understand,\" Fager says. \"There's a lot to talk about. Hopefully, we'll get some details.\"\n\nIn an interview clip released early by CBS, Trump says he's willing to retain some key provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including prohibiting insurers from denying coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThere has already been plenty of hand-wringing in American newsrooms about the failure to properly assess the impact of Trump's voters and the issues that drove them so eagerly to the voting booths. Coverage planning for Trump's presidency must entail deep-diving into these issues to hold him accountable for some of his outlandish proposals, Fager says.\n\n\"There are so many layers that make this interesting,\" he says. \"He's tapped into the dissatisfied voters. That's an important part of this. How is he going to address the issues they care about? How is he going to build a wall?\"\n\nBeyond issues, scrutinizing Trump's governing styles and tendencies\u2014not as a career politician, but honed on the fly based on his experience as a real estate developer and TV personality\u2014will also be a rich source of stories.\n\n\"He's a businessman who's a negotiator,\" Fager says. \"There's a lot of stories that could be generated in (covering) someone who's got a totally different perspective on how to get things done.\"\n\nWhile no news executives may admit it publicly, the possibility of Trump's gaffes and unfiltered diatribes, frequently evident during his campaign, remains an intriguing variable, says Mark Feldstein, a broadcast journalism professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, and a former journalist at NBC.\n\n\"Media critics are always attacking TV for ideological bias,\" he says. \"But the real bias is toward conflict, controversy, and excitement because that's what increases revenue. Whether you love or hate him, he is going to bring controversy.\"",
    " Title: Trump Softens Stance on Immigration, Courts Non-White Vote Amidst Controversial Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent shift in his campaign strategy, Republican nominee Donald Trump has softened his stance on immigration, a signature issue of his campaign, as he attempts to appeal to non-white voters. This change in approach comes as polls show Trump trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, particularly among likely non-white voters.\n\nLast summer, Trump proposed a controversial plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, with Mexico paying for it. His stance on immigration has been notoriously hardline, with unclear proposals regarding the estimated 11 million undocumented migrants currently residing in the U.S. He has suggested a \"deportation force\" to remove them.\n\nOn Saturday, following a meeting with his Hispanic advisory council, reports emerged that Trump was softening his stance. On Sunday, newly appointed campaign manager Kellyanne Conway seemed to waffle on whether Trump was still committed to deportation. In an interview with Fox News, Trump himself denied that he was \"flip-flopping.\" To buy more time to refine his stance, the campaign postponed a speech Trump was due to give on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump stated that immigrants not in the U.S. legally would not receive citizenship, but also appeared to offer a path forward and contradict his previous promises of deporting undocumented migrants.\n\n\"They'll pay back taxes, they have to pay taxes, there's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we will work with them,\" Trump said in a town hall with Fox News anchor Sean Hannity. The next day, he met with African American and Latino activists at Trump Tower in New York.\n\nSuch apparent moderation on immigration comes as Trump tries to aggressively court Hispanic and African American voters. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday gives Clinton a 62-point lead over Trump among likely non-white voters.\n\nIn a speech in Akron, Ohio, on August 22, Trump made controversial remarks about crime in American inner cities, stating that they are \"safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats.\" This statement, at best, offers a broad-brush portrait of America's cities and, at worst, uses offensive language towards the very voters Trump is trying to reach.\n\nTrump also claimed that crime is at \"levels that nobody's seen.\" Based on the context and past statements about crime statistics, we can assume he means crime is at record heights. However, this bleak picture of crime-ridden American streets, more dangerous than parts of the world where the U.S. is engaged in military action, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, runs counter to a trend of declining crime that has persisted for more than a quarter of a century.\n\nTrump also claimed to employ \"so many, so many\" African Americans in his various businesses. However, a June analysis by the Associated Press found \"few if any\" black executives in the upper echelon of Trump's organization.\n\nTrump has recently increased his outreach to African American voters, but he delivers his speeches before largely white audiences. A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed Trump receiving the support of only 1% of African American voters.\n\nIn a speech in Dimondale, Michigan, on August 19, Trump repeated an eye-popping statistic: that more than half of young black men and women are unemployed. The latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) put the unemployment rate among 16- to 19-year-old black Americans at 25.7%, adjusted seasonally. So how did he get to 58%?\n\nThe campaign's economic adviser, David Malpass, told ABC News it began with BLS data from 2015 and broke out the numbers for 16- to 24-year-old African Americans. As part of its calculation, the campaign included labor force participants and those outside the labor force, including people who have no job or are not looking for one, such as students and retirees. These are sectors of the population the federal government does not count as unemployed.\n\nThe campaign then divided the larger number by the population of the 16-to-24 age group to reach 58.5%, ABC reported. Economists have said it is statistically misleading to include segments of the population that are actively not seeking employment.",
    " Title: Biden's Third Presidential Bid: Unity Candidate or Divisive Figure?\n\nArticle:\n\nJoe Biden, who has previously run for president in 1988 and 2008, is set to officially announce his third presidential campaign this week. According to RealClearPolitics, he leads in 36 out of 37 polls for the 2020 Democratic nomination contest and is also ahead in Iowa and California, where his opponent, Kamala Harris, is from.\n\nHowever, Biden's candidacy is facing a significant challenge: the question of his ability to unite the Democratic Party across ideological and demographic lines. His long political career, which includes his two terms as vice-president under Barack Obama, initially positioned him as a bridge between the Clinton-Obama era and a more progressive future.\n\nRecent months, however, have seen a resurgence of criticism over Biden's association with some of the less defensible political and policy trends of the past, particularly those that are unpopular among minority and feminist constituencies. Allegations of inappropriate behavior towards women have further fueled doubts about Biden.\n\nDespite this, Biden's standing among Democratic voters remains strong. Morning Consult's tracking poll of Democrats currently gives him a 75/15 approval ratio. He is also the top second-choice candidate for those who favor Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke, or Bernie Sanders.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen if this support will hold, especially as his rivals begin to attack him more directly. If Biden chooses to distinguish himself from more progressive candidates as a moderate, he could risk falling between stools, as some have suggested. Alternatively, he could restore his \"unity candidate\" persona by clearly establishing himself as the most, or even the only, electable opponent for Donald Trump.\n\nThe feasibility of an all-electability rationale for Biden may depend on the assumption that Biden has a unique ability to appeal to white working-class swing voters in the Rust Belt states that Barack Obama won and Hillary Clinton lost. However, it is still early for general-election trial heats to have any significance, and partisan polarization may eventually erase any differences among Democrats.",
    " Title: Volker Testimony Undercuts Specific Allegations Against Biden in Trump Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican lawmakers are increasingly relying on the closed-door testimony of senior diplomat Kurt Volker in their defense of President Donald Trump against allegations of impropriety in the House impeachment inquiry. According to Volker's account, Trump never engaged in an improper \"quid pro quo\" when he pressured Ukraine's new president to investigate allegations against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, one of Trump's staunchest allies, stated that Ambassador Volker's testimony is the definitive account of the events in question. Trump himself thanked Volker for his testimony in a tweet on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, Volker's testimony contradicts the specific allegations against Biden that Trump and his allies have been promoting for months. Volker testified that no evidence was brought forward to support the allegations, and he considered them self-serving and not credible.\n\nBiden has publicly recounted how, as the Obama administration's point man on Ukraine in 2016, he pressured Ukraine's leadership to fire the prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin. Biden even threatened to withhold nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid if Shokin was not removed.\n\nVolker testified that Biden's push for Shokin's firing was justified, as Shokin was not pursuing corruption cases and had a reputation for not doing his job. The ousted ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, also testified that Shokin had a \"notorious reputation\" for \"not doing his job.\"\n\nIn March, Shokin's successor, Yuriy Lutsenko, unleashed a series of explosive allegations about Shokin's firing. Lutsenko alleged that Biden pushed for Shokin's firing to protect his son and derail the Ukrainian investigation of Burisma, the major gas company where Biden's son, Hunter, served on the board.\n\nVolker testified that Lutsenko's allegations against Biden were self-serving and made up to save his job and prevent investigations into himself for potential corruption. Lutsenko's allegations have never been directly or fully debunked, according to Volker.\n\nIn May, after Zelenskiy was elected Ukraine's new president and after the allegations against Biden began to attract more media attention, Lutsenko seemed to back away from his initial claims, telling Bloomberg News, \"Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws, and at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing.\"",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee Releases 658-Page Report on Impeachment Case Against President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee has released a 658-page report detailing the impeachment case against President Donald Trump, alleging two impeachable offenses: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress during its investigation. The report states, \"President Trump has placed his personal, political interests above our national security, our free and fair elections, and our systems of checks and balances.\"\n\nThe Democrats argue that Trump's actions constitute impeachable offenses, even if they are not explicitly outlined in the articles of impeachment. The report states, \"While there is no need for a crime to be proven in order for impeachment to be warranted, here, President Trump's scheme or course of conduct also encompassed other offenses, both constitutional and criminal in character.\"\n\nThe report accuses Trump of abusing power, which it claims constitutes the constitutional offense of \"Bribery.\" It also alleges multiple federal crimes. The Democrats argue that Trump has betrayed the national interest, the people of the nation, and should not be permitted to be above the law.\n\nRepublicans have pushed back, with Ranking Member Doug Collins (R-GA) criticizing the Democrats for \"pursuing impeachment first and building a case second\" based on hearsay and assumptions. The minority argues that \"not one of the criminal accusations leveled at the president over the past year\u2014including bribery, extortion, collusion/conspiracy with foreign enemies, or obstruction of justice\u2014has found a place in the articles.\"\n\nThe Republicans also claim that the actions taken by the Democrats during the impeachment process are \"unprecedented, unjustifiable, and will only dilute the significance of the dire recourse that is impeachment.\" The full House is expected to vote on the articles of impeachment this week.",
    " Title: Missing Wisconsin Girl Jayme Closs Found After 88 Days; Suspect Arrested\n\nArticle:\n\nA 13-year-old Wisconsin girl, Jayme Closs, who had been missing since her parents were found dead in their home three months ago, has been located. Jayme escaped from a remote house on Thursday and was found by a woman walking her dog. The girl was taken into police custody after the woman contacted authorities. She was reunited with her family on Friday following interviews with investigators.\n\nInvestigators identified the suspect as Jake Thomas Patterson, a 21-year-old man, and announced kidnapping and murder charges on Friday. Police stated that Patterson had planned his actions and took steps to avoid detection.\n\nPatterson was apprehended near the house from which Jayme escaped, and his arrest was facilitated by a description of his vehicle provided by Jayme. Authorities believe Patterson was searching for the girl when he was taken into custody.\n\nBarron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald stated that investigators were still working to understand Jayme's experiences and the reasons for Patterson's apparent determination to abduct her. \"The will of a kid to survive \u2013 it's unthinkable,\" said Fitzgerald, who expressed emotion after 88 days of searching for the teenager.\n\nInvestigators found no evidence of a relationship between Patterson and Jayme's family, nor any social media contact between them. Patterson had a connection to Jayme's hometown, Barron, but the details of this connection were not disclosed. Patterson had altered his appearance before the October attack and abduction, shaving his head to avoid leaving hair behind.\n\nInvestigators questioned Patterson, who is unemployed and has no local or Wisconsin criminal history, on Friday morning. The house where Jayme had most recently been held was searched.\n\nIt remains unclear if Jayme had been in the same house for the entire three months of her disappearance or if she was abused by her captor during that time. The local district attorney's office plans to issue a criminal complaint next week.\n\nJayme's aunt, Sue Allard, expressed her joy upon learning of the news on Thursday night. \"Praise the Lord,\" Allard said, between sobs. \"It's the news we've been waiting on for three months. I can't wait to get my arms around her. I just can't wait.\"\n\nPolice confirmed that no additional suspects were being sought, and no one else was found in the residence from which Jayme escaped. \"It is an incredible day,\" said Justin Tolomeo, FBI special agent in charge of Milwaukee.\n\nPatterson is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Monday.",
    " Title: U.S. Withdraws from Arms Trade Treaty, Citing Sovereignty and Domestic Gun Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Friday that the United States would withdraw as a signatory to the Arms Trade Treaty, a global agreement aimed at regulating the international sale of conventional weapons. The treaty, which was approved by the United Nations General Assembly in 2013 but never ratified by the U.S. Congress, has been a point of contention between gun rights advocates and supporters of stricter arms regulations.\n\nIn a speech before the National Rifle Association (NRA) in Indianapolis, Trump stated, \"We will never surrender American sovereignty to anyone.\" The NRA, a key backer of Trump's 2016 campaign, was a leading opponent of the treaty, arguing it could impinge on the rights of American gun owners.\n\nThe Arms Trade Treaty has been ratified by 101 countries, including member states of the European Union, but not by the United States. The treaty seeks to regulate the international sale of conventional weapons, with the goal of ensuring that weapons are not sold to countries involved in civil conflict or to regimes that the U.S. does not support.\n\nThomas Countryman, a former assistant secretary of state who was the lead U.S. negotiator for the treaty, stated that the treaty has no impact on Second Amendment rights of U.S. citizens. He also noted that the U.S. has for decades had strict arms-export laws in place.\n\nRachel Stohl, managing director of the conventional defense program at the Stimson Center, a Washington think tank, criticized the decision as a \"retreat from global leadership\" that would \"undermine international peace and security, increase irresponsible and illegal sales of conventional weapons, and harm the American economy.\"\n\nThe decision to withdraw from the Arms Trade Treaty follows Trump's announcement in February that the U.S. would withdraw from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which Washington alleged Moscow has violated by deploying multiple battalions of a prohibited cruise missile.\n\nDuring his third visit as president to an NRA annual convention, Trump pledged his support for gun rights, touted the strength of the U.S. economy, and criticized the recently completed Mueller investigation. Trump also warned the crowd that \"far-left radicals in Congress\" want to take their guns, stating, \"that will never happen as long as I'm president, not even close.\"\n\nThe president received a rousing reception from NRA members, despite criticism from some hard-line gun-rights advocates of his record on guns. The only major action Trump had taken on guns since being elected was to ban bump stocks, devices used in the September 2017 Las Vegas massacre that make semiautomatic rifles fire like machine guns. Meanwhile, Trump has not signed into law any major pro-gun legislation.",
    " Title: Death Threats and Racial Slurs Target Senator Tim Scott, While Pelosi's Controversial Remark Goes Unreported by Major Broadcasters\n\nArticle:\n\nA New York Times report published on Tuesday detailed recent death threats and racial slurs directed at Republican Senator Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate. The major broadcast networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC, did not report on this incident, instead choosing to focus on other topics.\n\nAccording to the New York Times article, written by Catie Edmondson, Senator Scott shared two audio recordings of the threatening and racist calls with the newspaper. The calls contained profanity, racial slurs, and one caller threatened to put Senator Scott \"in his crosshairs.\"\n\nSenator Scott attributed the media's portrayal of his police reform legislation as the reason for the negative characterization of him and his colleagues. In his interview with The Times, he stated, \"It's interesting that we are on the right side of the police reform conversation, yet we're on the wrong side according to the people, based on the way that we are characterized in the national press.\"\n\nIn a separate incident, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) generated outrage with her comments on CBS News Radio, where she stated, \"But so far, they were trying to get away with murder, actually, the murder of George Floyd.\" The Republican Party was not involved in the killing of George Floyd.\n\nPelosi's comment was made in response to a question about the possibility of compromise on police reform, and there was no fact-check about her statement in the broadcast networks' coverage.\n\nThe major broadcast networks also did not report on the official rollout of Scott's Justice Act, as previously noted by \u2588\u2588\u2588. Additionally, they did not cover the outrage generated by Pelosi's controversial comment made to their own West Coast correspondent, Steve Futterman.",
    " Title: Living Room Conversation: A Bipartisan Dialogue on Immigration\n\nArticle:\n\nRremida Shkoza, an Albanian-born US citizen and real estate broker, participated in a Living Room Conversation, a bipartisan forum for peaceful dialogue on immigration. The event, which took place in New York, brought together three Democrats and three Republicans, with the focus on immigration.\n\nShkoza, a refugee who fled communist Albania in 1991, initially questioned the participation of a Republican immigrant in the conversation. However, she was pleasantly surprised to find common ground with Sue Googe, a Republican co-host and fellow real estate professional, as well as other participants.\n\nDuring the conversation, each participant shared their personal experiences with immigration. Shkoza emphasized her refugee status and the xenophobia she faced as a child in Italy. The other participants, including Julia Song, a Brazilian immigrant and Republican, and Mario Benavente, an active local conservative politician, shared their experiences with immigration in the United States.\n\nThe participants agreed on the need for comprehensive immigration reform and the importance of treating migrants and refugees humanely. They acknowledged the need to balance democratic values with the need to help others, and the need to address issues such as racism, xenophobia, and homelessness in the United States.\n\nPolicy differences emerged, with some participants discussing the impact of Trump's tax cuts and immigration policies on the economy and average Americans. Shkoza and other participants suggested that investing more in working-class Americans might improve the economy and reduce xenophobia.\n\nDespite these policy differences, the conversation ended on a hopeful note, with participants finding common ground on the importance of humanizing immigrants and assisting them to the extent possible. Shkoza left the conversation with a newfound appreciation for the open-mindedness of Republicans and a renewed hope for the future of the United States.",
    " Title: Federal Law Enforcement Officers in Portland Detain Protesters in Unmarked Vehicles\n\nArticle:\n\nFederal law enforcement officers in Portland, Oregon, have been using unmarked vehicles to detain protesters since at least July 14, according to reports from Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB). Personal accounts and multiple videos posted online show the officers driving up to people, detaining individuals with no explanation of why they are being arrested, and driving off.\n\nThe tactic appears to be another escalation in federal force deployed on Portland city streets, as federal officials and President Donald Trump have said they plan to \"quell\" nightly protests outside the federal courthouse and Multnomah County Justice Center that have lasted for more than six weeks.\n\nFederal officers have charged at least 13 people with crimes related to the protests so far, while others have been arrested and released, including Donavan L. Pettibone and Mark P. O'Shea. They also left one demonstrator hospitalized with skull fractures after shooting him in the face with so-called \"less lethal\" munitions on July 11.\n\nOfficers from the U.S. Marshals Special Operations Group and Customs and Border Protection's BORTAC have been sent to Portland to protect federal property during the recent protests against racism and police brutality. However, interviews conducted by OPB show officers are also detaining people on Portland streets who aren't near federal property, nor is it clear that all of the people being arrested have engaged in criminal activity.\n\nDemonstrators like O'Shea and Pettibone said they think they were targeted by federal officers for simply wearing black clothing in the area of the demonstration. Pettibone did not escape the federal officers. \"I am basically tossed into the van,\" Pettibone said. \"And I had my beanie pulled over my face so I couldn't see and they held my hands over my head.\"\n\nPettibone and O'Shea both said they couldn't think of anything they might have done to end up targeted by law enforcement. They attend protests regularly but they said they aren't \"instigators.\" They don't spray paint buildings, shine laser pointers at officers or do anything else other than attend protests, which law enforcement have regularly deemed \"unlawful assemblies.\"\n\nMayor Ted Wheeler and other local officials have said they didn't ask for help from federal law enforcement and have asked them to leave. \"A number of people have asked if I know DHS leadership is in town, and if I'm going to meet with them. We're aware that they're here. We wish they weren't,\" Wheeler tweeted Thursday. Democratic Gov. Kate Brown called Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf's visit \"political theater from President Trump\" and said he \"is looking for a confrontation in Oregon in the hopes of winning political points in Ohio or Iowa.\"\n\nSince when does a Cabinet official, representing the president, come to a city and not even try to meet the mayor? Since 2017, of course. Brown is right. This is dumbshow for dummies. But it's also a terrible look into that of which this administration is capable, and for which this administration seems to be softening the ground.\n\nWolf is certainly on board. He put out a release that reads like Eisenhower's exhortation before the ships left for Normandy. \"This siege can end if state and local officials decide to take appropriate action instead of refusing to enforce the law. DHS will not abdicate its solemn duty to protect federal facilities and those within them. Again, I reiterate the Department's offer to assist local and state leaders to bring an end to the violence perpetuated by anarchists,\" said Acting Secretary Chad Wolf.\n\nTwo more dirty words on the side of a building, and Wolf might be calling in air strikes. Also on Thursday, press secretary Kaleigh McEnany took a moment out of her briefing to call Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot a \"renegade mayor\" because Lightfoot refuses to ask for the National Guard to come into her city. (To her credit, Lightfoot snapped right back.) The White House is on record several times as trying to delegitimize Muriel Bowser as mayor of Washington, D.C.\n\nPortland may be a dumbshow for dummies, but it also looks like a dress rehearsal. This is not an \"authoritarian impulse.\" This is authoritarian government\u2014straight, no chaser. And this administration has a powerful thirst for it. It will do anything if it thinks it can get away with it in order to benefit a president who wants to bring the Republic down on his head.\n\nWe need a Truth and Reconciliation Commission now, before the dress rehearsal becomes a road show.",
    " Title: Romney Labels Individual Mandate in Health Care Law as a Tax\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with CBS News on Wednesday, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney declared that the individual mandate in President Barack Obama's health care law is a tax. This statement comes just days after Romney's campaign had previously rejected this characterization.\n\nDuring the interview, Romney stated, \"While I agreed with the dissent, that's taken over by the fact that the majority of the court said it's a tax, and therefore it is a tax. They have spoken.\"\n\nHe further added, \"They concluded it was a tax. That's what it is, and the American people know that President Obama has broken the pledge he made. He said he wouldn't raise taxes on middle-income Americans. Not only did he raise the $500 billion that was already in the bill, it's now clear that his mandate, as described by the Supreme Court, is a tax.\"\n\nOn Monday, Romney's presidential campaign stated that the health care mandate should be considered a penalty and not a tax. This statement by Eric Fehrnstrom, the campaign's spokesman, contradicted the general stance of leading Republicans in Congress and elsewhere, who have been accusing the president of imposing a new tax.\n\n\"The governor disagreed with the ruling of the court,\" Mr. Fehrnstrom said Monday on MSNBC's \"The Daily Rundown.\" \"He agreed with the dissent written by Justice Scalia, which very clearly stated that the mandate was not a tax.\"\n\nThe characterization of the mandate is a sensitive issue for the Romney campaign, given Romney's past support for universal health care in Massachusetts when he was governor there. While Romney has pledged to repeal what conservatives call Obamacare, he had previously avoided labeling the mandate as a tax, possibly because his Massachusetts plan included a similar mandate.\n\nRomney made his comments while vacationing in New Hampshire.",
    " Title: Unforced Errors in Politics: Clinton's Email Controversy and the GOP's Iran Letter\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the world of sports, an unforced error refers to a mistake made by a player that doesn't involve the opposition. In politics, this concept also applies, with unforced errors potentially having more significant consequences than a simple misplay in a game. Recently, two major unforced errors have been committed by both sides of the political spectrum, demonstrating a lack of strategy and, at its core, poor decision-making.\n\nHillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, encountered a setback due to her use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. While the former First Lady may have rationalized her decision given the Whitewater investigation that led to her husband's impeachment proceedings, the questionable nature of this choice remains. For someone who served in high office, it is questionable why one would not have an official government account to transact business while having a separate email account for personal business.\n\nIn a similar vein, the open letter signed by 47 Republican Senators to the Iranian leadership can be seen as another unforced error. While the letter was intended as a lesson in constitutional government, the tone and approach it took were perceived as arrogant and an attempt to sabotage any deal reached between the U.S. and Iran. The letter made its signatories, particularly its author, U.S. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, appear as spiteful meddlers in foreign policy.\n\nWhile senators have the constitutional (and thus, legal) power to approve a treaty and can outlast an occupant of the White House due to their six-year terms, their own majority may be short-lived, with another third of the Senate seats coming up for election in just a year and a half, and GOP senators having to defend more than their fair share.\n\nBlind arrogance of power, whether in terms of email management and deciding what to release or openly flaunting senatorial power and prestige to a foreign nation, often backfires on those wielding the power. In this age of political polarization, should we really be surprised by these, and future, unforced errors? Not really, because these errors are due to the partisan nature of the players, and it is the game of politics that ultimately suffers.",
    " Title: DOJ Establishes Task Force to Combat Violent Anti-Government Extremism\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General William Barr has announced the formation of a task force aimed at curbing \"violent anti-government extremists of all persuasions.\" The announcement was made in a June 26 memo to all heads of department components and U.S. attorneys, shared publicly by Department of Justice (DOJ) spokesperson Kerri Kupec.\n\nIn the memo, Barr wrote that the aim of the task force is to lead DOJ efforts to investigate and prosecute those who commit violent acts, prevent extremist violence before it happens, and \"ultimately eliminate it as a threat to public safety and the rule of law.\"\n\nProtests in the wake of the police-custody death of George Floyd, who died on May 25 after a Minneapolis officer restrained him by kneeling on his neck, have largely been peaceful. However, at times, the protests have descended into scenes of looting, arson, and violence.\n\nBarr noted attacks on police officers and other government officials, destruction of public and private property, and threats to innocent bystanders. Clashes with protesters in Seattle several weeks ago led police to abandon a precinct and prompted the establishment of a so-called \"autonomous zone.\" While largely peaceful, the zone has also been the site of acts of violence, including a recent shooting.\n\nNearby property owners and businesses on June 24 filed a federal lawsuit against the city of Seattle for its tolerance of the zone, saying officials had been complicit in depriving them of their rights to their property.\n\nBarr said extremist groups targeted by the new initiative seek to deny constitutional rights to others and resort to methods that are illegal. \"Although these extremists profess a variety of ideologies, they are united in their opposition to the core constitutional values of a democratic society governed by law,\" Barr wrote in the memo, adding that the DOJ has obtained information suggesting that some extremists intend to sow more chaos.\n\n\"We have evidence that anti-government violent extremists\u2014including those who support the \u2018 Boogaloo,\u2019 those who self-identify as Antifa, and others\u2014will pose continuing threats of lawlessness,\" Barr wrote, adding that some of those who in recent weeks have undercut public order and tried to \"become a law unto themselves\" through violent acts may be supported by \"foreign entities seeking to sow chaos and disorder.\"\n\nThe task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement in an effort to arrest perpetrators of violence. It will also work closely with the FBI to \"develop detailed information about violent anti-government extremist individuals, networks, and movements\u2014and will share that information as appropriate with federal, state, and local law enforcement, especially in places where these extremists pose a threat.\"\n\nBarr's announcement came on the same day President Donald Trump signed an executive order protecting American monuments, memorials, and statues from being destroyed. \"I just had the privilege of signing a very strong Executive Order protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues\u2014and combatting recent Criminal Violence,\" Trump wrote in a tweet. \"Long prison terms for these lawless acts against our Great Country!\"",
    " Title: Former Texas Governor Rick Perry Suspends 2016 GOP Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Texas Governor Rick Perry has announced the suspension of his campaign to secure the 2016 Republican presidential nomination during a speech at the Eagle Forum in St. Louis on Friday afternoon. Perry, who served as governor for 14 years, faced difficulties in fundraising and gaining traction in a crowded and experienced field.\n\nIn his speech, Perry attributed his decision to God's guidance, stating, \"That is why today I am suspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States.\" He acknowledged the strength of the current Republican candidates, expressing confidence in the party's future as long as it remains connected to the grassroots and the cause of conservatism.\n\nSuspending a campaign, in most cases, is equivalent to dropping out of the race. Candidates typically cite technical fundraising issues as the reason for such a move. Perry's decision comes less than a week before the second debate of the primary season.\n\nThis marks Perry's second failed presidential campaign, following his 2012 bid, which was labeled one of the biggest campaign failures in modern political history. In his 2012 campaign, Perry managed to raise funds but failed to convert that into votes, ultimately withdrawing just before the South Carolina primary. This time around, Perry faced a crowded field of current and former governors with extensive experience and fundraising abilities, and he never found a niche. Reports emerged last week that he had stopped paying staffers, and some of his team had left to join other political campaigns.\n\nMichael Dennehy, a Perry supporter and strategist in New Hampshire, expressed regret over Perry's decision, stating, \"It's a shame that a man with the most successful executive experience and the one who can best relate to middle-class America will not be on the ballot as we choose the Republican nominee.\"\n\nPerry was relegated to the second tier in last month's first presidential debate in Ohio, and he was expected to remain in the second tier for the upcoming debate at the Reagan Presidential Library. Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, noted that Perry struggled to rebound after being excluded from the opening prime-time debate.\n\nPerry remains under indictment in Texas on corruption charges, with prosecutors alleging that he attempted to use the state budget to force a local prosecutor out of office. His departure leaves four candidates in the second-tier race: Former Sen. Rick Santorum, former New York Gov. George Pataki, Sen. Lindsey Graham, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. The main stage features 11 candidates: Businessman Donald Trump, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey, John Kasich of Ohio, and Scott Walker of Wisconsin, former Govs. Jeb Bush of Florida and Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, and Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio.\n\nIn his prepared remarks, Perry expressed optimism about the future, stating, \"As I approach the next chapter in life, I do so with the love of my life by my side, Anita Perry. We have our house in the country, we have two beautiful children and two adorable grandchildren, four dogs, and the best sunset from our front porch that you could ever imagine.\"",

In the statement, ZOA President Morton A. Klein criticized ADL President Jonathan Greenblatt for engaging in \"character assassination\" against Bannon and Breitbart Media, the media company Bannon presided over.\n\nAccording to the ZOA, Bannon and Breitbart have been fair-minded towards Israel and the Jewish people, and the allegations of anti-Semitism are \"Orwellian.\" The ZOA's statement cites several examples of Bannon and Breitbart's efforts to combat anti-Semitism, including their work to address anti-Semitic rallies at CUNY, their reporting on the Palestinian Authority's defamation of Israel, and their coverage of anti-Semitic incidents on college campuses.\n\nThe ZOA also criticized ADL for not speaking out against anti-Israel advisors in Hillary Clinton's campaign, specifically George Soros, who is known for his criticism of Israel. The ZOA concluded by expressing support for Bannon's appointment and urging ADL to withdraw and apologize for their allegations against Bannon and Breitbart Media.\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump's pro-Israel advisors, including Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani, Mike Pence, Mike Huckabee, Sheldon Adelson, Jared Kushner, David Friedman, and Jason Greenblatt, would allow an anti-Semite to work with them or whether Trump's Orthodox Jewish daughter Ivanka, whose children attend an Orthodox day school, would allow an anti-Semite to work with her father. The statement also questions why ADL and other Bannon critics did not speak out against anti-Israel advisors in Hillary Clinton's campaign.",
    " Title: Attorney General Directs Prosecutors to Pursue Most Serious Charges, Reversing Obama-Era Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions has directed federal prosecutors to pursue the most serious charges possible against the vast majority of suspects, marking a significant reversal of Obama-era policies that is expected to result in more people being sent to prison for longer terms.\n\nIn a memo sent Thursday night to U.S. attorneys and made public early on Friday, Sessions wrote, \"This policy affirms our responsibility to enforce the law, is moral and just, and produces consistency.\"\n\nThe move represents a clear undoing of Obama administration criminal justice policies that aimed to ease overcrowding in federal prisons and contributed to a national rethinking of how drug criminals were prosecuted and sentenced. Critics argue that the change will subject more lower-level offenders to unfairly harsh mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nSessions contends a spike in violence in some big cities and the nation's opioid epidemic show the need for a return to tougher tactics. In remarks prepared for a Thursday speech in Charleston, West Virginia, Sessions stated, \"Drug trafficking is an inherently violent business... If you want to collect a drug debt, you can\u2019t, and don\u2019t, file a lawsuit in court. You collect it by the barrel of a gun.\"\n\nThe policy memo instructs prosecutors to \"charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense\" - a move more likely to trigger mandatory minimum sentences. The memo concedes there will be cases in which \"good judgment\" will warrant a prosecutor to veer from that rule, but any exceptions will need to be approved by top supervisors, and the reasons must be documented.\n\nThe directive rescinds guidance by Sessions' Democratic predecessor, Eric Holder, who told prosecutors they could in some cases leave drug quantities out of charging documents to avoid triggering long sentences. Holder's 2013 initiative, known as Smart on Crime, was aimed at encouraging shorter sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and preserving justice department resources for more serious and violent criminals.\n\nThe Obama policy shift coincided with U.S. Sentencing Commission changes that made tens of thousands of federal drug prisoners eligible for early release, and an Obama administration clemency initiative that freed convicts deemed deserving of a second chance. Combined, these changes led to a steep decline in a federal prison population that now stands at just under 190,000, down from nearly 220,000 in 2013. Nearly half of those inmates are in custody for drug crimes, records show.\n\nObama administration officials cited that decline and a drop in the overall number of drug prosecutions as evidence that policies were working as intended. They argued prosecutors were getting pickier about the cases they were bringing and were seeking mandatory minimum sentences less often.\n\nHowever, some prosecutors felt constrained by the Holder directive and expressed concern that they'd lose plea bargaining leverage \u2013 and a key inducement for cooperation \u2013 without the ability to more freely pursue harsher punishments. Sessions and other justice department officials argue Holder's approach sidestepped federal laws that impose such sentences and created inconsistency across the country in the way defendants are punished. Even while in the Senate, Sessions repeatedly asserted that eliminating mandatory minimums weakened the ability of law enforcement to protect the public.\n\nAdvocates for the previous policy argue the change will revive the worst aspects of the drug war. \"It looks like we're going to fill the prisons back up after finally getting the federal prison population down,\" said Kevin Ring, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums. \"But the social and human costs will be much higher.\"",

At least one uniformed guard was injured and transported in an ambulance.\n\nAccording to BBC News, helicopter footage showed two cars, one a police vehicle and the other a black vehicle with no insignia, in a junction near the security gates. The cars appear to have collided, and debris is scattered across the intersection. A white cloth is visible beside the black vehicle.\n\nLocal emergency responders are handling the incident, with local agencies providing support, according to the BBC. The NSA has not provided an official comment.\n\nThe UK Mirror reports two people were injured during the incident, one of whom was the uniformed man described being placed in an ambulance by the BBC. Ynet News reports the man who tried to ram the gates was shot dead by security forces. CBS News confirms one fatality occurred during the incident, along with two injuries.\n\nCBS News reports that two women were in the vehicle attempting to ram the NSA gates, and that at least one woman is dead, with the other taken to Shock Trauma for treatment. The CBS report also claims authorities found \"cocaine and a weapon\" in the car involved in the incident, and that there is currently no armed shooter at large.\n\nThe gender of the individuals attacking the NSA headquarters is disputed in various reports. NBC News claims the two people in the car were \"men disguised as women,\" not women. The NBC report notes that drugs were found in the vehicle, coinciding with CBS. CNN is also reporting that the attackers were two men.\n\nFurther updates note the car was stolen, and there is not yet any indication of an organized terrorist attempt, but rather, one anonymous official described the attack as a \"local criminal matter\" to NBC.\n\nThis is not the first recent report of trouble at NSA headquarters. Earlier this month, the FBI arrested a man for firing shots at the building, as part of a shooting spree that lasted several weeks, including shots fired at a service truck, which injured one of the passengers with shattered glass.\n\nUpdate 12:30PM EST: ABC News reports that one of the perpetrators was shot dead on the scene, while the other is \"severely injured\" and probably will not survive. The injuries of the security officer are said to be \"non-life-threatening.\" Some reports have suggested the officer was struck by one of the vehicles involved in the crash \u2013 two damaged SUVs can be seen in helicopter footage \u2013 rather than being hit by gunfire.\n\nCBS News in Baltimore reports the FBI will take over investigation of the incident from the NSA's security force.

Somers had been held by al-Qaeda militants since his abduction in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in September 2013.\n\nHagel, speaking from Kabul where he made a surprise visit Saturday, confirmed the British-born hostage's death following an unsuccessful raid by U.S. and Yemeni special forces to free him.\n\nIn a statement, Hagel described Somers' death as murder at the hands of terrorists, stating there were \"compelling reasons to believe Mr. Somers' life was in imminent danger.\"\n\nLucy Somers, Somers' sister, learned of her brother's death from the FBI. \"We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,\" she told the Associated Press.\n\nA second hostage, South African Pierre Korkie, a teacher abducted in Yemen in May 2013 with his wife, was also killed in the failed raid. Yolande Korkie had previously been released by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula militants.\n\nDuring the rescue operation, helicopters swept in and dropped U.S. commandos about a mile from the village where Somers was being held, according to a senior Defense Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. U.S. warplanes flew overhead for protection but did not fire weapons. The commandos, from teams based in the Middle East, killed all of the al-Qaeda-linked terrorists. No U.S. forces were wounded, the official said.\n\nPresident Obama authorized the rescue attempt due to information the U.S. had that Somers' life was in immediate danger, including a video released by his terrorist captors this week that announced the journalist would be killed within 72 hours.\n\nU.S. officials believe the militants shot the two men during a firefight, and that both were alive when American forces pulled them from a building on the group's compound and got them aboard aircraft, where medical teams operated on them during a short flight to the USS Makin Island, a Navy ship in the region. Korkie is believed to have died during the flight, while American Somers died on the ship, according to senior U.S. officials who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the information had yet to be approved for release.\n\nThose who knew Somers, who was born in Britain but spent much of his life in America, remembered the photographer as a person drawn to new experiences. \"He really wanted to understand the world,\" said Shawn Gillen, an English professor and chairman of Beloit College's journalism program. Somers earned a bachelor's degree in creative writing while attending Beloit College in Wisconsin from 2004 to 2007. \"He'd want to be in places where world events were happening.\"\n\nAt a news conference in Bahrain on Saturday, Yemen's national security chief, Maj. Gen. Ali al-Ahmadi, said the militants had planned to kill Somers on Saturday. \"Al-Qaeda promised to conduct the execution (of Somers) today so there was an attempt to save them, but unfortunately, they shot the hostage before or during the attack,\" al-Ahmadi said.\n\nAt the same time, Pierre Korkie was set to be released Sunday, according to Gift of Givers, the aid group that negotiated his wife's freedom. \"The psychological and emotional devastation to Yolande and her family will be compounded by the knowledge that Pierre was to be released by al-Qaeda,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nIn a YouTube video released Wednesday, Somers, 33, said his \"life is in danger.\" The video featured an al-Qaeda official and a brief message from Somers\u2014dressed in a purple shirt and with a shaved head\u2014at the end. Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said Thursday a U.S. raid last month attempted to free Somers, but he turned out not to be at the site. Before her brother's death, Lucy Somers released an online video describing him as a romantic who \"always believes the best in people.\" She ended with the plea: \"Please let him live.\"",
    " Title: Nine Members of Mormon Community Killed in Drug Cartel Attack in Mexico\n\nArticle:\n\nNine individuals, including three women and six children, were killed in a violent attack in northern Mexico on Monday. The victims were members of a Mormon community of dual U.S.-Mexican citizens. The attack occurred on a highway in the border state of Sonora, an area known for its contention among organized crime groups.\n\nAccording to Mexico's minister for public security, the incident transpired in broad daylight. The attack began when one vehicle stopped due to a flat tire, and assailants attacked the stranded car, killing the driver and four children, including 6-month-old twins. The attackers then set the car on fire.\n\nTwo other cars were attacked nearby, resulting in the deaths of two women and two children. A family member described a chaotic scene where a child was shot while attempting to flee. It is believed that at least eight survivors remain, including as many as seven children who reportedly managed to escape. Some of the surviving children sustained serious injuries, including a 9-month-old who was shot in the chest and a 4-year-old who was shot in the back. A 13-year-old reportedly walked 14 miles to the family's home to seek help after hiding his wounded siblings in the brush.\n\nThe Mormon community targeted in the attack is a farming community that moved south of the border nearly a century ago to practice polygamy after a dispute with the church over the practice. The U.S. President, Donald J. Trump, tweeted about the incident, expressing his condolences and offering potential U.S. involvement in addressing the issue. However, the specifics of any potential U.S. intervention have not been detailed.",
    " Title: World Mourns and Celebrates the Life of Evangelist Billy Graham\n\nArticle:\n\nThe world is remembering and mourning the passing of evangelist Billy Graham, who dedicated his life to spreading the gospel of Christ through various communication technologies, a renowned evangelistic organization, and an eloquence that moved many to accept Jesus.\n\nDana Robert, a Boston University religion professor, praised Graham's evangelical zeal, comparing it to that of the Apostle Paul 1,800 years earlier. She attended one of Graham's crusades in her native Baton Rouge in 1970 and described him as a man who lived a good life and could say, as Paul did in his letter to Timothy, \"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.\"\n\nLarry Ross, Graham's longtime spokesman, said the evangelist showed courage and faith throughout his long physical decline. \"He was faithful to the end,\" he said. \"He showed how to finish well.\"\n\nNews of Graham's death spread globally, from missionaries' huts in Africa to back-country Bible Belt churches to mighty Southern Baptist temples. His life was recalled by Protestants, Catholics, Muslims, and Jews; by those who attended one of his crusades, or dozens; by those who only saw him on TV or heard him on the radio; by those who knew him mostly as a pastor to presidents.\n\nRandall Balmer, a Dartmouth College expert on evangelical Christianity, described Graham as \"the most prominent religious celebrity of the 20th Century,\" a period that included popes John XXIII and John Paul II, the 14th Dalai Lama, Mother Teresa, and Norman Vincent Peale. Balmer estimated that, even if the audiences for his many broadcasts are not counted, Graham preached to more people in person than anyone in history.\n\nThose with the strongest impressions of Graham saw him at his final big public events. Craig Allen, 74, of Finksburg, MD, heard Graham's last major sermon, delivered in Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore in July 2006. Michael Freeland, 59, of Metairie, LA, who lost most of his real estate business after Hurricane Katrina the previous year, attended with his wife and two sons. He said Graham's presence after the storm, especially after announcing his retirement the previous year, \"meant a lot to us.\" He was old, he'd lost his wife. You could see his frailty. But once he started to preach, you could feel an energy. That was the Holy Spirit. That was him doing something he was passionate about.\"\n\nMaggie Rousseau and her husband, Bill, drove 14 hours from Savannah, GA, to see Graham for the first time in New York City in June 2005. Given the evangelist's health, they knew it would be the last. \"There was just something about him,\" Maggie said. \"I don't know what it was, but you believed him. On the crusades, on TV, he spoke, and you listened.\"\n\nHowever, some argued that Graham's impact has already diminished. Balmer reported that, several years ago, when he asked one of his classes at Dartmouth if they knew who Billy Graham was, only 25% raised a hand. Robert described him as essentially a phenomenon of the Greatest and Boomer generations. \"When I was young, the whole family watched him on television, like Walter Cronkite. When he came to town, everyone went to the crusade,\" she recalled. \"But I don't think the Millennials even know who he was.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Faces Tough Decisions as Covid-19 Death Toll Rises and Economy Suffers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has reported 2,231 Covid-19 deaths on May 7, bringing the total number of deaths in the country to 75,662, and over 270,000 worldwide. The economic impact has been significant, with the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expected to see its first drop in six years in the second quarter of 2020, according to the U.S. Congressional Budget Office. Since March, 33.5 million people have filed for unemployment, and businesses large and small are closing, leading to the loss of millions of jobs.\n\nThe debate over reopening the economy versus maintaining strict social distancing measures to control the spread of Covid-19 has become a contentious issue. President Trump has advocated for reopening the country, stating, \"We can't keep our country closed. We have to open our country.\" However, the choice may not be as stark as it seems.\n\nThe objective of social distancing is to \"flatten the curve,\" slowing the spread of the virus to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed and to allow for public health measures like widespread testing and contact tracing. If these measures had been implemented effectively, the lockdown could have been less stringent, and the economic costs could have been reduced.\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo made a poignant point during a briefing, asking, \"How much is a human life worth?\" He stated, \"To me, I say the cost of a human life, a human life is priceless. Period.\"\n\nThe federal government has largely abandoned its own standards for when states should lift their shelter-in-place orders. A researcher at the respected Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security told Congress last week that no state looked epidemiologically ready to return to normal.\n\nDespite this, 31 states have decided to ease restrictions, with Texas allowing restaurants, movie theaters, and barber shops to reopen at 25% capacity, while acknowledging that Covid-19 cases will likely increase as a result. Georgia has lifted its stay-at-home order and reopened businesses like tattoo parlors and bowling alleys, while California, which initially took early action, is opening some southern beaches.\n\nThe information available about the virus, its impact on the national economy, and what people will contribute to the economy even if states end official restrictions is incomplete and sometimes contradictory. Given this uncertainty, it remains to be seen who will choose to travel or visit crowded places in the near future.\n\nThe question of the value of a human life is a complex one, and it is a question that society has historically been willing to incur costs to save lives and improve public welfare. However, the trade-offs clearly have limits, and the decision to prioritize the economy over public health during a pandemic is a difficult one that requires careful consideration and balanced decision-making.",
    " Title: Trump Suggests Softening Stance on Illegal Immigration, Emphasizes Deportation of Criminals and Reform of Sanctuary Cities\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump reiterated his stance on illegal immigration during a town hall with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Wednesday, stating that there would be \"no amnesty\" for undocumented immigrants but suggesting a willingness to \"work with them.\" This is the latest in a series of recent interviews where Trump has indicated a potential softening of his previous pledge to deport 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S.\n\nDuring the town hall on Tuesday, Trump expressed openness to \"softening\" laws dealing with illegal immigrants. On Wednesday, Trump clarified that there would be \"no citizenship\" for those who are in the country illegally. He proposed that these individuals would pay back taxes and work towards legal status, but not receive amnesty in the traditional sense.\n\nTrump also addressed the challenges of deporting long-term residents who have built families in the U.S. He emphasized the need to focus on deporting criminals while acknowledging the emotional impact of separating families who have lived in the country for decades.\n\nIn addition, Trump criticized sanctuary cities for protecting criminals, claiming that police are increasingly frustrated due to the inability to enforce immigration laws in these jurisdictions. He called for the elimination of sanctuary cities, arguing that they protect criminals and hinder law enforcement efforts.\n\nTrump is expected to announce a decision on his stance regarding illegal immigration \"very soon.\" According to the Associated Press, he will unveil his new immigration policy during a speech in Phoenix next week at the Hyatt Regency. The speech is expected to cover policy matters, as confirmed by Arizona Republican Party Chairman Robert Graham and two unnamed officials with knowledge of Trump's campaign plans.",
    " Title: Pennsylvania, Idaho, Nebraska, and Oregon Hold Primary Elections on Tuesday\n\nArticle:\n\nTuesday will see primary elections in several states, including Pennsylvania, Idaho, Nebraska, and Oregon. The elections will help settle the chaotic congressional landscape in Pennsylvania, which has undergone redrawn districts following a court fight just three months ago.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, primary voters will decide the fate of President Donald Trump's pick for U.S. Senate, as well as the nominees for 18 House districts due to the new court-ordered redrawn congressional district maps. This is the highest number of candidates running in Pennsylvania's House districts since 1984, when the state had 23 seats in the House.\n\nFive of Pennsylvania's 13 GOP House members have quit or are not running again, creating seven House vacancies, the most in Pennsylvania since 1976. The 7th District, abandoned by moderate Charlie Dent, is one of these vacancies. Hillary Clinton received more votes than Trump in this district, which was reunified with Democratic-leaning cities in the east and cut out some of Republican-leaning central Pennsylvania. Six Democrats are running in this district.\n\nTen Democrats are running in suburban Philadelphia's 5th District, where Rep. Patrick Meehan resigned last month amid sexual harassment allegations and where Clinton also beat Trump.\n\nIn the Pennsylvania Republican Senate primary, Rep. Lou Barletta is heavily favored to become the Republican challenger for Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, who is seeking a third term in November. Barletta was a Trump supporter before the 2016 presidential nomination and has Trump's early support in the Senate race.\n\nLast week, Trump urged GOP Senate primary voters to support Rep. Jim Renacci in the Ohio Senate primary and oppose former coal company executive Don Blankenship in West Virginia. Renacci won, and Blankenship lost. Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia are all seen as key to the 2018 Senate election landscape as states where Trump won in 2016 and Democratic senators are seeking re-election this year.\n\nIn Nebraska, Tuesday's Democratic primary in the 2nd Congressional District, dominated by Omaha and its suburbs, features moderate former Rep. Brad Ashford fighting for his old seat and Kara Eastman, a children's nonprofit administrator, running to Ashford's left. Ashford, a former Republican, served one term in Congress as a Democrat before losing to Republican Don Bacon in 2016.\n\nIn Idaho, the primary goes a long way to determining the general election, as Republican Gov. C.L. \"Butch\" Otter is not seeking re-election after three terms. Lt. Gov. Brad Little is seeking the GOP nomination, with Otter's endorsement, while Tommy Ahlquist, an emergency room doctor turned developer, hopes his outsider status carries him as it did Indiana businessman Mike Braun in last week's GOP Senate primary.\n\nIn Oregon, ten Republicans are vying for the nomination for governor\u2014the most in more than a century. The interest among candidates belies the uphill climb for the party in the Democratic-leaning state. Businessman Sam Carpenter, state Rep. Knute Buehler, and retired Navy pilot Greg Wooldridge have emerged as leaders in fundraising and GOP straw polls. However, Democratic Gov. Kate Brown remains the favorite to win in November. Brown became governor in 2015 upon the resignation of Gov. John Kitzhaber following an ethics scandal, and she won a special election in 2016.\n\nOregon is among eight states where Democrats control the governorship and both houses of the state legislature. Voters who identify as Democrats also outnumber their Republican counterparts by more than 9 percentage points.",
    " Title: U.S. Job Growth Slows in August, Missing Wall Street Projections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. economy added 130,000 jobs in August, falling short of Wall Street's expectations, as trade uncertainty and slowing global growth cast a shadow over the economic outlook. The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.7%, near a 50-year low, while the labor force participation rate was little changed at 63.2%. Average hourly earnings rose 3.2% over the past year to $28.11, slightly higher than projected at 3.1%.\n\nEconomists anticipated employers to add 158,000 jobs, in line with average growth this year but significantly below the 2018 average of 223,000. The June and July jobs numbers were revised down by a combined 20,000, according to the Labor Department's report released on Friday.\n\nEmployment in the federal government increased in the last full month of summer, primarily due to the hiring of temporary workers for the 2020 census. Excluding these employees, August payrolls grew by 105,000 jobs. Notable gains also occurred in the health care sector, which added 24,000 jobs, and the finance industry, which grew by 15,000.\n\nThe lower-than-expected growth comes amid concerns that the current economic expansion in the U.S., which has reached a record length, is beginning to slow and may be followed by a recession within two years. Industries on the front line of the U.S.-China trade war continued to report losses.\n\nTony Bedikian, managing director at Citizens Bank, commented, \"The on-again, off-again U.S.-China trade talks continue to roil markets and, in some ways, are mirroring the on-again, off-again Brexit debate. Both issues are providing market participants with more theater than substance while the U.S. consumer tunes them out, keeps spending, and keeps the U.S. economic fundamentals on track.\"\n\nThe jobs report is likely to give the Federal Reserve justification to lower short-term interest rates by a modest 25 basis points, rather than making a deeper cut, when policymakers meet in mid-September. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to discuss the economic outlook in a speech later Friday in Zurich.",
    " Title: California Imposes Indefinite 'Stay At Home' Order as Coronavirus Cases Surge\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has issued an indefinite 'Stay At Home' order for the state's 40 million residents in response to the growing novel coronavirus epidemic. The order, announced late Thursday, is the most extensive directive issued by any state so far in the United States.\n\nThe order requires residents to stay at home, with exceptions only for essential travel. The move follows similar restrictions imposed earlier this week for the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nDuring a late-evening news conference in Sacramento, Newsom stated, \"This order goes into force and effect this evening, and we are confident that the people of the state of California will abide by it, will do the right thing.\"\n\nNewsom, a Democrat who took office just over a year ago, said Californians would \"step up as they have over the last number of weeks to protect themselves, to protect their families, and to protect the broader community in this great state and the world we reside in.\"\n\nThe duration of the order is undetermined. After the announcement, California Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, tweeted, \"I hope Governor Newsom consulted with a lot of experts before he decided to shut down 12% of the nation's population.\"\n\nThe order includes several exemptions, according to Newsom. \"We're going to keep the grocery stores open,\" he said. \"We're going to make sure that you're getting critical medical supplies. You can still take your kids outside, practicing common sense and social distancing. You can still walk your dog.\"\n\nEssential travel includes trips to grocery stores, gas stations, farmers markets, food banks, convenience stores, takeout and delivery restaurants, banks, and laundromats, according to the Los Angeles Times. The directive also exempts critical infrastructure such as food and agriculture, health care, transportation, energy, and financial services, the newspaper said.\n\nCalifornia, along with Washington and New York, is among the states hardest-hit by the burgeoning U.S. outbreak. The state has over 1,000 confirmed cases of the potentially fatal respiratory infection, with 19 deaths from COVID-19.\n\nEarlier, Newsom stated that an official projection estimates that up to 56% of the state's residents could become infected by the virus\u2014a figure that would equate to more than 22 million people. However, he said at the news conference, \"The point of the stay-at-home order is to make those numbers moot.\"\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the total number of cases in the U.S. has surpassed 10,000. However, officials believe that due to the small number of tests for the virus so far due to a lack of test kits, the number of infections is thought to be significantly higher.\n\nA tally of worldwide coronavirus statistics maintained by Johns Hopkins University shows the global total of reported cases is nearly 250,000, with more than 10,000 deaths.",
    " Title: Attorney General Eric Holder's Mixed Legacy on National Security Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder, who announced his resignation on Thursday, leaves office with a mixed record on national security issues, according to legal experts. Holder, who took office in 2009, was determined to distance the Justice Department from past practices, but his decisions have drawn scrutiny and disappointed some who felt he did not go far enough in protecting civil liberties.\n\nOne of Holder's most controversial decisions was his plan to prosecute the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks and other alleged co-conspirators in a New York courtroom rather than through the Guantanamo Bay military commission process. The Obama administration's eventual decision to walk away from the proposal was a stinging defeat for Holder.\n\nDuring his tenure, Holder oversaw hundreds of terrorism-fighting successes, including the prosecutions of plots to explode a bomb in Times Square and on a Detroit-bound airliner. However, the department also authorized targeted drone strikes against Americans abroad, subpoenaed journalists' telephone records in leak investigations, and defended in court the government's bulk collection of millions of Americans' telephone records.\n\nJonathan Hafetz, a Seton Hall University law professor and former senior lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said Holder had been \"too supportive of executive power and insufficiently protective of civil liberties.\" Stephen Vladeck, an American University law school professor, credited Holder for overseeing a large number of terrorism prosecutions but noted that the visible successes did not tell the whole story.\n\nWhen Holder took over, he quickly signaled a new direction from the previous Republican administration. During Senate hearings on his nomination, Holder defined waterboarding as torture and announced an investigation into CIA interrogation methods of terrorist detainees. The inquiry ended without criminal charges.\n\nHolder pushed a shift away from the military commission system the Bush administration enacted to prosecute suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. In November 2009, he said the Justice Department would prosecute five detainees, including professed Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, in federal court in New York and seek the death penalty.\n\nCritics, mostly Republicans, argued the federal courts were ill-equipped for such a trial and expressed alarm that terrorists would be brought to American soil. The White House in 2011 shelved the idea, which was seen as a step toward closing the Guantanamo detention facility.\n\nDespite that defeat, Holder remained firm in supporting civilian courts for suspected terrorists, and his Justice Department has won many convictions before American juries. He has said his position was vindicated by the fact that, in the years since the Guantanamo proposal was spiked, Osama bin Laden's son-in-law was captured, convicted in New York, and given a life sentence. The military commission case against Mohammed remains stalled in Guantanamo by pretrial wrangling.\n\nHolder's successor will face many of the same policy questions, including how to close Guantanamo and what to do with the detainees, how to handle potential foreign fighters trying to join extremist groups in Syria, and whether there is a vehicle for bringing former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden out of asylum in Russia and into a U.S. courtroom.\n\nEither way, said Vladeck, it's challenging from the outside to fully assess Holder's national security record. \"The public's perspective, I think, may be very different from the attorney general's perspective. He knows all the things that never made the front pages.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Officials Provide Contrasting Views on Safety of Iraqi Christians\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo senior U.S. officials have provided contrasting assessments on the safety of Iraqi Christians, with one asserting that they face terror and extortion in northern Iraq, while the other maintains they are largely immune from politically motivated violence.\n\nLast September, Hallam Ferguson, a senior Trump appointee at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), told a government commission that militias aligned with Iran terrorize families who have returned to northern Iraq, extort local businesses, and openly pledge allegiance to Iran. Ferguson stated that in some towns, the number of Christians who have returned after the defeat of the Islamic State has reached only 1 to 2% due to persecution by these militias.\n\nOn the same day, Michael Rubin, a Middle East expert at the American Enterprise Institute, completed a sworn declaration at the request of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for use in its efforts to deport Iraqis. Rubin argued that Iraq is now a more stable country with an increasingly professional government, and Iraqi Christians could count on the state's protection.\n\nGovernment lawyers have submitted Rubin's statement, along with similar declarations by two other experts, to courts during immigration hearings. The assessments by Rubin and the other experts can have significant consequences, as the administration has sought to deport hundreds of Iraqis, many of them Christians, who immigrated to the U.S. years ago. To stay in the U.S., many of the Iraqis have to prove that if they are deported, they are most likely to be tortured by, or with the tacit permission of, the Iraqi government.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in a January speech in Michigan that he would grant an \"extension\" to Iraqi Christians facing deportation, but DHS' effort to deport the Iraqis is ongoing, lawyers said. In approving one Iraqi Christian's deportation late last year, an immigration judge wrote that he found the experts' declarations \"persuasive\" and was convinced that the Iraqi government has cracked down on abuses by the majority-Shiite Muslim militias that helped defeat the Islamic State but have not disbanded since its demise.\n\nIn an emailed response to questions, Rubin said that he does not agree with the Trump administration's policy of deporting the Iraqis, but that he had been asked for an informed assessment and not his political opinion. Rubin plans to update his statement to address recent unrest in Iraq, where there have been widespread demonstrations and the killing of hundreds of mostly unarmed protesters.\n\nThe two other experts who took similar positions as Rubin, Denise Natali and Douglas Ollivant, did not respond to requests for comment. Natali is now a senior State Department official.\n\nThe State Department, USAID, DHS, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment, and the Iraqi Embassy in Washington did not offer a response either.\n\nWhile the Iraqi government has succeeded in defeating the Islamic State and winning back control of its territory, religious and ethnic minorities have little faith the government can protect them against a multitude of active, semi-official armed groups, experts said.\n\n\"My view aligns more closely with USAID,\" said Steven Cook, a Middle East expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, who visited Iraq in December. \"Iraq seems to be in a situation of terminal collapse. With the continued presence of extremists and the unreliable central government, I find it hard to believe that Christians are safe and secure.\"\n\nLawyers for the deportees have also filed declarations from human rights experts arguing that the deportees would be at risk of detention and abuse. The Trump administration has frequently highlighted the dangers faced by Christians to support its decision to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid for them and other religious minorities in Iraq and Syria. The cause is especially popular with Trump's conservative Christian base, which he is seeking to solidify ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Vice President Mike Pence, in particular, has made this issue a priority. Starting in 2017, his aides pressured USAID to direct more funds to religious minorities in Iraq, including Christians. A \u2588\u2588\u2588 investigation last year found that, under pressure from Pence and in contravention of USAID regulations, political appointees were closely involved in deciding grants in Iraq that went to Christian groups.",
    " Title: Virginia Election Results Reveal Anti-Immigrant Strategy as Ineffective for Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent Virginia elections, the strategy employed by Republican candidate Ed Gillespie, which focused on anti-immigrant sentiments, was met with significant opposition from voters across various demographic and ethnic groups. Contrary to pre-election speculation, the anti-immigrant strategy proved to be a misstep for Gillespie, as demonstrated by election results and polling data.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by Latino Decisions on election eve, Latino voters expressed disapproval of Gillespie's MS-13 advertisements, with a 45-point margin stating that the ads made them less enthusiastic about him. This sentiment was not limited to Latino voters. In Virginia, whites, African-Americans, and Asian-Americans also expressed disapproval of the MS-13 ads, with a 23-point margin (52 to 29) stating that the ads turned them away from Gillespie.\n\nA regression analysis of survey data reveals a clear trend. Exposure to Gillespie's MS-13 ads drove white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. Furthermore, among white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Gillespie's Democratic opponent. This effect was not limited to the governor's race; the Gillespie campaign's coattail effects were of the wrong kind, with voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads being significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia's House of Delegates.\n\nThe data suggests that not only is it strategically sound for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a morally just position. This stance resonates with Latino, African-American, and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough white voters who oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis trend is particularly significant for voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters, also known as the Democratic base. As President Trump and his fellow Republicans gear up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018, the Virginia elections serve as a clear warning. Voters are becoming increasingly aware and are likely to respond negatively to such strategies. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry and, in doing so, have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.",
    " Title: President Trump Calls for \"Red Wave\" to Pass Immigration Bill, Accuses Democrats of Obstruction\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has called for a \"red wave\" in the November elections to pass an immigration bill in Congress, accusing Democrats of obstruction. In a series of tweets on Friday, Trump stated that Republicans should not waste their time on immigration until after the midterm elections, as Democrats are \"just playing games\" and have no intention of addressing the decades-old problem.\n\nThe House GOP abruptly scrapped a planned vote on a troubled immigration bill on Thursday, pushing a vote into next week. The compromise measure was expected to include a requirement that employers use E-Verify to check the legal status of employees.\n\nCongressional Republicans had earlier failed to pass a more conservative bill. A sticking point for conservatives is that while the compromise funds the wall, it also offers a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million young illegal immigrants. The conservative bill offers only the 700,000 recipients of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program the ability to apply for indefinite renewals of non-immigrant status.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., stated, \"It is not a compromise.\" She added, \"It may be a compromise with the devil, but it is not a compromise with the Democrats.\"\n\nTrump extended an invitation to Democrats to discuss immigration at the White House on Wednesday, but he had scathing words for what he called the \"extremist, open border\" lawmakers. On Thursday, he echoed that rhetoric, but without the invitation for Democrats to come to the table.\n\nTrump renewed his criticism of the filibuster in the Senate, which requires 60 votes to break. He stated, \"Even if we get 100% Republican votes in the Senate, we need 10 Democrat votes to get a much-needed Immigration Bill - & the Dems are Obstructionists who won\u2019t give votes for political reasons & because they don\u2019t care about Crime coming from the Border! So we need to elect more R\u2019s!\"\n\nTrump's tweets come after a fiery week in which rhetoric on both sides has escalated on the question of the administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy, which prosecutes all illegal border crossers. This led to an increase in the number of children being separated from their parents. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday ending the practice and allowing families to be detained together, but Democrats have since pushed for ending what they described as \"indefinite detention\" of families at the border.",
    " Title: Misinterpretation of Netanyahu's Remarks on Palestinian Statehood\n\nArticle:\n\nRecent media reports, primarily in the Western press, have been circulating a false narrative regarding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's stance on a Palestinian state. The misconception stems from a misinterpretation of Netanyahu's comments during an interview with the conservative Israeli publication NRG.\n\nIn the interview, Netanyahu was asked if his 2009 speech at Bar-Ilan University, where he expressed support for the possibility of a Palestinian state, was irrelevant. In response, Netanyahu did not reject the idea of a Palestinian state outright. Instead, he expressed concerns about the potential security risks of establishing a Palestinian state in the current political climate.\n\nWhen asked if a Palestinian state would not come to fruition if he were elected head of state, Netanyahu responded affirmatively, but his statement was taken out of context. He was referring to the potential dangers of creating a Palestinian state \"today,\" not a permanent rejection of the idea.\n\nFurthermore, Netanyahu's policy on the Palestinian issue aligns closely with that of Yitzchak Rabin, the man who created the Oslo Accords. In a speech one month before his assassination in 1995, Rabin stated, \"We view a permanent solution [involving] a Palestinian entity which is less than a state... We will not return to the June 4, 1967 lines... We committed ourselves before the Knesset not to uproot a single settlement in the framework of the interim agreement, and not to hinder building for natural growth... And first and foremost in our concerns is a united Jerusalem, as the capital of Israel, under Israeli sovereignty.\"\n\nThe misinterpretation of Netanyahu's comments by Ha'aretz and the subsequent spread of the story by the Western media has led to accusations of flip-flopping on Netanyahu's part. However, a careful examination of the interview transcript reveals that Netanyahu did not change his position on the Palestinian issue, but rather expressed concerns about the timing and potential security risks of establishing a Palestinian state.",
    " Title: Cruz and Trump Engage in Legal Threats Over Abortion Ad in South Carolina\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange, Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have engaged in a series of legal threats over an ad running in South Carolina that questions Trump's record on abortion. Cruz has dismissed Trump's complaints and vowed to run the ad more frequently, stating that voters \"deserve to know the truth.\"\n\nAt a press conference in South Carolina on Wednesday, Cruz read from a cease-and-desist letter sent by Trump's campaign, calling it \"one of the most remarkable letters I have ever read.\" Cruz challenged Trump to follow through with his threatened lawsuit.\n\nThe ad in question features footage of Trump in a 1999 interview stating he is \"very pro-choice.\" The ad references the current debate over the Supreme Court vacancy and states, \"We cannot trust Donald Trump with these serious decisions.\"\n\nTrump's attorney sent Cruz a letter on Tuesday, stating the ad was \"replete with outright lies, false, defamatory, and destructive statements\" and that Cruz could be held liable for damages if it is not taken down. In response, the Cruz campaign called the threats \"laughable\" and questioned the validity of preventing voters from hearing Trump's past statements on the issue.\n\nMeanwhile, Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are also embroiled in a dispute over alleged dirty tricks leading up to Saturday's South Carolina GOP primary. Cruz has denied any involvement in any untoward activities and has called for anyone with evidence to come forward. Rubio was asked Wednesday to provide evidence that Cruz's team was behind a fake Facebook page wrongly claiming that U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy had switched his endorsement from Rubio to Cruz.\n\nRubio responded, \"It's just a pattern of people around his campaign that have continuously done things like that.\"\n\nBoth candidates have yet to follow through on their legal threats, and the outcome remains uncertain.",
    " Title: BuzzFeed Report Alleges President Trump Directed Michael Cohen to Lie About Moscow Project\n\nArticle:\n\nBuzzFeed News has reported that President Donald Trump directed his former lawyer Michael Cohen to lie about his Trump Tower project in Moscow. According to the report, Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying about the deal in testimony and in a two-page statement to the Senate and House intelligence committees. Special counsel Robert Mueller noted that Cohen's false claim that the project ended in January 2016 was an attempt to \"minimize links between the Moscow Project and Individual 1\" - widely understood to be Trump - \"in hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigations.\"\n\nTwo sources told BuzzFeed News that Cohen also told the special counsel that after the election, the president personally instructed him to lie - by claiming that negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did - in order to obscure Trump's involvement.\n\nRepresentative David Cicilline (D-RI) and Representative Ted Lieu (D-CA) have reacted to the news, with Cicilline stating on CNN Friday that the report could be \"the most serious threat\" to Trump's presidency. Lieu concluded that the president is guilty of obstruction of justice.\n\nCicilline and Lieu have called for a congressional investigation into the matter. Cicilline stated that they should wait for the reports to be confirmed before calling for an investigation, while Lieu has called for the House Judiciary Committee to start holding hearings to establish a record of whether the president committed impeachable offenses.\n\nHowever, when asked by CNN's John Berman if he has evidence to prove Trump told Cohen to lie, Cicilline said \"we've all seen the conduct of the president.\" Berman noted that was not an answer and asked again if he actually saw the evidence. Cicilline admitted that he has not seen the evidence referenced in the article.\n\nOne of the authors of the BuzzFeed report, Anthony Cormier, stood by his reporting on CNN Friday as \"100 percent\" truth.

    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Reiterates Opposition to \"Clean\" Debt Ceiling Increase, Government Funding Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has stated that Republican lawmakers will not agree to a measure to raise the nation's debt ceiling without conditions to curb deficit spending. In an interview on the ABC news program \"This Week,\" Boehner expressed his opposition to a \"clean\" debt ceiling increase, stating, \"I told the president, there's no way we're going to pass one.\"\n\nRegarding the ongoing government shutdown, Boehner was equally firm that Republicans would demand concessions for any bill to reopen the government. Specifically, Republicans are seeking changes to President Barack Obama's healthcare law, known as Obamacare, as a condition for backing a measure to fund government agencies. The Democratic-led Senate and President Obama have rejected this demand.\n\nBoehner reiterated that there are not enough votes in the House to pass a \"clean\" continuing resolution on the budget to re-open the government. When asked about a group of Democrats and Republicans who have expressed willingness to pass a six-week \"clean CR\" without defunding Obamacare, Boehner responded, \"There may be a back room somewhere, but there's nobody in it.\"\n\nBoehner emphasized that his party has tried to compromise by passing several bills that would fund parts of the government while talks continue. However, Democrats have rejected all but a bill to fund military pay because they view the effort as a ploy to simply fund every part of government individually except the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBoehner repeated the recent GOP line that a simple conversation with President Barack Obama is needed to resolve the impasse. He used the word \"conversation\" a total of 22 times in the interview, stating that President Obama knows his phone number and can call him any time.\n\nHost George Stephanopoulos played past quotes from Boehner in which he has said Obamacare is the law of the land and that defunding Obamacare should not be tied to the budget. Boehner acknowledged making a promise to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to pass a clean CR that included $70 billion less than what the Senate wanted.\n\nThe article concludes with a call to action, urging readers to vote on whether they support Sen. Ted Cruz's efforts to defund Obamacare.",
    " Title: Critics Question Limited Scope of U.S. Airstrikes Against Islamic State and Khorasan Group\n\nArticle:\n\nCritics are questioning the effectiveness of the U.S.-led airstrikes against the Islamic State and the Khorasan Group, with some suggesting that the limited scope of the air campaign is hindering the effort to combat these terrorist organizations.\n\nPhotos from a U.S.-led airstrike in Syria on Monday showed that the Islamic State's finance center's rooftop communications array was destroyed, but the building itself remained intact. This limited effectiveness is further diminished by the Iraqi security forces' mixed results in combat and their inability to reverse most gains made by the Islamic State, also known as ISIL and ISIS.\n\nIraqi troops also lack a key skill in the badly needed mission: finding and designating ground targets for U.S. warplanes, making the American air campaign more difficult. Bart Bechtel, a retired CIA operative, expressed frustration over the limited damage caused by the airstrikes, stating, \"I was mad as hell when I saw the hit on a supposed ISIL building. The right question is: Why not the whole building?\"\n\nA retired Air Force general who has remained in touch with the jet fighter community echoed these sentiments, stating that the U.S. air war is too narrow, with not enough planes, heavy ordnance, or sorties. Before the first assaults in Syria on Monday night, U.S. Central Command had conducted 190 airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq since Aug. 8, averaging less than four per day.\n\nAt a Pentagon briefing on Tuesday, Army Lt. Gen. William Mayville, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, explained that the missile attack took out the communication suite atop an Islamic State finance center in Raqqa, Syria, the terrorist group's headquarters. However, the surrounding structure remained largely untouched.\n\nEarly Wednesday, U.S. Central Command announced that it had reduced the tempo of the airstrikes, conducting a few hits in Iraq and one in Syria. Later in the day, U.S. fighter jets and aircraft belonging to two Arab partner nations began dropping missiles on Islamic State-controlled oil refineries in eastern Syria.\n\nThe targets chosen by Central Command have not been so much to degrade the Islamic State inside Iraq as they have been to stop it from moving in one direction or another, or to break its hold on particular locations such as dams or small towns. The air war continues without American combat troops on the ground to uproot Islamic State positions. Iraqis have shown little ability to carry out such missions or to spot targets for U.S. warplanes.\n\nArmy Gen. Lloyd Austin, Central Command chief, wanted to put U.S. spotters on the ground, but Army Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, Joint Chiefs chairman, convinced him that other tactics could be used. President Obama has decreed \"no boots on the ground.\"\n\nUnder the current setup, joint command centers radio the positions of the enemy to Iraqis and U.S. pilots based on video feeds from unmanned aircraft and other intelligence assets. A retired military officer who visits Baghdad routinely and works with Iraqi defense officials stated, \"That is a recipe for disaster once we get into close-in combat.\"\n\nThe former officer explained the mission gap. Ground spotters need a critical piece of equipment: a multiband radio that connects them to other combatants and to pilots overhead. Conventional forces also have no specialized units set up to spot targets. That capability resides with Iraqi special operations forces, but they have limited experience, the former officer said.\n\nThis role is not as important while U.S. pilots target Islamic State fighters in relatively open terrain, but it becomes crucial if the reorganized Iraqi units begin to fight in close combat in congested areas where pilots need exact locations. Retired Army Maj. Gen. Robert Scales stated, \"I'd like to see more of everything, a real air campaign with sorties delivered against the ISIS leadership.\"\n\nWithout more intensive strikes, he said, \"Over time the enemy learns to obviate the killing effects and becomes used to seeing planes orbiting overhead.\" The Pentagon said the air campaign could go on for years.",
    " Title: U.S. President Trump Considering National Regulation of Domestic Flights Amid Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that his administration is exploring the possibility of ordering airlines to reduce domestic flights as a measure to curb the spread of the coronavirus. However, Trump stated that he is not yet ready to issue a national stay-at-home order, suggesting it is not necessary in some states.\n\nSome governors have taken independent action in the travel sector. For instance, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has mandated self-isolation for 14 days for anyone flying to Florida from New York, New Jersey, or Connecticut, states that are among those most affected by the coronavirus. Alaska and Hawaii have also implemented self-quarantine requirements for travelers arriving from other states.\n\nTrump's comments suggest that he is contemplating regulating flights from a national level, expressing concern about flights moving from coronavirus hotspots to other affected cities. He acknowledged the potential hardship such measures would impose on the airlines.\n\nAirlines, industry officials, and health experts argue that flights are an essential service, necessary for both people and cargo, and should continue during the crisis. The federal government reinforced this view with a key provision in the $2 trillion coronavirus aid package passed last week: airlines that accept a share of the $50 billion set aside for the industry must maintain a minimum level of service through at least September.\n\nWhen asked on Monday about continued air travel from coronavirus hotspots, Trump stated, \"We are going to be \u2013 hopefully before we close things \u2013 we\u2019re going to start to open things.\" He added, \"Airports, when you close them and reopen them, it\u2019s a tremendous deal. It\u2019s a tremendous deal. In addition, you need them for emergencies, you have emergency flights.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would be the agency to order any shutdown or restrictions, similar to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max following two fatal crashes in less than five months last year. The FAA declined to comment on potential nationwide flight groundings when asked about the possibility.\n\nAirlines have significantly reduced their flight schedules in response to the decrease in passenger volume between cities. Trump has also imposed a ban on foreign nationals visiting the U.S. from China and most of Europe, including France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. He has also imposed restrictions on non-essential travel from Mexico and Canada.\n\nTrump emphasized that a national stay-at-home order is not necessary because \"you need to give a little bit of flexibility\" in states or regions where the coronavirus has not been as prevalent. He cited the Midwest and Alaska as examples.",
    " Title: HealthCare.gov Concerns Mount as Obama Administration Anticipates Public Reaction to Insurance Plan Prices and Limited Choices\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration is reportedly expressing concern over potential negative publicity regarding the pricing and availability of health insurance plans on the HealthCare.gov website. According to War Room Notes obtained by CNN, project managers are apprehensive about the media attention that may arise as individuals select plans on an improved Obamacare site. The notes suggest that the media attention could focus on individual plan selections and choices, with some cases having fewer options than desired to promote consumer choice and a satisfactory shopping experience. Additionally, in some cases, there will be relatively high-cost plans, the notes indicate.\n\nCNN's report appears to reference an October 24 discussion regarding the Obama administration's signature healthcare law failing to lower prices for people in rural areas. The Times reported that rural areas have fewer insurance companies offering plans in the new online insurance exchanges, with more than 500 counties having only one insurer participating.\n\nThe War Room notes also mention \"problem plans\" and a site issue that prevents certification, possibly due to a misspelling on the website, according to CNN.\n\nThe high cost of coverage under the new law is already a concern, with an average state seeing Obamacare increase underlying premiums by 41 percent, according to a Manhattan Institute analysis released Monday, as reported by Forbes. Before the law's online healthcare markets launched on October 1, the administration estimated nearly 500,000 people would enroll for subsidized private insurance within the first month. Despite high consumer interest, a computer system plagued by issues has prevented most from doing so.\n\nRecently, at least 3.5 million Americans have received cancellation notices from their private carriers because their coverage does not meet the standards set by the new Affordable Care Act. The exact number is unclear, as an Associated Press survey noted data from half the states is still unavailable.\n\nThe administration refuses to release official Obamacare insurance plan enrollment numbers until mid-November, when a crash effort of computer fixes may be showing results. However, numbers are expected to be disappointingly low. Americans remain divided over the new healthcare law, with negative views outweighing positives. Yet, they also lean against repealing it.",
    " Title: Romney Raises $4.2 Million in 24 Hours Following Obama Tax Ruling\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's ruling on the Obama Tax case yesterday, Mitt Romney's campaign has reportedly raised $4.2 million in the subsequent 24 hours. In response to the ruling, Romney stated that he would repeal the entire bill on his first day in office if elected president.\n\nThe influx of funds comes just days after President Obama sent an email with the subject line, \"I will be outspent.\" The president expressed that he could potentially become the first president in modern history to be outspent in his re-election campaign if the current trend continues.\n\nIn the email, Obama did not only refer to super PACs and anonymous outside groups but also mentioned the Romney campaign itself. He stated that the Romney campaign raises more funds than the Obama campaign, and the disparity is not hard to understand. According to the Obama campaign, they raised almost three-quarters of their funds from donors giving less than $1,000, while Mitt Romney's campaign raised more than three-quarters of its funds from individuals giving $1,000 or more.\n\nFurthermore, the Obama campaign noted that the massive outside spending by super PACs and front groups, estimated to be up to an additional billion dollars, is not included in these figures. These outside groups are reportedly spending heavily on ads criticizing Obama, his campaign, and his beliefs.\n\nIn the email, Obama emphasized that they can be outspent and still win, but they cannot be outspent 10 to 1 and still win. He also thanked the more than 2.2 million Americans who have already donated to his campaign and encouraged more contributions.\n\nThe email also mentioned a fundraising deadline this week and offered a chance for donors to join Michelle and Obama for one of the last grassroots dinners of the campaign. These dinners, according to the email, represent a different approach, as Obama spent the past weekend at a secretive retreat for the biggest donors to both his campaign and the super PACs supporting him.",
    " Title: Obama's Farewell Address and Post-Presidency Plans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his farewell address to the nation on Tuesday, President Barack Obama called for continued action, addressing issues such as inequality, racial divisions, and the decline of fact-based consensus and faith in public institutions. Obama's post-presidency promises to be active, with a focus on organizing, redistricting, and supporting Democratic candidates.\n\nIn his address, Obama urged citizens to take action, stating, \"If something needs fixing, then lace up your shoes and do some organizing.\" He also referenced his commitment to Organizing for America, an outside group that sprang from his presidential campaigns and will now be retooled to train activists and recruit Democratic candidates.\n\nObama also mentioned his involvement in the reshaping of congressional districts after the 2020 census. He will work on redistricting with former Attorney General Eric Holder, who chairs the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. The committee aims to invest in races for governor, state legislature, and other down-ballot offices.\n\nUnspoken in Obama's remarks is the decline of the Democratic Party during his tenure. The party has lost control of both houses of Congress, numerous governorships, and now the presidency. Democrats control the governor's chair and both legislative chambers in only six states.\n\nLike most ex-presidents in the modern era, Obama will write a memoir and focus on his initiative aimed at helping young men of color avoid the school-to-prison pipeline, known as My Brother's Keeper. He will also work on his Chicago-based presidential library and foundation.\n\nObama will be based in Washington for the next two and a half years, while his younger daughter finishes high school, making him the first president since Woodrow Wilson to remain in the capital after leaving office. Obama's close proximity to his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, may lead to involvement as an informal Democratic adviser.\n\nPolitical scientist Andra Gillespie of Emory University in Atlanta suggests that Obama may maintain a behind-the-scenes role in helping craft Democratic strategy. However, Obama framed his exhortations on civic engagement in a broad, nonpartisan way, calling for national unity and a restoration of the sense of common purpose.",
    " Title: Obama's Economic Performance During Presidency: A Look at the Numbers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe strong economic growth in the second quarter of 2014 has sparked discussions about President Obama's lack of credit for the economic recovery. However, the public's perception of a robust economy under the Obama administration is not universally shared.\n\nEvidence of a sustained economic recovery is still scarce. While the economy grew 4.6 percent in the past quarter, a single quarter of strong growth does not equate to a healthy economy. Only one other quarter during Obama's presidency has matched this growth rate. The economy's performance in 2014's first quarter was qualitatively as bad as the second quarter was good, marking the economy's worst performance since 2009's first quarter and the economy's worst quarter since 1990.\n\nThe Obama administration's economic performance has been characterized by periods of subpar growth. In 10 of its 22 quarters, the economy's growth has been below 2 percent. Excluding the 2009 negative 2.8 percent real GDP downturn, Mr. Obama's 2010-13 average annual GDP growth was just slightly above 2.1 percent. Including 2009's figure, the president's five-year average falls to below 1.2 percent annual GDP growth. If the Congressional Budget Office's 1.5 percent estimate for 2014 economic growth holds true, Mr. Obama's six-year economic growth average will be a paltry 1.2 percent.\n\nUnemployment rates during Obama's presidency have also been high. Last month's 5.9 percent unemployment rate was the lowest of his presidency, and it was the first time it was below 6.1 percent since he came into office. In contrast, for 30 consecutive months of his presidency, the U.S. unemployment rate was 9 percent or higher. The average annual unemployment rate for Mr. Obama's first five years in office was 6.9 percent, a rate not seen since 1993.\n\nThe economy has not lacked substantial assistance. The Federal Reserve's unprecedented monetary-policy accommodation has kept interest rates at roughly zero percent for almost the entirety of Mr. Obama's time in office. Additionally, an equally \"stimulative\" fiscal policy has been implemented, with federal debt held by the public more than doubling\u2014growing 106 percent\u2014from 2008 through 2013. In comparison, during the same period, America's economy has grown just 12.6 percent overall.\n\nSupporters argue that Mr. Obama faced a recession when he came into office and that, relative to the blow, the economy has at least endured. However, the stronger the recession, the stronger the recovery should be, and such has not been the case.\n\nThe president's economic problems, however, run deeper than just economics. They also delve into politics for two important reasons. First, the president is now firmly associated with the subpar economy of the past five years. Given that America has suffered a prolonged and painful economic performance for more than six years, it is natural to associate Mr. Obama with it. It is a test of most people's memory\u2014if not credulity itself\u2014to try attaching today's economy to George W. Bush, who is out of office for almost six years.\n\nSecond, America is not accustomed to persistent failure. Americans expect excellence, particularly in the economy. The United States is often seen as the land of opportunity, and its vibrant economy has been a significant draw for immigrants seeking a better life. Given his record, what is truly surprising is not that the president does not get credit for a good economy, but that he does not get more blame for the economy being so poor. If anything, Mr. Obama should be counting his blessings for the little respect he has earned for his economy's dismal performance.\n\nJ.T.

    " Title: Obama's Second Term and the Challenges of Presidential Leadership\n\nArticle:\n\nThe suggestion that former President Barack Obama, who successfully pushed for higher taxes on the wealthy following his re-election, has been too passive in his leadership is disputed by his advisors. David Plouffe, a key advisor to Obama, dismissed this notion as \"not a very sophisticated analysis.\"\n\nSecond terms have historically presented challenges for U.S. presidents, with examples such as the Iran-contra affair for Ronald Reagan and the impeachment of Bill Clinton. President George W. Bush also faced difficulties in his fifth year, with his attempt to revamp Social Security stalling, and the escalating violence in Iraq making it difficult to regain traction.\n\nHowever, presidents have also made significant breakthroughs during their second term despite Congressional investigations. Reagan signed a nuclear-arms treaty with the Soviet Union, Clinton balanced the budget, and Bush defied opposition to implement a troop surge in Iraq, contributing to a turnaround there.\n\nFor President Obama, the recent announcement by the Congressional Budget Office of a sharp drop in the projected deficit serves as a reminder that a healthier economy at the end of his term could have a more significant impact on his legacy than this week's setbacks.\n\nHowever, the ongoing furors could reinforce an impression of an Obama presidency that has expanded the role of government more than many Americans prefer. These controversies can also undermine a crucial aspect of the presidency, the ability to focus public attention.\n\nAs a senator, Obama recognized that a president could influence only 15 to 20 percent of the public agenda, with the rest requiring a reaction. According to his aides, Obama maintains his famed equanimity and, free from campaign pressures, takes a longer view.\n\nDan Pfeiffer, a White House senior adviser, stated, \"Being in office for nearly four and a half years gives the president some perspective \u2014 it helps separate the signal from the noise. When you have dealt with real life-and-death problems, the political ones seem much smaller and affect you less.\"",
    " Title: Parents of Slain Border Agent Criticize Attorney General Holder Over Fast and Furious Operation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe parents of slain U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry have accused Attorney General Eric Holder and other Justice Department officials of withholding information regarding the botched anti-gunrunning operation Fast and Furious. In an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday, Kent and Josephine Terry expressed their belief that the Obama administration is concealing details about their son's death.\n\nFast and Furious, an operation aimed at tracking illicit guns to larger traffickers, allowed guns to be \"walked\" and subsequently lost in Mexico. Two of these guns were later found at the crime scene where Terry was killed in December 2010, north of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nOn Wednesday, a House panel voted along party lines to recommend holding Holder in contempt of Congress for not releasing a vast collection of documents related to Fast and Furious. The House is considering a full vote on the matter. President Obama has invoked executive privilege to keep many of the documents from public view.\n\nHolder has not been formally charged with contempt of Congress. The full House would need to approve a resolution for this to occur, according to Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.). Issa suggested that the vote could be avoided if the attorney general provides more emails and memos about the Fast and Furious sting.\n\nHolder has testified that he became aware of Fast and Furious after Terry's death, and he has condemned the operation's tactics. However, GOP lawmakers have suggested that top Justice Department officials knew more about the operation than they have disclosed.\n\nThe Terry family expressed their frustration that the Obama administration may be obstructing their pursuit of the truth about their son's death. \"They're lying... They're passing the buck,\" Kent Terry told Hannity. \"I just know that they're hiding something big. Something happened out there.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Terry family released a statement expressing their disappointment with the Obama administration's actions. \"Attorney General Eric Holder's refusal to fully disclose the documents associated with Operation Fast and Furious and President Obama's assertion of executive privilege serves to compound this tragedy. It denies the Terry family and the American people the truth,\" they said.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Fast and Furious documents has raised questions and challenges about the power of the presidency, as President Obama's decision to assert executive privilege over the documents not only failed to delay contempt proceedings against Attorney General Eric Holder but also sparked constitutional debates.\n\nThe immediate question was whether the documents contained information so damaging that the president was willing to risk negative publicity by withholding them. GOP lawmakers also questioned the legitimacy of Obama's assertion, with the committee voting that it was not appropriate in this case. Republicans repeatedly suggested that the White House had acknowledged being involved in Fast and Furious discussions by asserting privilege over the documents in question.\n\nThe Department of Justice has defended its response, with Holder stating that Issa, the committee chairman who has led the charge for answers about Fast and Furious, rejected an \"extraordinary offer.\" Wednesday's developments follow a flurry of activity on Tuesday, as Holder attempted to negotiate a way to avoid contempt proceedings. Issa had earlier indicated a willingness to postpone the vote after Holder indicated a willingness to make compromises and supply some documents in response to House Republicans' subpoena.",
    " Title: Trump Proposes 5% Domestic Spending Cuts in 2020 Budget, Maintains Border Wall Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow announced on Sunday that President Trump has proposed a 5% across-the-board cut on all domestic spending as part of his 2020 budget. Kudlow stated during an appearance on \"Fox News Sunday\" that the budget will be \"tough\" and that it's \"long overdue.\"\n\nThe proposed budget, according to Kudlow, will contain a 5% reduction in domestic spending, similar to previous spending blueprints. The budget will reportedly propose cuts to many domestic programs favored by lawmakers in both parties, but it will leave alone politically popular retirement programs such as Medicare and Social Security.\n\nThe U.S. budget deficit is expected to reach $897 billion, according to a government report. Kudlow, however, said there's no reason to \"obsess\" about the budget deficit as long as it remains below 5% of the overall economy.\n\nTrump's 2020 budget, like his 2017 tax cut, has been criticized for contributing to the growing deficit. The tax cut, along with sharp increases in spending for both the Pentagon and domestic agencies and the growing federal retirement costs of the baby boom generation, have been cited as factors behind the deficit.\n\nThe proposed budget will not address the main factors behind the growing, intractable deficits that have driven the U.S. debt above $22 trillion. Its most striking proposed cuts \u2013 to domestic agency operations \u2013 were rejected when Tea Party Republicans controlled the House, and they face equally grim prospects now that Democrats are in the majority.\n\nTrump has given no indication he's interested in the deficit and has rejected any idea of curbing Medicare or Social Security, the massive federal retirement programs whose imbalances are the chief deficit drivers.\n\nOne area that won't see a cut in the proposed budget is for funding for the president's border wall. The Washington Post reported on Sunday that Trump will request at least $8.6 billion in new funding to build additional sections of a wall along the Mexico border. Trump also wants $5 billion in additional funds for the Department of Homeland Security and another $3.6 billion in military construction funds.\n\nAll this would come in addition to the $6.5 billion Trump vowed last month to redirect for the construction of the wall. Kudlow stated that the issue of the wall and border security is of \"paramount importance\" and that Trump has made a \"crisis\" case effectively. He cited economic, crime, and drug concerns, as well as humanitarian issues, as reasons for the need for a border wall.",
    " Title: Graham Urges Direct Confrontation Between Trump and Putin, Praises Supreme Court Nominees\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has called for President Donald Trump to directly challenge Russian President Vladimir Putin over alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections during their upcoming meeting in Helsinki. In an interview with Fox News Sunday, Graham stated, \"When Putin denies that he was involved in our election in 2016, reject the denial\u2014challenge him. Don't let him deny the obvious. They're still trying to disrupt the 2018 election cycle.\"\n\nGraham also addressed the ongoing issues with Russian influence in Turkey, referring to the country as \"an ally adrift.\" However, he noted that Turkey represents a \"new chapter\" following the re-election of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan amid sweeping government purges.\n\nIn other international matters, Graham attributed North Korea's criticisms of U.S. rhetoric to Chinese influence. \"I see China's hands all over this,\" Graham said. \"We're in a fight with China... If I were President Trump, I would not let China use North Korea to back me off of the trade dispute. We've got more bullets than they do in terms of trade.\"\n\nTurning to domestic affairs, Graham expressed confidence in the four Supreme Court nominees reportedly under consideration by President Trump. \"Republicans are holding four lottery tickets, and they're all winners,\" Graham said, who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee. The four nominees are believed to be federal judges Thomas Hardiman, Brett Kavanaugh, Raymond Kethledge, and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nGraham particularly praised Thomas Hardiman, a judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, likening him favorably to Associate Justice Samuel Alito in both personality and legal bent. However, Graham criticized the partisanship in the Senate, stating, \"There's nobody that President Trump could nominate from a conservative bent that will get many Democratic votes.\"\n\nGraham predicted that the nomination process would be a \"nightmare for red-state Democrats,\" who risk alienating their constituency if they oppose Trump's pick. The increasingly partisan nature of Supreme Court confirmation hearings has led some analysts to urge Trump to try to defuse the tension. Fox News political analyst Juan Williams suggested that the potential appointment of a conservative justice could be perceived as the court becoming a \"rubber stamp for a conservative social agenda.\"\n\nTrump is expected to announce his pick to replace retiring Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy in a primetime address at 9 p.m. ET.",
    " Title: Colorado Voters Able to Change Presidential Primary Ballots Before Tuesday Deadline, Lawmakers Discuss Future Changes\n\nArticle:\n\nColorado voters who have already cast their ballots for presidential candidates who have since dropped out of the race cannot change their votes this year, but lawmakers are discussing potential changes to the law for future presidential primaries.\n\nElections officials have encouraged early voting for the state's first presidential primary in 20 years, leading to some voters selecting candidates who are no longer in the race, such as Pete Buttigieg. Secretary of State Jena Griswold noted on Sunday that Colorado voters who have filled out but not returned their ballots can still obtain new ballots or cross out their previous selection and pick a new candidate by 7 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nIf a voter has marked a ballot but has not returned it, they can change their selection by crossing out their first pick and then marking the oval next to their preferred candidate. Alternatively, they can obtain a replacement ballot in-person at a Voter Service and Polling Center (VSPC). More information can be found at https://t.co/OQ2SXOeniQ.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Alec Garnett told reporters on Monday morning that there should be a discussion about a possible statutory change to allow voters in the future to cast their votes through Election Day, even if their initial choice has dropped out.\n\n\"Every voter should have the opportunity, even if their vote was cast for an election and their candidate dropped out, to go to the county clerk and have the opportunity to pull a provisional ballot and vote for who remains in the race,\" Garnett said.\n\nGarnett added that this issue was not discussed during the legislative process, and it is something that lawmakers should discuss with both sides of the aisle.\n\nBoulder County Clerk Molly Fitzpatrick tweeted on Monday that voters who still have their ballots can change a vote by following the voter instructions on how to correct a mistake (do not sign the ballot, only the envelope). If a voter has already voted, they cannot receive a replacement ballot.\n\nOnly three other states hold all mail-ballot statewide elections, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, making the issue of voting early for a candidate that may drop out early fairly unique.\n\nGarnett has not spoken to lawmakers about specific solutions, but after the results came in from South Carolina's caucus and former mayor Buttigieg's announcement on Sunday, he has heard from constituents asking what they can do.\n\n\"I think it was a little frustrating on my end to say, 'There's nothing you can do,'\" he said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Steve Fenberg has also heard from people who are frustrated by being unable to change their votes, and he thinks this is an issue lawmakers can tackle this year for future elections, though he doesn't yet know what the exact solution should be.\n\n\"It could be logistically difficult, but I think it's worth looking into,\" Fenberg said.\n\nThe problem is exacerbated by the fact that the primary election for presidential candidates is how the state parties select delegates, and some of the candidates who dropped out, such as Buttigieg, could still receive delegates because they had a significant amount of support.",
    " Title: Michael Cohen Admits to Hiring IT Firm to Manipulate Polls for Donald Trump in 2015\n\nArticle:\n\nMichael Cohen, former personal lawyer to President Donald Trump, admitted on Twitter Thursday to hiring an IT firm, RedFinch Solutions LLC, to manipulate polls in favor of Trump during his 2015 presidential campaign. The Wall Street Journal reported the revelation on Thursday.\n\nJohn Gauger, owner of RedFinch Solutions, told the Wall Street Journal that in 2015, he was promised $50,000 by Cohen for attempting to influence polls in Trump's favor. However, he received approximately $12,000 to $13,000 in cash and a boxing glove in a blue Walmart bag.\n\nCohen denied to the Wall Street Journal that he paid in cash, stating that the money was given by check. According to the report, Mr. Gauger was asked in 2014 to manipulate the results of a CNBC poll for the top U.S. business leaders, but he was unsuccessful in getting Trump into the top 100. The next year, he was asked to influence a Drudge Report ranking of potential Republican primary picks, where Trump came in fifth.\n\nMr. Gauger told the newspaper that he performed other services for Cohen, unrelated to the president, and said Cohen paid for some. One project was to create the \"@ WomenForCohen\" account on Twitter, which still exists and describes Cohen as a \"strong, pit bull, sex symbol, no nonsense, business-oriented, and ready to make a difference!\"\n\nIn 2017, Cohen requested a $50,000 reimbursement for \"tech services\" from the Trump Tower Organization, according to federal prosecutors in an August 2018 charging document. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, bank fraud, and lying to Congress. None of the charges are connected to his dealings with RedFinch.\n\nThe Trump Organization did not provide a comment to the Wall Street Journal, but Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, told the newspaper that Cohen is untrustworthy. \"If one thing has been established, it's that Michael Cohen is completely untrustworthy,\" the former New York City mayor said.",
    " Title: Pelosi Contemplates Delaying Transmission of Impeachment Articles to Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent days, some legal scholars have suggested that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi could delay transmitting the articles of impeachment to the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has declared he is coordinating trial strategy with the White House. This proposal, initially perceived as having little currency on Capitol Hill, has gained momentum as McConnell has continued to express his disinterest in serving as an impartial overseer of the Senate trial.\n\nDuring a news conference, Pelosi's remarks, barely audible above the clatter of camera shutters, were unexpected and prompted reporters to interrupt her, generating confusion about the next steps in the impeachment process. When asked if she would not transmit the articles, Pelosi responded, \"You\u2019re asking me, \u2018So are we all going to go out and play in the snow?\u2019 That has not been part of our conversations.\"\n\nFollowing the news conference, Pelosi huddled with top committee chairs leading Trump-focused investigations, and they emerged with a consistent message: The only story that matters is the president has been impeached. Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) stated, \"The only thing that matters is the president of the United States was impeached today.\" As for the Senate, she said, \"One step at a time.\"\n\nJudiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) added, \"We defended the Constitution and we defended our democracy.\" He further stated, \"Right now, that\u2019s the story.\"\n\nSome Democrats have suggested a delay in transmitting articles is under consideration due to the House leaders' decision to not name impeachment managers\u2014the set of lawmakers who would argue their case on the Senate floor\u2014until an undetermined later date. When President Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998, House leaders identified their impeachment managers the same day. However, Pelosi will be empowered to pick managers at her discretion and without a deadline.\n\nRep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) has approached every member of House leadership about the idea and received responses ranging from interest to outright support. Blumenauer stated that Pelosi, in particular, \"indicated she was interested and considering it.\" He argued that the House could use the delay to continue building on its evidence for impeachment and potentially to secure additional legal victories that could unlock troves of new evidence and witness testimony the Trump administration has withheld from Congress. Some of these court cases could be decided within weeks.\n\nIn his remarks to reporters, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer emphasized that early discussions about the timing of transmitting articles of impeachment to the Senate are \"not in the context\" of the proposal by constitutional lawyer Laurence Tribe. However, he acknowledged that colleagues keep raising the issue. \"People have read that article, discussed it. People have come up to me, discussed it,\" he said, adding, \"We will talk about it in some point in time. It\u2019s within the speaker\u2019s purview, obviously, she\u2019ll make that decision. And I also think she\u2019ll do it in discussions with McConnell and [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer.\"",
    " Title: Democrats Test Obamacare as Election Issue in New Hampshire\n\nArticle:\n\nBarack Obama and his Democratic allies in the U.S. Congress have grown more confident in recent months about their ability to use the president's signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as a draw rather than a liability in this November's midterm elections. Three races in New Hampshire illustrate the challenge, offering a test of whether Democrats can overcome voter skepticism about the ACA.\n\nThe ACA, aiming to expand health insurance coverage to millions more Americans, has come under sustained attack from Republicans. The president has urged Democrats campaigning in the Nov. 4 congressional elections not to run away from \"Obamacare,\" but instead to \"forcefully defend\" it. Obama has said that a surge in enrollment shows the system is running smoothly now, after its disastrous debut last October.\n\nNew Hampshire, which is closely divided between Democrats and Republicans, is one of about 10 states where Republicans hope to make gains in order to pick up six seats they need to put the Democratic-led Senate under their control. Senators Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana have been among the Democratic targets of anti-Obamacare ads by conservative groups such as Americans for Prosperity.\n\nRepublicans are counting on voter antipathy toward Obamacare to try to take charge of the Senate and expand their majority in the House of Representatives. However, Obamacare may now be working better, but national polls clearly show more people disapprove than approve of the law.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Shaheen and Representative Carol Shea-Porter, a fellow Democrat, were among the earliest advocates of the healthcare law. The state's other Democratic Representative, Ann Kuster, was elected after the law passed, but also backs it. Shaheen said in an interview she shared Obama's view that as Americans get to know Obamacare, they are embracing it. Shaheen said there was \"a lot of misinformation\" about the law. \"The reality is it's beginning to work for people,\" she said.\n\nHowever, a recent WMUR-Granite State poll reported that 51 percent of New Hampshire adults oppose Obamacare while just 37 percent support it. Sixty-one percent of the state's voters think medical costs will increase under the act. \"The perception is, 'it will hurt my family and costs will go up,'\" said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. \"In a political campaign, that is a big boulder to push uphill.\"\n\nSkeptics include people like Derek Gagnon, a 33-year-old auto mechanic who says he would not even consider voting for anyone who had backed the ACA. He has no health insurance, but he also says he has no intention of signing up for the private insurance offered through the government-run website, HealthCare.gov. \"I shouldn't be forced to do something like that in a free country,\" said Gagnon, referring to the law's requirement, known as the \"individual mandate,\" that almost all legal U.S. residents buy health insurance or pay a fine.\n\n\"I'll pay the fine this year and next year,\" Gagnon said at a frozen yogurt store outside New Hampshire's state capital, Concord. \"Maybe I won't have to pay it the third year, because by then Obama will be out of office.\"\n\nGagnon's distaste for the individual mandate dovetails with a principal line of conservative attacks nationally on the law. Obamacare is meant to extend subsidized health coverage to millions of uninsured Americans through new online private insurance markets and an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor. However, conservative critics portray it as a government intrusion in a major sector of the economy that will hurt job growth and erode freedoms.\n\nShaheen's leading Republican opponent in the Senate race, Scott Brown, is betting that theme will resonate in New Hampshire, where the state's famous motto is \"Live Free or Die.\" In April, Brown kicked off his candidacy with the declaration that New Hampshire could \"Live Free or Log On\" - a caustic reference to signing up online for Obamacare. Lately, he has been traveling the state on an \"Obamacare Is Not Working\" tour. Brown, a former senator from neighboring Massachusetts, says the act should be completely repealed, and the issue of healthcare reform should be left to the states.\n\nBrown has been rising in the polls against Shaheen. However, she was ahead 45 to 39 percent in a recent WMUR-Granite State poll. Dean Spiliotes, a New Hampshire political analyst, said Shaheen, a former New Hampshire governor, still had political capital in the state, and he doubted the healthcare issue alone could defeat her. \"People view her as not an ideologue. That has helped her with voters,\" said Spiliotes, a political science professor at Southern New Hampshire University. \"If Obamacare rises to the level of taking out Jeanne Shaheen, there is something larger going on.\"\n\nTo be sure, Obamacare faces unique challenges in New Hampshire. Just one insurance company in the small state offered insurance policies through the program this year, and the insurer does not cover healthcare in 10 of the state's 26 hospitals, deficits Shaheen and Shea-Porter have been working to fix. Spiliotes said New Hampshire Democrats are defending Obamacare \"but they are kind of doing it in fits and starts. It's not a uniform, rah-rah kind of support.\"\n\nIn one hopeful sign for Democrats, enrollment in Obamacare in the state of 1.3 million people has reached 40,000 - double the number that had been expected. Shea-Porter, a former social worker who came to Congress in 2006 campaigning on healthcare reform, said she would never run away from Obamacare because she considers the law to be a \"great joy and triumph.\" That said, she understands the political perils for Democrats of Obamacare. She lost her seat in Congress in 2010 elections after her vote for the law, only to be re-elected in 2012. Her 2014 race is considered a toss-up although her Republican opponent has yet to be chosen in a September primary.\n\nShea-Porter, who met last week with recent healthcare enrollees in Somersworth, said she is aware of the qualms some people have, including wariness of providing personal information on a government website. However, she said the best way to advertise Obamacare's benefits is to publicize the stories of people who signed up and discovered that \"nothing terrible happened.\"\n\nPatrice Glynn, a 54-year-old New Hampshire resident, is already convinced. Glynn, a diabetic, lived without health insurance for nine months after she lost her job and before she signed up on HealthCare.gov. \"If it was so bad, would 40,000 people be on it?\" she asked.",
    " Title: New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman Resigns Amid Allegations of Domestic Abuse\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump and a champion of the #MeToo movement, has resigned following allegations of physical and emotional abuse by four women. The New Yorker published an article on Monday detailing the women's claims, which include choking, threatening, and demeaning behavior.\n\nSchneiderman, who had built a high-profile reputation during the Trump era for his legal pushback and criticism of some of the President's agenda items, was hailed as an icon of the anti-Trump resistance and a key figure in the #MeToo movement. He had used his authority to take legal action against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and was outspoken in the push for a \"critical national reckoning\" about the harassment of women.\n\nHowever, the article revealed that Schneiderman had allegedly abused four women, including choking a former girlfriend, controlling what she ate, and leaving her \"emotionally battered.\" He also reportedly demanded that another girlfriend, who was born in Sri Lanka and whom Schneiderman referred to as his \"brown slave,\" call him \"Master.\"\n\nThe women came forward for a number of reasons, including the resignation of White House aide Rob Porter over claims he had abused his ex-wives. The women's \"anguish and anger grew\" as Schneiderman used his office to become a figurehead for the growing #MeToo movement.\n\n\"You can not be a champion of women when you are hitting them and choking them in bed, and saying to them, 'You're a f--king whore,'\" Michelle Manning Barish, one of the women speaking out, told the New Yorker. \"His hypocrisy is epic,\" she said. \"He's fooled so many people.\"\n\n\"This is a man who has staked his entire career, his personal narrative, on being a champion for women publicly. But he abuses them privately,\" Tanya Selvaratnam told the outlet. \"He needs to be called out.\"\n\nSchneiderman issued a statement denying the allegations, saying, \"In the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity. I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in nonconsensual sex, which is a line I would not cross.\"\n\nWithin three hours of the article being published, Schneiderman announced that he would step down as attorney general at the end of the day on Tuesday. The accusations brought a wave of condemnation from both the right and the left, with fellow New York Democrat Andrew Cuomo calling the pattern of facts and corroboration \"damning\" and calling for Schneiderman to resign.\n\nTrump allies, whom Schneiderman had targeted, made little attempt to hide their glee at their foe's sudden downfall. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway tweeted, \"Gotcha,\" referencing a tweet of Schneiderman's in which he said that \"no one is above the law.\" Donald Trump Jr. dug up past statements Schneiderman had made about the #MeToo movement, snarking, \"Self awareness level 0.\"\n\nIn a November interview with Full Frontal's Samantha Bee, Schneiderman laid out his achievements in the Trump era, including beating the President on several issues. Now, Samantha Bee's \"Full Frontal\" tweeted a screenshot of Schneiderman boasting on Twitter of the superhero mockups the TBS show had made for his November appearance.",
    " Title: Obamacare Repairs: A Loose Thread Unraveling the Healthcare System\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, is currently undergoing numerous proposed repairs, with the aim of allowing millions of Americans whose health insurance plans have been canceled under the Act to keep their plans and their doctors if they wish. However, these repairs could potentially cause more harm to the Obamacare system.\n\nAccording to an Associated Press survey, over 4.2 million Americans have received cancellation notices from their insurers. This group tends to be healthier than the uninsured, who are most likely to be attracted to Obamacare. If healthier individuals remain outside the Obamacare pool, it could lead to actuarial trouble, similar to removing a piston from an engine and expecting it to run smoothly.\n\nThe fear is that the Obamacare exchanges will attract a disproportionate share of higher-cost, sicker people, leading to higher premiums and a potential inability of the insurance system to sustain itself. Cori Uccello, senior health fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries, expressed this concern.\n\nInsurers argue that it's too late to reverse course and implement the change, as some state insurance commissioners believe bringing back canceled policies would violate new state laws that forbid \"substandard\" plans. California and New York are among the states in this group.\n\nA reversal could add to the confusion and lack of confidence already surrounding Obamacare. A crisis of confidence in the new health-care system could be debilitating, as noted by Larry Kocot, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who helped roll out Medicare Part D during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nThe repairs are being made due to the backlash from those affected by the cancellations and the low approval rating of President Obama, currently at 39%. The political impact of the cancellations has been described as a \"Category 5 political hurricane\" by Rep. Greg Walden (R) of Oregon.\n\nDemocrats, who \"own\" Obamacare as much as the president, are facing criticism and tough races in the 2014 midterm elections. In response, nearly 40 House Democrats have peeled from their caucus to support a bill that allows people to return to their old health plans. However, this bill faces opposition from the White House, as it allows new customers to sign on to canceled plans, potentially worsening the outlook for Obamacare's sustainability.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, such as Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, are working on their own legislation. The future of these repairs and their impact on Obamacare remains uncertain, but the rollout is producing problems beyond a broken website. Fixing them is like pulling on a loose thread, with things starting to unravel.",
    " Title: Google News Shows Strong Preference for Left-Leaning Perspectives, According to AllSides Report\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report from media technology group AllSides claims that Google News and Google News search results exhibit a strong preference for media outlets with a left-leaning perspective. The report, published on AllSides' website, analyzed Google News' homepage and search engine results over a two-week period from Aug. 23 to Sept. 5.\n\nAccording to the report, the overall bias of Google News during this timeframe was approximately 65 percent toward the left, 20 percent toward the center, and 16 percent to the right. This period coincided with President Donald Trump's tweets criticizing Google for allegedly biasing its search results against him.\n\nTrump tweeted on Aug. 28, 2018, \"Google search results for \u2018Trump News\u2019 shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media... Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good... This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!\"\n\nThe AllSides report found that not only did Google show a bias for the left, but it also gave left-leaning news greater prominence. On average, left-leaning news was almost always one of the top two results displayed. News from the center of the political spectrum was less visible but usually in the top five or six results, the report said.\n\nRight-leaning news, however, required users to scroll down the computer screen before they saw their first news article from the right. The report also found that when news from the left competed with news from other viewpoints, the left won just about every time.\n\nThe report did not suggest that Google intentionally favored media sources from the left, nor did it suggest the opposite. Instead, it demonstrated that the resulting choice of links provided by Google News showed a significant bias in favor of the left. The report attributed this bias to the political views of most news outlets and journalists, as well as the fact that online news consumers are younger and lean farther left than the average American.\n\nGoogle has previously denied setting a political agenda and stated that its goal is to provide the most relevant answers to users' queries in a matter of seconds. The company has not yet responded to the AllSides report.",
    " Title: Indonesia Raises Minimum Marriage Age for Girls to 19, Aims to End Child Marriage\n\nArticle:\n\nIndonesia, the eighth-highest country in terms of child brides globally, has taken a significant step towards ending child marriage by raising the minimum age at which girls can marry from 16 to 19. This change was prompted by a ruling from the Constitutional Court in December, which deemed it discriminatory to mandate a lower minimum age of marriage for girls than for boys.\n\nWhile this development is positive, it is important to note that Indonesia is not the worst offender in this regard. According to UNICEF, 14% of Indonesian women marry before they reach 18 years old. In comparison, 59% of women in Bangladesh and 76% in Niger marry before their eighteenth birthday. Nineteen of the 20 countries where child marriage is most prevalent are in Africa, as shown in the map provided.\n\nFamilies often marry off their daughters at a young age in an attempt to secure their lives and provide stability. Factors associated with this practice include rigid gender norms, conflict, and poverty. Education is a crucial factor in this context. A study by the World Bank involving 15 countries found that girls without secondary education are three times more likely to be married by age 18 than those with secondary education. In many cultures, education for girls takes a backseat to marriage and its associated duties.\n\nCutting a childhood short can have severe consequences. Girls who marry have an increased risk of sexual violence, poorer health, and higher school drop-out rates. They are also less likely to participate in the labor force, which has significant economic costs. A paper published in 2015 found that child marriage cost Indonesia's economy 1.7% of its GDP in 2014. The global welfare benefit of ending the practice is estimated to be around $22 billion.\n\nIndonesia's new policy is a significant step towards ending child marriage. However, in the context of controversial new revisions to the country's criminal code, which would criminalize extra-marital sex and endorse chauvinistic local by-laws, lawmakers will have to demonstrate that the new marriage age for girls is more than a token gesture towards gender equality. Indonesia's parliament could resolve to tackle the social and economic forces that make child marriage so common. Ensuring that girls complete their 12 years of compulsory schooling would be a start. Reducing unintended pregnancies by improving access to contraception and sexual-health education would also help. Giving girls more control over their bodies would allow them to exercise more sway over their future, including who they marry. That is worth saying yes to.",
    " Title: U.S. Marshals Prepared to Guard National Monuments Amid Ongoing George Floyd Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has directed the U.S. Marshals Service to be on standby and ready to protect national monuments across the United States from potential destruction. In an email, Marshals Service Assistant Director Andrew C. Smith stated that the agency has been asked to immediately prepare to provide federal law enforcement support to safeguard national monuments throughout the country. The subject line of the message indicates it is an \"Attorney General Assignment,\" suggesting it originated from Attorney General William P. Barr.\n\nSmith also wrote, \"This is a challenging assignment due to the breadth of possible targets for criminal activity.\" According to CNN, the marshals are being mobilized as part of a \"major effort\" by the administration to bolster security around national monuments, and they are expected to begin their work before the end of the week.\n\nThe Daily Wire reported that unarmed National Guard troops will also be deployed to monuments in and around Washington, D.C., to assist the U.S. Park Police in protecting the monuments in the nation's capital. The security reinforcements were prompted after weeks of statues being toppled nationwide. Initially, rioters primarily targeted Confederate monuments, but in recent days, tributes to the founding fathers and even abolitionists have been destroyed.\n\nPresident Trump warned on Tuesday that those found damaging federal property such as monuments would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. He tweeted, \"I have authorized the Federal Government to arrest anyone who vandalizes or destroys any monument, statue or other such Federal property in the U.S. with up to 10 years in prison, per the Veteran's Memorial Preservation Act, or such other laws that may be pertinent.\" He added, \"This action is taken effective immediately, but may also be used retroactively for destruction or vandalism already caused. There will be no exceptions!\"\n\nThe president addressed the issue again on Wednesday night, tweeting:\n\n\"Very sad to see States allowing roving gangs of wise guys, anarchists & looters, many of them having no idea what they are doing, indiscriminately ripping down our statues and monuments to the past. Some are great works of art, but all represent our History & Heritage, both the good and the bad. It is important for us to understand and remember, even in turbulent and difficult times, and learn from them. Knowledge comes from the most unusual of places!\"",
    " Title: NSA's X-KEYSCORE Program Provides Wide-Ranging Access to Foreign Internet Data\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest disclosure from the Snowden files reveals the existence of an NSA program called X-KEYSCORE, which offers access to a vast amount of internet data, primarily foreign signals intelligence. The quantity of communications accessible through X-KEYSCORE is immense, with one document stating that the NSA receives up to 20+ terabytes of data per day, which can only be stored for as little as 24 hours.\n\nX-KEYSCORE appears to provide access to various types of communications, such as phone conversations, emails, chats, and more. An NSA tool called DNI Presenter, used to read the content of stored emails, also enables analysts to read the content of Facebook chats or private messages. Analysts can monitor Facebook chats by entering the Facebook user name and a date range into a simple search screen. They can search for internet browsing activities using a wide range of information, including search terms entered by the user or the websites viewed.\n\nThe X-KEYSCORE program also allows an analyst to learn the IP addresses of every person who visits any website the analyst specifies. However, it is unclear whether this includes U.S. persons or only foreign nationals. Under U.S. law, the NSA is required to obtain an individualized FISA warrant if the target of their surveillance is a 'U.S. person,' though no such warrant is required for intercepting the communications of Americans with foreign targets. X-KEYSCORE reportedly provides the technological capability, if not the legal authority, to target even U.S. persons for extensive electronic surveillance without a warrant, provided that some identifying information, such as their email or IP address, is known to the analyst.\n\nThe NSA documents assert that by 2008, 300 terrorists had been captured using intelligence from X-KEYSCORE. However, it is unclear whether this surveillance program is a real-time surveillance tool or merely a database search tool. X-KEYSCORE provides access to tremendous volumes of foreign communications, which can then be searched by NSA analysts.\n\nThere are known \"compliance problems\" with NSA's surveillance programs, as communications by U.S. persons end up in this database if the other end of the conversation is overseas\u2014and these communications can therefore end up on an analyst's desktop. The NSA's minimization procedures are supposed to prevent such \"inadvertent\" targeting of U.S. persons, but there are reportedly plenty of exceptions to this rule.\n\nIt is essential to note that this article aims to provide an unbiased, factual, and informative account of the NSA's X-KEYSCORE program based on the provided text.

    " Title: Republican Health Care Bill Faces Uncertain Future in House\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House and congressional Republicans are facing a potential lack of votes to pass their health care bill, with several Republicans voicing opposition to the current measure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). As of Monday, CNN's whip count shows 21 Republicans opposed to the bill, with at least 17 lawmakers still undecided. No vote has been scheduled, and it is unclear if there will be one before the House recesses for a week-long break on Friday.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who has been working with congressional leaders on the health care effort, is meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to lobby for support. President Donald Trump, who had previously expressed optimism about the bill's passage, has suggested that the measure may still be changed.\n\nThe Republican Party can only afford to lose 22 votes, assuming all Republicans attend the vote and no Democrats cross party lines. Notably, Rep. Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, announced his opposition to the legislation on Monday. Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Daniel Webster of Florida, and Chris Smith of New Jersey have also announced their opposition.\n\nAs the Republican congressional leaders work to secure enough votes, some members remain undecided, including Reps. Kevin Yoder, David Valadao, Erik Paulson, Elise Stefanik, and Adam Kinzinger. The hope is that leadership can sell moderates on the fact that the bill will be sent to the Senate, where it may be significantly reworked.\n\nThe fight over how pre-existing conditions are covered is at the center of the debate. Trump has stated that the GOP plan \"guarantees\" coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions, but under the GOP bill, insurers could charge them higher rates if they allow their coverage to lapse.\n\nPressure from the White House to deliver a legislative win for Trump is real, and the repeated pledges to their constituents over the past seven years to repeal and replace Obamacare if given the chance are still a factor in the current debate. However, the process has left some moderates frustrated, with some seeing their party making the same mistakes Republicans criticized Democrats for making in 2010.",
    " Title: High School Students Protest Alleged Lack of Action Against Bullying in Oklahoma\n\nArticle:\n\nHundreds of students from Norman High School in Oklahoma walked out of their school on Monday to protest the school's response to alleged bullying of three classmates who claim they were raped by the same person. The students were supported by parents and members of the community outside the school, according to Sophia Babb, a junior at the school who spoke to CNN.\n\nThe students' message was clear: \"No justice, no class\" and \"No more bullying.\" The protest was sparked by allegations from three female students who say they were mercilessly bullied after being raped in separate instances by the same person. The students and their families claim school administrators failed to take adequate action after they reported the rapes and bullying.\n\nThe story gained traction on social media after Jezebel published a detailed account on Friday. No arrests or charges have been made yet, Norman Police Department Captain Tom Easley told CNN. An investigation began a month ago, and no details will be released until it concludes. A Norman High School spokesperson had not returned CNN's request for comment by publication time.\n\nIn a letter to the school community, Norman Public Schools Superintendent Joe Siano encouraged parents to discuss alternatives to the walkout, such as wearing stickers and ribbons provided by the school \"in symbolic support.\" He also announced the school was expanding a task force to study the implementation of a \"targeted, research-based sexual assault curriculum for students.\" The school will continue to respond quickly to reports of sexual assault and bullying, according to Siano.\n\nThe three teens told Jezebel that they stopped attending classes and left school voluntarily after the teasing became unbearable. Friends of the teens started a Facebook page, YES ALL Daughters, two weeks ago to show support for them. The page drew nearly 10,000 likes in two weeks. With the help of their mothers and relatives, they organized Monday's protest.\n\n\"After hearing the story, we felt compelled to help the kids do something,\" said Stacie Wright, whose niece started the Facebook page.\n\nThe group posted a list of \"Protest Do's and Don'ts\" on its Facebook page to ensure a peaceful event. The list included guidelines such as \"Be Peaceful, Law-Abiding Citizens that do not disturb local businesses\" and \"Do Not Respond to any negativity.\"\n\nThe Daily Oklahoman reported the crowd of protesters on Monday was in the hundreds. However, organizers estimated that 1,500 attended the protest outside the school, which has an enrollment of about 1,800 students.\n\n\"It shows that students won't put up with this harassment and bullying,\" Babb said. \"We stand in solidarity with all victims and we want to show that we support them.\"",
    " Title: Ryan's Speech at the Republican National Convention: Analysis of Content and Delivery\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan delivered a speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa on Wednesday that received applause from the audience. The speech was critically analyzed for its content, with mixed reviews on its delivery and clarity.\n\nRyan, in his speech, critically assessed the Obama administration's economic policies, particularly the Obama Economy and Obamacare. He also addressed the common Democratic attacks on Medicare reform, often referred to as \"Mediscare.\" However, the economic growth solutions presented in the speech were reportedly unclear, with some stating that Ryan's use of the term \"tax fairness\" was surprising, as it is a term frequently used by President Obama and other liberal Democrats.\n\nThe speech did not mention specific tax cut proposals, such as the 20% across-the-board supply-side reduction in marginal tax rates or the 25% corporate tax rate reduction, which have been proposed by Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate. Instead, the speech focused on the issue of debt to an extent that some found it disconnected from the concerns of the unemployed or underemployed.\n\nCritics argue that when Republicans focus on debt and deficits, they often lose elections, while running on growth, limited government, lower spending, lower tax rates, and deregulation tends to result in victories. The growth issue, according to some, was not clearly addressed in Ryan's speech, leading to confusion.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that the specifics of Mitt Romney's growth policies will likely be clarified during his speech on Thursday night. The author expresses a desire for clearer emphasis on economic growth in the Republican platform.",
    " Title: Narendra Modi: From Humble Beginnings to India's Likely Prime Minister\n\nArticle:\n\nNarendra Modi, the current Chief Minister of Gujarat, is poised to become India's next Prime Minister following the conclusion of the country's parliamentary elections on Friday. Modi, who has been praised for the strong economic growth in Gujarat, has been a controversial figure due to religious riots that occurred in 2002 during his tenure as Chief Minister.\n\nModi, the son of a tea vendor, rose through the ranks of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist organization, and is closely allied with the group. He is married but did not acknowledge his wife's existence until April, when he filed his nomination papers.\n\nModi has been Chief Minister of Gujarat for 13 years and during his tenure, he made it one of India's best-performing states economically. He is known for his self-discipline, austerity, and decisiveness. According to NPR's Julie McCarthy, Modi is seen by many as a \"pro-business go-getter.\"\n\nGujarat's economy has nearly tripled in size under Modi's stewardship, and he has a reputation for rooting out corruption, stimulating investment, and slashing through bureaucratic red tape and outdated regulations. Gujarat is one of the few places in India where there is an uninterrupted electricity and water supply, and its roads are the envy of Indians from other states.\n\nHowever, not everyone has benefited from the state's economic progress. Half of all children younger than 5 suffer from malnutrition, and two-thirds of rural households lack toilets. Additionally, Gujarat's entrepreneurial tradition long predates Modi, but as one businessman told Julie, Modi made the government machinery accountable.\n\nThe biggest reservation many Indians have about Modi is the massive anti-Muslim violence that broke out under his watch in 2002. Hundreds of Muslims were killed in violence that followed the burning of a train compartment carrying Hindu pilgrims; 59 of those pilgrims died. Some of Modi's close aides were found guilty of taking part in the violence that ensued.\n\nModi has never publicly addressed the violence until late last year, when he published a long blog post saying the violence shook him deeply. However, his comments fell short of an apology sought by many victims of the riots. Those riots still make many Muslims and other minorities wary of Modi.\n\nThe Indian government's own data show urban Muslims in Gujarat are worse off than Muslims in the rest of the country. However, government figures also show that Gujarat is one of the top states in the country for Muslim employment.\n\nModi is also criticized as vindictive and abrasive, and he is capable of holding grudges for years and intolerant of dissent. According to Reuters, \"Modi displays all the signs of becoming an Indian Putin.\"\n\nFollowing the 2002 Gujarat riots, Modi was denied a visa to travel to the U.S. However, it's nearly certain he would be granted one if he becomes prime minister and applies for a visa. Indeed, Modi met with the U.S. envoy to India in February and has also met with European officials. If Modi becomes prime minister of the world's largest democracy, he would not be isolated in the West or the international community.",
    " Title: Hurricane Sandy Affects Presidential Campaign Schedules as East Coast Braces for Storm\n\nArticle:\n\nThe eastern third of the United States is bracing for the impact of Hurricane Sandy, with a 42 percent chance of experiencing tropical storm-force winds in the coming days. The storm has disrupted the campaign schedules of both President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.\n\nPresident Obama has canceled campaign events in Northern Virginia on Monday and in Colorado Springs, Colo., on Tuesday, according to a statement by press secretary Jay Carney late Saturday evening. Obama will continue to receive regular briefings on the storm and expects his team to continue preparations as state and local partners do the same.\n\nMitt Romney has canceled all events scheduled for Virginia on Sunday and has decided to campaign in Ohio on Monday morning instead.\n\nHurricane Sandy currently sits off the coast of Florida, with tropical storm watches and warnings in effect in the Carolinas. Federal officials warn that the East Coast from South Carolina on up should prepare for heavy rains and winds, and inland areas could see up to 2 feet or more of snow. Tropical storm conditions off the coast of North Carolina are expected to soon move northward. The National Hurricane Center projects landfall around Delaware and New Jersey sometime late Monday or early Tuesday.\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate emphasized that the storm will affect a large geographic area and not just coastal areas. He warned of potential flooding in the Ohio Valley and Appalachian regions. FEMA and other federal partners are already sending teams and resources into potentially impacted areas to support state and local preparedness efforts.\n\nVice President Joe Biden is set to appear in Ohio on Tuesday, and additional changes to Obama's schedule may be announced. Obama will leave Washington for Florida on Sunday afternoon before the brunt of the storm hits the D.C. metro area, and he will hold an event in Youngstown, Ohio, before returning to Washington to monitor the storm.\n\nBoth White House and campaign officials downplayed the storm's potential effect on turnout in swing states as well as the optics of campaigning during a looming disaster.",
    " Title: US President Trump Cancels Planned Veterans Day Parade in Washington DC Over High Costs\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has announced the cancellation of a planned Veterans Day military parade in Washington D.C. due to the high costs associated with staging the event. The estimated cost of the parade was reported to be around $90 million (\u00a371m), more than three times the original estimate.\n\nIn a tweet, Mr. Trump stated that local politicians had requested a \"ridiculously high\" figure for the parade. He added that he might organize an event in Washington D.C. next year and will instead attend parades in France and at Maryland's Andrews Air Force Base.\n\nThe Washington parade was initially scheduled for November 11, the centenary of the end of World War One. Paris will hold its long-planned parade on the same day, while the event at the Maryland air force base is scheduled for a \"different date,\" according to the president.\n\nThe budget director had initially estimated costs of between $10 million and $30 million when the White House announced its request in February. However, a U.S. official later provided a new estimate of $92 million.\n\nInitially, the plan was to avoid using tanks to prevent damage to the roads of the nation's capital. The District of Columbia Council, Washington's legislative body, was critical of the plan when it was announced, voicing displeasure on Twitter.\n\nMembers of the Democratic party were similarly sceptical, with congressman Jim McGovern declaring it \"an absurd waste of money\" on Twitter and saying Mr. Trump \"acts more like a dictator than a president.\"\n\nThe Pentagon had stated that the military would march from the White House to the Capitol, and the parade would feature a \"heavy air component at the end.\" The focus was set to be the work of U.S. military veterans through the ages, starting with the American revolution.\n\nIt is worth noting that Donald Trump cancelled planned military exercises with South Korea in June after his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, citing the need to \"save a fortune.\" The U.S. had a military parade in 1991 following the end of its successful campaign to force Saddam Hussein's troops out of Kuwait.\n\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser responded to the cancellation, emulating the president's Twitter tone. A Pentagon spokesperson, Col Rob Manning, said in a statement that the Department of Defense and the White House \"have now agreed to explore opportunities in 2019.\"",
    " Title: House Passes GOP-Authored Bill to Repeal Unpopular Obamacare Provisions, Faces Uncertain Future in Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill, known as the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, which aims to repeal unpopular provisions of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The bill, which defunds Planned Parenthood for one year, was passed with a vote of 240-189. However, the bill's future in the Senate is uncertain, as vocal conservatives have expressed concerns that the bill does not go far enough in repealing Obamacare.\n\nThe bill, if enacted, would repeal Obamacare's insurance mandates on individuals and employers, as well as taxes on medical device sales and the \"Cadillac tax\" on generous health plans. The bill was passed using the budget reconciliation process, which allows it to bypass a filibuster in the Senate and be passed with a simple majority.\n\nPresident Obama can still veto the bill, but Republican leaders are hoping to demonstrate their ability to dismantle Obamacare with a simple Senate majority and a GOP president in 2017. Majority Whip Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, stated, \"Let's get this bill to the president's desk and let him make a decision. Is he going to finally stand up for American workers and sign this bill? Or is he going to continue to support a law that's destroying jobs and destroying health care in this country?\"\n\nDemocrats criticized the bill, with Rep. Louise Slaughter, a New York Democrat, stating, \"I don't know why the American public is not outraged over the fact that none of their business is taken care of, but over and over and over again we talk about taking health care away from people.\"\n\nThe bill's path through the Senate will be challenging, as it must win the approval of the chamber's parliamentarian, who will rule on which provisions meet reconciliation's arcane rules. A provision that would repeal Obamacare's Medicare spending board was already removed from the bill due to the parliamentarian's likely ruling that it would be out of order.\n\nA trio of Senate Republicans, including two 2016 presidential hopefuls, have stated that the legislation \"simply isn't good enough\" and does not fulfill repeated promises to repeal the entire law. The bill passed with the support of Republican votes, with only seven GOP members rejecting it and one Democrat, Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota, voting \"yes,\" though he has been opposed to Obamacare in the past.\n\nThe bill's passage comes as House Speaker John A. Boehner is set to be replaced by Rep. Paul Ryan, who won the support of the House's three main factions and swayed a majority of the House Freedom Caucus, a coalition of hard-line conservatives who pushed Mr. Boehner out of office. Mr. Ryan is putting himself at odds with the Heritage Foundation on the reconciliation bill, and Friday's vote appeared to split the Freedom Caucus itself.",
    " Title: DHS Ammunition Purchases Under Scrutiny: Republican Lawmakers Question Department's Bullet Buys\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a hearing on Thursday, Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah questioned the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over its ammunition purchases, stating that the department is using roughly 1,000 rounds of ammunition more per person than the U.S. Army. Chaffetz, who chairs one of the House oversight subcommittees, noted that the DHS currently has more than 260 million rounds in stock, with over 103 million rounds purchased in 2012 and 116 million used the same year, among approximately 70,000 agents.\n\nComparing these figures with the small-arms purchases procured by the U.S. Army, Chaffetz noted that the DHS is churning through between 1,300 and 1,600 rounds per officer, while the U.S. Army goes through roughly 350 rounds per soldier. Nick Nayak, the chief procurement officer for the Department of Homeland Security, did not challenge Chaffetz's numbers but sought to counter what he described as several misconceptions about the bullet buys.\n\nDespite reports that the department was trying to buy up to 1.6 billion rounds over five years, Nayak clarified that the number is closer to 750 million. He also stated that the department, on average, buys roughly 100 million rounds per year. Nayak further countered claims that the department is stockpiling ammo, stating that such claims are \"simply not true.\" He also denied that the purchases are contributing to broader ammunition shortages in the U.S.\n\nWhile Democrats likened concerns about the purchases to conspiracy theories, Republicans raised concerns about the sheer cost of the ammunition. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, stated, \"This is not about conspiracy theories, this is about good government.\" Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., who chairs the full Oversight and Government Reform Committee, suggested that rounds may be being stockpiled, then either \"disposed of,\" passed to non-federal agencies, or shot \"indiscriminately.\" If that is the case, he said, \"then shame on you.\" The department has long stated that it needs the bullets for agents in training and on duty, and buys in bulk to save money.",
    " Title: Romney Accuses Obama Administration of Misunderstanding Threat of Radical Islam, Sharpens Attack on Libya and Egypt Incidents\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, is set to deliver a major foreign-policy speech at the Virginia Military Institute on Monday, where he will accuse the Obama administration of fundamentally misunderstanding the threat of radical Islam. The speech, which was delayed for nearly a month, will also sharpen Romney's attack on the way President Obama handled the assault on American diplomatic posts in Egypt and Libya.\n\nAccording to excerpts, Romney will say that President Obama's initial reaction was to blame an Internet video mocking Islam, and only belatedly to acknowledge \"the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others.\"\n\nRomney will argue that Obama's response to the attacks is emblematic of his overall approach to foreign affairs, which Romney said he will change by asserting more American influence. He will propose using foreign aid to pressure Egypt to protect democracy, building the Syrian opposition, and restarting negotiations toward a two-state solution for the Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nThe Obama campaign has criticized Romney's foreign policy credentials, stating that he has not demonstrated his ability to handle foreign policy. Jen Psaki, an Obama campaign spokeswoman, said, \"We're not going to be lectured by someone who has been an unmitigated disaster on foreign policy every time he's dipped his toe in the foreign policy waters.\"\n\nThe economy has dominated the presidential race, but Iran's nuclear program and the September 11 attacks on the American Embassy in Cairo and the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, have thrust foreign affairs into the headlines. The Obama administration initially said the attacks were sparked by a video mocking the Prophet Muhammad, but have since acknowledged that the attack in Benghazi was orchestrated by terrorist elements linked to al Qaeda.\n\nThe Romney campaign has not specified how his foreign policy would differ from Obama's, and this question has been a point of contention throughout the campaign. Romney's advisers, however, have stated that he starts from a completely different philosophy that begins with the belief that the fight against terrorism cannot be conducted surgically.\n\nRomney chose VMI, in Lexington, Va., to deliver the speech because it was the alma mater of George C. Marshall, who, as secretary of state and secretary of defense, helped craft the foreign policy that guided Republicans and Democrats after World War II. The presidential race has seen a series of ups and downs over the past week, with Romney's strong debate performance and the release of unemployment numbers benefiting Obama, while the Obama campaign announced they collected $181 million in donations in September. The campaigns have exchanged rhetorical blows over their contrasting economic messages, with both sides airing television ads criticizing each other's tax plans.",
    " Title: Trump's Embrace of American Health Care Act: A Betrayal of Promises Made to the American People\n\nArticle:\n\nDonald Trump's endorsement of the American Health Care Act, authored by Paul Ryan and other House Republicans in collaboration with establishment-minded members of his administration, represents a significant departure from his clear and repeated promises to the American people.\n\nWhile it was likely that Trump would break some of his promises, the extent of his shift towards more centrist positions on health care and retirement security is a crucial aspect that cannot be overlooked. Trump ran and won on a platform that included promises to cover everyone, avoid Medicaid cuts, and boost funding for opioid abuse treatment. However, the American Health Care Act, which he is now lobbying Congress to pass, does none of those things.\n\nIn May 2015, Trump told the conservative Daily Signal, \"I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.\" He reiterated these promises throughout his campaign, stating, \"I am going to take care of everybody\" and \"Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.\"\n\nThe centerpiece of the Trump-endorsed American Health Care Act is a $600 billion tax cut. While families with incomes below $208,500 per year will see their taxes fall by an average of $0 per year, receiving none of that money, members of the top 0.1 percent of the income distribution\u2014households with an annual income of more than $3.75 million\u2014will see their taxes fall by an average of $165,090 per year.\n\nThe American Health Care Act's tax cuts come at a cost, with an estimated 6 to 15 million people losing insurance, according to various analyses. The administration's current strategy is to deny these projections and claim that nobody will lose coverage. However, this is contradicted by the bill's requirement for offsetting long-term spending cuts to enact the tax cuts under budget reconciliation rules.\n\nThe bill shifts $370 billion in Medicaid costs onto state governments, some of which will likely respond by throwing people off the program. The American Health Care Act also drastically reduces federal subsidies to help people pay for insurance, meaning many people will drop out.\n\nWhile the American Health Care Act specifically advantages and disadvantages certain groups of people relative to the ACA, it will particularly harm older Americans and residents of rural areas where the cost of health insurance is inherently higher due to reduced competition.\n\nTrump's betrayal of his health care promises is not only a departure from his campaign promises but also a specific harm to the people who voted for him the most. As Nate Cohn writes for the New York Times, Trump will be specifically harming his own voter base. It remains to be seen whether Trump voters will care about this, but it is unlikely that Trump made these promises without considering their popularity.",
    " Title: Trump's Hydroxychloroquine Use and Pelosi's Comment Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump's admission on Monday that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine, a drug he has long advocated for in the fight against COVID-19, has sparked a flurry of questions and controversy. Some speculate whether Trump was lying about his use of the drug, while others question the medical reasoning behind its prescription. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cautioned against using hydroxychloroquine outside of hospitals, and the drug has been linked to deaths.\n\nThe news did not seem to alarm Trump's supporters, but a comment from Speaker Nancy Pelosi did. In an interview with CNN on Monday night, Pelosi expressed concern about the president's use of the drug, particularly given his age and weight. \"He's our president, and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group\u2014morbidly obese,\" Pelosi said.\n\nThe reaction to Pelosi's comment, regardless of political affiliation, was varied. Some found the comment humorous, while others took offense at what they perceived as a \"fat-shaming\" of the president. Trump supporters, in particular, took umbrage at Pelosi's comment, with some accusing her of \"fat-shaming\" and violating the rules of body positivity.\n\nHowever, Pelosi's comment was not the first time the president has been criticized for his comments about weight and appearance. Throughout his public career, Trump has been accused of making derogatory and insensitive comments about women, immigrants, the media, and people with disabilities.\n\nSome Trump supporters, emboldened by Pelosi's comment, took the opportunity to make their own fat-shaming remarks about others, including public figures such as Lizzo, Stacey Abrams, and unnamed individuals.\n\nThe earnestness with which these comments were made suggests that they were not intended as jokes. In response, S.E. Cupp, the host of \"S.E. Cupp Unfiltered\" on CNN, tweeted, \"The president has referred to women over the course of his public career as 'dogs,' 'pigs,' 'fat,' 'ugly,''slobs,' 'lowlifes,' and 'horseface'; he has bragged about grabbing women by the genitals, and has been accused by no fewer than 25 women of sexual misconduct.\"\n\nCupp's tweet sparked a debate about the rules of decency and the hypocrisy of those who are offended by Pelosi's comment but remain silent or even support the president's own history of offensive remarks. The debate continues as to whether Pelosi's comment was inappropriate or a valid concern for the president's health.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Face Challenges in Delivering on Obamacare Premium Reduction Promises\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Republicans are grappling with finding ways to reduce health insurance premiums as part of their efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The options for reducing premiums are limited, with the primary methods being offering larger subsidies, allowing insurers to offer skimpier coverage, or permitting insurers to charge more to those with pre-existing conditions and older individuals.\n\nRepublicans argue that Obamacare's insurance regulations are responsible for making coverage expensive, and premiums would decrease if these rules are rolled back. However, they have yet to develop a comprehensive plan to achieve this goal while preserving consumer protections.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) expressed concern that reducing premiums could come at the expense of those with pre-existing conditions or by significantly reducing benefits. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) acknowledged the complexity of reducing premiums but emphasized the importance of making health care affordable for families.\n\nAnalysts suggest that Republicans may achieve their goal for younger, healthier consumers, but at the cost of eliminating popular consumer protections like the ban on insurers charging more for coverage to those with pre-existing conditions. This could leave millions of people unable to afford the increased premiums associated with conditions such as heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or cancer.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office's report on the House repeal plan has made the Senate Republicans' task more difficult. The analysis concluded that allowing states to opt out of Obamacare's pre-existing condition requirement would destabilize markets and in some cases, drive premiums upward for older, sicker people.\n\nSome Republicans, such as Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), advocate for preserving the pre-existing condition policy, while others, like Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), argue that Obamacare's pre-existing condition policy is the \"biggest reason\" premiums have increased.\n\nRepublicans have proposed allowing insurers to sell more basic policies without certain benefits, such as maternity coverage, mental health, or prescription drug benefits. However, they may face challenges in implementing these changes due to the complex rules governing the fast-track process being used to avoid a Democratic filibuster.\n\nSome Republicans also support allowing insurers to charge older people higher premiums, although Republican leaders appear to have been deterred by the backlash faced by House Republicans when they raised the idea. Ultimately, the GOP drive to reduce premiums could result in an increase in the number of uninsured Americans.\n\nPremiums vary across the country but have generally been on the rise. This year, benchmark Obamacare policies in 17 major cities rose an average of 9 percent, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. That's up from 2 percent in 2016.\n\nLawmakers can influence market conditions to make premiums fall, but they do not control how insurers set rates. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), a former insurance executive, emphasized the need to recognize how to bring actual costs down and transfer them to the insurance industry.\n\nUltimately, the success of the GOP's efforts to reduce premiums will be judged by the extent to which they achieve this goal. When asked about the possibility of achieving this goal, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the Senate's No. 3 Republican, responded, \"That is the goal.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Delivers Expletive-Laden Speech at CPAC, Accuses Mueller's Team and Clinton Aide\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a two-hour speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Saturday, President Donald Trump accused FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team of attempting to \"take him out with 'bullshit'\" and criticized a top Clinton aide for not having \"recovered from getting his a-- kicked.\"\n\nTrump, in his speech, alleged that his opponents were moving away from the narrative of Russian collusion as Mueller prepares to file his report on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He stated that the report was being produced \"by people who weren't elected.\"\n\nThe President also commented on the recently revealed book proposal by his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, stating, \"Cohen's newly revealed book proposal blows up his testimony: Totally discredited!\"\n\nTrump's remarks come just days after Cohen testified to a House committee, where he partially refuted some of the claims surrounding theories about the Trump campaign's alleged collusion with Moscow, including denying that he traveled to Prague in 2016 and saying he has no knowledge of any compromising material Russia may have on Trump.\n\nIn his speech, Trump pointed to alleged hypocrisy from Democrats who, he said, wanted to fire former FBI Director James Comey, only to change their tune when Trump fired him in 2017. He singled out Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and former Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta.\n\n\"Podesta, I believe that day, because he still hasn't gotten over getting his a-- kicked, I believe that day called for his resignation,\" he said. \"Podesta, the great genius of campaigns.\"\n\nHe went on to say he told First Lady Melania Trump that the move would be popular.\n\n\"And I fire a bad cop, I fire a dirty cop, and all of a sudden the Democrats say 'How dare he fire him? How dare he do this?'\" he said. \"That's where we are. In this swamp of Washington, D.C., but you know what? We are winning, and they're not.\"\n\nThe President's speech also touched on various other topics, including media bias, his \"Never Trump\" opponents within the GOP, and Democratic policies like the Green New Deal. He jokingly encouraged the Green New Deal, apparently sensing that the policy may be unpopular and lead to his re-election.\n\nHe also used anecdotes to promote his policies at home and abroad, particularly pulling back troops from the Middle East. He spoke at length about a Christmas visit to Iraq, where he was told to kill the lights on Air Force One as it came into land.\n\n\"We spent $7 trillion, and we can't land a plane with the lights on,\" he said.\n\nAs Trump spoke, the crowd appeared to be highly engaged, with audience members standing on chairs and craning their necks to get a glimpse as the Rolling Stones' \"Time Is On My Side\" blared through the speakers, indicating the president's imminent arrival.",
    " Title: Former NSA Officials Express Confusion Over Nunes' Claims of Surveillance on Trump Transition Team\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of former top National Security Agency (NSA) officials gathered on Friday prior to an academic conference in Washington, discussing the ongoing investigation by the House Intelligence Committee into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The conversation centered around Representative Devin Nunes (R-CA), the committee's chairman, and his recent claims that President Trump's transition team had been subject to surveillance by U.S. intelligence.\n\nThe Nunes-led panel has been investigating Russian interference in the election, and his claims, made public this week, have caused a stir, as there has been a consistent lack of evidence to support President Trump's allegation that he was wiretapped by his predecessor, President Barack Obama. The former NSA leaders found Nunes' claims vague and inconsistent, and they were unsure about the type of surveillance he was referring to.\n\nJames A. Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and former State Department official, witnessed the discussion and stated, \"They were scratching their heads trying to figure out what was going on.\"\n\nThe confusion surrounding Nunes' actions has raised concerns about the credibility of the Intelligence Committee's investigation, with Democrats questioning his motives. Critics have called for an independent commission or select committee to take over the Russia investigation. Nunes, however, maintains that he is fulfilling his responsibilities as intelligence panel chief.\n\nNunes' dispute began on Wednesday when he held a press conference to announce that a source had revealed \"dozens of reports\" showing that unnamed U.S. intelligence agencies had collected information about Trump or members of his transition team as part of their \"normal foreign surveillance.\" This collection was legal, said Nunes, and it was not confirmation that Trump's tweets claiming he was wiretapped by Mr. Obama were true.\n\nSince then, Nunes has walked back some of his original implications. He does not have the documents in question in his possession, though he has requested them from the NSA. He is unsure whether Trump officials were part of the conversations collected by U.S. intelligence, or whether their names were simply mentioned by two foreign persons under U.S. surveillance.\n\nOn Friday, Nunes declined to say how many Trump-related names had been \"unmasked\" in the documents he is discussing. \"I don't know that yet,\" he said, stating that he was waiting for the NSA to provide copies of the documents for his full perusal.\n\nPresumably, the Intelligence Committee chairman is referring to reports or other summaries of emails or phone conversations obtained by the NSA under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). This law allows the NSA to listen in on foreign targets. If the foreign target happens to contact a U.S. citizen, the NSA can still spy on the communications. That's called \"incidental collection.\" However, the agency must mask the name of the American. The name can be unmasked for compelling intelligence reasons.\n\nThe specific details of who was being surveilled and why remain unclear. James Lewis of CSIS notes, \"What we don't know is who was talking to whom. It could have been a Russian under surveillance talking to an American \u2013 Ambassador Sergey Kislyak talking to former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, for instance. Or it could have been foreigners simply talking about an American.\"\n\nThe reasons for unmasking the names would also remain a question. Perhaps they were integral to the intelligence value of the conversation, as it would be indicative if someone were speaking of an important Trump associate. On Friday, Nunes said he could not figure out why the names he's seen were not hidden, but he added that all of it appeared to be \"legal surveillance\" as well as \"valuable intelligence.\"\n\nWithout more details, it's unclear whether Nunes has uncovered a situation that's troubling or not. However, by raising the charge, he's increased the political temperature of his own panel's work. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), has said that Nunes' actions have raised \"profound doubt\" about the panel's ability to conduct an impartial investigation of Russian meddling. Nunes didn't brief the committee on his findings until he'd been to the White House and held two press conferences, Representative Schiff said.\n\nOn Friday, the situation became further inflamed when Nunes canceled a public hearing scheduled to feature former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, among others. In its place, the panel will hold a closed hearing with FBI director James Comey and NSA chief Adm. Mike Rogers, who testified publicly earlier in the week. \"It's necessary to get both of them back down here before we can move onto other interviews,\" Nunes said.",
    " Title: Trump Attempts to Pivot Campaign Strategy as Election Nears, Faces Challenges in Winning Over Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to revitalize his struggling campaign, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has made significant changes to his campaign staff and strategy. Stephen Bannon, an executive from Breitbart News, has been brought on as a key advisor, effectively demoting Paul Manafort who subsequently resigned.\n\nIn a surprising admission, Trump acknowledged that he has said the \"wrong thing\" at certain points during his presidential campaign and expressed regret for these statements. The move comes as Trump is facing significant challenges in the polls, with poor showings in swing states, red states, and blue states.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Trump is even struggling to maintain support among his core demographic, white men. This development, coupled with the ongoing concerns about Trump's capacity to be president, has led some political analysts to predict a landslide victory for the Democrats.\n\nIf the Democrats win, they could capture the White House by a substantial margin, secure control of the Senate for the first time since 2010, and potentially take over a majority of the House of Representatives, although the odds of this last scenario remain low. The Republican party is reportedly feeling the pressure, with good reason.\n\nPivoting to a \"New Trump,\" as some are calling it, will not be an easy task. It is challenging for any candidate at this stage of the campaign, and it will be particularly difficult for Donald Trump. Shaking up his campaign team, which he has done before, will not be enough to turn the tide.\n\nSocial scientists have cautioned against \"game change\" accounts of presidential campaigns, and the most significant challenge Trump currently faces is the overwhelming evidence from aggregate poll numbers that point to problems for the Republican ticket. While there are always a few polls that suggest the race might be tightening, a broader look at the data indicates that Trump is consistently struggling in almost every part of the country, including very red states like Utah.\n\nMy colleague at Princeton, Sam Wang, has shown that when all the polls are combined, Trump does not stand much of a chance of winning. Currently, Clinton is running 5.8 percentage points above President Obama's standing versus the 2012 GOP candidate Mitt Romney at the same point in the campaign four years ago.\n\nDespite speculation that Trump would pivot to a more appealing message for the wider audience of general election voters, he has consistently failed to stay the course. Occasionally, he gives carefully calibrated speeches using a teleprompter, but then immediately reverts to his more extreme messages.\n\nTrump has shown no interest in backing away from the provocative style that brought him to the forefront. His advisers have not been able to push him in a different direction, and as he slips in the polls, his instincts seem to be to double down on this kind of behavior.\n\nTrump's efforts to reach out to new constituencies, such as African-American voters, will not be easy. In recent days, Trump has made attempts to appeal to African-American voters by criticizing Democrats for failing to deliver on their promises to the community. However, these kinds of speeches will do little to sway a part of the American electorate whose support for Trump registers a stunningly low level of 1 percent.\n\nAfrican-Americans will not start turning to Trump after the kinds of statements he has made over the course of his campaign, including his slow response to calls to dissociate himself from white supremacist supporters. Nor will the GOP as a whole easily reverse its disadvantage with African-American voters unless it works to reverse the damage caused by the party's positions on key issues like voting rights, economic inequality, and police violence.\n\nAs the summer comes to a close, we are pretty late into the election game. While there have been moments in US history, such as Hubert Humphrey's surge in the fall of 1968, when candidates have been able to rapidly gain ground on their opponents (of course, Humphrey still lost the election), these comebacks do not happen too often. Given the chaotic and underdeveloped state of Trump's campaign field operation in the swing states, it will be extremely difficult for him to achieve anything of this sort.\n\nThe three presidential debates, which begin in late September, offer an opportunity to change the direction of the race. The possibility of some kind of crisis or data dump creates room for campaigns to shift course. Most often, however, there is no October Surprise.\n\nFundamentally changing the direction of the campaign will be extremely hard for the GOP. The recent comments and new campaign staff will not be enough. Republicans might conclude that they will be better off focusing on the Senate and House races than placing too much hope in the idea that the man at the top of the ticket has a big trick up his sleeve.",
    " Title: Trump's Tweets Spark Controversy: A Closer Look at the President's Remarks to Congresswomen\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, President Donald Trump directed criticism towards four freshman Democratic representatives, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.). The tweets, which some have interpreted as racist, have sparked a national conversation about the nature of the comments and their implications.\n\nTrump's tweets, in essence, suggested that the four representatives should return to the countries from which they originated. However, three of the four representatives were born in the United States, and the fourth, Ilhan Omar, was born in Somalia and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe sentiment expressed in Trump's tweets has been widely criticized as racist. Merriam-Webster defines racism as \"a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.\" The president's comments are seen as targeting non-white women and suggesting that they are not truly American or that their views are not welcome in the country.\n\nFurthermore, the comments have been criticized as anti-American, as they contradict the long-held notion that America is a melting pot, a place where people from diverse backgrounds come together to create a stronger, more vibrant society. The idea of America as a melting pot suggests that the diversity of its people is a strength, not a weakness, and that the country is improved by the unique experiences and perspectives brought by its inhabitants.\n\nTrump's comments have been met with condemnation from both sides of the political aisle, with many arguing that the president's words are not only racist but also divisive and harmful to the fabric of American society. The president's remarks have been compared to past instances of racism and xenophobia in American history, and some have called for a more unified response from political leaders to address the issue.\n\nIn the past, President Trump has been criticized for his rhetoric and comments regarding race and diversity. During his campaign, he painted a dark picture of America, deriding so-called political correctness and suggesting that if he was not elected, it would mark the end of the American experiment. In his inauguration speech, Trump painted a dystopian version of the America he was to lead, describing it as a place plagued by poverty, crime, and a failing education system.\n\nTrump's slogan, \"Make America Great Again,\" has been interpreted by some as a call to return to a time when America was supposedly better, a time when white people and men supposedly held more power and influence. This interpretation has been criticized as racist and anti-American, as it suggests that America was better off before the diversity that exists today.\n\nIn contrast, former President Barack Obama, in a speech in March 2008, spoke of the importance of diversity and the need to work together to create a more just and equal America. Obama's words, in many ways, represent the antithesis of Trump's rhetoric and serve as a reminder of the ideals that America was founded upon: a place where people from diverse backgrounds come together to create a more perfect union.\n\nIn conclusion, President Trump's tweets directed at the four freshman Democratic representatives have sparked a national conversation about race, diversity, and the nature of America. The comments have been widely criticized as racist and anti-American, and have been compared to past instances of racism and xenophobia in American history. The president's words serve as a reminder of the importance of diversity and the need to work together to create a more just and equal society, a society that truly embodies the ideals of the melting pot.",
    " Title: China's Interest in Iraq's Oil Fields: Implications and Perspectives\n\nArticle:\n\nThe China National Petroleum Corporation has expressed interest in acquiring a 60 percent stake in the West Qurna I oil field, a potential divestment from Exxon Mobil due to the latter's oil interests in Iraqi Kurdistan. Despite initial resistance, Exxon Mobil has yet to make a definitive decision. In March, the Chinese company expressed openness to forming a partnership with Exxon Mobil for the oil field.\n\nThe potential Chinese investment in Iraq's oil sector could have positive implications for global oil prices and geopolitical stability. If the United States invasion and occupation of Iraq resulted in increased Iraqi oil production, much of it pumped by Chinese workers, it has shielded the world economy from a potential spike in oil prices due to Western sanctions on Iranian oil exports.\n\nWith the boom in American domestic oil production from new shale fields, the United States' dependence on Middle Eastern oil has declined, making access to Iraqi fields less vital. However, China's interest in Iraq could help stabilize the country as it faces a growing sectarian conflict.\n\nDavid Goldwyn, former State Department coordinator for international energy affairs in the first Obama administration, stated, \"Our interest is the oil gets produced and Iraq makes money, so this is a big plus. Geopolitically it develops close links between China and Iraq, although China did not get into it for the politics. Now that they are there, they have a great stake in assuring the continuity of the regime that facilitates their investment.\"\n\nChina's growing economy relies heavily on oil imports, with Iraq being one of several countries it invests in to meet its energy needs. China recently became the world's biggest oil importer, and with its consumption growing, it is investing heavily in oil and gas fields worldwide. Over 50 percent of its oil imports come from the Middle East, even as imports from Iran have been reduced in recent years.\n\nThe Iraqi government depends on oil revenues to finance its military and social programs. Iraq, currently OPEC's second-largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia, estimates that its oil fields, pipelines, and refineries need $30 billion in annual investments to reach production targets that will make it one of the world's premier energy powers for decades to come.\n\nThe revenue that investment would produce could either help alleviate tensions between Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis or exacerbate those tensions as competing factions vie for control of the oil resources. The article does not provide specific information on the potential impact of Chinese investment on Iraq's internal conflicts.",
    " Title: Presidential Persuasion: The Challenges Facing Obama in Rallying Public Support for U.S.-Led Airstrikes in Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's upcoming media blitz, including interviews on six television networks and a primetime Oval Office address, is not expected to garner significant public support for U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria, according to an analysis by George C. Edwards III, university distinguished professor of political science and Jordan chair at Texas A&M University.\n\nThe belief in the dominant president who moves the country and the government through strong leadership has deep roots in American political culture. However, history shows that even great communicators typically fail to move the public to support their initiatives.\n\nPresidents such as Bill Clinton, \"the great explainer,\" could not win public backing for his economic stimulus bill or his cornerstone proposal for reforming the health-care system. Nor did the public support his 1999 bombing in the Balkans.\n\nSimilarly, Ronald Reagan faced opposition when he took office, with the public moving against increased defense spending, and he never achieved even plurality support for his high-priority policy of aiding the Contras in Nicaragua. Reagan could not convince the public to support limiting domestic policy expenditures or environmental regulations. Rescuing Americans in Grenada was an easier sell.\n\nWorld War II posed the greatest crisis of the twentieth century. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the century's supreme politician, was continually frustrated in his efforts to convince Americans to rearm and aid their allies against Adolf Hitler's onslaught. It took events in Europe and then Pearl Harbor, not a fireside chat, to change voters' minds.\n\nThese presidents were not stymied in their efforts to persuade the public because they avoided engaging the public, framed their positions ineffectively, or articulated their views in unappealing terms. They failed because of the nature of public opinion and the president's communication environment.\n\nThe president faces strong competition for the public's attention, and most people are not attentive to him. Barely a tenth of the population watched Obama's 2013 State of the Union address. Moreover, many people who do pay attention miss the president's points, and the less people know, the more confidence they have in their pre-existing beliefs and resist factual information. A desire to avoid risk and distrust of government make people wary of policy initiatives, especially when they are complex and their consequences are uncertain, as is the case with virtually every proposal for a major shift in public policy and undoubtedly is the case of military action against Syria.\n\nWhat's more, the opposition gets to have its say. Committed, well-organized, and well-funded opponents can undermine the White House's efforts to write its own narrative and place the president's performance in a favorable light. Republicans are not accepting the White House view that attacking Syria will weaken Assad and deter his use of chemical weapons. Then there's partisanship, which is especially likely to bias perceptions, interpretations, and responses to the president. Most people seek out information confirming their opinions and ignore or reject arguments that contradict their predispositions.\n\nThe deep polarization of today's politics only exacerbates these tendencies. One might think opinion about military action against Syria would be fluid because the issue is relatively new. The president would be wise to couch his presentation in terms of a unique situation posing a grave threat to the nation's security rather than the general international responsibilities of a humane superpower. The latter frame activates opinions that counsel against taking action.\n\nNevertheless, the president is unlikely to change many opinions. Those least likely to change are Republicans, the core constituency of the House majority. Although one wing of the GOP favors a more aggressive foreign policy, few Republican voters trust the president. And even those inclined to hear his argument will note the relative lack of international support for U.S. action. Meanwhile, a range of partisan leaders they do trust is signaling that opposing a strike is the wiser course.\n\nThe president might have better luck with his fellow Democrats. Many will remain opposed to attacking Syria because of their deep opposition to violence in international relations. A few others, and it will be at most a few, may be moved by their general predisposition to support their party's leader. This calculation explains why administration officials have fanned out to liberal outfits such as MSNBC and the Center for American Progress in recent days.\n\nBut barring dramatic events in Syria itself, the world will not change on Tuesday. Partisan politics will not stop at the water's edge, and the president is unlikely to substantially increase public support for military action against Syria. It's not because, as you'll hear often in the days ahead, he's a pale shadow of great presidents of yore; it's just the way American politics really works.",
    " Title: FISA-Gate Scandal: A Comparative Analysis with Watergate and Iran-Contra Affairs\n\nArticle:\n\nThe FISA-Gate scandal, unfolding in the present day, shares similarities with the Watergate and Iran-Contra affairs of the past, as it involves allegations of government officials using intelligence agencies for political purposes. The scandal centers around members of the Obama administration's Department of Justice seeking court approval for the surveillance of Carter Page, a Trump campaign associate, based on an unverified dossier that originated from a Hillary Clinton campaign-funded opposition research.\n\nIn the Watergate scandal of 1972-74, Democratic politicians and a tenacious media uncovered the Nixon administration's attempts to manipulate the CIA and FBI to cover up a minor, though illegal, political break-in. In the Iran-Contra affair of 1985-87, the media and liberal activists exposed wrongdoing by some rogue members of the Reagan government, warning of government overreach and the use of the \"Deep State\" to subvert the law for political purposes.\n\nThe FISA-Gate scandal, however, presents a unique twist. Unlike the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals, the media and liberal civil libertarians are now opposing the disclosure of public documents, siding with those in the government who sought surveillance to facilitate the efforts of a political campaign. This time around, the press is not after a hated Nixon administration or a conservative Reagan team; instead, the roles are reversed.\n\nBarack Obama, a progressive constitutional lawyer who expressed distrust of the secretive \"Deep State,\" is accused of weaponizing the IRS and surveilling Associated Press communications and a Fox News journalist for reporting unfavorable news based on supposed leaks. This contrasts with the past stereotypes of right-wing authoritarians subverting the Department of Justice and its agencies.\n\nThe FISA-Gate scandal is still unfolding, and its full extent remains to be seen. However, the potential for it to surpass the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals lies in the fact that our defense against government wrongdoing\u2014the press\u2014is defending such actions, not uncovering them. Liberal and progressive voices are excusing, not airing, the excesses of the DOJ and FBI.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson, a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, is the author of \"The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won\" (Basic Books, 2017).",
    " Title: Potential U.S. Strike on Syria: Implications and Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nThe potential military action by the United States against Syria, despite strong opposition from various countries and influential political and religious leaders, including the Pope, has raised concerns about the potential consequences. The strike could result in more innocent casualties and escalate the conflict, potentially spreading it beyond Syria's borders.\n\nThe conflict in Syria is not a struggle for democracy, but an armed conflict between the government and opposition in a multi-religious country. The number of democracy advocates in Syria is limited, while there are numerous Qaeda fighters and extremists engaged in the conflict. The U.S. State Department has designated Al Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, fighting with the opposition, as terrorist organizations. This internal conflict, fueled by foreign weapons supplied to the opposition, is one of the bloodiest in the world.\n\nConcerns have been raised about mercenaries from Arab countries fighting in Syria, as well as hundreds of militants from Western countries and even Russia. There is a fear that these individuals, having gained experience in Syria, might return to their home countries, posing a potential threat. This is a concern, as extremists who fought in Libya moved on to Mali, posing a threat to global security.\n\nFrom the outset, Russia has advocated for peaceful dialogue, enabling Syrians to develop a compromise plan for their future. Russia is not supporting the Syrian government, but international law. The preservation of law and order in today's complex and turbulent world is seen as one of the few ways to prevent international relations from sliding into chaos. The law is the law, and it must be followed, regardless of personal opinions.\n\nUnder current international law, force is permitted only in self-defense or by the decision of the United Nations Security Council. Any action outside of these parameters would be unacceptable under the United Nations Charter and would constitute an act of aggression.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that poison gas was used in Syria, there is reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian Army, but by opposition forces, to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists. Reports of militants preparing another attack, this time against Israel, cannot be ignored.",
    " Title: House Republicans Abandon Health Care Bill, Democrats Celebrate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, House Republicans have decided to abandon their high-stakes health care bill after failing to secure enough support from within their own party. The move leaves the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, intact.\n\nDemocrats immediately celebrated the development, taking to social media and holding press conferences to express relief for the American public. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters, \"Today is a great day for our country. It's a victory. What happened on the floor is a victory for the American people.\"\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement, \"In the words of my friend Joe Biden: This is a BFD.\"\n\nThe failure to uphold their campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare is expected to embolden and amplify the Democratic party, both in Congress and at the grassroots level.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-California, told CNN the bill's downfall was due not only to Republican intra-party disagreement, but also to the liberal movement that's been pushing back against the new Republican government since President Donald Trump's first day.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Friday that the health care disaster sets a poor precedent for Republicans in the new Congress, adding that they're unlikely to have much luck with the president's budget plan.\n\nDemocrats are now entering what will likely be an ugly fight over Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. The Democrats were already planning to filibuster, but Republicans can still get around that by lowering the threshold needed to end a filibuster from 60 votes to a simple majority.\n\nWhether the health care bill fiasco will have a real impact on the Gorsuch nomination is unclear, but it could give Democrats some momentum as they head into the week.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan acknowledged the Republican setback in a sobering press conference. \"I will not sugarcoat this,\" he said. \"This is a disappointing day for us. Doing big things is hard.\"\n\nRepublicans are already fretting about next year's midterm elections, with one senior GOP official telling CNN, \"2018 will be tough.\"\n\nRep. Ben Ray Lujan, chairman of the House Democratic campaign arm, is already forecasting which Republicans they could start targeting over the debacle. He told reporters there were 15 Republicans from competitive districts who voted to advance the bill in various committees during the legislative process.\n\nRep. Jim McGovern, D-Massachusetts, told CNN now is a time for House Republicans \"to reflect and be a little bit humble.\"\n\n\"If they want to do something constructive, they'll work with us to find ways to improve the Affordable Care Act,\" he said. \"If they want to play politics and go down the same road again or drop their hands and do nothing, I think that's unfortunate because we have to wait for the Democrats to take over.\"",
    " Title: President Trump's Response to White Supremacist Terrorism in Charlottesville Falls Short\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville has been criticized for its vagueness and equivocation. During his presidential campaign, Trump often condemned Islamic terrorism, but his response to the events in Charlottesville has been met with criticism for failing to label the violence as an act of terrorism.\n\nThe president's initial statement, which condemned \"violence on many sides,\" has been widely criticized as insufficient. The subsequent expansion of the statement, which was not made by the president himself but by an anonymous White House aide, has not been enough to quell the criticism.\n\nWhile President Trump is correct in acknowledging that there has been violence on both sides during the current season of protests, his denunciation of hatred and bigotry in Charlottesville fell short. It is important that he join other Republican leaders in labeling the violence as an act of terrorism conducted under the auspices of a white-supremacist movement that has embraced terrorism and political violence.\n\nThe president's advisor Steve Bannon has been linked to the white-supremacist movement, having boasted of turning the website Breitbart into a platform for the so-called alt-right. Trump-aligned alt-right elements have also taken a more than indulgent attitude toward white-supremacist groups.\n\nRepublicans, for the most part, have denounced the white-supremacist violence after Charlottesville. However, the white supremacists and their allies have taken the president's \"both sides do it\" stance as tacit indulgence, as the closest thing to a public embrace that realpolitik will allow.\n\nThe president should treat the Charlottesville white supremacists with the same specificity with which he denounces other political adversaries. The car attack on the counter-protesters has all the hallmarks of a terrorist attack, similar to those seen in other cities around the world.\n\nThe violence in Charlottesville is not only a specific act of violence but also a broader cause that should be repudiated. The rally in question was advertised as a project to \"Unite the Right.\" However, the idea of unity with white-supremacist groups, who are characterized by their hatred, bigotry, and racism, is rejected.\n\nThe events in Charlottesville are a reminder that armed brawls between white-supremacist groups and their left-wing equivalents are an ordinary part of American politics. Responsible parties on both sides can at the very least be honest about what is happening and unequivocal in their condemnation of it. The president has a special responsibility to set an example, and it is urged that he live up to it."
