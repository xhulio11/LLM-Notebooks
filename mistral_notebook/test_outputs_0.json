    " Title: Germany's Lower Coronavirus Death Rate Attributed to Early and Widespread Testing\n\nArticle:\n\nGermany, despite having the fifth-highest number of coronavirus cases globally, has a remarkably low fatality rate of 0.5 percent, making it the country with the world's lowest death rate from COVID-19. This contrasts sharply with countries like Italy and France, which have fatality rates of around 10 percent and 5 percent, respectively.\n\nAccording to Christian Drosten, director of the Institute of Virology at Berlin's Charit\u00e9 hospital, Germany's low fatality rate is due to the country's ability to test early and often. Drosten, whose team developed the first COVID-19 test used in the public domain, estimates that Germany has been testing around 120,000 people a week for COVID-19 during the month-long period from late February to now, when it reached epidemic proportions in the country. This extensive testing regimen is believed to be the most extensive in the world.\n\nDrosten attributes Germany's extensive testing to the country's decentralized diagnostic system, which allows for a more open market for testing. Unlike the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Germany's equivalent, the Robert Koch Institute, makes recommendations but does not control testing for the entire country. Instead, Germany's 16 federal states make their own decisions on coronavirus testing, as each is responsible for its own health care system.\n\nWhen Drosten's university medical center developed the test recommended by the World Health Organization, they rolled these tests out to their colleagues throughout Germany in January. This created a situation where testing was already in place, broadly, by the beginning or middle of February.\n\nHowever, not everyone in Germany is as confident as Drosten. Nizana Nizzi Brautmann, a Berlin resident, was worried when a teacher at her son's school tested positive for COVID-19, and she and her son woke up with fevers and persistent coughing. She said she could not get through to Berlin's coronavirus hotline, which was continuously busy. She finally got through to the city's emergency medical service number, but was told they did not perform tests and advised her to stay home and drink tea.\n\nDrosten believes such experiences are probably an exception, not the rule. He said the supply of tests is still good, and the country has had a robust response to the coronavirus pandemic. However, he is most worried about countries in Africa that are not well-set up for this pandemic, as they will find it more difficult to flatten the curve once the crisis reaches them.",
    " Title: Black Lives Matter Global Network's Funding Structure and Transparency Under Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent investigation, FactCheck.org and Politifact confirmed that the Black Lives Matter Global Network is not a recognized Internal Revenue Service (IRS) charity. Instead, the organization raises funds through a fiscal sponsor, global nonprofit Thousand Currents. This arrangement, while common in the nonprofit sector, has sparked discussions about transparency and the legal obligations of the involved parties.\n\nAccording to FactCheck.org, ActBlue, a fundraising platform, helps to raise funds for the Black Lives Matter Global Network by directing donations to Thousand Currents, their fiscal sponsor. The partnership between ActBlue and Thousand Currents was announced in 2016, with the latter providing \"fiduciary oversight, financial management, and other administrative services to BLM.\"\n\nCaleb Cade, a spokesperson for ActBlue, confirmed to the fact-checking site that \"donations made through ActBlue go to Thousand Currents for Black Lives Matter.\" Jenesha de Rivera, director of finance and administration at Thousand Currents, stated that the foundation has applied to become its own 501(c)(3), but the Black Lives Matter group did not return their request for a Form 1023, the form used to apply for 501(c)(3) status.\n\nBenjamin Leff, a professor specializing in nonprofits, told the fact-checking site that both ActBlue Charities and Thousand Currents have a legal obligation to make reasonable efforts to ensure that the funds they receive are spent consistent with 501(c)(3) restrictions.\n\nHowever, Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, suggested that the fiscal sponsorship route blocks full transparency, particularly when it comes to its partnership with ActBlue. \"Transparency? So if you want to make a tax-deductible charitable donation directly to Black Lives Matter, you can't. You donate to Act Blue Charities. Act Blue Charities sends this money, allegedly, to another charity, Thousand Currents, which runs BLM as a 'fiscal sponsorship,'\" Fitton tweeted.\n\nAs reported by FactCheck.org, a Thousand Currents audit for 2019 shows that, as of June 2019, the organization held nearly $3.4 million in net assets for Black Lives Matter. It had released nearly $1.8 million to the group in the last fiscal year. The audit also provides a breakdown of how the foundation spent that $1.8 million, including on consultants and salaries.\n\nThis arrangement and the transparency surrounding it have become a topic of debate, with some critics suggesting that the financial arrangement blocks full transparency. The Black Lives Matter Global Network continues to operate under this fiscal sponsorship arrangement, and the question of transparency remains a point of contention.",
    " Title: The 491st Sin: Racism in American Politics and the Trump-Clinton Rhetoric\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the accusation of racism has become a potent weapon, akin to the Gospel's \"seventy times seven\" forgiveness, with the 491st sin being considered unforgivable. This was evident in the recent exchange between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, as they courted the African-American and Hispanic communities.\n\nClinton, in an attempt to discredit Trump, implied that the \"alt-right\" supporters, who she claimed back her opponent, were racists. While she did not explicitly label Trump a racist, her insinuation was clear. This tactic, reminiscent of the McCarthyite smear campaigns of the past, has been effective in stirring up opprobrium and demanding moral isolation of the accused.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to examine the nature of these accusations and the individuals they target. In the case of the \"alt-right,\" it is not accurate to label them as the biggest racists around. If one is looking for racism, one might find it in the Black Lives Matter movement or in the actions of some political figures, including Hillary Clinton herself.\n\nIn the political right, it is not the nationalists, but the libertarians, who might be accused of harboring racial biases. These individuals, often white friends with an unhealthy fascination with IQ scores, take a guilty pleasure in books like \"The Bell Curve\" by Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein, which seems to validate their belief in their intellectual superiority.\n\nIt is essential to differentiate between racism and nationalism. A nationalist accepts all fellow citizens as peers, while a racist does not. The nationalist judges policies based on their benefits to American citizens, not foreigners. They are not indifferent to people in other countries, but they prioritize their own, including Americans of every race.\n\nIn the case of Trump and his supporters, they are nationalists, not racists. The accusation that Trump supporters are racists, especially among Trump-haters on the right, remains to be seen. As the political landscape continues to evolve, it will be interesting to observe who takes up this accusation and how it will shape the discourse moving forward.",
    " Title: Four Cities Vote to Legalize Marijuana, Signaling a Shift in American Attitudes Toward Pot\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development for the marijuana legalization movement, four cities in the United States voted to legalize marijuana in Tuesday's elections. The cities include three in Michigan and the first East Coast city, Portland, Maine. While these votes are largely symbolic as the states of Michigan and Maine still consider marijuana illegal, they mark another milestone in the ongoing push for legalization.\n\nAccording to a Gallup Poll released in October, 58% of Americans support marijuana legalization, a 10-point increase from a year earlier. This figure represents the highest level of support for marijuana legalization in American history, with a majority of Americans backing the measure for the first time in both polls.\n\nAnalysts and advocates attribute the sudden surge in support to several factors. The legalization of marijuana in Colorado and Washington has brought the issue to the forefront of a national conversation, and during a time of tight federal budgets, people are increasingly questioning the need for robust law enforcement spending, which experts say leads to high incarceration rates.\n\nAdditionally, the federal government is allowing states to move forward with legalization and is not aggressively enforcing federal marijuana crime laws. According to Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Law, the country is moving closer to legalization.\n\nIn addition to the two states that have legalized marijuana, 21 states allow medical marijuana, and 17 have decided to decriminalize it. In the next two elections, voters in five states, including California, Maine, Oregon, Massachusetts, and Alaska, are expected to have a say in the issue.\n\nThe legalization of marijuana has taken a similar trajectory as same-sex marriage, which has also seen a flood of public support in recent years. In both cases, the same groups of people are opposed: those who are most religious and those over 55. Additionally, liberals and young people are most likely to support the issues.\n\nHowever, William Galston, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, cautions against too closely linking the two issues. Republicans and conservatives are much more likely to oppose same-sex marriage, and those against are strongly opposed. As for marijuana, this group tends to be \"ambivalent,\" Galston said.\n\nDespite the differences in the two issues, support is growing for both. Interestingly, the liberalization of the issues comes at a time when the country remains mostly conservative. In 2012, a Gallup survey found that 40% of Americans identify as conservative, while 35% identify as moderate. Only 21% call themselves liberals. Moderates have been declining since the poll began asking the question in 1992 as more are identifying as either liberal or conservative.\n\n\"It's perfectly possible for a country to become more conservative about economic policy and more liberal on issues affecting personal liberty,\" Galston said. \"I just described libertarianism to you.\" And that could explain the increase in support for marijuana legalization, an example of an issue where the liberal and libertarian-minded conservatives are on the same page.",
    " Title: Four Key Insights from New Hampshire Primary: Marco Rubio's Debate Impact, Clinton-Sanders Race, and GOP Field Shrinkage\n\nArticle:\n\nAs New Hampshire voters head to the polls on Tuesday, the primary will provide valuable insights into the state of the presidential race. Here are four things the first-in-the-nation primary will reveal:\n\n1. The extent of Marco Rubio's debate damage: After a strong start in New Hampshire, Rubio's performance in the ABC debate on Saturday has raised concerns. His repetitive responses and perceived lack of depth have been criticized, and his campaign has since been downplaying expectations. The results of the New Hampshire primary will indicate the impact of the debate on Rubio's standing.\n\n2. The margin of Hillary Clinton's defeat to Bernie Sanders: Clinton's narrow victory in Iowa has not translated into momentum in New Hampshire. A significant victory for Sanders could provide a boost for his campaign ahead of the Nevada caucuses, while a closer race could signal Clinton's ability to maintain her campaign.\n\n3. The size of the GOP field post-New Hampshire: Before the debate, the Republican field was expected to narrow to a three-man race (Trump, Cruz, and Rubio). However, the results of the primary could determine whether governors such as John Kasich, Jeb Bush, and Chris Christie remain in the race, depending on their placement.\n\n4. The intensity of voter turnout: New Hampshire is known for its unpredictable results, and the level of voter turnout could significantly impact the outcome of the primary. A high turnout could favor candidates with strong grassroots support, while a lower turnout could benefit candidates with a strong establishment backing.\n\nThe results of the New Hampshire primary will provide valuable insights into the direction of the presidential race, as well as the potential shape of the remaining Republican field.",
    " Title: Trump's Tweet Delays House Immigration Bill Vote, Raising Doubts on Compromise Bill's Future\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014President Donald Trump's tweet on Friday has delayed a House bill on immigration overhaul, as he suggested that Republicans should wait until they have more solid majorities in Congress to pursue the issue. The tweet has cast doubt on the future of the compromise bill, which has been delayed until next week.\n\nRepublicans currently hold majorities of 51-49 in the Senate and 235-193 in the House. Some election watchers see Democrats making gains in the House in the midterm elections this fall, and perhaps winning back majority control.\n\nRep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), the chief deputy whip, said Friday that the planned immigration vote will move ahead despite the flagging support for the effort, citing party leaders' promise to GOP moderates.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) had agreed to hold the vote on what Republicans called a compromise bill to head off a special maneuver called a discharge petition that would have allowed centrist Republicans to join with Democrats to bring their own immigration bills to the floor.\n\n\"There's no significant dynamic shift in our conference on immigration,\" Mr. McHenry said, when asked if there was sufficient support to pass the consensus bill. As for Mr. Trump's tweet, he said: \"The president is speaking truth. If you want to fix immigration crisis in a holistic way, you're going to need Democrats to participate in this process.\"\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, has rejected labeling the bill a compromise, saying its provisions on Dreamers\u2014young immigrants brought to the country as minors and living in the U.S. without authorization\u2014and the zero-tolerance policy of charging adult illegal immigrants are too harsh for her party to accept. No Democrats were expected to support the measure.\n\nHouse Republican leaders had seen Mr. Trump's salesmanship as essential to pushing an immigration plan through the House. The Republican president shifted his position on the compromise bill several times over the past week, first rejecting it, then supporting it, and now saying it should be put off until after the November election.\n\nMr. Trump also moved this week to change a policy that had resulted in thousands of children being separated from their parents at the border. Mr. Trump issued an executive order that keeps his zero-tolerance stance on arresting illegal border crossers in place but directs that families be kept together. While welcomed by many lawmakers, it again shifted the playing field for the legislative negotiations.\n\nThe president's support of the compromise bill had given some Republicans political cover, particularly from conservative critics who charged that granting protected status to young immigrants amounted to amnesty. With that support now gone, the bill's future was more in doubt.\n\n\"I would say his tweet doesn't help,\" said Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) who is supporting the compromise bill. \"I just feel like this is an opportunity to get something done and I feel like we owe it to do our part in the House.\"\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) said the president was under pressure to back the compromise bill to bring hard-line immigration conservatives like himself on board and was glad to see Mr. Trump push back.\n\n\"The president realized that this is not a bill that we ought to be dying on because it's time to move on. We'll get a better bill later,\" he said.\n\nThe compromise immigration bill would provide $23.4 billion for border security\u2014including a wall and surveillance technology\u2014and would cut family-based immigration and eliminate a diversity-visa lottery program. It would also provide six years of legal status to the young immigrants.\n\nThe vote on that plan was delayed Thursday after rank-and-file House Republicans pressed leaders to make additional changes to the measure. Some conservatives complained that the compromise omitted a requirement that employers use the E-Verify system to check workers' immigration status, while other lawmakers wanted reassurances on how the legislation addressed the parents of Dreamers.\n\nSeveral Senate Republicans have introduced their own, narrow, legislation that focuses on how asylum cases are handled at the border. That bill would codify Mr. Trump's zero-tolerance policy for border crossers and keep families seeking asylum united in detention centers. It would authorize 225 new immigration judges and require the Department of Homeland Security to prioritize resolving family cases. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) are also working on bipartisan legislation.",
    " Title: \"Dennis Prager Challenges Leftist Narrative on Racism: A Closer Look at Conservative Values and Preferences\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a thought-provoking piece, nationally syndicated radio talk-show host and columnist Dennis Prager questions the widespread labeling of Trump supporters and conservatives as \"racist\" by leftists. Prager, in his latest book \"The Rational Bible,\" argues that this label is a \"big lie\" and challenges leftists to confront the truth about conservatives.\n\nPrager proposes a series of questions to test the validity of the leftist narrative:\n\n1. Do you have more in common with, and are you personally more comfortable in the company of, a white leftist or a black conservative?\n2. Would you rather have nine white leftists or nine black conservatives on the U.S. Supreme Court?\n3. Would you rather your child marry a black Christian conservative or a white non-Christian liberal?\n\nPrager asserts that a white racist would prefer the whites in each case, but he claims that his interactions with thousands of Trump supporters have never yielded a response favoring whites over blacks or non-Christians over Christians.\n\nPrager draws a parallel between this situation and the medieval Christian world's anti-Semitic attitudes, suggesting that the charge of \"racism\" against conservatives serves a similar purpose as the blood libel charge against Jews. He argues that, just as every Jew knew the blood libel was a lie, every conservative knows their responses to these questions are heartfelt and true.\n\nPrager concludes by stating that this exercise can help conservatives come to see the left's charge of conservative racism as a lie, much like medieval Jews came to see the anti-Semites' blood libel charge as false.\n\nIt is essential to note that the opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of \u2588\u2588\u2588.com.

    " Title: Trump Reverses Campaign Pledge, Says He Will Not Pursue Prosecution of Hillary Clinton\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant departure from his campaign rhetoric, President-elect Donald Trump has stated that he will not recommend prosecution of Hillary Clinton, his former rival in the presidential race. This decision marks a stark contrast to the chants of \"lock her up\" that were a common feature of Trump's rallies during the campaign.\n\nDuring a meeting with reporters and editors at The New York Times, Trump expressed empathy for Clinton, stating, \"She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways.\" He further clarified, \"I do not want to hurt the Clintons. I really don't.\"\n\nThis change in stance was first reported by New York Times reporters Mike Grynbaum and Maggie Haberman, who attended the meeting. Trump is quoted as saying, \"I think I will explain it that we, in many ways, will save our country.\"\n\nTrump's comments suggest that the Trump administration will not pursue further investigations related to Clinton's private email server or the Clinton Foundation. This decision was preceded by a statement from Trump's former campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who suggested that Trump's decision not to pursue charges sends a strong message to fellow Republicans.\n\nAt the second presidential debate in early October, Trump had threatened Clinton, stating, \"If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation.\"\n\nSteve Vladeck, CNN legal contributor and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, noted that it is unusual for a President-elect to take such a public position on whether to pursue an investigation. Vladeck stated, \"Even though the attorney general reports to the president, the Department of Justice is meant to exercise a degree of independence from the White House entirely to avoid the perception that political considerations, rather than legal ones, are behind decisions to (or not) prosecute.\"\n\nThis decision has drawn criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. While some Trump supporters may view this as a broken campaign promise, Democrats have expressed concern over what they perceive as executive overreach. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut tweeted, \"That's not how this works. In our democracy, the President does not decide who gets prosecuted and who does not.\"\n\nDuring the election campaign, chants of \"lock her up\" became a recurring theme at Trump rallies, as he criticized Clinton over her use of a private email server as secretary of state and accused the Clinton Foundation of corruption and \"pay to play\" politics. Trump's choice for national security advisor, Michael Flynn, also led a high-profile chant at the Republican National Convention of \"lock her up.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly brought up the possibility of jailing Clinton during his rallies, often at raucous campaign events over the summer and into the fall. However, in interviews with the Wall Street Journal and CBS' \"60 Minutes\" after the election, Trump refused to commit to appointing a special prosecutor.\n\nThis development marks a significant shift in Trump's stance on Clinton, and it remains to be seen how this decision will be received by the American public.",
    " Title: San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee Passes Away at Age 65\n\nArticle:\n\nSan Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee, the city's first Asian-American mayor and a former civil rights attorney, passed away Tuesday at the age of 65, his office confirmed. Lee suffered a heart attack while shopping at a Safeway grocery store on Monday night, according to US House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who represents San Francisco in Congress.\n\nLee was rushed to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital in critical condition shortly after 10 p.m. on Monday and died at 1:11 a.m. Tuesday, the hospital's CEO, Dr. Susan Ehrlich, said. The cause of death has not been released.\n\nLondon Breed, president of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors, has become acting mayor following Lee's death. Breed is the city's first black female chief executive.\n\n\"Our mayor was a good man with a good heart,\" Breed said Tuesday morning. \"He believed above all else in building bridges and solving problems.\"\n\nLee was expected to conduct meetings Tuesday at City Hall, according to his official schedule. On Monday, he attended a city event promoting a recycling program and was seen smiling and shaking hands, CNN affiliate KGO reported.\n\nBorn in Seattle and the son of Chinese immigrants, Lee graduated from Bowdoin College in 1974 and earned his law degree at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1978. After becoming a civil rights attorney, he began decades of work in city government in the late 1980s, serving under four mayors.\n\nIn 2011, the Board of Supervisors appointed Lee, then the city administrator, to fill the rest of the term of Mayor Gavin Newsom, who left to become California's lieutenant governor. Lee was elected to his own term later in 2011 and re-elected in 2015 as mayor of the consolidated city-county government.\n\nLee unabashedly trumpeted San Francisco as a sanctuary city for undocumented immigrants and opposed President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at stripping such cities of federal funding.\n\nPelosi told CNN on Tuesday that Lee was a \"man of the people,\" and that his death was heartbreaking.\n\n\"All who knew Mayor Lee understood him as a true gentleman of great warmth, positivity, and kindness,\" Pelosi said in an official statement. \"His passing is not only a tragic official loss for our city but also a profound personal loss for all who were fortunate enough to call him friend.\"\n\nLaurence M. Baer, the CEO of the San Francisco Giants, saluted Lee's service and called him the professional baseball team's top fan.\n\n\"He was a true San Franciscan who devoted his life to serving our great city and to supporting those most in need,\" Baer said. \"He was the Giants' No. 1 fan, and we are blessed to have shared so many wonderful memories together.\"\n\nVoters will elect someone to fill the rest of Lee's term on June 5, City Attorney Dennis Herrera said. The term expires on January 8, 2020. Until the vote, Breed would remain acting mayor unless the board of supervisors decides to replace her with an interim mayor, Herrera said. Breed still retains the board presidency, Herrera said. The board does not have to replace Breed as acting mayor, and the panel had no plans to address the matter on Tuesday, Herrera said.",
    " Title: State Department Delays Release of Hillary Clinton's Full Meeting Schedules, Election-Related Criticism Arises\n\nArticle:\n\nThe State Department has announced that it will not release the entirety of Hillary Clinton's daily meeting schedules from her tenure as Secretary of State before the upcoming U.S. election. The department's lawyers have stated that all the schedules will be made public by December 30 of this year, a date that falls more than a month after the election.\n\nThis development comes after the Associated Press (AP) analyzed a portion of the released schedules, finding that most of the meetings with private individuals in their sample were with individuals who had, in some capacity, contributed to the Clinton Foundation. The AP, which initially requested the schedules in 2010 and again in 2013, and then sued the State Department to obtain them, has faced criticism from media reporters for basing their report on a relatively small data set. The AP's analysis only considered meetings with individuals outside of government, and Clinton has contested the report's findings, stating that the analysis is flawed because it does not take into account the full context of the meetings.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Clinton said, \"These are people I would be proud to meet with, as any secretary of state would have been proud to meet with, to hear about their work and their insights.\" Clinton further explained that whether or not these individuals were going to give money was not a factor in her decision to meet with them.\n\nClinton's campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, criticized the AP for focusing on a \"limited subset\" of the data, suggesting that the analysis provided a skewed perspective. By the time the AP published their findings, they had only analyzed 154 of the meetings.\n\nJason Miller, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, released a statement on Friday, stating, \"It is unacceptable that the State Department is now refusing to release her official schedule before the election in full. Voters deserve to know the truth before they cast their ballots.\"\n\nAccording to the Clinton Foundation's official website, the charity \"convenes businesses, governments, NGOs, and individuals to improve global health and wellness, increase opportunity for girls and women, reduce childhood obesity, create economic opportunity and growth, and help communities address the effects of climate change.\" Last week, Bill Clinton stated that, if Hillary is elected president, the foundation will stop accepting foreign or corporate donations.",
    " Title: Treasury Department Warns of Looming Debt Ceiling Crisis as Short-term Measures Exhausted\n\nThe Treasury Department has issued a warning that the U.S. government could reach its debt ceiling in the middle of October, marking the end of short-term measures used to avoid hitting the borrowing limit. In a letter to Speaker John Boehner, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew stated that the government is running out of accounting maneuvers and urged Congress to act promptly to allow the Treasury to continue paying its bills.\n\nLew cautioned that it is impossible to predict the exact date when the debt ceiling will be reached, but warned that if no action is taken soon, the government could be left with approximately $50 billion in cash by mid-October. This amount would not be sufficient to cover Social Security payments, military personnel salaries, Medicare, and other programs for an extended period.\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center, in its analysis after the last short-term debt ceiling deal, predicted a similar scenario. Forecasting government cash flows is inherently uncertain, especially many months in advance. Unexpected changes in economic conditions or policy changes could affect the estimate. One unknown factor is whether Freddie Mac will release its $30 billion deferred tax asset, which would result in a larger-than-usual dividend payment to the U.S. Treasury by September 30. However, a $30 billion increase in federal revenues would not be enough to change the BPC's projected \"X-Date\" window.\n\nJohn Boehner has signaled a willingness to use the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip for spending cuts, potentially in the mold of a \"grand bargain\" with the White House. President Obama, on the other hand, has repeatedly stated, \"We are not negotiating on the debt ceiling.\"\n\nIn a possible indication that Republicans may not be as serious about using the debt ceiling to extract concessions from Democrats, the push to defund Obamacare is being tied to a budget resolution rather than the debt ceiling. In general, the debt ceiling is not a matter to be taken lightly - while it is not true that the government would default if it hits the debt ceiling, markets would react as if it had.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Declines to Hear Cases on Defunding Planned Parenthood, Leaving Lower Court Rulings in Place\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Supreme Court has declined to consider efforts by Republican-led states to defund Planned Parenthood, allowing federal appeals court rulings that maintained the reproductive health organization's eligibility for Medicaid funds in Louisiana and Kansas. This decision marks a setback for conservative interest groups in several states that have sought to restrict funding for Planned Parenthood and abortion providers.\n\nThree of the court's conservative justices \u2013 Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch \u2013 dissented, expressing their disapproval of the court's decision. In a statement, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas questioned the court's rationale, stating, \"I suspect it has something to do with the fact that some respondents in these cases are named 'Planned Parenthood.' That makes the court\u2019s decision particularly troubling, as the question presented has nothing to do with abortion.\"\n\nThe court's refusal to hear the case comes amidst a series of defunding attempts in various states, with similar efforts being blocked in Arizona and Indiana and contested in Ohio and Texas. In Arkansas, a federal court has allowed the state to deny funds. The laws were passed by state legislatures opposed to Planned Parenthood's provision of abortions, although abortions are already denied federal Medicaid funds. The laws targeted the funding for other services, including contraception and cancer screenings.\n\nThe federal Medicaid Act allows patients to seek out any qualified provider, with the key word being \"qualified.\" Louisiana and Kansas sought to block Planned Parenthood's funding based on various allegations, including disputed claims that the group sold fetal tissue and body parts for profit.\n\nOpponents of abortion rights have expressed disappointment with the high court's inaction, but have noted that other cases are pending in lower courts that could provide the justices with another opportunity to address the issue. Catherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life, stated, \"We will continue to fight to protect states from being forced to use their limited public funds to subsidize abortion businesses.\"\n\nDr. Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, hailed the court's decision to uphold the lower court rulings. \"As a doctor, I have seen what\u2019s at stake when people can not access the care they need and when politics gets in the way of people making their own health care choices,\" Wen said.\n\nThe Supreme Court has historically upheld abortion rights in a series of decisions dating back to 1973. Its most recent ruling struck down restrictions on abortion clinics and providers in Texas two years ago. Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest provider of abortions, with more than 2 million women using its clinics for a variety of reproductive services, including many on Medicaid. More than 70 million people \u2013 1 in 5 Americans \u2013 are enrolled in Medicaid.",
    " Title: New Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Emerges Amidst Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic, parents are now grappling with a new health concern: a mysterious inflammatory disease that shares similarities with Kawasaki disease, particularly in its symptoms and prevalence among children. This new ailment, known as pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, has been reported in various parts of the world, including the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, and other countries.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, warned against hasty decisions to reopen schools in the fall, citing the potential risks of this new disease. He referred to \"children presenting with COVID-19 who actually have a very strange inflammatory syndrome, very similar to Kawasaki syndrome.\"\n\nDoctors are investigating the link between this new syndrome and the coronavirus. The symptoms of the new disease, such as prolonged fever, a rash, conjunctivitis, swelling of the palms or soles of the feet, sometimes peeling of the skin in those areas, and lymph node enlargement, are similar to those of Kawasaki disease. However, the age range for this new disease extends into adolescence, unlike Kawasaki disease, which typically affects children under 5 years old.\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo reported that the state is investigating about 100 possible cases of the new disease, with at least three reported deaths. New York-based pediatricians have seen about 40 cases since mid-April, with the majority showing antibodies similar to the coronavirus, indicating previous infection, but no symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nThough a causal connection between the virus and the new illness has yet to be proven, Dr. Charles Schleien, chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health in New York, stated, \"The relationship seems pretty strong.\" He added, \"We never see these many kids with Kawasaki. Usually we \u2019 ll see a few kids a year. We won \u2019 t see three dozen over a period of a few weeks. So, given the numbers and given the fact it \u2019 s not acting exactly like Kawasaki, it looks like it \u2019 s probably a post-COVID-19 infection inflammatory disease.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is studying the rare disease and does not have statistics about its incidence. The CDC plans to send out an alert in the next couple of days, advising doctors to be on the lookout for the syndrome.\n\nResearchers are working to understand the link between the virus and the new syndrome. Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Stanford University, hosted a webinar on Friday to discuss the case of the first reported case of the new disease in a 6-month-old baby in the United States. Maldonado and other researchers are investigating whether the virus precipitates the syndrome.\n\nParents are advised to seek medical attention if their children exhibit symptoms such as a prolonged fever, rash, conjunctivitis, swelling of the palms or soles of the feet, peeling skin, and lymph node enlargement. The good news is that, like Kawasaki disease, the new syndrome is treatable with intravenous immunoglobulin and sometimes steroids, followed by aspirin. Hospital stays for patients may last two to four days.\n\nAs more data emerge, researchers hope to better understand the new syndrome, its prevalence, and risk factors. The CDC is working with domestic and international partners to develop a case definition that will allow them to keep track of the syndrome.\n\nIn conclusion, the emergence of this new pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing global health crisis. While the link between the syndrome and the coronavirus is still under investigation, parents are advised to remain vigilant and seek medical attention if their children exhibit symptoms. The good news is that, like Kawasaki disease, the new syndrome is treatable, and with proper medical care, most children are expected to recover.",
    " Title: Senate Silences Elizabeth Warren During Debate on Jeff Sessions' Nomination, Incident Sparks National Outcry\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, the United States Senate, led by a majority of Republicans, silenced Senator Elizabeth Warren during a debate on the nomination of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General. The incident, which occurred on Tuesday, has sparked a national outcry and elevated Warren into a Democratic hero.\n\nThe controversy began when Warren read a letter written by Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King Jr., opposing Sessions' nomination for a federal judgeship in 1986. The letter was read during a debate on Sessions' nomination as Attorney General, a position he now holds under President Donald Trump.\n\nWarren, a Massachusetts Democrat, quoted from King's letter, stating, \"Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge.\"\n\nRepublicans argued that Warren violated Senate rules against impugning another senator. A vote along party lines upheld the decision, turning what could have been an ordinary partisan floor speech into a national story.\n\nIn response, Warren told CNN's Don Lemon, \"They can shut me up, but they can't change the truth.\" The incident immediately galvanized the Democratic base, providing a new rallying point following the women's marches around the country.\n\nThe apparent hypocrisy of the incident was further fueled by the fact that Warren's male colleagues were able to read from the letter uninterrupted. Senators Tom Udall of New Mexico and Jeff Merkley were allowed to read from King's letter, though they couched their remarks as only reading portions of the letter and with the context to be in line with Senate rules.\n\nAs a result of the incident, Warren is forbidden from participating in the floor debate over Sessions' nomination ahead of a confirmation vote expected Wednesday. \"I literally can't be recognized on the floor of the Senate,\" Warren told Lemon. \"I have become a nonperson during the discussion of Jeff Sessions.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell defended invoking Rule 19, a rarely used chamber regulation that prohibits senators from impugning each other. \"She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor, delivering an instantly classic line.\n\nThe incident comes at a crucial time for Warren, who is up for re-election in 2018. On Tuesday, she announced she hired an aide who is an expert on national security, a move that could help burnish her expertise in that area, as well as the publication of a new book, which will become available in April.\n\nLiberals had been frustrated with Warren's vote in committee in favor of Ben Carson, Trump's nominee for secretary of Housing and Urban Development. By Tuesday night, the hashtag #LetLizSpeak was trending on Twitter, and millions of people had watched on Facebook as Warren read the letter outside the Senate chamber.\n\nMoveOn members contributed $250,000 to Warren's re-election campaign in about 12 hours. \"I will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory & racist comments that have no place in our justice system,\" Warren wrote on Twitter. \"I will not be silent while the Republicans rubber stamp an AG who will never stand up to the @POTUS when he breaks the law.\"\n\nThe incident has become a rallying cry for fellow Democrats. California Sen. Kamala Harris took to the Senate floor to call the vote to silence Warren \"outrageous.\" \"I never ever saw a time when a member of the Senate asked to put into the record a letter -- especially by a civil rights icon -- and somebody objected,\" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont.\n\nThe Senate descended into a series of complaints about declining decorum on both sides. \"We have to treat each other with respect or this place is going to devolve into a jungle,\" said seven-term Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch.\n\nAs the incident continues to unfold, Democrats are bringing out examples of Republicans who have crossed similar lines and not been shut up the way Warren was forbidden from participating. The Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's office highlighted Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's accusation that McConnell had told a \"flat-out lie\" about the future of the Export-Import Bank in 2015. Warren sat on the Senate floor, though, silently, having already had her moment.",
    " Title: Henry Kissinger Expresses Optimism for Trump's Foreign Policy Potential\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on \"Face the Nation,\" former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who served under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, expressed optimism about President-elect Donald Trump's potential influence on the international community. Kissinger, who is known for his extensive experience in foreign affairs, acknowledged that Trump's unexpected victory has surprised many, but he believes the president-elect could present an \"extraordinary opportunity\" for the nation and its foreign relations.\n\nKissinger stated, \"Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries have not seen. So it is a shocking experience for them that he came into office. At the same time, extraordinary opportunity. I believe he has the possibility of going down in history as a very considerable president.\"\n\nDespite concerns from many seasoned politicians and experts about Trump's brazen rhetoric and lack of political experience, Kissinger remains optimistic about Trump's potential influence. He hopes the president-elect can harness the same appeal he used to start his own political revolution to shape a foreign policy plan.\n\nKissinger explained, \"In the first appearances, I thought it was a transitory phenomenon. But I give him huge credit for having analyzed an aspect of the American situation, developed a strategy, carried it out against the leadership of his own party, and prevailed.\"\n\nAs the world grapples with Trump as the new leader, Kissinger believes other nations will have to reassess their relationships with the United States. He stated, \"One, their perception that the previous president, or the outgoing president, basically withdrew America from international politics, so that they had to make their own assessments of their necessities. And secondly, that here is a new president who's asking a lot of unfamiliar questions. And because of the combination of the partial vacuum and the new questions, one could imagine that something remarkable and new emerges out of it.\"\n\nKissinger also expressed hope that Trump will shift his tone somewhat as he enters the Oval Office, especially when it comes to complicated and dense issues like the relationship between the US and China, which he believes has an opportunity to be mutually beneficial if properly maintained. However, he acknowledged that this might depend on Trump becoming less of an instinctive actor.\n\n\"I think he operates by a kind of instinct that is a different form of analysis as my more academic one,\" Kissinger said. \"But he's raised a number of issues that I think are important, very important. And if they're addressed properly, could lead to good\u2014great results.\"",
    " Title: RNC Chairman Threatens Non-Supportive Republicans, Including John Kasich, with Potential Party Roadblocks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has threatened Ohio Governor John Kasich and other Republicans who have refused to support the party's presidential nominee, Donald Trump. According to Priebus, the party may take steps to ensure it is not \"that easy\" for non-supporters to seek the White House in the future.\n\nSpeaking on the matter, Priebus stated that every Republican who ran in 2016 needs to get behind Trump. Those who have not, including Kasich, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, could see diminished support from the party moving forward.\n\n\"People who agreed to support the nominee, that took part in our process, they used tools from the RNC. They agreed to support the nominee. They took part in our process. We're a private party, we're not a public entity. Those people need to get on board,\" said Priebus.\n\nHe further added, \"And if they're thinking they're going to run again someday, I think we're going to evaluate our process, the nomination process, and I don't think it's going to be that easy for them.\"\n\nGovernor Kasich stated it is \"very unlikely\" he will vote for Trump, citing \"too much water under the bridge.\" In an interview with CNN that aired Friday, Kasich expressed similar sentiments as Bush and Cruz, who withheld an endorsement of Trump during the Republican National Convention and instead told Republicans to \"vote their conscience\" in November.\n\nPriebus denied that he was threatening Kasich, Cruz, or anyone else, yet he clearly suggested the party would put roadblocks in front of the electoral hopes of anyone who hasn't offered a full-throated endorsement of Trump.\n\n\"People in our party are talking about what we're going to do about this... It's not a threat. It's just a question,\" the RNC chairman said. \"What should a private party do about that if those same people come around in four or eight years?\"\n\nKasich, a former 2016 GOP presidential candidate himself, emphasized the importance of getting out the vote for Republicans like Senator Rob Portman, who is running for re-election in Ohio.\n\n\"We want to get people out to vote. We want to re-elect Senator Portman, and we want to re-elect people down ticket,\" said Kasich. \"I'm not voting for Hillary [Clinton].\"\n\nKasich was in Cleveland during the Republican National Convention in July but did not attend the convention itself. When asked about Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, Kasich stated, \"I haven't even gone there yet. It's a long way [until] Election Day.\"",
    " Title: Trump Accuses Comey of Lying, Alleges Perjury in Tweet Amidst Ongoing Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Friday morning, President Donald Trump claimed \"total and complete vindication\" while seemingly accusing former FBI Director James Comey of lying under oath and leaking information. The tweet, which raised eyebrows in the White House, is just one part of the counteroffensive against Comey, who testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee the previous day.\n\nTrump's tweet, which followed a bellicose statement from his lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, on Thursday, accused Comey of lying under oath and inappropriately disclosing the contents of his conversations with Trump. The accusation, essentially alleging that Comey committed perjury in his congressional testimony, is just the latest broadside Trump has launched against his former FBI director.\n\nThe president's tweet also hinted at a forthcoming complaint to the Department of Justice inspector general about the so-called leak, in which Comey handed off memos describing his conversations with Trump to a friend who in turn passed them onto The New York Times.\n\nTrump's team has been quick to push back against Comey's testimony, with a main thrust of their strategy being to discredit Comey, painting him as disgruntled and untrustworthy. The process began with an RNC-coordinated counter-messaging effort, and was followed by Kasowitz's prepared statement at the National Press Club, near the White House.\n\nWhile Trump and Kasowitz have directly refuted the substance of Comey's accounts, many of Trump's fellow Republicans sought to frame it as a misinterpretation by Comey rather than a total fabrication. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday that the president \"is new at this. He's new at government.\"\n\nTrump's allies are also eager to shift the conversation to Comey's conduct. Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski made the president's case in three separate appearances on ABC, NBC, and Fox News, emphasizing Comey's statement that Trump had never been under investigation while at the same time calling into question the FBI director's credibility to dispute other portions of his testimony.\n\nThe president is also expected to address the controversy further when he holds a joint news conference with the president of Romania on Friday afternoon in the Rose Garden.",
    " Title: ISIS Takes Control of Ramadi: A Setback in Iraq's Anti-ISIS Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, ISIS forces have taken control of the Iraqi city of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, marking the biggest victory for the militant group in Iraq in nearly a year. The fall of Ramadi, which has been under siege by ISIS for some time, highlights the fundamental weakness of the Iraqi military and its reliance on radical Shia militias.\n\nThe battle for Ramadi, a predominantly Sunni city, has been a long and arduous one. ISIS has shown an unusual level of success in Anbar province, thwarting Iraqi army attacks and even pushing forward in some instances, despite setbacks in other parts of the country. The recent shift in the balance of power in Anbar, as evidenced by the fall of Ramadi, is a testament to ISIS's resilience.\n\nThe Iraqi army's contingent in Ramadi has been under-resourced for over a year. As reported by Liz Sly, the Washington Post's Beirut bureau chief, Iraqi troops had held out for 16 months, with little help, before succumbing to the ISIS onslaught. The Iraqi army's core problem lies in its profound weakness due to corruption and mass defections during last June's ISIS offensive. With the Iraqi army lacking enough effective, battle-hardened units, it is forced to rely on allies, such as the Kurdish peshmerga in the north and violent sectarian Shia militias in the rest of the country.\n\nThe reliance on these allies, however, has its challenges. The militias, while effective on the battlefield, are also politically divided. Some of the most influential Shia militias have political wings that are political rivals of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's Dawa party. These factions were not present in Ramadi when it fell, as Abadi wanted the army to beat ISIS without the use of Shia militias, and the United States was concerned about the militias' track record of brutalizing Sunni civilians.\n\nNow, Anbar's Sunni-dominated provincial council has formally requested militia assistance, which is on its way. Michael Knights, the Lafer fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, states, \"More forces, including local forces, is the only solution\" in Ramadi. The militias, according to Knights, are \"the only speedy mechanism left.\"\n\nDespite the setback in Ramadi, the fundamentals of the conflict remain unchanged. ISIS is still likely to lose its territory in Iraq. The militant group remains outnumbered, surrounded by enemies, vulnerable to American airstrikes, and facing increasingly competent enemies. However, the anti-ISIS campaign will not be easy, nor will it be short. ISIS has a remarkably effective combat force given its size and resources. The Iraqi army is more competent than it was during its disastrous performance early in the conflict, but it still has a long way to go.\n\nThe deep political divides between the Iraqi army forces and the militia leadership are not going away, and could lead to a different sort of conflict after ISIS. The fighting will continue to devastate Iraq and potentially deepen the Sunni-Shia divides that gave rise to ISIS in the first place. Even with ISIS's fundamental weakness, Iraq remains in a very bad place.",
    " Title: Private Prison Companies See Surge in Business Amidst Expansion of U.S. Immigration Detention Centers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration's plan to double the capacity of America's immigrant detention centers has sparked controversy, with the potential for further expansion if the administration intends to carry out its promise of deporting millions of undocumented residents. This development has ignited a wave of national outrage among many, but there is at least one group that appears to be celebrating this new era of xenophobia: private prison companies.\n\nAs of November, a staggering 65 percent of ICE detainees were housed in facilities run by private prison companies, whose business model revolves around earning a fee per detainee per night and minimizing costs to maximize profits for their shareholders. Since President Trump's election, private prison stocks have experienced a significant increase, and two new, for-profit detention centers are set to open in Georgia and Texas. Furthermore, private prison company Management & Training Corp. is reportedly seeking a contract with ICE to reopen the Willacy County Correctional Institution, a troubled detention camp that once held up to 2,000 ICE detainees in Kevlar tents between 2006 and 2011.\n\n\"Historically, ICE has relied heavily on the private prison industry every time the detention system has expanded,\" says activist George Takei. \"There's little doubt in my mind that they will continue to rely on the private prison industry in what's going to be the biggest expansion of the agency in history.\"\n\nThe private prison industry's growth is fueled by the potential profits to be made in building and operating detention centers. While the individuals being rounded up may be guilty of minor offenses such as overstaying visas, they may find themselves in private detention facilities that have been terminated by other federal agencies due to patterns of abuse and neglect.\n\nThis expansion of the detention system is likely to result in larger detention centers, as the administration moves aggressively to fulfill its campaign promise of deporting millions. The increased capacity will undoubtedly provide a significant boost to the private prison industry's bottom line.",
    " Title: Scalia Criticizes Obama's Immigration Policies, Questions Framers' Response\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a strongly worded dissent, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia questioned Monday whether the Framers of the Constitution would have reacted negatively to President Barack Obama's recent immigration policies.\n\nSpeaking in dissent of most of the court's rulings on Arizona's immigration law, Scalia took a clear swipe at the Obama administration's new policy ending deportations for many young adults brought into the country illegally, which was not part of the Arizona case.\n\n\"The president has said that the new program is 'the right thing to do' in light of Congress's failure to pass the administration's proposed revision of the immigration laws,\" Scalia said. \"Perhaps it is, though Arizona might not think so.\"\n\nScalia suggested that the Framers would have left Independence Hall if presented with the idea behind Obama's policy shift. He questioned whether states would have entered into the union had the Constitution included a clause enacting immigration laws but stipulating that the president had a choice on whether to enforce them.\n\n\"The husbanding of scarce enforcement resources can hardly be the justification for this,\" he said of the new Department of Homeland Security directives, \"since those resources will be eaten up by the considerable administrative cost of conducting the non-enforcement program, which will require as many as 1.4 million background checks and biennial rulings on requests for dispensation.\"\n\nThe court upheld a key piece of Arizona's law\u2014requiring police to check the immigration status of those they arrest or stop for questioning\u2014but struck down other pieces of the law, arguing the state had stepped into the bounds of federal law.\n\n\"To say, as the Court does, that Arizona contradicts federal law by enforcing immigration law that the president declines to enforce boggles the mind,\" Scalia said.\n\nThe problem that Arizona faces, Scalia said, is not that scarce resources are being put toward enforcing immigration laws elsewhere and not in that border state, but the Obama administration's policies.",
    " Title: GOP Faces Tough Choices as Government Funding and Debt Ceiling Deadlines Loom\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the month of September approaches, Republican lawmakers are bracing for a challenging few weeks, with the possibility of being asked to vote on two contentious issues: a continuing resolution to keep the government open and a bill to raise the debt ceiling.\n\nThe continuing resolution, which would maintain current spending levels, is likely to be tied to the debt ceiling increase, a measure that is unpopular among congressional conservatives. The deadline for preventing a government shutdown is September 30, while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has set a September 29 deadline for raising the nation's borrowing limit.\n\nMnuchin has stated that the debt ceiling hike should be \"clean,\" meaning it should not be tied to spending cuts or reforms demanded by conservatives. To get the bill through the Senate, Republicans will need support from Democrats, giving the minority leverage.\n\nRepublicans are traditionally opposed to funding the government through a continuing resolution because it blocks or delays their priorities, such as funds for President Trump's border wall, significant increases in military spending, and cuts to non-defense discretionary spending.\n\n\"We'd be against a continuing resolution because that wouldn't allow us to fund those priorities,\" said White House budget director Mick Mulvaney in June.\n\nRepublicans could avoid the continuing resolution by reaching a deal on a broader spending bill, but this would also require Democratic support in the Senate, and time is running out. So far, the House has only managed to approve four spending bills, while the Senate has not approved any, and most have not even made it out of committee.\n\nThis means a continuing resolution is a more likely outcome and one that would buy time for a longer budget deal at the end of the year. Several prominent conservative leaders, such as Rep. Mark Meadows, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, have already expressed their resignation to a continuing resolution.\n\nCongress will still be under pressure this fall to secure a spending deal, even with a continuing resolution. New budget caps under a previous long-term budget deal are set to kick in in January, which would reduce spending below existing levels unless Congress passes a new law.\n\nRaising the borrowing limit is a difficult vote for most members of Congress, but particularly for Republicans. A Harvard\u2013Harris Poll in June found that an astonishing 69 percent of voters were opposed to Congress raising the debt ceiling, even though the failure to do so could lead the United States to default on its debt.\n\nUnder former President Barack Obama, conservatives tried to use the must-pass legislation to get spending reforms or other Republican priorities made into law. With Trump in the White House and Republicans controlling both the House and Senate, however, the dynamics have shifted. Democrats may try to turn the tables and extract concessions from Republicans, who will need Democratic support to pass the debt ceiling.\n\n\"To ensure that we have robust economic growth and promote fiscal discipline, the Trump administration believes it's important to raise the debt ceiling as soon as possible,\" said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Tuesday.\n\nEven so, some Republicans are still pushing for some sort of policy reform to hitch to the debt ceiling. \"I've been raising the issue of the debt ceiling for months now, and certainly what I'd like to see is some meaningful, structural control enacted in conjunction with increasing,\" said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).\n\nThe difficult decisions come as Republicans grapple with a narrative that they are unable to govern. In the first six months of the Trump administration, they have yet to finalize a major piece of legislation, including the healthcare bill that failed in the Senate last week. Come autumn, the GOP will likely have to choose between allowing the government to shut down and default on its debt and making politically difficult, unpopular decisions.",
    " Title: California's Largest Preventive Blackout Affects Over 800,000 Residents Amid Wildfire Danger\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to prevent wildfires, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) initiated a massive power shutdown affecting over 800,000 customers in Northern, Central, and coastal California counties on Wednesday. The utility company had already cut power to more than 500,000 customers earlier in the day, with plans to gradually turn off electricity to nearly a million customers.\n\nPG&E's decision comes in response to a forecast of hot, dry, and gusty weather, with winds of up to 72kph (45 mph) sweeping across the state. The utility aims to reduce the risk of trees falling onto power lines during these conditions, particularly in areas prone to wildfires.\n\nThe utility's Community Wildfire Safety Program head, Sumeet Singh, described the move as a \"last resort.\" However, California Governor Gavin Newsom expressed dissatisfaction, stating, \"No one is satisfied with this, no one is happy with this.\" He emphasized the need for PG&E to upgrade and fix its equipment to prevent such widespread outages in the future.\n\nRestoration of power could take up to five days, as each power line must be inspected to ensure it is not damaged or poses a fire risk. The outages are not limited to fire-prone areas, as the utilities must turn off entire distribution and transmission lines to wider areas to minimize the risk of wildfires.\n\nThe outages have disrupted normal life, with schools cancelling classes, and universities such as the University of California, Berkeley, Sonoma State University, and Mills College closing. The California Department of Transportation is installing generators to avoid closing the Caldecott Tunnel and the Tom Lantos Tunnel.\n\nThe outages come as residents in the region's wine country north of San Francisco mark the two-year anniversary of deadly wildfires that killed 44 and destroyed thousands of homes. To the south, Southern California Edison may cut power to over 106,000 customers in parts of eight counties as early as Thursday due to Santa Ana winds.\n\nThe outages are a result of a plan instituted after deadly wildfires, some blamed on PG&E transmission lines, destroyed lives and homes in recent years and forced the utility into bankruptcy over an estimated $30bn in potential damages from lawsuits.\n\nAuthorities have urged residents to be prepared, with supplies of water, sensitive medicines, full petrol tanks, and checked food in freezers and refrigerators after power is restored. PG&E has set up community centers offering air conditioning, restrooms, bottled water, and electronic charging stations during daylight hours.\n\nMayors of affected cities have expressed mixed reactions, with some appreciating the proactive approach, while others, like Melanie Bagby, Mayor of Cloverdale, find the situation inexcusable. The situation has highlighted the need for reliable power and the potential consequences of relying on a monopoly utility.",
    " Title: The Unprecedented Re-election of President Obama: A Reflection on Self-Reliance, Dependency, and the Expansion of Government\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, it is a remarkable occurrence that a president who has overseen a significant increase in government spending, a rise in entitlement programs, and a controversial foreign policy can be re-elected. This is the reality that America now faces with the re-election of President Barack Obama.\n\nThe re-election of President Obama is a testament to the truism observed by Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, who, despite their political differences, shared a common understanding of the public's response to the perceived role of the government as a public trough. As the voters recognize the government as a source of cash handouts, they tend to elect individuals who promise to distribute more funds, thereby fostering dependency. This attitude, though present in some localities during the colonial era, was amplified at the federal level by presidents such as Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, FDR, LBJ, and has been a consistent feature of modern-day Democrats and contemporary Republicans.\n\nMitt Romney, a Republican, is one of those who can be classified as a proponent of federal entitlements. He promised to maintain the status quo, with entitlement costs to taxpayers amounting to approximately $1.7 trillion annually. Under President Obama, these costs have increased, as have the number of recipients. Half of the country is aware of this reality, and has chosen to re-elect Obama to continue sending federal funds to the other half.\n\nPresident Obama's tenure has been marked by a centralized approach to the economy and federal regulation of private behavior. His handling of the Libya incident, in which American government employees were killed, has been criticized, and he has shown a reluctance to admit error. His interpretation of the Constitution is flexible, treating it as a guideline rather than a set of principles intended to protect personal liberty and a diffusion of power. He rejects the fundamental American value that our rights come from our Creator, not the government, leading to an expansive view of the federal government's role in regulating behavior and taxing events.\n\nThe practical implications of Obama's second term are daunting. ObamaCare is now a permanent fixture, with federal bureaucrats directing medical treatment and access to medical records. The national debt is projected to reach $20 trillion, with an estimated $1 trillion in annual interest payments if the Republican-controlled House of Representatives continues to cooperate. Taxes are set to increase on January 1, 2013, as the Bush-era tax cuts expire. The vision of a populace dependent on a central government and a European-style welfare state is now a reality.\n\nThough the election was perceived as a choice between big government and bigger government, with the focus on the extent of private wealth to be seized and redistributed and the degree of private behavior to be regulated, rather than the constitutionality of such actions, the re-election of Obama is unsettling. The fear is that, freed from the need to cater to the electorate, Obama may become the authoritarian figure who will curtail personal freedoms.",
    " Title: Wisconsin's Political Dichotomy: A Microcosm of American Polarization\n\nArticle:\n\nMadison, Wis. \u2014 Wisconsin, a state known for its picturesque landscapes and progressive history, has long been a political enigma, defying traditional political trends and exhibiting a unique political personality. This dichotomy, as Rutgers University political science professor Ross Baker observes, is a testament to the state's ability to surprise politically, not just occasionally, but consistently.\n\nThe state's political history is a fascinating tapestry, weaving together the threads of iconic figures such as Robert \"Fighting Bob\" La Follette, a populist senator and Progressive Party presidential candidate in 1924, and Joseph McCarthy, the hard-line conservative senator who led the Communist witch-hunts of the 1950s. This broad political disparity is not limited to the past; it extends to the present day, with conservative Republican Ron Johnson and liberal Democrat Tammy Baldwin representing the widest ideological gulf of any state's senators, according to a 2013 National Journal ranking of voting records.\n\nThe current political landscape of Wisconsin is a testament to the state's ability to elect politicians from opposite ends of the political spectrum. Baldwin, the Senate's first openly gay member, is listed as the 5th most liberal, while Johnson, the 9th most conservative. This political schism is further underscored by the fact that the state has a history of electing liberal politicians such as William Proxmire, an early anti-Vietnam war opponent, and Democrat Russ Feingold, the champion of campaign finance changes, only to see them replaced by conservatives like Johnson.\n\nThe state's political climate, according to Michael Wagner, a political science and journalism professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, appears \"schizophrenic\" both to outsiders and insiders. Wagner attributes this to the long-standing political polarization that has become more pronounced in the last decade. He notes that the state's voters are sharply divided, and a small swing vote can determine whether a conservative Republican or liberal Democrat wins.\n\nWisconsin's political landscape is also unique in its demographic homogeneity, with whites accounting for 88% of the population. This narrow electorate, when combined with the state's political polarization, means that a small minority vote\u2014or its absence\u2014can swing an election.\n\nPolitical scientist Wagner notes that both sides have become adept at winning elections. However, the cost of this political acumen is a lack of consensus politics that serve the greater good. Compromise, he says, is no longer possible due to such polarization. This bitter divide means that politicians elected to statewide office represent the interests of those who got them there, often at the expense of the greater good of the state.\n\nThis political divide in Wisconsin offers a chilling insight into the current political climate in Washington, D.C., where compromise is a dirty word, and winning is the only objective. As the 2024 presidential race heats up, with native son Gov. Scott Walker casting himself as Ronald Reagan's heir, understanding Wisconsin's political history and its implications for the nation's capital is more important than ever.",
    " Title: The Lack of Political Guardrails: A Reflection on the Current Political Climate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn today's political landscape, the concept of \"political guardrails\" has taken on a new meaning, as many politicians seem to be operating without any constraints or safeguards, according to Kimberley Strassel of The Wall Street Journal.\n\nStrassel's article highlights the tendency of some politicians, such as former President Barack Obama and potential presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, to bypass Congress and implement policies unilaterally when faced with opposition. For instance, Obama altered the Affordable Care Act without congressional approval, while Clinton has promised to impose gun control laws and new taxes on corporations if Congress does not support her proposals.\n\nThis trend is not limited to one party, as Donald Trump, another potential presidential candidate, has also made headlines for his controversial statements and promises, such as his proposal for a Muslim travel ban and his assertion that he will make Mexico pay for a border wall.\n\nThe public's response to these bold, often unconstitutional, moves seems to be positive, with many people appearing to favor a strong, decisive leader who will take control and make changes. However, this desire for a \"big, strong\" leader overlooks the importance of constitutional restraints and the role of the president as a presider, not a controller, of the country.\n\nThe Constitution was designed to limit political authority, allowing individual Americans to manage their own lives and fostering a free and prosperous nation. Today, both major parties seem to be off the rails, with some advocates demanding the use of the IRS against political rivals and others quietly undermining government reform efforts, such as the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.\n\nThis lack of political guardrails not only distracts from the smaller, routine violations of constitutional rules but also threatens the very foundation of our democratic system. It is crucial for citizens to demand accountability and adherence to the Constitution, ensuring that our leaders act within the bounds of their authority and uphold the principles of limited government and individual freedom.",
    " Title: US Political Climate Deteriorates Ahead of 2013 Elections as Gridlock and Approval Ratings Plummet\n\nArticle:\n\nThe political landscape in the United States is facing a significant downturn as the nation heads into the 2013 elections on Tuesday. According to the George Washington University Battleground Poll, a national survey of 1,011 registered likely voters, Washington's gridlock is the nation's most pressing problem, and approval ratings for Congress and President Obama are both on a decline.\n\nThe poll, conducted jointly by Republican pollster Ed Goeas of the Tarrance Group and Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, paints a grim picture of the current political environment. Goeas, a Republican campaign consulting firm strategist, states, \"It is the worst political environment we have seen in a long time.\" He notes that the Battleground survey found that 73 percent of voters believe the country is on the wrong track.\n\nThe survey reveals that the No. 1 problem in the country is the dysfunction in Washington, according to the voters. This issue is rated higher now than jobs and the economy combined. Some 26 percent of voters cited government gridlock as the most important problem versus 18 percent for the second-most-cited top problem \u2013 government spending and the budget deficit.\n\nWhen voters are asked to rate the job Congress is doing, 87 percent say they disapprove versus just 9 percent who approve. \"The thing that I think is most interesting is that people blame their own Congress person,\" Lake says. In the Battleground survey conducted Oct. 27-31, 50 percent of those polled disapproved of how their own member of Congress was doing versus 39 percent who approved and 11 percent who were unsure.\n\nRepublicans in Congress had worse ratings than Democrats, the survey found. Some 65 percent of those polled had an unfavorable view of Republicans in Congress, while Democrats were viewed unfavorably by 53 percent. The government shutdown last month clearly played a role in these numbers, both strategists said.\n\n\"What I don't know is how much of this data is driven by the shutdown or offset by what has happened in the last three weeks,\" Goeas said, referring to the trouble-prone launch of the Affordable Care Act website and complaints that consumers are having health insurance policies canceled as a result of Obamacare coverage requirements.\n\nIn the poll taken almost a month after a government shutdown largely driven by the demands of tea party activists, only 54 percent of those polled said they had an unfavorable impression of the tea party \u2013 11 points lower than the disapproval level for Republicans and a statistical dead heat with Democrats.\n\nWhile Republicans in Congress have reason to be concerned about their standing, this latest poll also contains bad news for President Obama. The president's approval rating now stands at 44 percent, with 52 percent disapproving. Obama's personal ratings are also down, with 47 percent of those surveyed saying they had a favorable view of him and 50 percent holding unfavorable views.\n\nThis is the first time in the Battleground survey that Obama has had both a majority unfavorable image and majority disapproval of his job performance, Goeas says. \"The key question... is has Barack Obama lost the ability to lead in this country,\" he adds. Goeas further notes that, \"In a second term of the White House, once a president's numbers decline, they never come back up... More importantly, what we see is that once a president loses the trust of the American people in the second term, they never gain it back. And I think what is going on with health care right now has the potential of Barack Obama losing the trust of the American people.\"",
    " Title: White House, Congress Grapple with Corporate Tax Rate in Ongoing Tax Reform Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's recent comments about a potential increase in the corporate tax rate for the upcoming tax reform bill have sparked debate within the U.S. Congress, with a White House aide attempting to downplay the president's remarks on Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol Building is seen from the Congressional Visitors Center in Washington, D.C., on December 6, 2017. (Photo by Aaron P. Bernstein)\n\nTwo rival tax bills, passed separately by the Senate and the House of Representatives, propose reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20 percent. However, they differ in other areas that Republicans are trying to merge into final legislation.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the Senate approved its tax bill on Saturday, Trump said the corporate tax rate in the final legislation, expected soon from lawmakers, \"could be 22 percent... it could also be 20 percent.\"\n\nThis comment has piqued the interest of some Republicans who see a slight increase in the proposed corporate tax rate as a potential source of federal revenue to address other issues with the legislation, according to lobbyists.\n\n\"The 20 percent rate ought to be our goal,\" said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, who is expected to head a bicameral House-Senate negotiating committee. \"My view is the president is giving us flexibility in that area if it's needed. No decision's been made on if that's needed,\" the Texas Republican told reporters.\n\nHowever, White House legislative affairs director Marc Short told Reuters on Thursday that Trump was not expressing support for a higher proposed corporate rate. Instead, he may have been reflecting views conveyed to him by Republican senators.\n\n\"I think he was just reflecting what conversations he had heard from them, but that... wasn't intended to signal: this is an endorsement of raising the corporate rate,\" Short said.\n\n\"We believe that 20 percent is the right number... 20 percent is about as high as we feel comfortable going,\" he said in an interview.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies have a lot at stake in the outcome of the tax reform bill. A sweeping U.S. tax overhaul, which has not been achieved since 1986, would give Republicans their first major legislative victory of 2017, after their failure to overturn former President Barack Obama's healthcare law. Without a win, Republicans fear they could lose their control of the House and Senate in the 2018 congressional elections.\n\nHowever, it may be too late to avoid confusion over priorities as the tax debate moves forward in Congress. Lobbyists said many perceive that Trump and his advisers would accept a corporate rate higher than 20 percent.\n\nWhite House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on Thursday that a 22 percent corporate rate would not undermine the economic boost that Republicans say tax cuts will create.\n\nAnalysts say the corporate income tax rate could be a ready source of revenue for lawmakers, as they move toward a final bill that can lose no more than $1.5 trillion in revenue over the next decade under Senate rules.\n\nRepublicans are considering a more costly deduction for state and local taxes than the $10,000 property tax deduction contained in the House and Senate bills. One version would allow taxpayers to choose a $10,000 deduction for either property or income taxes.\n\nHouse lawmakers also want to adopt the House bill's repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, which would cost about $40 billion in revenue over a decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Senate retained the tax.\n\nA House limit on the amount of debt interest payments that businesses can deduct from their income would also cost about $136 billion more than the Senate version, the JCT said.\n\nAnalysts say a one percentage point change in the corporate rate equals about $100 billion in revenues over a decade.",
    " Title: President Trump Vows Immediate Negotiations on Border Security Measures Following Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the recently concluded partial government shutdown, President Donald Trump has announced that negotiations with congressional Democrats over border security measures will commence immediately. The President, in a series of tweets on Saturday, expressed caution about the difficulty of reaching a compromise within the next three weeks.\n\nTrump signed a bill on Friday evening to fund the government until February 15, marking the end of the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The bill did not allocate funds for the President's long-standing campaign promise of a wall along the southern border. However, Trump has indicated his intention to secure the necessary funds in upcoming talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).\n\nThe President seems to be using a new caravan of Central American migrants approaching the U.S.-Mexico border as a justification for his proposed wall. In a tweet, he stated, \"If we had a powerful Wall, they wouldn\u2019t even try to make the long and dangerous journey. Build the Wall and Crime will Fall!\"\n\nPrior to 10 a.m. ET on Saturday, the President tweeted seven times, discussing border security five times, Roger Stone's indictment for lying to Congress, and the RNC's pledge of support for the President in 2020.\n\nLater in the day, the President tweeted, \"Only fools, or people with a political agenda, don\u2019t want a Wall or Steel Barrier to protect our Country from Crime, Drugs and Human Trafficking. It will happen - it always does!\"\n\nIn a tweet late on Friday, the President had stated, \"I wish people would read or listen to my words on the Border Wall. This was in no way a concession. It was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the Shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days, if no deal is done, it\u2019s off to the races!\"",
    " Title: Jared Kushner Takes Center Stage in White House Coronavirus Response, Draws Criticism for Lack of Public Health Expertise\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare public appearance, Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, criticized governors on Thursday, stating they lack control over their own supplies of masks and ventilators needed to combat the coronavirus outbreak. During a briefing at the White House, Kushner urged governors and some senators to be more self-reliant and resourceful in their own states rather than relying on the federal government for assistance.\n\nKushner, a real estate executive with no public health expertise, has emerged as a central figure in the administration's efforts to address the coronavirus pandemic. He has been working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to oversee the distribution of critical medical supplies to hospitals and healthcare providers.\n\nKushner's lack of experience has drawn scrutiny, particularly when he referred to the national stockpile of medical supplies as \"our stockpile.\" In response to this, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, told NPR's Here & Now, \"That is absolutely not the way it is supposed to work.\" Kelly stated that the national stockpile was intended to serve as a backup for states, and the Trump administration should have done more to fill it.\n\nA day after Kushner's remarks, language on a government website about the national stockpile was updated to reflect his description. However, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services stated that the department had been using the new language for weeks. The assistant secretary for preparedness and response explained that efforts were made to update the website text a week ago to more clearly explain the role of the Strategic National Stockpile to state and local agencies and the public.\n\nWhen asked about his son-in-law's remarks on Friday, Trump said Kushner was \"talking about our country.\" He added, \"We need it for the government and the federal government, not just the states.\"\n\nKushner's proximity to the president has been a significant factor in his role, as he has been Trump's point person on issues ranging from the Middle East peace process, immigration, and now the response to the coronavirus. Kushner, a real estate developer and scion of the Kushner family, which operates the Kushner Companies, is well-connected and is using those connections to facilitate the response to the outbreak, working with FEMA and the U.S. military.\n\nOn Thursday, Kushner recounted a conversation with Dr. Mitchell Katz, who runs the New York public hospital system, about critical shortages in the system. Kushner secured N95 masks for the system by contacting Admiral Polowczyk, the director of fleet ordnance and supply at the U.S. Fleet Forces Command in Norfolk, Va.\n\nHowever, some experts question Kushner's lack of experience in overseeing responses to emergencies of this scale. Craig Fugate, who ran FEMA during the Obama administration, stated, \"My experience in disasters is the burn rate is always greater than what anybody anticipates.\" Fugate added that if the federal government had waited for states to identify their needs, they would have been behind and not there fast enough.\n\nEthics groups have also raised concerns about Kushner's role in the response, with Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, stating, \"If there was ever a time we need records and transparency, this is it.\" Bookbinder called for understanding who in the White House is making policy decisions, who from private industry is influencing those decisions, and how decisions to address the pandemic are being made.\n\nAndy Slavitt, the Obama-era administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, described the current crisis as an all-hands-on-deck effort. He appreciates Kushner or anyone else in government sharing their expertise, but he emphasized that roles need to be clear and execution much more coordinated. Slavitt stated, \"The issue should be, we don't need five generals. We need somebody in charge.\" He added, \"We need a top-down structure where we get decisions made quickly.\" Slavitt also noted that the military is best positioned to lead the effort.",
    " Title: Obama Visits Orlando, Urges Gun Control Measures After Deadliest U.S. Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, President Barack Obama met with survivors of the Orlando nightclub attack and relatives of the 49 victims on Thursday. The shooting, carried out by a U.S.-born gunman, Omar Mateen, who pledged allegiance to various Islamist militant groups, left 49 dead and 53 injured.\n\nDuring his visit, Obama laid flowers at a memorial for the victims and urged Congress to pass measures to make it harder to legally acquire high-powered weapons like the semi-automatic rifle used in the attack. He expressed his condolences to the grieving families and emphasized the need for the U.S. to address gun violence and homegrown terrorism.\n\nObama and Vice President Joe Biden arrived in Orlando, Florida, four days after the attack. During the shooting rampage, Mateen exchanged text messages with his wife, Noor Salman, as well as posting on Facebook and placing a phone call to a television station. Police killed Mateen, a 29-year-old U.S. citizen born in New York to Afghan immigrants.\n\nThe Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, but U.S. officials have stated that Mateen was not assisted from abroad. CIA Director John Brennan told a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Thursday that the agency had \"not been able to uncover any direct link\" between Mateen and militants abroad.\n\nThe attack sparked a new debate over how the U.S. responds to Islamist militant violence at home and abroad. Republican Senator John McCain stated that Obama is \"directly responsible\" for the Orlando attack due to his failure to prevent the rise of Islamic State. However, McCain later clarified that he was referring to Obama's national security decisions, \"not to the President himself.\"\n\nMateen carried out the attack with an assault weapon and handgun that had been legally purchased, despite being investigated by the FBI for possible connections with militant Islamist groups twice. Obama reiterated his frustration over the failure of Congress to pass any gun control measures in more than two decades.\n\nThe massacre put pressure on Congress to act, and after a series of speeches by Democrats, a Democratic senator said Republicans had agreed to hold votes on measures to expand background checks and prevent people on U.S. terrorism watch lists from buying guns. No formal deal between the parties for votes was announced, and it remains unclear when and how the Senate will proceed with the votes.\n\nSenator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said the chamber would most likely vote on four gun control measures on Monday. The Republican-controlled Senate has previously blocked a number of Democratic-backed gun control measures, citing infringement on Americans' constitutional right to bear arms.\n\nPresumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump also joined the gun debate, announcing on Wednesday he would meet with the National Rifle Association to discuss barring people who are on terrorism watch lists from buying guns.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Activity Marks a Resurgence of Deal-Making in the 113th Congress\n\nThe 113th Congress, following the least productive 112th Congress in over 60 years, is showing signs of increased productivity, despite the ongoing political rancor. The year has seen a series of bipartisan initiatives, including the resolution of the controversial Senate filibuster issue, the passage of the long-delayed Violence Against Women Act, and the avoidance of government shutdowns.\n\nIn March, a bipartisan group of senior senators managed to head off a potential \"nuclear\" showdown over the filibuster, a controversial Senate tool. The Violence Against Women Act, which had been stalled for years, was signed into law in March. More recently, House and Senate lawmakers have worked diligently to keep the government funded through the end of the fiscal year, without the protests that have characterized such measures in recent years.\n\nOn major legislative initiatives, at least some bipartisan activity is underway, even if it is not yielding everything its sponsors would like. From strengthening firearm controls to immigration reform to renewed discussions of a \"grand bargain\" on taxes and entitlement programs, Congress is once again alive with the possibility of compromise.\n\nThe obstacles to congressional deal-making are not unique to the current political climate in Washington. The deep divide among lawmakers reflects the polarization on a wide range of policy and cultural issues that exists among the voters who sent them to Congress. The positions are hardened by deep-pocketed advocacy groups with intense ideological focuses and narrow agendas. Such groups make departing from the party line more dangerous than ever.\n\nThe increasing amount of money needed to run for Congress also means lawmakers spend more time fundraising and less time studying issues or forging relationships with colleagues, the foundation on which deal-making is built. Complicating the impulse to compromise today is the frequency of \"wave\" elections, which have created cliques of lawmakers with seemingly narrow mandates to an extent rarely seen in US history.\n\nMembers elected in such waves \"are really not going to make deals that go against what the people who put them there want [ them ] to do,\" says former Rep. Steven LaTourette (R-OH), a centrist. \"On 'Obamacare,' you do not hear a lot of the 2010 class say, 'Well, let's save the good parts and jettison the rest.' It's'repeal, repeal, repeal,' because that was the war drum on the campaign trail.\"\n\nGiven the tough constraints, today's congressional deal-makers are not coming from either party's moderate wing, as many of them have in the past. Instead, it's up to lawmakers respected on both the left and right, like Republicans Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin or Democrats like Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), to get things done.\n\n\"If you're waiting for the moderates to compromise,\" says former Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT), \"you're going to be waiting quite a while. There are not enough left.\"\n\nGetting those on either end of the political spectrum to sit down together can be aided by political entrepreneurs, like Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), legislators willing to tackle sensitive issues such as immigration and Social Security before their parties are willing to do the same. However, bringing disparate politicians together on new ideas is another matter. That is now often done through old-fashioned bargaining in the backroom, where lawmakers can make the kind of concessions key to compromise.\n\n\"Part of the value [ of such groups ] is they are working on the outlines of what a bargain on any issue would be before it hits the media,\" says Julian Zelizer, a congressional historian at Princeton University. Bipartisan groups \"give some kind of signal to other party members that it's OK\" to depart from orthodoxy.\n\nThe public's general disdain for gridlock and voters' outspokenness on individual issues are other factors that may force more compromise. \"Sometimes deal-makers gain strength when there is some kind of social pressure to do something,\" says Mr. Zelizer.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Divide: Four Republicans and an Independent Break Ranks, Condemning President's Remarks in House Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, only four Republicans and one independent broke ranks to join the Democrats in a House vote on Tuesday, condemning the President's controversial language. This development serves as a stark reminder of the evolution of the Republican Party, once known for its broad tent approach, welcoming to Latino and African-American voters.\n\nThe political landscape, however, has shifted, with party leaders emphasizing messages of patriotism. Some leaders attempted to sidestep the racial implications, while others seemed less concerned about potential backlash.\n\nKellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, spoke out on Fox News, stating, \"Forget these four. They represent a dark underbelly of people in this country. We are sick and tired of people denigrating that American flag, the American military, veterans, and America.\"\n\nOther party members were quick to follow, but sought to reframe and soften the message. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, offered a tutorial in offensive counterattack, saying, \"Our opposition to our socialist colleagues has absolutely nothing to do with their gender, with their religion, or with their race. It has to do with the content of their policies.\"\n\nWith the election still over a year away, the Democrats will eventually have a standard-bearer to define the party in opposition to the President. However, some Democrats express concern that criticism of the four congresswomen may resonate with a segment of their voters and independents, who may share unease with the policies they support and some of their rhetoric, as they do with the President's own bombast.\n\nThe Democrats who performed well in the midterms were those who played down the President while focusing on issues like protecting health insurance for people with pre-existing conditions. Many strategists rallying behind former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. believe the party cannot rely on increased turnout among young people and minorities and needs to win back voters it lost to the President.",
    " Title: GOP Struggles to Gain Support for American Healthcare Act as Vote Nears\n\nArticle:\n\nThe American Healthcare Act (AHCA), the Republican Party's attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), faces an uncertain future as GOP leaders struggle to garner enough support for a vote, initially scheduled for Thursday but now rescheduled for Friday morning. President Trump, according to Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, has urged House Republicans to act swiftly, stating that the time for negotiation is over and if the bill fails this time, they will be stuck with Obamacare.\n\nThe AHCA has faced opposition from both sides of the aisle, with no Democrats expected to support the bill, and detractors within the GOP, particularly among moderates and conservatives. Some conservatives reject the bill due to its failure to deliver a clean repeal of the ACA, with nicknames like \"Obamacare 2.0\" and \"Obamacare Lite\" reflecting their dissatisfaction. Moderates, on the other hand, are concerned that the bill's accelerated timeline for rolling back the ACA's Medicaid expansion could leave too many uninsured.\n\nCritics also argue that the bill does not do enough to address rising premium costs. Over the past week, GOP leaders and the president have offered changes to the bill, including a manager's amendment that tinkered with Medicaid and the IRS code. On Thursday, Republicans discussed removing Obamacare's \"essential benefits,\" such as maternity and prenatal care, preventative care, and other mandatory insurance provisions since the passage of the ACA.\n\nThe stakes are high, with President Trump \"100 percent\" supporting the bill and spending the last few weeks making a hard sell. He has warned Republicans that their seats and the Republican majority are in danger in 2018 if they don't pass the bill. However, reluctant House Republicans may also be considering the Senate's stance, as at least three senators - Rand Paul, Mike Lee, and Tom Cotton - currently oppose the bill. Ted Cruz has also expressed his inability to support the bill as it stands, and four other senators have objected to the bill's treatment of the Medicaid expansion. If three Republican senators vote against the bill, the AHCA will fail in the Senate, which has a slim 52-48 Republican majority.\n\nRepublicans need 215 votes to win passage in the House, due to the absence of Rep. Bobby Rush, a Democrat from Illinois. They can lose no more than 22 votes. The list of House Republicans who have expressed opposition to the bill in its current form is subject to change, with negotiations and potential deals expected in the lead-up to the vote. This article will be updated regularly as members decide on their voting position or change their minds.",
    " Title: House Republicans Abandon Health Care Replacement Bill: \"Obamacare Remains the Law of the Land\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant setback for the Republican Party, House Republicans have abandoned their long-awaited health care replacement bill, effectively leaving the Affordable Care Act, or \"Obamacare,\" as the law of the land.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan admitted defeat on Friday, shortly after he pulled the bill, stating, \"We're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future.\" He further added, \"I do not know how long it's going to take us to replace this law.\"\n\nPresident Trump, while acknowledging the setback, termed it a \"learning experience.\" He also expressed optimism for a potential bipartisan bill in the future, stating, \"Both parties can get together... and have a better bill.\"\n\nHealth care has been put on the backburner, with both Trump and Ryan shifting focus to tax reform. The failure of the health care bill is a significant blow to Trump's leadership and Ryan's ability to control his conference, a challenge that eluded his predecessor, John Boehner, eventually leading to his ouster.\n\nTrump, who entered office without any political or legislative experience, seemed to admit there was a learning curve. He stated, \"This was an interesting period of time... We learned a lot... Certainly, for me, it was a very interesting experience, but for me, it'll be an experience that leads to an even better health care plan.\"\n\nRyan, in a more somber tone, admitted that fulfilling the GOP's pledge to repeal the Affordable Care Act was tougher than expected. He stated, \"Moving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains, and, well, we're feeling those growing pains now.\"\n\nThe way forward for Republicans on exactly how to replace Obamacare remains unclear. It's uncertain whether they will try again. Ryan had already delayed the bill a day to try to muster support. Trump had delivered an ultimatum to House Republicans\u2014pass the GOP replacement, the American Health Care Act, or Obamacare would stand.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, were quick to take a victory lap in the GOP's defeat. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, whose caucus was decimated in 2010 after the health care bill was passed, appeared flanked by Democratic leadership to gloat just a day after the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe inability of Republicans to reach consensus on a bill, given their control of the House, Senate, and White House, badly hurts the GOP's image as a party that can govern. The risks were high for Trump on the bill. His inability to get this through, after giving an ultimatum to congressional Republicans, raises questions about his deal-making abilities and underscores his lack of legislative and policy experience upon entering the White House.",
    " Title: Trump Digs In on Government Shutdown Over Border Wall Funding, Viewing Himself as a \"Border Warrior\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of a series of turbulent events, including a government shutdown, a stock market rout, and Cabinet shakeups, President Donald Trump is resuming his role as a unifying figure for the right, adopting the mantle of a \"border warrior.\"\n\nThe ongoing government shutdown, Trump's third, is a situation he appears to accept, with White House aides reporting that he is willing to let it drag into the new year. This stance is a reflection of his determination not to be perceived as reneging on his central campaign promise to build a border wall, a promise he views as crucial to his reelection bid.\n\nMick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, set the tone for the prolonged standoff during an interview on Fox News, stating, \"I don't think things are going to move very quickly here for the next couple of days.\"\n\nRepublicans are not uniformly falling in line. Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee criticized Trump for failing to avoid the shutdown, dismissing his hardening negotiating posture on immigration as \"a made-up fight so that the president could look like he\u2019s fighting.\"\n\nTrump's aides have attempted to blame the Democrats for the shutdown, despite the president's earlier statements suggesting that he would be proud to shut down the government for border security. However, the president's campaign has seized the opportunity to capitalize on the stalemate, painting him as an authentic promise-keeper.\n\nFor Trump, the border wall is more than just a physical structure. The White House has long seen his \"Build the wall\" promise as an indicator of the extent to which his early pledges could resonate with voters he needs to secure reelection.\n\n\"The wall is important, but it's more the underlying anti-immigrant message that's the key,\" a former White House official said. Trump's team has identified the potential for supporters to doubt his ability to deliver on the wall, and the ongoing shutdown serves as a test of his political will.\n\nThough the wall has yet to be built, the president has been filling the void with words, repeatedly boasting about how much of the wall has already been constructed, even though little, if any, building has occurred during his presidency. The government-funding exercise is one area where Trump has the ultimate say, and for now, it seems to be a function of leverage, which the Democrats currently hold.",
    " Title: House of Representatives Gathers Enough Support for Discharge Petition on DACA, Pushing for Immigration Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the House of Representatives has garnered enough support to force votes on several legislative fixes for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, potentially compelling Republican leaders to take action on immigration.\n\nRep. Jeff Denham (R-CA) has spearheaded the move to secure a majority of House members' signatures on a discharge petition, which, if successful, would bypass Speaker Paul Ryan's (R-WI) opposition and bring immigration bills to the floor for a vote. As of Thursday, Denham reportedly has enough support for the discharge petition, but he continues to negotiate behind closed doors to find a compromise bill that leadership can bring up.\n\nHouse Republican leaders have made it clear that they do not want their members to sign on to the discharge petition. They argue that the process will lead to chaos, guaranteeing that no bill that can pass will become law, and potentially reveal deep discord within the party, especially during a contentious election year.\n\nHowever, support for the petition is growing, with Denham, a California Republican in a Hispanic-heavy district this fall, driving the process. Interestingly, this is not the only instance this week where members have pushed past leadership's timeline.\n\nOn Wednesday, a bipartisan group of senators defied Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and voted to overturn the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) controversial ruling to dismantle net neutrality. The vote to reinstate the Obama-era net neutrality rules won the support of 49 Democrats, as well as three Republican senators: Susan Collins (R-ME), John Kennedy (R-LA), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK).\n\nThe fight to reinstate net neutrality will have a difficult road ahead, as it must be voted on and passed in the House and signed by the president (or gain a veto-proof majority). President Trump has expressed opposition to net neutrality.\n\nIn another sign of frustration, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) invoked an obscure Senate rule on Thursday to try to put a House-passed sexual harassment and discrimination bill on the Senate calendar without McConnell's support. The bill would overhaul how harassment complaints are made in Congress and make lawmakers personally accountable for paying settlements.\n\nThe legislation, a version of which the House passed 100 days ago, has been stalled in the Senate while negotiators iron out some details in the language. However, many, like Gillibrand, have grown impatient.\n\nThese events demonstrate that regular members can take control and force leadership's hand, but it is not always easy. In the past week, we have seen three different methods put into action: the Congressional Review Act, Rule 14 in the Senate, and a discharge petition in the House.\n\nWhile these methods are at lawmakers' disposal to buck leadership, they don't always happen. The reasons range from strong top-down party control, a desire to show a unified front, and a message that anything pushing the envelope could put the majority at risk.\n\n\"Members who theoretically want to advance an agenda aren't doing so, because they think the majority is very important,\" said James Wallner, a political scientist and former executive director of the Senate Steering Committee. \"But at a certain point, that all comes to head.\"\n\n\"You can't bottle up stuff forever,\" Wallner said. \"It keeps getting worse. At some point, things have to change. There is always another election\u2014and then when that happens, we are not going to get it, we are never going to get it, because the parties aren't unified.\"",
    " Title: Lori Lightfoot Makes History as First Black Woman and Openly Gay Mayor of Chicago\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic victory, former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot has been elected as the new Mayor of Chicago, becoming the first black woman and openly gay individual to lead the third-largest city in the United States. Lightfoot defeated Toni Preckwinkle, a longtime political insider and Cook County Board president, in Tuesday's mayoral race.\n\nLightfoot, who has never been elected to public office, delivered a commanding victory over Preckwinkle, who served in the City Council for 19 years. The former prosecutor ran on a platform of ridding City Hall of corruption and addressing the needs of low-income and working-class residents who, she argued, had been neglected by Chicago's political ruling class.\n\nAt her victory party, Lightfoot pledged to break the city's cycle of corruption and ensure that a resident's zip code would no longer determine their destiny. She also emphasized the importance of racial equality, stating that Chicago was a city where race and sexual orientation no longer mattered.\n\nLightfoot emerged as the front-runner in the first round of voting in February, when 14 candidates were vying to succeed Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who decided against running for a third term. Chicago will become the largest U.S. city to elect a black woman as mayor when Lightfoot is sworn in May 20.\n\nThe election took place just days after Chicago state prosecutors dropped charges against actor Jussie Smollett, who was accused of faking a hate-crime attack that implicated supporters of President Trump. The decision to drop the charges has sparked controversy, with some criticizing the prosecutors' decision and others accusing Smollett of exploiting the incident for personal gain.\n\nLightfoot seized on the shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald, which led to the conviction of white officer Jason Van Dyke, to launch her campaign. The incident, which occurred before Emanuel announced he would not seek a third term, was a significant factor in the election.\n\nThe campaign between Lightfoot and Preckwinkle was marked by personal attacks and negative advertising. Preckwinkle's advertising focused on Lightfoot's work as a partner at Mayer Brown, a large law firm, and portrayed her as a wealthy corporate lawyer. Preckwinkle also tried to cast Lightfoot as an insider for working in police oversight posts under Emanuel and former Mayor Richard M. Daley.\n\nIn one ad, Preckwinkle criticized Lightfoot's oversight of emergency communications in 2004 when a fire killed four children. The ad noted some of the 911 tapes were destroyed, prompting a judge to rebuke Lightfoot. The ad sparked a backlash from the family of three of the children killed, with their sister accusing Preckwinkle of trying to take advantage of her family's tragedy.\n\nDespite the contentious campaign, both candidates expressed similar ideas to boost the city's finances, including support for a casino in Chicago and a graduated income tax system. They also shared a focus on addressing neighborhood growth, investing in schools, affordable housing, and criminal justice reform.\n\nJoyce Ross, a 64-year-old certified nursing assistant living on the West Side, cast her ballot for Lightfoot, citing the former prosecutor's potential to clean up the police department and curb the city's violence. Ross also expressed concern over Preckwinkle's association with Alderman Ed Burke, who was indicted earlier this year on charges he tried to shake down a restaurant owner who wanted to build in his ward.\n\nAs Chicago's new mayor, Lightfoot will face numerous challenges, including addressing the city's financial problems, high levels of gun violence, and restoring the public's faith in government. However, with her commanding victory and the support of voters from every part of the city, Lightfoot is poised to make history and lead Chicago into a new era.",
    " Title: Kentucky Senator Rand Paul Stages Record-Breaking Filibuster on Drone Strikes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unprecedented move, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul staged a nearly 13-hour filibuster in the Senate on Wednesday, voicing concerns over the potential danger of drone strikes on U.S. citizens on American soil. The filibuster, which began at 11:47 a.m. and ended at about 12:39 a.m. on Thursday, disrupted the Senate's agenda, preventing a potential vote on President Barack Obama's nominee to run the CIA, John Brennan.\n\nSenator Paul, a self-proclaimed libertarian, seized control of the Senate, leading a bloc of conservatives in a successful bid to delay the confirmation vote for Brennan. Paul's prolonged speech forced the Senate to postpone the vote, effectively removing it from the day's agenda.\n\nIn his impassioned speech, Paul expressed his concerns about the potential use of drones against American citizens on U.S. soil and the lack of transparency regarding drone policy. As the day progressed, several of Paul's colleagues, as well as one Democrat, joined him in voicing their concerns.\n\nBy nightfall, Paul's effort had garnered the support of more of his colleagues, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who joined him on the floor. Other senators, such as Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Tim Scott of South Carolina, and Jeff Flake of Arizona, used their time to discuss issues ranging from the dysfunctional Senate and the national debt to the essential issue of liberty and the question of drone policy.\n\nDespite the long hours on his feet, Paul admitted to reporters that he had not prepared extensively for the filibuster. He joked about his lack of comfortable shoes and his need for water, but he did employ some strategy, such as frequent visits to the candy drawer to keep his energy up.\n\nThe filibuster, while surprising to many senators who were prepared to confirm Brennan earlier in the day, ultimately served to highlight the growing concerns about drone policy and the need for transparency in government operations. The Senate is expected to reconvene to discuss the matter further in the coming days.",
    " Title: Trump Proposes $8.6 Billion for Border Wall in 2020 Budget, Sparking Potential Funding Standoff with Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced his intention to request $8.6 billion for his long-promised border wall with Mexico in his 2020 congressional budget, a move that could ignite another funding standoff with Congress. The proposed budget is set to be submitted on Monday.\n\nAccording to a senior administration official, the $8.6 billion would be used to build or replace approximately 700 miles of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. The figure was confirmed by Reuters, who also reported that the funding for the wall would pull $5 billion from the Department of Homeland Security budget and $3.6 billion from the military construction budget at the Pentagon.\n\nThe budget proposal also includes $3.6 million in military construction funding to help fund projects affected by the wall. In addition to wall funding, Trump's proposal calls for the hiring of an additional 2,800 law enforcement and other personnel to reinforce the border and 100 immigration judge teams.\n\nThe proposal is expected to face stiff opposition in the Democrat-held House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) indicated in a statement that the president's $8.6 billion ask is a non-starter.\n\n\"President Trump hurt millions of Americans and caused widespread chaos when he recklessly shut down the government to try to get his expensive and ineffective wall, which he promised would be paid for by Mexico,\" the Democratic leaders said. \"Congress refused to fund his wall and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government. The same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again,\" they added.\n\nCongress must approve funding for fiscal 2020 by Oct. 1, or funding could lapse, and the government could shut down. Trump's requests for border funding have shifted during his time in office as he seeks to fulfill a signature campaign promise.\n\nThe administration's proposal for fiscal year 2019 sought $18 billion for the wall, including $1.6 billion to construct 65 miles in south Texas. The president in December triggered a partial government shutdown when he demanded $5.7 billion in wall funding. Trump agreed after 35 days to reopen the government without wall funding, but continued to press lawmakers for $5.7 billion for the structure. Congress ultimately approved $1.375 billion for border barriers, and the president issued a national emergency to bypass Congress and spend roughly $8 billion to construct his long-desired border wall.\n\nIn making the emergency declaration, the president said he planned to redirect $3.6 billion in military construction funding toward the border project. He also said he would take separate executive action to repurpose about $2.5 billion from the Defense Department's drug-interdiction program and $600 million from the Treasury Department's asset-forfeiture fund.\n\nThe national emergency has drawn pushback from Congress, with the House voting to approve a resolution that would terminate the emergency, and the Senate expected to do the same this week. The Senate vote would set Trump up for the first veto of his presidency, with neither chamber likely to override it.\n\nTrump has made construction of a wall along the southern border a key agenda item since he launched his campaign in 2015. His inability to complete the task has prompted criticism from immigration hard-liners, though Trump has insisted the wall is being built, and he has transitioned his mantra from \"Build the wall\" to \"Finish the wall.\"\n\nLarry Kudlow, Trump's top economic adviser, acknowledged on \"Fox News Sunday\" that the request for wall funding is likely to spur yet another fight with Congress, but he depicted it as a necessary one.\n\n\"I would just say that the whole issue of the wall and border security is of paramount importance,\" Kudlow said Sunday. \"We have to be much tougher and have more constructive immigration policy, which we will be developing. (Trump) is going to stay with his wall. He's going to stay with the border security theme. I think it's essential.\"",
    " Title: Democrats Kick Off National Convention in Charlotte, Emphasizing Middle-Out Economic Approach\n\nThe Democratic National Convention commenced in Charlotte, North Carolina on Tuesday, with the party's leaders emphasizing a clear plan to restore the nation's economic stability. Antonio Villaraigosa, the convention's chair, stated during a press briefing that by the convention's conclusion on Thursday, the Democrats will have defined their platform and presented a stark contrast between their candidate's middle-out economic strategy and the top-down approach of the Republican nominee.\n\nVillaraigosa's remarks echoed themes expressed by President Obama in recent interviews, such as his conversation with Time magazine, where he underscored the importance of articulating his policies and the contrasting approach of the Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney.\n\nAlice Germond, the Democratic National Committee Secretary, reiterated the party's pride in Obama's accomplishments during her remarks at the media briefing. In response to perceived GOP secrecy regarding their platform, Germond noted that by the end of the convention, everyone will have a copy of the Democratic platform.\n\nVillaraigosa indicated that the upcoming days would serve to remind the nation of Obama's first-term achievements, such as preventing an economic catastrophe, saving the auto industry, and passing the landmark healthcare law.\n\nBen LaBolt, the Obama campaign's National Press Secretary, addressed a recently released Gallup poll indicating tepid responses to Romney's acceptance speech. LaBolt stated that the American public is seeking solutions to secure the middle class, and the GOP convention's attacks against Obama were merely recycled and debunked.\n\nLaBolt expressed that the Democrats would use the convention to address these concerns and engage in an honest conversation about the nation's state in 2008. He emphasized that the Democrats have made progress and that the president will outline his plans to continue this progress in his Thursday evening speech.",
    " Title: Obama's Controversial Last-Minute Actions: A Look at the Commutation of Chelsea Manning's Sentence and the UN Resolution on Israel\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final days of his presidency, Barack Obama took actions that were met with surprise and criticism, with two of the most notable being the commutation of Chelsea Manning's sentence and the passing of a UN resolution critical of Israel.\n\nThe commutation of Manning's sentence, a former Army intelligence analyst who was convicted of leaking classified documents to WikiLeaks, was a move that was widely criticized as a finger-in-the-eye willfulness. Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison for stealing and releasing almost half a million military reports and another quarter-million State Department documents. The documents were said to have jeopardized the lives of American troops, allies, and interests.\n\nThe other controversial action occurred four weeks earlier when the United States, for the first time in nearly a half-century, abandoned Israel on a crucial Security Council resolution, allowing the passage of a condemnation that will plague both Israel and its citizens for years to come.\n\nThe Obama administration's actions have been criticized as hypocritical, given the president's previous stance on WikiLeaks and the harm inflicted by its release of stolen materials during the election campaign. The release of Manning's documents was said to have caused harm to American troops, allies, and interests, while the material released by WikiLeaks during the election campaign was primarily campaign gossip, backbiting, indiscretions, and cynicism, with no national-security secrets or classified material.\n\nThe other last-minute Obama bombshell occurred four weeks earlier when, for the first time in nearly a half-century, the United States abandoned Israel on a crucial Security Council resolution, allowing the passage of a condemnation that will plague both Israel and its citizens for years to come.\n\nThe Obama administration's actions have been interpreted as a move to curry favor with the international Left, given the president's potential future role as a leader on the international stage. However, a more likely explanation is that these are acts not of calculation but of authenticity, with Obama being true to his political beliefs and values.\n\nThe actions taken by President Obama in his final days in office have sparked debate and controversy, with critics arguing that they were hypocritical and harmful, while supporters argue that they were authentic and in line with the president's political beliefs and values.",
    " Title: US Secretary of State John Kerry Pursues Coalition to Counter Islamic State in Middle East and Europe\n\nArticle:\n\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry is currently in Saudi Arabia, engaging in talks to form a broad coalition of partners in the fight against the Islamic State, as part of a strategy unveiled by President Obama in his national address on Tuesday. The talks, which include a diverse group of Middle Eastern nations, aim to secure support for establishing military bases and overflight for airstrikes, as well as improved coordination to halt the flow of funds to extremist groups.\n\nAccording to a senior US State Department official, Kerry will focus on stopping ISIL oil smuggling through the Jordanian and Turkish borders, where authorities have pledged to take action, but the US will work closely with them over the next few weeks on intelligence sharing and border control.\n\nHowever, the formation of this broad partnership to combat militants in Iraq and Syria faces several challenges. One of the main questions is whether all countries can be persuaded to join, and what the potential unintended consequences of such a coalition might be. The talks today involve leaders from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Jordan, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar.\n\nPresident Obama stated last night that the US will be joined by a broad coalition of partners, and Secretary Kerry will travel across the Middle East and Europe in the coming days to enlist more partners in this fight, particularly Arab nations who can help mobilize Sunni communities in Iraq and Syria to drive the Islamic State from their lands.\n\nSaudi Arabia's agreement to host training camps for \"moderate Syrian rebels\" is seen as a sign of support, given Saudi Arabia's religious significance among Sunnis, and the Islamic State fighters are also Sunni. However, the challenges do not end there. Many of the countries crucial to the coalition are deeply skeptical of the US's commitment to follow through on its promises to eliminate the Islamic State, after it hesitated to launch airstrikes last year against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe US's coalition-building efforts are complex, as these countries have favored various anti-Assad rebels, but also Islamist groups that have spawned the Islamic State and other jihadi groups that are now beyond their control. This complicates any US-led coalition against radicalism.\n\nAs Secretary Kerry moves on to Europe, he should receive a warmer response from governments concerned about the fact that hundreds of Europeans have left to fight in Syria. At the NATO Summit in Wales last week, the US had support from Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Australia, Turkey, Italy, Poland, and Denmark.\n\nFrance has been the most public in its support so far, pledging to act in an international coalition if international law is followed. French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius will travel to Baghdad tomorrow, before France hosts a conference in Paris on Monday to coordinate efforts to tackle the Islamic State.\n\n\"An international mobilization is necessary to respond to this trans-national danger that can reach our territory,\" Mr. Fabius said, according to Reuters. \"In Iraq, the government and minorities have called for help, and we answered with deliveries of military equipment and humanitarian aid.\"\n\nThis week, the UK announced it would send a limited amount of arms to Kurds in Iraq to fight the Islamic State. Germany also agreed to do the same. In a Guardian opinion piece, Hayder al-Khoei, an associate fellow on the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, argued that \"the UK should be an important player in the international coalition that Obama is trying to set up to confront the most dangerous terrorist organization of the 21st century.\"",
    " Title: George Papadopoulos Labeled as \"Proactive Cooperator\" in Mueller Investigation Sparks Speculation of Undercover Work\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent court filing, George Papadopoulos, the former Trump campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, has been identified as a \"proactive cooperator\" by federal investigators. This term, as explained by a 2001 federal court case, generally implies that the defendant will engage in undercover work on behalf of the government, such as wearing a wire and/or meeting face-to-face with persons suspected of involvement in criminal activity.\n\nAt a plea hearing held on Oct. 5, Aaron Zelinsky, a prosecutor in the Office of the Special Counsel Robert Mueller, shed light on Papadopoulos' cooperation. Zelinsky stated that at Papadopoulos' sentencing, prosecutors would make note of his \"efforts to cooperate with the Government\" as long as he continued \"to meet with and provide information to the Government on request.\"\n\nPapadopoulos was arrested on July 27 on charges that he lied to FBI agents during a Jan. 27 interview. Agents met with Papadopoulos as part of the bureau's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. As part of his plea deal, Papadopoulos acknowledged that he lied to agents during that meeting about his interactions with three Russian nationals.\n\nPapadopoulos discussed arranging meetings between Russian government officials and the Trump campaign. One of Papadopoulos' contacts also told him in April that the Russian government had obtained \"thousands\" of Hillary Clinton's emails.\n\nThe White House downplayed the revelations, stating that Papadopoulos played a small part on the campaign and that the Trump team did not collude with the Russian government. The revelation that Papadopoulos was serving as a \"proactive cooperator\" has sparked widespread speculation about the extent of his cooperation with the Mueller team.\n\nRon Hosko, a former assistant director of the FBI's criminal division, suggests that it is possible that Papadopoulos wore a wire as part of his cooperation agreement. \"I think it's a fair assessment that it means Mueller and Co. might have been working with [Papadopoulos] to engage other subjects in conversation along the lines suggested in the article,\" said Hosko, referring to the possibility of Papadopoulos wearing a wire.\n\nLegal analyst Jeffrey Toobin also believes that the government's disclosure strongly suggests that Papadopoulos was wearing a wire or recording conversations with Trump associates. \"What this says to me is that Papadopoulos between July and October was wearing a wire. He was recording conversations secretly with people who are subjects and targets of this investigation,\" said Toobin. He added, \"If he was wearing a wire, this summer and fall, think about that, just weeks ago, that is a whole new chapter of possibilities in this investigation and potentially a very, very big deal.\"",
    " Title: Senate Judiciary Committee Prepares for Barr's Attorney General Confirmation Hearing Amidst Focus on Mueller's Russia Investigation\n\nAs the Senate Judiciary Committee prepares for the confirmation hearing of William Barr's nomination for attorney general, the special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation will likely take center stage. Several Senate Democrats on the committee plan to question Barr on his views regarding Mueller's investigation, particularly a controversial memo Barr wrote last year criticizing Mueller's investigation into possible obstruction of justice.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday stated that Barr should be disqualified from leading the Department of Justice due to the memo. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) has expressed concerns about political interference in the special counsel's probe and has stated that Barr should recuse himself from overseeing the investigation if he cannot provide an \"ironclad\" commitment to protecting Mueller and disavow statements made in the memo.\n\nThe nomination battle for Barr comes at a critical juncture in Donald Trump's presidency, with the Justice Department in transition and Mueller's probe entering its 20th month. The investigation has resulted in seven guilty pleas and a conviction of the president's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. Trump has repeatedly denounced the Mueller investigation, labeling it a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nA bipartisan group of senators is also reintroducing a bill to protect Mueller, though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to bring the bill up for a floor vote. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) have expressed concerns about Barr's views on the Mueller investigation and the departure of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is reportedly leaving the Justice Department after a new attorney general is confirmed.\n\nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee don't appear to have a unified strategy for the nomination hearing, with some senators focusing on meeting with Barr and asking their own questions. Despite potential Democratic attacks, Senate Republicans remain confident that Barr will be confirmed, particularly given that they expanded their majority during the midterm election.\n\nBarr met with Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and former Committee Chair Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Wednesday. Graham stated that during their meeting, Barr reassured him of his respect for Mueller. Graham also expressed support for bringing up the Mueller protection bill in his committee if the probe is still ongoing next month.\n\nNot all Republicans are on board with Barr's nomination, with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) expressing concerns about Barr's views on civil liberties. However, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) doesn't see Barr's memo to Rosenstein on the Mueller investigation as disqualifying, noting that Barr wrote the memo as a private citizen.",

The enrollment period begins on November 15, with those renewing their policies required to sign up by December 15 to ensure coverage by the new year.\n\nThe specifics of the renewal process are yet to be determined, according to Paula Steiner, chief strategy officer for Health Care Service Corporation, which offers Blue Cross plans in five states. \"We're still waiting on the details of the process,\" Steiner said. \"We haven't gone through any testing yet of any changes to the system for 2015.\"\n\nAndrew Slavitt, principal deputy administrator for Medicare, which oversees the insurance marketplaces, expressed optimism about the renewal process. \"We're putting in place the simplest path for consumers this year to renew their coverage,\" he said. Those who prefer to stay with the same plan will be able to renew automatically, as many do with employer coverage. Renewal can be done with \"absolutely nothing,\" he added.\n\nThe federal online marketplace is being continuously improved, according to Slavitt, who stated that the government was updating the website to allow renewals. \"We're in a very different position than we were last year,\" he said.\n\nCompared with the previous year, 30 carriers have requested entrance into the marketplaces for 2015, and 1.6 times more plans are being offered, according to McKinsey & Company's Center for US Health System Reform. Prices for 2015 are expected to remain varied, with some plans increasing by about 30 percent while others decrease by the same amount, depending on the market and policy. \"We are definitely seeing a lot of volatility in pricing,\" said Erica Hutchins Coe, a McKinsey expert.",
    " Title: Ferguson October: A Wake-Up Call for America\n\nArticle:\n\nThis past weekend, protestors and activists, including students, clergy, and concerned citizens, descended on Ferguson, Missouri, for a weekend of marches, protests, sit-ins, and civil disobedience, collectively known as Ferguson October. Yesterday, as one activist, Patrisse Cullors-Brignac, an organizer with Black Lives Matter, tweeted exultantly from the inside of a St. Louis County jail cell about having taken over a Wal-Mart, I waited to hear news of her safe release alongside rapper-activist Tef Poe, attorney and legal observer Justin Hansford, and Palestinian activist Bassem Masri, who handled live streaming for the Organization for Black Struggle.\n\nThe actions of these activists have sparked debate on social media, with some questioning the appropriateness of disturbing the peace in a private business. However, the message is clear - we are no longer content with business as usual. The tragic shooting of John Crawford in a Beaver Creek, Ohio Wal-Mart, who could not expect to come out alive while shopping, suggests that it is time for a change.\n\nThis nation has long proclaimed Black America as backwards, stuck in the past, and obsessed with race rather than racism itself. However, Black people are the hands on our national clock, controlling the timing of America's social progress. This time, both hands are up, pointing to the sky. It is high noon in America, the deepest midnight in our hearts. But, as Lucy A. Delaney proclaimed in her 1891 autobiography, \"from the darkness cometh the light.\"\n\nYoung people are on the ground dreaming new dreams, and in doing so, they are inspiring elders. They are creative, taking over public spaces not only with signs and chants but with impromptu games of twister and double-dutch. From them, we learn that play can be political, that there is joy in struggle, that there is no justice without pleasure.\n\nThey are lining up, linking arms, and being locked up for justice. They are listening to those who have something to say and shutting down events when forced to listen to anyone who doesn't. They are choosing their leaders, their griots, their truth-tellers, their strategists, their elders. Showing up matters most. Putting one's body on the line is the order of the day.\n\nThis weekend, they took over four Wal-Marts, in solidarity with John Crawford who was murdered in an Ohio Wal-Mart. Prosecutors have cleared officers of wrongdoing. Protestors took signs to the St. Louis Rams game, and confronted angry fans who yelled, \"I am Darren Wilson.\" Two weeks ago, they disrupted the symphony. Exploding dreams cause disruptions. They should be expected to continue.\n\nMore than 3000 new registered voters move among them (Update: This number has since been revised downward to 128). They have collected these new registrations like so many arrows in a quiver. Still, they remain skeptical of the vote. And since the presence of Black faces at the voting booth scares white people, they should be.\n\nTake Tef Poe's surly response to Senator Claire McCaskill at a PBS townhall in late September. She argued that we needed new pipelines of local African American leadership. He replied, \"I voted for Barack Obama twice, and still got tear-gassed.\"\n\nWe could mince words about the vast differences and expansive power of local governments in these matters, over against the apparently limited power of federal jurisdiction. But that's kind of beside the point. Movements are as much about symbols as about substance. Barack Obama is a broken symbol, a clanging cymbal, unable to say and do anything of use. His silence is the sound of imploding dreams, his words mere distractions and detours from the future we want.\n\nHe has become a prime example that being the leader of the free world in a Black body is still no match for entrenched, local, systemic, committed racism. It's sad that it has come to this. But this is bigger than Barack Obama. Just like it was bigger than King and his dream. We have awakened from sleep. We have been startled out of it by nearly 30 gunshots ringing out insistently from the heart of America. Jay-Z might call it \"a moment of clarity.\"\n\nIn Obama's place, Cornel West has re-emerged, the wise and fearless elder, the one who we tried not to listen to, as he screamed into the wind for six years, the one whose approach chafed my hide on more than a few occasions, the one who is - despite all of our collective quibbles and begrudgements \u2013 right.\n\nThis moment is about all of us. About what kind of America we want to be. About what kind of America we are willing to be, willing to fight for. About whether we will settle for being mediocre and therefore murderous to a whole group of citizens. About whether there are other versions of ourselves worth fighting for.\n\nDon't sleep. Millennials, it seems, are the ones we have been waiting for. Fearless and focused, the future they are fighting for is one I want. It is high time to awake out of sleep. Stay woke.",
    " Title: Mayorkas Denies Allegations of Improper Visa Aid at Homeland Security Confirmation Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated confirmation hearing on Thursday, Alejandro Mayorkas, President Obama's nominee for the No. 2 spot at the Department of Homeland Security, unequivocally denied allegations that he improperly helped a company run by Hillary Clinton's brother obtain a visa. The hearing was boycotted by Republicans, who called for a postponement due to an ongoing investigation into Mayorkas' actions.\n\nMayorkas, the current director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. He stated that he \"made no orders\" in these cases and that he only offers guidance based on the \"facts\" and \"the law.\"\n\n\"I have never, ever in my career exercised undue influence to influence the outcome of a case,\" he said. Mayorkas also claimed he had \"no idea\" he was under investigation and \"quite frankly, I still don't understand it.\"\n\nThe investigation, led by the department's inspector general, is examining Mayorkas' role in helping secure a foreign investor visa for Tony Rodham's Gulf Coast Funds Management, even after the application was denied and an appeal rejected. The international investor visa program run by USCIS, known as EB-5, allows foreigners to get visas if they invest $500,000 to $1 million in projects or businesses that create jobs for U.S. citizens.\n\nIn a statement, the inspector general's office confirmed that it is investigating Mayorkas' role in the visa case, but initially, he was not a target of the investigation. As the probe progressed, the office stated that \"subsequent allegations have been identified involving alleged conflicts of interest, misuse of position, mismanagement of the EB-5 program, and an appearance of impropriety by Mayorkas and other USCIS management officials.\"\n\nThe hearing was largely friendly towards Mayorkas, as he dealt with questions from Senate Democrats. Republicans boycotted the hearing, after having tried unsuccessfully to get it postponed. In a statement, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said, \"I cannot participate in a hearing I believe to be unfair and improper to all parties involved.\"\n\nRepublicans, in a letter to committee Chairman Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., claimed the news of the investigation took them by surprise. They said neither the White House nor Mayorkas had disclosed the existence of the probe to them before. The letter was signed by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.; Rob Portman, R-Ohio; Ron Johnson, R-Wis.; and Coburn. They argued that lawmakers would be hamstrung in asking about an ongoing investigation during the hearing, yet would need to know those details in order to fairly consider the nomination.\n\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, also wrote committee leaders asking for a postponement \"until the facts are more fully developed.\" The White House is standing by Mayorkas, with White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler assuring that the nominee underwent a \"thorough\" FBI background check before the nomination, and they have no concerns about his suitability for the position.\n\nThe investigation does not appear to have any direct ties to Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. However, any connection to Clinton, who is a possible 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, is likely to become fodder for Republican super PACs. The nomination took on new importance earlier this month when Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced she would be leaving the department in September to take over as president of the University of California. If approved by the Senate, Mayorkas would likely lead the department until a permanent replacement for Napolitano is named.",
    " Title: Congress Explores Legislative Options to Halt President Obama's Immigration Executive Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could potentially alter the course of President Obama's executive action on immigration, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) has concluded that Congress has the power to halt the president's proposed actions by denying him funding. This development comes as Congress prepares for a two-week sprint to conclude its current session, with the annual spending bills, the response to Mr. Obama's immigration moves, and the annual defense policy bill being among the key issues lawmakers must address.\n\nRepresentative Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who recently ascended to the Senate, has emphasized the need for Congress to assert its authority. In a recent appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" he argued that the employment situation alone should motivate Congress to block the president's executive action.\n\nCotton stated, \"The president just lost an election, in no small measure because wages for working families are declining and unemployment is still too high in too many places, and the first big action he took after the election was to make it easier for illegal immigrants to get jobs, not for working families to get jobs.\"\n\nCotton suggested several strategies for lawmakers to employ against the president on immigration, including tying all of this year's spending bills to a decision to block the deportation amnesty, tying only homeland security money to the deportation amnesty, and pushing the issue into next year, when Republicans will control both the House and Senate.\n\nThe CRS, in its letter to Senator Jeff Sessions, acknowledged that while the annual spending process may not be able to curb the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a fee-based agency handling most of the president's amnesty, it does not mean Congress has no power over fee-based agencies. The CRS stated that the Supreme Court has established that Congress can dictate how an agency spends, as all government revenue, even when collected by a fee-based agency, technically goes to the overall fund and is reappropriated to the agency.\n\nWith the December 11 shutdown date looming, Republican leaders are grappling with decisions over which issues to address now, while Democrats retain control of the Senate, and which issues to defer until the next Congress, when Republicans will have at least 53 seats and control of the Senate and a larger House majority. The upcoming tax and spending deadlines, as well as President Obama's call for expanding the war in Iraq to combat Islamic State terrorists, also pose significant challenges for Congress. The House Republicans are also seeking to pass a bill to grant tax incentives allowing the disabled to stow money tax-free. The House and Senate may also confront the thorny issue of detainees at Guantanamo Bay when Congress tackles the annual defense policy bill.",
    " Title: Analyzing the Presidential Debate: A Closer Look at the Economic Narratives of Obama and Romney\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the presidential race heats up, the economic narratives of both candidates, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, are taking center stage. In an interview, former President Bill Clinton and Charlotte Beers, a Democratic strategist, discussed the Democratic narrative that Obama is being held to impossibly high expectations when it comes to jobs and economic growth.\n\nClinton argued that Obama inherited a disastrous economic situation and kept it from getting worse. He emphasized that the economy is improving, and no one could have done better under the circumstances. This narrative, Clinton stated, is not just his, but a consensus view that even Romney, the Republican candidate, cannot refute.\n\nRomney, on the other hand, has been criticizing the Obama administration's handling of the economy, arguing that the economy is in terrible shape. Clinton suggested that Romney's strategy is to focus on the economy, as the incumbent always owns the economy, and he will criticize the president's economic policies.\n\nOne point of contention is the idea that Obama made the economic situation worse, a narrative that has been circulating for over a year. Clinton argued that this narrative is incorrect, as Obama's actions have made things better, not worse.\n\nAnother point of discussion is the high unemployment rate, which includes those who have given up looking for work. Critics argue that this statistic should be taken into account when evaluating Obama's job creation record.\n\nClinton also pointed out that the upcoming presidential debates, starting in October, will be Romney's best opportunity to turn things around. He suggested that the debates will be closely watched by undecided voters and will provide an opportunity for Romney to surprise and demonstrate his Likability.\n\nIn conclusion, the economic narratives of both candidates will be a significant factor in the upcoming presidential debates. The debates will be a crucial opportunity for Romney to change the current narrative and present his vision for the economy. The debates will also provide a chance for voters to evaluate the candidates' Likability and make their decision before the election.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans and Democrats Negotiate Stimulus Package Details as Coronavirus Aid Bill Progresses\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to alleviate the economic impact of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Senate Republicans released a $1-trillion economic stimulus plan last Thursday. The proposal includes a $1,200 payment for each individual or $2,400 for joint returns, with an additional $500 for each qualifying child. However, Senate Democrats have blocked the bill, expressing concerns over its corporate-friendly provisions and insufficient support for working families.\n\nAs negotiations continue, Senate Democrats have outlined several key requirements to pass the bill. These include:\n\n1. Invoking the Defense Production Act by President Donald Trump to compel private companies to manufacture essential medical equipment such as respirators and masks.\n2. Allocating nearly $40 billion to help states maintain school funding and support colleges during the crisis.\n3. Providing billions in grant funding to states for holding elections, with a focus on expanding early, absentee, and mail voting.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed optimism about reaching a deal, stating, \"We're very close to reaching a deal... Our goal is to reach a deal today. And we\u2019re hopeful, even confident, that we will meet that goal.\" However, Schumer emphasized the importance of getting the details right.\n\nThe current proposal suggests individuals would receive up to $1,200 (or $2,400 for joint returns) with no less than $600 (or $1,200 for joint returns). Families would receive an additional $500 for each qualifying child. The income limit for individuals is set at $75,000, and $150,000 for joint returns. The amount individuals receive would be reduced by 5% for every dollar of income exceeding these thresholds.\n\nThe federal government is expected to use tax filings to determine eligibility for stimulus checks. Filing 2019 taxes is encouraged, and receiving a refund or owing money to the Internal Revenue Service will not affect the stimulus check. The current proposal is for a one-time lump sum payment, but a second stimulus check could still be considered if economic conditions do not improve.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has stated that, once Congress passes the bill, the payments will be distributed within three weeks. However, specific dates are subject to change during the appropriations process in Congress. Individuals with direct deposit set up with the IRS can expect their payments sooner than those who receive checks by mail.\n\nThe last time the federal government sent checks to Americans was in 2008, under President George W. Bush, with the Economic Stimulus Act providing tax rebates of up to $600 for individuals and $1,200 for married couples, with additional rebates for families with children. The payments did not start until late April.\n\nThe aid package signed by Trump on Wednesday, known as \"phase two,\" includes paid sick and family leave, free coronavirus testing, and enhanced unemployment insurance. Student loan interest payments are also on hold, with payments suspended until further notice. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has also announced it will suspend foreclosures and evictions on FHA-insured mortgages.\n\nAs the situation evolves, it is essential to stay informed about the latest financial assistance efforts from the government.

    " Title: California's AB5 Bill Threatens to Reshape Gig Economy, Heads to Governor's Desk\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia lawmakers have passed a significant bill, Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), which could potentially transform the business models of companies like Uber and Lyft. The bill, which was passed in the state Assembly on Wednesday and now heads to Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom's desk, aims to reclassify gig economy workers as employees instead of contractors.\n\nThe legislation, authored by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego), passed in the state Assembly in a 61-16 vote. It follows the bill's passage in the state Senate on Tuesday.\n\nUber and Lyft, however, maintain that AB5 will not immediately change the status of independent contractors to employees. Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer, stated on a call with reporters that the bill builds on legal tests already established in California regarding worker classification. West suggested that drivers may not necessarily fall under the new rules outlined in AB5.\n\nUnder the three-part test, companies must prove that contractors are doing work \"outside the usual course\" of their business. West explained that several previous rulings have found that drivers' work is outside the usual course of Uber's business, which is serving as a technology platform for various digital marketplaces.\n\nWest stated that Uber intends to comply with AB5 should it become law next year, but the company will continue to argue that it does not fall under the bill's legal framework. He warned that unsuccessful challenges to AB5 could result in costs to Uber's business.\n\nUber and Lyft have informed drivers that they may need to implement shifts if workers are classified as employees. This would limit when ride-hailing drivers can start and stop accepting rides. In a notice to drivers, Lyft also stated that drivers might only be allowed to work for one ride-hailing service at a time.\n\nWest noted that there would be significant changes in the way drivers interact with the platform, and these changes are not ones that drivers would welcome, according to their feedback. He added that he was encouraged by Governor Newsom's efforts to negotiate a solution on the bill.\n\nNewsom told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that he is still engaged in talks with Uber, Lyft, and other gig economy companies about possible negotiations around the bill. Newsom is expected to sign the bill, after voicing support for it earlier this month.\n\nThe bill has received broad support from Democratic presidential candidates, including Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), as well as South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nAB5 has the potential to change the employment status of more than 1 million low-wage workers in California, not just gig workers at companies like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Postmates, and Instacart. The bill aims to make it harder for gig economy companies to prove that their workers are not employees, while ensuring key benefits and protections, such as minimum wage, insurance, and sick days.\n\nAB5 has faced strong opposition from gig economy companies, as it could disrupt their traditional business model of hiring inexpensive contractors. In an attempt to counter the bill, Uber and Lyft proposed establishing a $21-an-hour minimum wage for drivers in California. The ride-hailing companies, as well as DoorDash, have also pledged $90 million on a ballot initiative for the 2020 election that would exempt them from AB5.\n\nWest stated that Uber is open to investing more in the initiative and is working to include other businesses facing similar issues with AB5. The $90 million will be used to \"hire the best campaign team and best advisors we possibly can to run a successful ballot initiative,\" he added.\n\nLyft spokesperson Adrian Durbin stated that the bill has the potential to negatively impact drivers who prefer a flexible work schedule.",
    " Title: Possibility of New Charges Against Paul Manafort as Mueller's Team Reveals Alleged Lies\n\nIn a significant development, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team has left open the possibility of filing new charges against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort for alleged lies during his interviews with the special counsel's office. Manafort's legal team has stated that he maintains his honesty during these interactions.\n\nThe filing, signed by Andrew Weissmann, a prosecutor known for his aggressive approach, was made on a busy week for Mueller's team. On the same day, they also filed a recommendation for the sentencing of Michael Cohen, President Trump's former lawyer, accompanied by a scathing attack from prosecutors in Manhattan who accused Cohen of using his power and influence for deceptive ends.\n\nThe prosecutors sought a prison term of approximately four years for Cohen when he is sentenced next week for lying to Congress about the extent of President Trump's business dealings in Moscow, as well as for campaign finance violations and other charges.\n\nManafort, convicted in August of eight counts of financial fraud in a Virginia court, initially agreed to a plea deal on the brink of a second trial. However, the special counsel's office later declared that he had violated the plea agreement.\n\nThe filing also revealed that prosecutors have previously accused the Russian, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, whom Manafort is alleged to have been in touch with, of ties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik, a Russian Army-trained linguist, served as Manafort's right-hand man in Ukraine for over a decade, working on behalf of the country's Russia-aligned former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, his party, and the oligarchs behind it.\n\nIn Friday's filing, prosecutors blacked out much of the information related to Kilimnik, but they did reveal that some of it had been uncovered in emails and testimony. They claimed that Manafort lied about various interactions and meetings with him, as well as about his involvement with witnesses who might testify against Manafort.",
    " Title: DNC Steps in to Assist Iowa Democratic Party in Caucus Result Verification Following App Malfunction\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Monday's botched Iowa caucus count, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has taken an active role in verifying the results, as state party officials continue to grapple with the fallout from the malfunctioning app designed to streamline the caucus result reporting process.\n\nAccording to a report by ABC News, DNC staffers have been contacting leaders of each precinct to verify the results. Polk County Democratic chairman Sean Bagniewski and Des Moines precinct chairman Carl Voss, among others, have confirmed these contacts. They stated that this level of DNC involvement in the caucus process is unprecedented.\n\nDNC chairman Tom Perez addressed the situation in a series of tweets on Tuesday evening. He stated that DNC staffers were \"assisting\" the Iowa Democratic Party (IDP) in an effort to release the results as quickly and accurately as possible. Perez emphasized the importance of accuracy and the need to ensure that all votes are counted.\n\nThe IDP has been in disarray since Monday night, when the app commissioned by the IDP and developed by Shadow Inc. failed to function properly, causing problems for precinct chairs as they attempted to download or log into the app to report their caucus results. As of Wednesday afternoon, only 71 percent of results had been released by the IDP, and IDP chairman Troy Price has refused to provide a timeline for the release of the remaining 29 percent of results.\n\n\"We're going to take the time we need to get these results done,\" Price said Tuesday.\n\nA spokesperson for the DNC could not be reached for comment by The Post. The ongoing situation in Iowa is a significant development in the Democratic primary race, as it is the first contest in the nomination process. The delay in releasing the full results could have implications for the frontrunners in the race.",
    " Title: Ohio's White Male Voters Favor Bernie Sanders in Democratic Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Democratic primary race, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has garnered significant support from white male voters in Ohio, a trend that could potentially propel him to victory in the state's primary election. This demographic played a crucial role in Sanders' win in Michigan last week, and if he manages to secure a victory in Ohio, their support will likely be instrumental once again.\n\nJim, a union member who asked to remain anonymous due to his union's endorsement of Hillary Clinton, expressed his support for Sanders. \"We're pissed off,\" Jim said. \"We haven't gotten raises. Our pensions have been cut. Our healthcare's increased.\" He added, \"Bernie, he speaks from the trenches.\"\n\nIn Michigan, Sanders won the support of 62 percent of white men, who made up one-third of voters, according to exit polls. In the 2008 Democratic primary in Ohio, white men turned out in strikingly similar proportions. However, black voters could make up a smaller proportion of the electorate and may not be enough to secure a win for Clinton. In Michigan, Clinton won more than two-thirds of black voters and they were 21 percent of the electorate. In 2008, Barack Obama won nearly 90 percent of black voters in Ohio, and they were 18 percent of the electorate. Clinton won the state with the support of white voters, including white men.\n\nRyan, a member of a building trades union in Cleveland, also expressed support for Sanders. He, too, asked not to use his last name because his union has endorsed Clinton. \"She's [Clinton] seen as the centrist candidate,\" Ryan said. \"And she's a big-money candidate. And big money and centrism hasn't been working for middle-class America for the past 30 years.\"\n\nSanders' appeal to working-class men is evident in his stance on trade deals and healthcare costs, issues that resonate with these voters. In Michigan, Sanders overwhelmingly won voters who thought trade deals cost American jobs, and he won them 2-to-1. Jim, the union member from Michigan, has only received one raise in eight years.\n\nThe money issue is also a concern for Dave Passalacqua, executive vice president of the Communications Workers of America Local 4340 in Cleveland. His union has endorsed Sanders, but he is still undecided. \"There's that old saying: politicians should be like NASCAR, everyone wear their patch,\" Passalacqua said. \"You know, let's see what the patches are, and [Sanders] doesn't need to wear a patch, because it's his own thing.\"\n\nPassalacqua, Jim, and Ryan discussed these issues at a union hall in Cleveland. Despite their support for Sanders, they are realistic about his chances of winning the presidency. \"It's pie in the sky,\" said Jim Goggin, a labor community organizer. \"I mean, everything Bernie says, I think would be fantastic. But the fact of the matter is, that I am also a realist, and I know that you can't do that.\"\n\nAll four men agreed that they would support the Democratic nominee in November, regardless of who wins the primary. Passalacqua, however, expressed a struggle between his head and his heart, unsure if Sanders can deliver on his promises. \"Whoever I think is going best for me and my family is the bottom line,\" Passalacqua said. \"Whoever is going to make\u2014not to steal Donald's line\u2014but America great again, because in order to make America great again, we've got to make the middle class great again. So whoever's going to do that, I think's going to be the best person. And that's who I'll end up having to vote for.\"",
    " Title: A Balanced Approach to COVID-19 Reopening: The Controlled Avalanche Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the United States grapples with the question of how to safely reopen society amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, a clear divide in opinions has emerged. However, the majority of Americans, according to polling data, are not advocating for a swift reopening or a prolonged lockdown, but rather a measured, considered approach. This article explores the concept of a controlled avalanche strategy, a potential solution that balances public health concerns with economic recovery.\n\nThe controlled avalanche strategy, coined by Israeli scientists, suggests a phased reopening of society, prioritizing the protection of vulnerable populations while allowing less vulnerable individuals to develop immunity. This approach aims to reduce deaths, conserve resources, and accelerate the return to normalcy.\n\nThe strategy hinges on making assumptions about the progress of therapeutics, vaccines, and the economic impact of social distancing measures. If we assume that no significant therapeutics will be available in the near future, that vaccines may take 18 months or more to develop, and that the economy cannot function at reduced capacity, then a controlled avalanche strategy may be the most viable option.\n\nThe strategy's proponents argue that by prioritizing the protection of the elderly and vulnerable, and allowing herd immunity to develop among the least vulnerable, overall mortality could be significantly reduced. For instance, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that, as of late April, only 1,036 of the 37,308 recorded COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. were individuals under the age of 45, and just 51 were below the age of 25.\n\nFurthermore, the strategy could reduce the maximum number of people requiring intensive care units (ICUs) by over 60% and shorten the time needed to allow low-risk populations to return to normal activities by several months. This strategy is not foolproof, but it offers a potential path forward that balances public health and economic concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, the controlled avalanche strategy is a considered approach to reopening society that prioritizes the protection of vulnerable populations while allowing herd immunity to develop among the least vulnerable. This strategy may offer a more balanced solution to the COVID-19 pandemic, striking a delicate balance between public health and economic recovery.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Decision to Abandon ACA Could Affect Pre-Existing Condition Protections, Intensifying Healthcare Debate in Election Year\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration's decision to abandon the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in an ongoing court challenge could potentially impact some of the most popular aspects of the law, further escalating the contentious debate over healthcare during an election year. This move could particularly affect provisions that ban insurance companies from denying coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions, a component that is widely regarded as the most popular part of the 2010 health care law.\n\nThe lawsuit, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, was initiated in February by 20 states against the federal government, claiming the individual mandate is unconstitutional following the elimination of the tax penalty for not having health insurance in the 2017 tax cut law. The lawsuit argues that without the individual mandate, the entirety of the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, is unconstitutional.\n\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services, as many as 130 million adults under the age of 65 in the U.S. have pre-existing conditions that could potentially prevent them from obtaining insurance coverage in the private market. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that about a quarter of the country's under-65 population has pre-existing conditions. A Kaiser tracking poll in June 2017 showed that 70% of adults want Congress to maintain pre-existing condition protections.\n\nBefore the ACA became law, insurance companies frequently denied health insurance coverage to individuals with ongoing medical conditions or recent illnesses. Even when insurance policies were offered to those with health problems, they often excluded those illnesses. Furthermore, insurance companies could cancel coverage for individuals who became ill once the policy year ended. The ACA made all these practices illegal.\n\nBy withdrawing from defending the law in court, the Trump administration is effectively stating that it no longer supports these consumer protections, which are popular with voters. This move could disrupt insurance markets for the upcoming year and alter the dynamics of this fall's elections.\n\nLarry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, stated, \"This suit comes as insurers are proposing individual market premiums for 2019. The lawsuit injects more uncertainty into what is already an uncertain environment for insurers. Insurers hate uncertainty, and they respond to it by hedging their bets and increasing premiums.\"\n\nNicholas Bagley, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School who was previously a Justice Department lawyer, expressed concern over the department's move. \"The Justice Department has a long-standing, durable, bipartisan commitment to defend acts of Congress. It's a cornerstone of what they do,\" he said. \"For the Trump administration to crumple that up and throw it out the window is galling.\"\n\nJust hours before the Justice Department officially withdrew from the case, three of the staff attorneys who had been working on it withdrew. Bagley noted that these attorneys are civil servants who are not political and are dedicated to defending federal programs. \"They believed they could not, in good conscience, consistent with their professional obligations, sign the brief. These are people who defend programs they disagree with all the time,\" Bagley said, adding that he has not spoken with any of them about the case.\n\nThe Justice Department has opted not to defend existing law in court in other matters as well. For instance, in 2012, the Obama Justice Department stated it would not defend the Defense of Marriage Act, which legally defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman for federal purposes.\n\nAmerica's Health Insurance Plans, the trade association for health insurance companies, supports the pre-existing condition protections under the ACA. \"Removing those provisions will result in renewed uncertainty in the individual market, create a patchwork of requirements in the states, cause rates to go even higher for older Americans and sicker patients, and make it challenging to introduce products and rates for 2019,\" AHIP said in a statement.\n\nAHIP plans to file an amicus brief in support of the law that \"provides more detail about the harm that would come to millions of Americans if the request to invalidate the ACA is granted in whole or in part.\"\n\nOn Capitol Hill, congressional Republicans' reaction to the Trump administration's decision was muted, with many lawmakers expressing skepticism that the courts would ultimately rule against a law already upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\n\"We need to let that go forward and see if it goes anywhere,\" said Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J. \"I do not know if that legal logic will fly or not.\" MacArthur worked on legislation to continue pre-existing condition protections during the GOP's unsuccessful effort to repeal Obamacare last year.\n\nHealthcare is already a significant issue in this year's elections, with voters regularly citing it as a leading determinant for how they will vote. \"There is no doubt that Republicans are responsible for the rising cost of healthcare premiums and the high likelihood that many will no longer be able to afford basic care at all, and they will face serious blowback in the midterms,\" the House Democrats' campaign operation said in a statement.",
    " Title: CNN's Brian Stelter Critiques Republican Candidates' Media Bashing and Political Polarization\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a piece aired during Thursday's AC360, CNN's senior media correspondent, Brian Stelter, discussed the tactic of Republican presidential candidates attacking the liberal media to deflect tough questions and cause further political polarization in the electorate.\n\nStelter began by acknowledging that the claim of media bias is a tool often used by Republican politicians to shield themselves from difficult questions. He suggested that this is not because the liberal media is inherently biased, but rather a strategy to deflect unwanted inquiries, display strength, and put the press on the defensive.\n\nDuring the CNBC debate on Wednesday night, Stelter noted, several candidates demonstrated the effectiveness of media bashing, making it an easy applause line for conservative audiences.\n\nStelter argued that while most journalists strive to eliminate any bias from their stories, many conservatives remain skeptical. He further criticized conservatives for contributing to political polarization in America by refusing to engage with the media.\n\nAccording to Pew, the more conservative an individual is, the less they trust mainstream media sources. Fox News and some candidates have benefited from this distrust, Stelter pointed out. On Thursday, several candidates declared war on the liberal media, soliciting funds while mocking the moderators.\n\nStelter questioned whether CNBC's questions were harsher than those from Fox or CNN. He concluded by quoting University of Virginia's Larry Sabato, who defended the CNBC moderators for attempting to uncover the truth. Sabato stated, \"Some of the criticism is for show. What those moderators at CNBC were trying to do was to get candidates to tell more of the truth.\"\n\nThe relevant transcript from CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 on October 29 can be found below.",
    " Title: North Korea Conducts Most Powerful Nuclear Test to Date, Escalating Tensions with U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea has conducted its most powerful nuclear test to date, marking a significant escalation in tensions with the United States. The test, which took place on September 3, was confirmed by the US Geological Survey following a 6.3-magnitude earthquake at North Korea's Punggye-ri testing site.\n\nExperts estimate the device yielded approximately 100 kilotons, making it around seven times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. This was North Korea's sixth nuclear test and its first under the Trump administration.\n\nHours before the test, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), North Korea's state-run media organization, released images of the country's leader, Kim Jong Un, overseeing the loading of a hydrogen bomb onto an intercontinental ballistic missile.\n\nFollowing the test, KCNA stated that the test was conducted to \"examine and confirm the accuracy and credibility\" of the weapon. Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on North Korea's missile program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told reporters that North Korea's goal is to target the United States.\n\n\"North Korea wants the ability to target the United States,\" Lewis said. \"A thermonuclear weapon does more damage. This bomb can do quite a bit of damage.\" Vipin Narang, a nuclear expert at MIT, concurred, stating that with relatively inaccurate intercontinental ballistic missile technology, North Korea could destroy a significant portion of a city with this yield.\n\nPresident Donald Trump expressed his displeasure with the development via Twitter, stating, \"North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.\"\n\nSecretary of Defense James Mattis offered a stern warning to North Korea after a meeting of national security leaders with the president. \"Any threat to the United States or its territories, including Guam, or our allies, will be met with a massive military response\u2014a response both effective and overwhelming,\" Mattis said.\n\nRegional allies South Korea and Japan also responded strongly to the test. South Korean President Moon Jae-in convened a meeting of his national security team, and his national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, stated that Seoul wants the \"most powerful sanctions\" placed on North Korea at the United Nations.\n\nJapan issued a statement of disapproval, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stating, \"It is absolutely unacceptable if North Korea did force another nuclear test, and we must protest strongly.\"\n\nOn August 29, North Korea launched a missile into Japanese airspace, which eventually landed about 733 miles east of the country. \"We have to say that this morning's launch by the North is the most serious and grave threat ever to us,\" Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said afterward.\n\nIt remains unclear if the Japanese government finds North Korea's latest nuclear test more threatening than the missile launch.\n\nWhile Trump could respond with a military strike, it is still unlikely. The Trump administration still prefers a diplomatic approach toward Pyongyang in hopes that it would give up its nuclear weapons. However, it is unclear what incentive North Korea has to stop its nuclear program, especially now that it has tested a powerful hydrogen bomb. This will make it much harder for Trump to strike a deal with the North.",
    " Title: Federal Aid to States: Ensuring Fiscal Responsibility and Protecting Taxpayers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Illinois state workers received an automatic pay raise on July 1, a move that will cost taxpayers $261 million. This decision comes as nearly 1.4 million Illinoisans have filed for unemployment since the economic shutdown in March.\n\nWhile other state governments have recognized the need to pare back demands on taxpayers amid major revenue shortfalls, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has signed a budget that increases spending by $2.4 billion over last year and relies on $5 billion from a nonexistent federal bailout to partially close a $6 billion deficit.\n\nThis continued disregard for basic fiscal responsibility has raised concerns about the potential for state bailouts. Congress is currently considering further aid to state and local governments, with another coronavirus relief package expected to move this month.\n\nThe debate over state aid has polarized many, with some on the right philosophically opposed to offering any aid, while the left advocates for pumping in as much as $1 trillion without regard to the amount of money actually needed or how those funds are safeguarded.\n\nHowever, there is a compromise solution that would avoid rewarding irresponsible behavior in troubled states. Congress can offer more aid, but if\u2014and only if\u2014it\u2019s conditioned on sound financial management to protect taxpayers from tax increases or service failures.\n\nAttaching \"strings\" to financial rescues is already the norm across the world, as seen in the relief packages that followed the 2010 Greek debt crisis, the 2007-2009 U.S. bank bailouts, and most recently, the corporate financial assistance under the recently passed CARES Act. Without conditions, there's no way to ensure good money isn't thrown after bad to be squandered by those with a history of misusing funds.\n\nThe federal government should follow this best practice as it debates further support for states such as Illinois, New Jersey, and Connecticut, which have built up crushing debt burdens through decades of bad decisions unrelated to COVID-19. Funding should be conditioned on three hallmarks of healthy state finances: sound pensions, truly balanced budgets, and sufficient rainy-day savings.\n\nFirst, states must be on a path to fully eliminating unfunded pension liabilities over no more than 25 years, in line with generally accepted actuarial principles. If a state can't achieve this, pension liabilities should be reduced to the level the state can afford without increasing employer contributions, i.e., taxpayer costs. States where legacy systems are unsound should be required to close those systems to new employees in exchange for more sustainable models such as a defined contribution plan or Wisconsin-style risk-sharing system.\n\nNext, any state receiving funds should be asked to maintain a truly balanced budget, meaning the fiscal year ends in the black and no deficits are carried over. Illinois is one of just 11 states that doesn't require end-of-year balance by state law or constitution. The requirement calls for the planned budget to be balanced on paper, but what actually happens is irrelevant. Balance should also mean only money actually coming in gets counted as revenue, rather than allowing for Illinois-style gimmicks such as sweeping money from other state funds or relying on short-term borrowing to paper over deficits.\n\nLastly, states should have restrictions on rainy-day fund withdrawals to ensure they're only used in an emergency and have rules for automatic deposits when the economy returns to growth. The federal government should not be expected to bail out states in every future recession, and that means states must have sufficient emergency savings of their own.\n\nWithout these reforms and proof of effort by state governments, fiscally irresponsible states would use aid money in an inefficient and ineffective manner\u2014just as they've done with their own mismanaged funds for decades.\n\nFederal lawmakers have a tremendous opportunity in front of them: They can provide aid to ensure the people have access to essential government services while encouraging mismanaged states to fix their tumbledown fiscal houses.",

However, by Friday morning, Balla's bar was little more than a pile of bricks following protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in Minneapolis police custody on Monday.\n\n\"I don't know what we're going to do,\" Korboi Balla told CBS News on Thursday morning, fighting back tears. \"It hurts, man. It's not fair, it's not right. We've been working so hard for this place. It's not just for me, it's for my family.\"\n\nAs CBS reporters were interviewing Balla on Thursday morning, looters attempted to break into his bar to steal the safe.

    " Title: \"Clinton Campaign Faces Unexpected Challenge as Email Scandal Resurfaces, Threatening a Smooth Election Path for the Democratic Nominee\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final week of one of the most unpredictable and contentious presidential campaigns in modern history, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton finds herself on the defensive as the FBI revisits the issue of her private email server. The discovery of new emails on the computer of her longtime aide Huma Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, has brought the issue back to the forefront, potentially altering the course of the election.\n\nThe FBI's review of the emails has revived a controversy that has dogged Clinton since the beginning of her campaign. Democrats are furious with FBI Director James Comey for reopening the investigation, while Republican nominee Donald Trump is seizing the opportunity to unite a GOP that has been divided by his controversial candidacy.\n\nThe latest polls suggest a tightening race, with Clinton leading by a margin of five points according to CNN's Poll of Polls. However, the email scandal has cast a shadow over Clinton's campaign, and her plans for a smooth run-up to Election Day have been disrupted.\n\nClinton's campaign is now focusing on turning the spotlight back on Trump, in line with her campaign-long effort to brand him as unfit for the presidency. Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, has called on Comey to explain why he took the unprecedented step of reopening the investigation.\n\nIn the coming days, Clinton will travel to Florida and Ohio, where she is in a tight race with Trump, and North Carolina, where she is leading. By winning any one of those states, Clinton can block Trump's path to the presidency. She will also make a foray into Arizona, a traditionally red state that appears competitive a week out.\n\nClinton will also lean on her superior ground game and polling that suggests she still has several routes to surpass the 270 electoral votes she needs. She will dispatch former President Bill Clinton, President Barack Obama, and First Lady Michelle Obama to battleground states, leveraging her advantage over Trump, who lacks such high-profile surrogates.\n\nHowever, there are nervous days ahead. Clinton will now live in fear of another damaging twist to the email saga, more campaign inside gossip from the WikiLeaks hack of John Podesta's email account, and the release of more Clinton emails from the State Department scheduled for Friday.\n\nMany Democrats believe the character issue is already baked into polls that show Clinton is the favorite to win the election. But her plans for a smooth run-in to Election Day are in tatters, and her campaign has been forced into a tactical shift, unleashing its full fury on the FBI chief.\n\nFor the moment, Clinton is using the move as a rallying cry to drive up Democratic turnout. \"There have been ups and downs in all that we have gone through over the years and even in this campaign, but I want you to know I am focused on one thing: you,\" Clinton told supporters in Florida on Sunday. \"There's a lot of noise and distraction, but really comes down to what kind of future we want.\"\n\nTrump, on the other hand, must also improve his position on the political map to mount a stunning comeback on November 8. He must forge ahead in Florida and Ohio, cut his deficit to Clinton in North Carolina, capitalize on an advantage in Iowa, then find a way to put states like New Hampshire and Nevada, that went for Obama, in play. He could carve out a decisive edge by making a big blue state like Pennsylvania or Michigan competitive, though polls suggest that is a long shot.\n\nBut Trump's team must also be wondering, even as they salivate over Clinton's woes, if there is one last big shock awaiting Trump, following October Surprise controversies over claims he sexually assaulted women and an \"Access Hollywood\" tape exposing his lewd language that left him so far behind his rival that he starts the campaign's last week possibly too far behind to catch up.",
    " Title: Terrorism and Cultural Tensions: A Comparative Analysis of the U.S. and France in the Wake of Recent Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Orlando shooting, the U.S. and France find themselves grappling with the devastating consequences of terrorism, with the former experiencing Islamic extremist terrorism in San Bernardino and Orlando, and the latter suffering from a series of ISIS-coordinated attacks. This article aims to provide a neutral, factual, and informative analysis of the current state of terrorism in both countries, focusing on the unique challenges they face and the cultural tensions that have arisen as a result.\n\nThe recent wave of Islamic extremist violence has left a profound impact on both societies, instilling a sense of unease and insecurity. The U.S., having experienced 9/11, San Bernardino, and Orlando, is grappling with the aftermath of the most catastrophic terrorist attack in history. Meanwhile, France, which has been the epicenter for ISIS-coordinated terrorism, is in the midst of a homegrown Islamic terrorism crisis.\n\nWhile the U.S. has a history of mass killings, the current threat of Islamic extremism is a new and chilling development. Terrorist attacks, whether perpetrated by lone wolves or extremist groups, are becoming increasingly common, targeting civilians as they go about their daily lives. The recent attacks in Paris, Brussels, and Nice are stark reminders of this global phenomenon.\n\nFrance's history in the Middle East, particularly in Syria and Algeria, and its traditional cultural intolerance have contributed to the current crisis. The country's large Muslim population and its insistence on strict cultural assimilation have created a combustible mixture in a dangerous time. In contrast, the U.S., despite its history of xenophobia and nativism, has generally been successful in assimilating immigrants, with Muslims being an integral part of American society for many decades.\n\nHowever, the post-9/11 era has seen a shift in public perception of Muslims, with profiling, investigations, and protests against the building of mosques becoming more common. The U.S. has not experienced the same level of organized radicalism as France, but the underlying commitment to diversity remains, albeit hanging by a thread.\n\nFrance's response to its homegrown Islamic terrorism crisis is a matter of concern, with some advocating for draconian solutions. In the U.S., the political landscape is dominated by figures like Donald Trump, who has proposed a ban on Muslims and the construction of a wall to keep out immigrants from Mexico and Central America.\n\nThe future of both countries hinges on their ability to navigate these cultural tensions and address the threat of terrorism without resorting to draconian measures. The key to ending this violence lies not in military intervention or increased authoritarianism, but in fostering a global sense of solidarity and empathy, as the world comes together in the face of shared tragedy. The more violence these extremists inflict, the more they sow the seeds of their own demise, as the human population unites in the face of their divisive tactics.",
    " Title: \"Political Divisions and Internal Strife: A Look at the Potential Future of the Democratic and Republican Parties\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, political analysts and pundits have been discussing the future of both the Democratic and Republican parties. In a recent appearance on Meet the Press, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman suggested that the Republican Party might need to \"crash and burn\" to give way to a more moderate, sane version of the party.\n\nHowever, this idea of encouraging a Republican civil war is not without its critics. While it is true that the GOP's internal divide is large, particularly following the Donald Trump campaign, some argue that such a divisive approach could lead to further chaos and destruction within the party.\n\nBut what is often overlooked in these discussions is the potential for a similar civil war within the Democratic Party. If a Democrat resides in the White House, especially an unpopular one like Hillary Clinton, their own chaos could be at least as messy, public, and internally destructive as anything the GOP might face.\n\nOne of the main sources of this potential internal strife is the ongoing tension between Hillary Clinton and her primary challenger, Senator Bernie Sanders. Sanders and his supporters feel that the Democratic National Committee rigged the primary process against him, and this belief was reinforced by the WikiLeaks revelations that pointed to this fact. The resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz over the first revelation, and the likely forced resignation of Donna Brazile over the second, are indicative of the deep-seated dissatisfaction within the party.\n\nSanders has also announced that he will be \"vigorously in opposition\" to government action, including laws or policies not sufficiently leftist, which could put him at odds with Clinton on a number of issues. This tension could be further exacerbated by the presence of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has a strong following among the furthest-left part of the Democratic Party base and has a similar economic policy agenda to Sanders.\n\nAnother area of potential conflict is the selection of Supreme Court nominees. If Democrats take control of the Senate in January, Hillary Clinton might face the difficult task of finding a nominee who can garner the support of both the Sanders-Warren wing of the party and enough Republicans to gain confirmation. This could result in a nominee who is further left than desired, leading to a filibuster, or a nominee who is further right, leading to a contentious confirmation process and potential backlash from the progressive wing of the party.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that a vocal minority of the Democratic base, including many who supported Green Party candidate Jill Stein, are ideologically opposed to much of Clinton's agenda. This group is likely to be a source of opposition and conflict throughout Clinton's presidency, particularly on the issues they care most deeply about.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of a Republican civil war is a popular topic of discussion among Democratic elites, it is important to recognize that the Democratic Party could also face significant internal strife if a Democrat is elected president. The potential for conflict between Hillary Clinton and her primary challengers, as well as the ideological divisions within the party, could lead to a tumultuous and divisive presidency.",
    " Title: New York Governor's Remarks on Human Life Value Sparks Debate on Abortion Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent press conference, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, while discussing the state's gradual reopening, posed a thought-provoking question: \"How much is a human life worth?\" This question, though initially in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, has sparked a broader discussion on the value of human life, particularly in relation to abortion policies in New York.\n\nDuring the conference, Cuomo stated, \"That is the real discussion that no one is admitting, openly or freely. That we should. To me, I say the cost of a human life\u2014a human life is priceless. Period.\"\n\nThis statement has led to a renewed focus on the inconsistencies in New York's policies, particularly regarding abortion. The discussion has highlighted issues such as nursing home practices, the continued operation of abortion clinics, and the state's recent expansion of legal abortion.\n\nThe governor's comments have also prompted reflection on the value of human life from various perspectives. Some argue that the inconsistencies in policies, such as the operation of abortion clinics during a pandemic, undermine the governor's assertion that human life is priceless.\n\nOrganizations like the Sisters of Life, based in New York, have long been advocates for the sanctity of human life. They emphasize the priceless nature of life, a gift from a Creator who loves and values each individual. The Sisters of Life have been approached by women, including those inside abortion clinics, who feel they have no choice but to terminate their pregnancies.\n\nThe debate has led to calls for open and honest discussions about abortion, with some advocating for an end to euphemisms and a focus on the real-life experiences of women. The Sisters of Life, in particular, have urged for a shift from a culture of death to a culture of life, where every human life is valued and protected.\n\nGovernor Cuomo's question has indeed sparked a conversation, and it remains to be seen how this discussion will shape New York's policies moving forward. The debate underscores the complexities and nuances surrounding the value of human life, and the need for open, honest, and consistent discussions on these issues.",
    " Title: Dreamers Express Disappointment as Democratic Leaders Delay Immigration Legislation Until January\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, have expressed their disillusionment with Democratic leaders for failing to force a government shutdown showdown this week over demands to pass the Dream Act by the end of the year. Congressional leaders signaled Wednesday that they will revisit the immigration issue early next year and vowed to complete legislation in January.\n\nHundreds of Dreamers, some risking arrest, took to the halls of Congress to march and conduct sit-ins in office corridors to express their frustration that they have been overlooked. \"We want Dream Act,\" protesters chanted, referring to a bill that would grant temporary legal status to more than 2 million illegal immigrants and allow 1.7 million of them to earn green cards, signifying permanent legal presence, according to the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nFinal negotiations were ongoing late Wednesday over the shape of a year-end package of bills. Democratic leaders insisted the Dream Act is still part of negotiations, but Republican aides said Democrats signaled days ago that it wasn't one of the major sticking points. The pieces that are in play include an extension of the government's chief foreign intelligence communications surveillance program, disaster relief for states and U.S. territories affected by this year's hurricanes, and a renewal of the Children's Health Insurance Program, a federal-state health program for children whose parents are too wealthy to qualify for Medicaid but too poor to afford their own insurance.\n\nThe biggest moving part, however, is a year-end spending bill needed to avoid a government shutdown when current funding expires Friday. House Republicans have proposed full-year funding for the Defense Department coupled with a four-week extension of current funding for domestic needs, known as a \"continuing resolution.\" That continuing resolution would force all sides to revisit the domestic programs in January.\n\nDemocrats have said they won't accept that and insist on parity between defense and domestic programs in order to dole out money for veterans' health, a pension bailout, opioid-fighting programs, and medical research. As of late Wednesday, House Republican leaders were still trying to figure out a path forward. Democrats said they were waiting for Republicans.\n\n\"Unless we see a respect for our values and priorities, we continue to urge a strong NO on the continuing resolution,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, wrote in a letter to her troops.\n\nRank-and-file Republicans complained that Democrats were pushing Congress toward a government shutdown by threatening an all-or-nothing Senate filibuster. \"The American people sent us the Republican majorities in the House, the Senate, and the White House. And we have to get eight votes on the Democrat side, and we should compromise, right? But it should be proportional to Democratic Senate votes,\" said Rep. Dave Brat, Virginia Republican.\n\n\"That is the crux of the issue,\" he said. \"They get a fair compromise, but they don't get to control the Republican agenda.\"\n\nUsually, it's Republicans facing calls for a shutdown showdown from their right flank. But the Dreamers flipped the script, forcing Democrats into a tight spot by demanding a permanent fix after President Trump announced a phaseout of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals deportation amnesty. Mr. Trump's phaseout kicks in March 5, but Dreamers set an artificial end-of-year deadline, and Democratic leaders initially agreed that, though some of them have backed off their red line.\n\nRep. Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who has been a leading voice for Dreamers, said he believed his party's leaders in the House were holding firm in their DACA demand and that some Senate Democrats were also adamant. But he was less sure about Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat. \"I believe that at this particular moment, the onus is on Sen. Schumer,\" Mr. Gutierrez said.\n\nDreamers were more pointed, saying Mr. Schumer was betraying them. \"Time and time again, politicians have failed to stand by our community,\" said Cata Santiago. \"Now, at the peak of the Dream Act fight, Chuck Schumer and the Democrats won't hold their promises to protect us.\"\n\nMs. Santiago was arrested last week while protesting in Mr. Schumer's congressional office and stayed in custody by refusing to identify herself to police. She and a handful of other Dreamers who were also arrested staged a hunger strike in jail.\n\nMr. Schumer said Wednesday morning that he has been trying to find a DACA answer for weeks. \"Because of the particular importance of all of these issues, especially the Dreamers, we can not do a short-term funding bill that picks and chooses what problems to solve and what not to solve. That will not be fair and will not pass. We have to do them all together, instead of in a piecemeal fashion,\" he said.\n\nDreamers and their defenders did not blame only Democratic leaders; several dozen Republicans said they wanted a DACA solution this year. Mr. Gutierrez said if those Republicans had joined forces with Democrats in refusing to vote for any year-end bill that doesn't include the Dream Act, then they could have forced Republican leaders' hands.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has been pushing for the Dream Act, said Wednesday that he has assurances the DACA issue will be taken up in January. He said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, \"has committed to bring the bipartisan DACA bill we are currently negotiating to the Senate floor\" next month.\n\nMr. Gutierrez said Dreamers can't bank on another promise. \"It's very easy for Sen. Flake to send out a tweet this morning and say, 'Dreamers in January.' His kids aren't getting deported. He's going home to his wife. He's celebrating Christmas,\" he said.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Announces New Gun Control Measures, Focusing on Military Surplus Weapons and Corporate Gun Registration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprise move, the Obama administration announced two new gun control measures on Thursday, aimed at curbing the import of military surplus weapons and tightening regulations on guns registered to corporations and trusts. The announcement, made while Washington was preoccupied with the Syrian crisis and looming fiscal battles, signaled President Obama's continued commitment to the issue despite Congress's failure to pass any gun control legislation earlier this year.\n\nVice President Biden unveiled the new measures during a morning event in the Roosevelt Room. The new rules, added to the list of 23 executive actions the White House had previously determined the president could take unilaterally, come in response to Congress's refusal to pass gun control legislation following the shooting massacre in Newton, Conn.\n\nOne of the new policies will end a government practice that allows military weapons, sold or donated by the U.S. to allies, to be reimported into the U.S. by private entities. Under the new policy, only museums and a few other entities like the government will be eligible to reimport military-grade firearms. The U.S. has approved 250,000 of these guns for reimport since 2005.\n\nThe Obama administration is also proposing a federal rule to prevent individuals who would be ineligible to pass a background check from skirting the law by registering a gun to a corporation or trust. The new rule would require people associated with these entities, such as beneficiaries and trustees, to undergo the same type of fingerprint-based background checks as individuals if they want to register guns.\n\nHowever, the National Rifle Association (NRA) criticized the administration, stating that neither measure would reduce crime, as neither the re-importation of firearms nor the corporate gun registration is known to be a source of weapons for criminals.\n\nThe types of surplus weapons that have been re-imported under this provision are all more than 50 years old and fall under the definition of \"curio\" or \"relic\" firearms. They include M1 Garand rifles and several other models. As such, it is safe to assume that few are used in crimes.\n\nThe event also marked the ceremonial swearing-in for Todd Jones, whose confirmation to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) after six years of political wrangling to fill that position was another of Obama's post-Newtown priorities.\n\nAlthough Obama and Biden have said the fight is not over, there is scant evidence that there is more support for gun control legislation than there was in April, when efforts died in the Senate amid staunch opposition from the National Rifle Association and most Republican senators. The new rules for guns registered to corporations will follow the traditional regulatory process, with a 90-day comment period before ATF reviews suggestions and finalizes the rule. Last year, ATF received 39,000 requests to register guns to corporations and trusts.",
    " Title: China Steps into the Void Left by U.S. Withdrawal from Paris Climate Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, the world has witnessed a significant shift in global dynamics, with one notable exception: China. As the U.S. steps back from its role as a leader in the global fight against climate change, China is poised to take the lead, both diplomatically and economically.\n\nThis is not the first time President Trump, who campaigned on a platform critical of China, has inadvertently provided Beijing with an opportunity to expand its global influence. After the U.S. withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, China moved to fill the void, inserting itself into trade talks among nations disappointed by America's reversal. As Canada and Mexico have felt spurned by Trump during the runup to renegotiating NAFTA, China has emerged as a more reliable trading partner.\n\nAt the World Economic Forum in Davos, Chinese President Xi Jinping chided the West for its flirtation with protectionism and painted a picture of China as a champion of free trade and an attractive destination for foreign investment. As the U.S. withdraws from the global community's effort to curb carbon emissions, China's profile as a forward-thinking world leader will only grow. It is set to become closer to the U.S.'s allies that feel abandoned by Trump's recent actions, as well as take a more aggressive lead in building a green economy.\n\nAlex Wang, an environmental law professor at the University of California Los Angeles, observed, \"While the U.S. is breaking these ties, China \u2014 which has traditionally been more reserved in international affairs \u2014 is building them at breakneck pace. As the U.S. loses goodwill, China is building it.\"\n\nThe reshuffling of the world order in the wake of Trump's announcement could be seen almost immediately, with top Chinese and European leaders criticizing the U.S.'s withdrawal side by side on Thursday. Standing next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said that \"fighting climate change is a global consensus\" and pledged that China would remain committed to the Paris agreement. Merkel said, \"The cooperation of the European Union with China in this area will play a crucial role, especially in regards to new technologies.\"\n\nIn a statement to the press, Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the European Union commissioner on climate action and energy, made the point even more forcefully: \"No one should be left behind, but the EU and China have decided to move forward. Our successful cooperation on issues like emissions trading and clean technologies are bearing fruit. Now is the time to further strengthen these ties to keep the wheels turning for ambitious global climate action.\"\n\nAs Europe and China's enhanced cooperation is quite likely to go beyond coordinating on climate change, it could potentially build a better relationship for navigating conflicts over trade. If Europe and China are actually able to grow closer through their coordination on climate change, it could potentially build a better relationship for navigating conflicts over trade.\n\nIn the meantime, the U.S. and Europe are going through the roughest patch they've had since they split over the Iraq War in 2003. Even before Trump pulled out of the Paris agreement on Thursday, he had already alienated Europe during his trip abroad last week, when he, among other things, refused to reaffirm America's commitment to NATO and accused Germany of being a trade cheat.\n\nTrump's America First agenda has been a huge gift to China. Consider how, on his first full working day as president, he withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that would have boosted trade ties between the U.S. and 11 countries along the Pacific Rim and generated the largest trade bloc the world had ever seen. The accord would have strengthened ties between the U.S. and a number of China's neighbors and would have served as a counterweight to Beijing's increasing influence in the region (China was not part of the deal).\n\nNow, Trump's move means that Beijing has a major opportunity to step into that vacuum and negotiate a regional trade deal that basically serves as a China-centric version of the TPP. It's already making efforts to do exactly that. China has generally been eager to capitalize on Trump's protectionist tendencies. In his World Economic Forum speech, Chinese President Xi warned against rising nationalism in the West and defended free trade. This is China lecturing the U.S. and Europe about free trade. China's economy has liberalized significantly in recent decades, but it's a country that flagrantly disregards all kinds of global trade rules, from denying market access to foreign companies to subsidizing many of its key industries. But when you have the most powerful politician in the world calling for 45 percent tariffs against other countries, Xi doesn't look so preposterous.\n\nIf there's one realm where China is set to best the U.S. in the wake of Paris, it's in developing a sustainable economy. It's already investing more than the U.S. in clean energy\u2014in 2016, it invested more than $88 billion to the U.S.'s $59 billion\u2014but the gulf between the U.S. and China will grow as the U.S. decides that renewable energy investment isn't a priority. And it will grow fast. America First is turning out to be anything but.",
    " Title: Federal Judge's Ruling on ACA: What It Means for Healthcare and the Future of Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, a federal judge in Texas has struck down aspects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as \"Obamacare.\" The ruling, which is expected to be appealed, has left the fate of the healthcare law and the insurance for millions in limbo.\n\nThe ruling, handed down by U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor in the Northern District of Texas, declared the individual mandate, a key provision of the ACA, unconstitutional. The judge agreed with a coalition of Republican-led states that it was unconstitutional to mandate individuals buy health insurance or be taxed for not complying.\n\nThe ruling is likely to be appealed by California and other states to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which is dominated by Republican-appointed judges. The expected lengthy court fight between Republican and Democratic state officials over the ruling is likely to end up at the Supreme Court, which has twice voted to uphold other challenges to the ACA.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has long been critical of the ACA, hailed the ruling as \"great news for America\" and called on Republican and Democratic congressional leaders to pass a \"STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare.\" However, the White House acknowledged that the ruling was expected to be appealed and that the law remains in place while the appeal process unfolds.\n\nThe ruling has no immediate effect, and consumers who buy insurance through federal or state marketplaces can still purchase 2019 coverage through Saturday. If the ruling is upheld after the appeal process, however, subsidies that people collect to buy health coverage would no longer be available, and Medicaid, which has extended insurance coverage to millions of low-income and working-class Americans, could also be in jeopardy.\n\nThe latest challenge stems from Congress' elimination of the penalty for not purchasing health insurance, part of the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul approved last December. The penalty will disappear in 2019 under the tax law.\n\nThe Trump administration sided largely with the states that brought the lawsuit but argued that only some provisions of the law should fall if the individual mandate were struck down. That would include coverage for pre-existing conditions, a popular aspect of the ACA that Trump has pledged to preserve.\n\nThe annual penalty for those who refuse to get health insurance is $695 or 2.5 percent of income, whichever is greater. The latest ruling could potentially throw the individual insurance market and the entire healthcare system into chaos, according to experts. However, the case still has a long legal road to travel before that becomes an immediate threat.",
    " Title: The Urgent Need for Active Participatory Democracy in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nThe presidential election cycle, much like the holiday shopping season, seems to arrive earlier each round. As the nation gears up for another round of political engagement, it is crucial to reflect on the state of participatory democracy in the United States.\n\nWhile active participation in the democratic political process is evident through voting, the majority of political engagement happens online, in social media circles, and through printed press editorials. The current state of participatory democracy is an online argument rife with name-calling and political polarization.\n\nThe American voter is generally more engaged during presidential races, with an average of 55 percent voter turnout for presidential runs and even less during midterm elections, averaging around 45 percent. This leaves many voices in the political spectrum unheard.\n\nThe political process in this election cycle has become similar to reality television. Instead of a respectful discourse of ideals and values, the electorate is subjected to a media circus. The solution to this issue lies not in looking to a presidential candidate to solve the nation's problems, but in the active participation of the voter.\n\nThe voter should be just as invigorated around congressional, midterm, gubernatorial, and local elections. The populace of this country has the ability to influence their communities through participatory democracy, which extends beyond showing up to polls.\n\nParticipatory democracy involves encouraging thoughtful discussion on important issues, donating time and money to organizations that support a healthy democratic process, and entering into a dialogue with neighbors in hopes of achieving a bipartisan society and political process.\n\nAfter the presidential election, serious matters of economic prosperity, national security, environment, and the unification of a people divided will remain. No one candidate for office will solve all the issues at hand \u2014 instead, these issues are relegated to the American populace, proving that more than ever participatory democracy is the only way to find a collective solution to societal ills.\n\nBarrio, a native New Mexican and recent NMSU graduate, has been covering Southwest music culture through several online music publications and has a passion for political activism and public discourse. His work underscores the urgent need for active participatory democracy in the United States.",
    " Title: House Energy and Commerce Committee Rejects Climate Change Acknowledgement Amendment, Receives Funding from Fossil Fuel Industries\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee on Tuesday spent a significant portion of its time debating an anti-environmental bill, H.R. 3826, also known as The Electricity Security and Affordability Act, which aims to suspend the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed climate rules for power plants. In a surprising turn of events, the committee rejected an amendment that would have acknowledged the reality of climate change.\n\nThe amendment, proposed by Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), simply stated that greenhouse gas pollution \"threatens the American public's health and welfare\" by contributing to climatic changes. ClimateProgress reported on the Republicans' response to the amendment, which failed to pass despite the bill's approval. Twenty-four Energy & Commerce Committee members, all Republicans, voted against the amendment. Among them were E&C Chair Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI), who has previously expressed doubts about human-caused climate change, and Joe Barton (R-TX), who also questions the role of human activity in climate change.\n\nThis is not the first time House Republicans have rejected amendments acknowledging the reality of climate change. In 2011, House Republicans voted down amendments that called on Congress to accept that climate change is real, man-made, and a human health threat.\n\nThe question arises as to why House Republicans continue to deny the scientific consensus on climate change. ClimateProgress reported that the Republicans who voted to deny climate change have collectively accepted about $9.3 million in career contributions from the oil, gas, and coal industries.\n\nThis revelation raises questions about the potential influence of these industries on the committee's decisions, as they stand to gain financially from the continued use and production of fossil fuels. The rejection of the climate change acknowledgement amendment further underscores the need for transparency and accountability in political decision-making, particularly when it comes to issues as critical as climate change.",
    " Title: \"Americans United for Life Advocates for Comprehensive Regulation of Abortion Clinics in Virginia and Beyond\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to ensure the safety and well-being of women seeking abortion services, Americans United for Life (AUFL) has been at the forefront of advocating for meaningful and comprehensive regulation of abortion clinics across the United States. This push for regulation has gained momentum in the past three years, with at least 15 states launching investigations into substandard care in abortion clinics, some of which have resulted in women's deaths.\n\nAUFL's efforts have led to the enactment of new comprehensive abortion clinic regulations in eight states over the past three years, and the introduction of the \"Abortion Patients' Enhanced Safety Act,\" model legislation mandating that abortion clinics meet the same health and safety standards as facilities performing other outpatient surgeries.\n\nRecently, Alabama Governor Robert Bentley signed legislation inspired by AUFL's model legislation. In Virginia, the Board of Health approved final regulations for abortion clinics, which are now considered a subset of \"hospitals\" and are required to meet rigorous and protective standards for patient care. AUFL testified twice in support of these regulations.\n\nThe debate over Virginia's abortion clinic standards is emblematic of the ongoing battle to force abortion providers to prioritize women's health and safety over profit margins and the promotion of unrestricted and unregulated abortion on demand.\n\nVirginia officials and pro-life advocates argued that abortion clinics in the state should, among other requirements, be licensed by the state health department, inspected regularly, have operable emergency equipment, and maintain sanitary and safe facilities. Pro-abortion advocates countered that if required to abide by these medically appropriate standards, abortion clinics would be coerced into spending significant amounts of money to come into compliance and might even be forced to close their doors.\n\nIn seeking to advance their own financial and political interests, Virginia abortion advocates ignored evidence of substandard conditions in Virginia abortion clinics, refusing to acknowledge or contradict evidence presented to the commonwealth's board of health. Instead, after hearing testimony about recurring health and safety violations at some Virginia abortion clinics and the failure of a number of these clinics to fulfill \"plans of correction\" for previously documented violations, a representative from NARAL Virginia wrongly and stubbornly insisted that there was no demonstrated public health need supporting the regulations.\n\nContrary to NARAL's claim, documentation obtained by the Family Foundation of Virginia from the Virginia Board of Health confirms that the continued health and safety violations at Virginia's abortion clinics are widespread. \"These reports from more recent, follow-up inspections of abortion centers continue to show dozens and dozens of deficiencies, some worse than before,\" said Victoria Cobb, president of the Family Foundation of Virginia. \"Not cleaned up. Not fixed. Ongoing. Even after submitting plans to correct these deficiencies, they have not done so. The abortion industry continues to claim that it is safe, but these inspection reports are indisputable evidence that nothing could be further from the truth.\"\n\nDenise M. Burke, vice president of legal affairs at Americans United for Life, emphasized that the \"right\" to abortion does not give rise to a corollary \"right\" for abortion providers to practice without meaningful oversight and regulation. \"Big Abortion does not \u2014 contrary to its apparent beliefs \u2014 have a constitutional right to maim and kill women in unlicensed, substandard, and dangerous clinics,\" Burke stated.",
    " Title: Analysis: Healthcare and Busing: A Tumultuous Start for Sen. Kamala Harris' Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political arena, imitation is often considered the sincerest form of flattery. This seems to be the case as several Democratic candidates, including California Senator Kamala Harris, strive to replace President Donald Trump. However, Harris' approach to key issues such as healthcare and busing has raised questions about her ability to communicate effectively with the American public.\n\nSeven days after announcing her presidential bid in January, Harris endorsed the concept of \"Medicare for All\" and was asked about private insurance. Her response, which suggested the elimination of private insurance, has been a point of contention for her campaign. In the following weeks, Harris seemed to \"waffle\" on the issue, only to reaffirm her support for private insurance in a debate moderator's question about government-run plans.\n\nThe inconsistency in Harris' stance on private insurance has been a topic of discussion, with some critics pointing out that her policy could affect the 217 million Americans who currently have private insurance. This issue is particularly significant as it touches upon a core function of organized labor, which negotiates employer-provided health care as untaxed compensation.\n\nMoreover, Harris' decision to use the contentious issue of school busing as a political weapon during her debate with Joe Biden has been met with criticism. In the 1970s, busing was a divisive issue, with a 1973 Gallup poll showing that only 4% of whites and 9% of blacks supported it. Yet, Harris used busing as a cudgel against Biden, a move that some argue was politically unwise and lacked nuance.\n\nThe healthcare and busing issues are not the only points of contention in Harris' campaign. Her evolving stance on private insurance and her use of a divisive issue like busing have raised questions about her ability to communicate effectively with the American public. As the primary season progresses, it will be interesting to see how Harris and other candidates navigate these complex issues and connect with voters.",
    " Title: Trump's Plastics Boosterism Clashes with Corporate America's Environmental Shift\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast to the growing environmental concerns of corporate America, President Donald Trump has been vocal about his support for plastics, positioning himself as a proponent of the material in contrast to Democrats. This shift in policy, however, comes at a time when major corporations, from Google to Coca-Cola, are attempting to align themselves with environmentalists, reducing their plastic footprint and increasing their recycling efforts.\n\nThe latest example of progressive change, despite the White House's stance, is the new plastic manufacturing plant being built by Royal Dutch Shell in Pennsylvania. Contrary to Trump's claims during a recent visit, the plant's construction plans were initiated in 2012, with over $1 billion in tax credits from state taxpayers.\n\nAt a rally, Trump touted the plant's contribution to the economy and used it as a platform to promote his reelection, stating, \"Virtually every leading Democrat has vowed to eliminate fossil fuels.\" He urged Pennsylvanians to \"get out there and make sure we win.\"\n\nThe plant will utilize a byproduct of fracking to produce pellets used in various plastic products, including those that make cars lighter and more fuel-efficient and in wind turbines. This aligns with the Trump administration's stance on the benefits of plastics.\n\nHowever, the excessive use of plastic leads to significant waste, with single-use items like bags and straws contributing to pollution in the ocean and landfills. When asked about the issue before speaking at the new plant, Trump pointed the finger at other countries, particularly China, for their lack of plastic waste management.\n\nTrump's anti-plastic waste accomplishment is the Save Our Seas Act, a bipartisan bill signed in 2018 to combat ocean garbage and plastic. Despite this, the President did not mention the word \"plastic\" when he signed the bill.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's reelection campaign is selling 10-packs of plastic Trump straws on its official website, with the campaign raising over $450,000 from them, according to Politico. The campaign's website states, \"Liberal paper straws do not work. STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP and buy your pack of recyclable straws today.\"\n\nCorporate America, too, is making efforts to reduce its plastic footprint. Companies like Coca-Cola and Pepsi are aiming to improve their environmental images and reduce plastic bottle production. In 2017, Coca-Cola alone produced over 3 million tons of plastic packaging, according to its commitment to transparency on the issue of plastic and waste.\n\nBoth companies have announced plans to sell their water in aluminum cans, in addition to plastic bottles. Starbucks has developed a new recyclable lid for its iced drinks, and companies in the UK, where plastic straws will be banned by 2020, are adapting to the change. McDonald's moved away from plastic straws in its UK and Ireland stores, but found the new paper straws were not recyclable, though the old plastic ones were.\n\nGoogle has announced plans to include recycled plastic in its products by 2022, and Amazon, responsible for a significant amount of packaging, has moved toward paper-padded packaging that it claims is recyclable. Amazon also has a portion of its website dedicated to its sustainability and environment efforts.\n\nSupport for plastic-bag bans, where they've occurred, is bipartisan. A Siena College poll of New Yorkers in April found bipartisan support for the state's ban on single-use plastic bags in grocery stores. However, these bans can only do so much, as demonstrated by China's continued contribution to plastic waste in oceans, despite having laws limiting single-use plastic bags.",
    " Title: Comedian Challenges Senator Warren on Single-Payer Healthcare and Middle Class Taxes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent appearance on Stephen Colbert's CBS late night show, the host grilled Senator Elizabeth Warren on the issue of single-payer healthcare, a policy she supports. Colbert pressed Warren on the question of whether middle-class Americans' taxes would have to increase significantly to fund the program she and Senator Bernie Sanders have proposed.\n\nDuring the interview, Warren attempted to explain that costs would rise for the wealthiest Americans and big corporations, while hardworking middle-class families would see their costs decrease. However, Colbert pressed her on the issue of taxes, stating that he wanted her to be more transparent about the tax increases that would be necessary.\n\nColbert's questioning marked a rare moment of hostility towards a Democrat on national entertainment television. The comedian, who supports the idea of single-payer healthcare, offered Warren advice on how to make the argument for middle-class tax hikes more effectively.\n\nThe political challenge for Warren is that admitting to significant tax increases is politically risky. A poll conducted by Robert Blendon, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, found that if voters were told that a government-run system could lead to delays in getting care or higher taxes, support plunged to 26 percent and 37 percent, respectively.\n\nAnother challenge for Warren is that her plan would eliminate private healthcare plans for nearly 180 million Americans, making such coverage illegal. At the last Democratic debate, Warren tried to downplay this issue by claiming that few Americans love their insurance companies. However, polling suggests that many Americans value their coverage and providers, making such uprooting a significant political liability for single-payer advocates.\n\nAccording to Gallup polling from late last year, 82% of Democrats said the quality of health care they received was either good or excellent. A large majority, 71%, believed their health care coverage was either good or excellent. Even when it comes to health care costs, 61% of Democrats said they were satisfied with what they paid in health care. The same poll also notes that the vast majority of all Americans are satisfied with the quality of their health care \u2013 rating it \u2018 excellent\u2019 or \u2018 good\u2019 (80 percent) \u2013 and their level of coverage (69 percent).\n\nIn addition, a recent Kaiser poll found that 86 percent of Americans with private coverage were satisfied with it. Healthcare disruption is deeply unpopular, as both parties have learned in recent years. Warren may try to \"here's the thing\" her way out of addressing these facts, but she cannot deflect away from the higher taxes, illegal private coverage, and long, bureaucratic wait times for care.",
    " Title: The Tragic Death of Kate Steinle and the Need for Smarter Immigration Enforcement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the July Fourth weekend, a tragic incident occurred in San Francisco, where Kate Steinle, 31, was fatally shot while walking with her father on a busy pier. A Mexican immigrant, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, was arrested in connection with the crime. Lopez-Sanchez, who was in the country without documentation, had been previously deported five times and had seven felony convictions, including four for drug offenses.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to separate Lopez-Sanchez's actions from the broader issue of undocumented immigration in the United States. He does not represent the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, the majority of whom are productive members of society. The Washington Post recently analyzed Donald Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants being drug dealers and \"rapists\" and found them to be incorrect. Being in the country without authorization is not a crime; it is a civil infraction.\n\nMost undocumented immigrants come to the United States to work and provide a better life for themselves and their families. It is a myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime. Research from the Immigration Policy Center shows that crime rates fell in the United States as the size of our immigrant population, including undocumented immigrants, grew from 1990 to 2010.\n\nIt is essential to remember that the actions of one individual should not be used to vilify an entire group. The same news outlets that are now highlighting Wednesday's murder as proof that undocumented immigrants are criminals often overlook or ignore other stories of undocumented immigrants who are genuine heroes. In 2013, for instance, an undocumented immigrant rescued a mother and her child on Staten Island, New York, amidst the storm surge of Superstorm Sandy.\n\nDeporting as many undocumented immigrants as possible is not the answer to our immigration problems. Lopez-Sanchez had been deported five times, and yet he was still in the country without authorization. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced last week that it is rethinking its deportation priorities to focus on recent arrivals and serious criminals. This move is a step in the right direction, as it is time to start seriously targeting those immigrants who are a real threat to public safety.\n\nThe government will be focusing its enforcement efforts on three categories of people: convicted criminals, recent border crossers, and terrorism threats. True, Lopez-Sanchez should not have been in the country, or he should have at least been behind bars. However, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) erred in not seeking a warrant or court order for his arrest and he was released in accordance with city law in March.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's proposed executive action on immigration, currently tied up in a legal battle, might also have made a difference because it would have freed up resources to go after people like Lopez-Sanchez. The executive action would have given deportation relief to parents of DREAMers, while allowing DHS to zero in on criminals.\n\nIn conclusion, the tragic death of Kate Steinle is a reminder of the need for smarter and better immigration enforcement. The government should focus on recent arrivals and serious criminals, rather than wasting time, manpower, and money chasing after people working productively in their communities. The system failed Kate Steinle, but it should not fail the millions of undocumented immigrants who contribute positively to our society.",
    " Title: New Hampshire Senate Debate Moderator Apologizes to Scott Brown for Geography Error\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events during a New Hampshire Senate debate on Thursday, moderator James Pindell, a reporter for WMUR, apologized to Republican candidate Scott Brown for incorrectly disputing him on state geography.\n\nDuring the debate, Mr. Brown, a former Massachusetts senator, was asked about his views on the \"right\" and \"wrong\" in Sullivan County, a county located on the western border of New Hampshire, as reported by Fox News on Friday.\n\nMr. Brown responded by discussing economic challenges faced by areas north of Concord, the state capital. \"Geography plays a role along the southern border. We have more jobs, we have more opportunity, infrastructure, and other opportunities up north are difficult,\" Mr. Brown said. \"One of the biggest opportunities is tourism. One of the biggest opportunities are ski areas and trails for snowmobiles\u2014I support those efforts.\"\n\nHowever, Mr. Pindell interrupted Mr. Brown, reminding him that the question was about Sullivan County. \"I think you were talking about the North Country,\" he said.\n\nMr. Brown responded, \"I'm talking about any place past Concord, actually, and the challenges of our state.\"\n\nThe debate continued, with Mr. Brown listing more economic challenges facing northern counties. Mr. Pindell interrupted him again, clarifying that Sullivan County is west of Concord, not north of Concord.\n\n\"Sullivan County is west of Concord. It's not north of Concord, Senator Brown. So what do you see as going well and what's not going well there?\" Mr. Pindell asked.\n\nMr. Brown, however, stuck with his initial answer, maintaining that \"the challenges are the same in every county in our state.\"\n\nThe state Democratic Party posted a video of the exchange online, labeling Mr. Brown as \"clueless\" in the description.\n\nLater that night, Mr. Pindell admitted his error in a tweet, noting that Mr. Brown was referring to Mt. Sunapee, a ski resort in Sullivan County north of Concord.\n\n\"I said that Sullivan County was west of Concord, not north of Concord. The truth is, it's both. So on this point, Scott Brown was right, I was wrong, and I apologize to Scott Brown and to both campaigns,\" Mr. Pindell tweeted.",
    " Title: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Indicted in Three Corruption Cases, Marking First Time a Sitting Israeli Head of State Faces Criminal Charges\n\nArticle:\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also known as \"Bibi\" Netanyahu, has been indicted in three corruption cases, making him the first sitting head of state in Israel to face criminal charges. The indictment was announced on Thursday, following a four-day hearing last month with the prime minister's defense team.\n\nThe indictment includes charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. The most serious charge, Case 4000, alleges that Netanyahu engaged in a quid pro quo deal with businessman and media mogul Shaul Elovich. During his tenure as communication minister, Netanyahu is accused of spearheading regulations that helped Elovich gain roughly $500 million. In return, Netanyahu and his wife allegedly sought alterations to Walla News, which Elovich ran, to serve their political interests and undercut their opponents.\n\nThe Netanyahus have argued that the deal does not constitute a bribe and that they only sought balanced coverage.\n\nThe second case, Case 2000, accuses Netanyahu and Arnon Mozes, the publisher of the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, of trying to limit the circulation of a rival paper in return for favorable media coverage.\n\nThe final case, Case 1000, accuses Netanyahu of fraud and breach of trust for allegedly using his public role to receive gifts from Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan and billionaire James Packer.\n\nNetanyahu could face up to 10 years in prison if he is convicted of bribery and a maximum of three years for fraud and breach of trust.\n\nNetanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, is not required to step down as a result of the charges. He can ask the parliament for immunity, though that request would have to be considered by a special committee that has not been established due to ongoing gridlock.\n\nThe indictment casts further uncertainty over Netanyahu's political future. Israel appears to be headed toward an unprecedented third election in less than a year after Netanyahu's chief rival announced Wednesday he would miss a deadline to form a ruling coalition.\n\nThe parliament now starts a 21-day period in which it can try to nominate any one of its 120 lawmakers to try and establish a coalition. Should that effort fail, an election would be triggered within 90 days.\n\nIf Netanyahu were to win a new election, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin would be forced to decide if he can give Netanyahu the mandate to form the next government given the criminal charges against him.",
    " Title: Republicans Push for Reduced Unemployment Benefits as Economy Shows Mixed Signs of Recovery\n\nArticle:\n\nThe June jobs report has been released, and the Republican party is once again claiming victory, with payrolls growing by 4.8 million, according to government surveys, and the official unemployment rate dropping to 11.1 percent. President Trump took to Twitter, proclaiming \"HISTORIC JOBS NUMBERS!\" as Republicans begin to coalesce around a second round of economic rescue payments, which includes a reduced super-unemployment benefit and a smaller round of more strictly means-tested checks.\n\nWhile the increase in jobs is a positive development, there are reasons to be concerned about the underlying economic conditions. Economist Jed Kolko calculates a \"core\" unemployment rate, which includes permanent layoffs or quits, and the \"marginally attached\" people who express a desire to work but have not searched for a job in the past four weeks. This kind of unemployment has increased steadily since February and accelerated in June to 5.9 percent.\n\nMoreover, the June numbers are already outdated, as the surveys are collected during the first two weeks of the month, and they will necessarily miss events that occurred during the latter weeks. The last two weeks have seen a surge in coronavirus cases across the country, and private economic activity indexes have shown a stalling out of spending. In states with high infection rates, such as Texas and Florida, economic activity is going into reverse. Weekly unemployment claims have also leveled off over the past month or so, at levels many times higher than during the Great Recession.\n\nIt is likely that the restoration of temporary layoffs will slow down or even reverse over the coming months, and the economy will fall short of its pre-pandemic levels. The U.S. needs more government aid to prevent a worsening economic situation and potential bread riots. The boost to unemployment benefits, small business grants, and the one-time rescue payment are keeping tens of millions of people from starvation, but these programs are set to expire, and super-unemployment will end in July.\n\nRepublicans argue that super-unemployment pays lower-income workers more not to work, but there are not enough jobs to go around, and it is not advisable for people to work during a pandemic. The U.S. government can borrow without limit as long as the economy has not recovered, and once the pandemic has passed, the government can address conservative complaints about labor incentives by making the universal checks bigger to compensate for taking a job.\n\nHowever, it appears that Republicans are not primarily concerned with labor incentives. They view the state's main duty as pushing people into the labor market, regardless of the consequences for public health or the business class. The outcome of the 2020 presidential election may hinge on this ideological divide, and if the current trajectory continues, the economic situation will worsen, and the Trump administration may be a casualty of its refusal to prioritize public health and economic recovery.",
    " Title: California Senator Dianne Feinstein Introduces Comprehensive Gun Control Legislation, Aiming to Reinstate Assault Weapons Ban\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia Senator Dianne Feinstein is set to introduce new gun control legislation today, aiming to re-establish the \"assault weapons\" ban of the Clinton era. However, Feinstein's proposed bill extends beyond the restriction of so-called \"scary look\" guns, encompassing a wide array of handguns, rifles, and shotguns.\n\nThe bill, to be introduced today, targets specific semiautomatic firearms, including rifles and handguns that can accept a detachable magazine and possess one or more military characteristics, as well as semiautomatic rifles and handguns with a fixed magazine capable of holding more than 10 rounds.\n\nIn an attempt to strengthen the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban and various state bans, the bill eliminates easy-to-remove bayonet mounts and flash suppressors from the characteristics test. It also bans firearms with \"thumbhole stocks\" and \"bullet buttons\" to address attempts to \"work around\" prior bans.\n\nMoreover, the bill aims to ban large-capacity ammunition feeding devices capable of accepting more than 10 rounds. To accommodate legitimate hunters and existing gun owners, over 900 specifically-named weapons used for hunting or sporting purposes are exempted.\n\nGrandfathered weapons, however, must be registered under the National Firearms Act. This registration process requires certification from local law enforcement of the owner's identity and compliance with State or local law. Fingerprinting for firearms lawfully purchased is also a part of the proposed legislation.\n\nIt is essential to note that the term \"assault weapon\" is a political term with no specific weapon association. The term is typically used in reference to semi-automatic rifles, but any weapon can be used to assault someone. Feinstein's new legislation includes handguns and shotguns, expanding the definition of \"assault weapons.\"\n\nThe qualifications for being considered a \"legitimate hunter\" remain unclear, potentially creating a gray area as many people may not hunt annually but occasionally. The hunting argument is often employed by pro-gun control advocates as a means of finding common ground, but the Second Amendment is not directly related to hunting.\n\nThe success of Feinstein's legislation is questionable, as it reflects extreme stances on the Second Amendment that many Democrats have already deemed outdated, misguided, and ineffective in preventing school shootings.\n\nLast night, conservative columnist Michelle Malkin discussed the latest gun control measures proposed by far-left Democrats on Hannity.\n\nUPDATE: According to CNN, Feinstein has received permission from DC police to be flanked with semi-automatic rifles during a press conference today at 11 a.m. when the legislation will be officially introduced.",
    " Title: Clinton and Sanders Accuse Each Other of Political Games Ahead of Wisconsin Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final days leading up to the Wisconsin primary, Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have been engaged in a debate over the scheduling of a debate between the two candidates. Clinton has been accused of avoiding a debate in her adopted home state of New York ahead of its April 19 primary, while Sanders has challenged Clinton to a debate in delegate-rich New York.\n\nClinton told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that she is open to a debate, but has suggested a few dates that the Sanders campaign and others see as less than optimal for viewership. Sanders, who has won five of the last six primaries or caucuses, has proposed several dates for a debate, including April 10, 11, 12, or 13.\n\nSanders campaign spokesman Michael Briggs accused the Clinton campaign of playing \"silly political games\" and disingenuously announcing a debate date when they knew Sanders had already secured park permits for a major rally in New York City. \"Let's stop the silly political games, let's get on with debating the candidates' stands on serious issues affecting New York and the United States,\" said Briggs.\n\nClinton had no public events Sunday in Wisconsin, where some polls show Sanders with a slight lead. Clinton also made clear that Sanders remains a political threat, stating, \"I certainly have not moved on. I know that I still have work to do to win the nomination.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the top two Republican presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, were also campaigning in Wisconsin. Trump doubled-down on his comments that the US should \"do a better deal\" with Japan, South Korea, and other allies, suggesting they should pay more for America's protection while taking a greater role in their defense, including building their own nuclear weapons. Trump also discussed his plans to change the nation's tax code by \"simplifying\" it, stating that the very rich would likely pay more, but there would be an incentive for them to invest and create jobs in the country.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich, the other Republican candidate, told ABC's \"This Week\" that the Republican convention, which could happen in July without a clear nominee based on delegate wins, could be a civics lesson for the country. \"Kids will spend less time focusing on Bieber and Kardashian and more time focusing on how we elect presidents,\" said Kasich, who has won only Ohio.\n\nTrump called for Kasich to drop out of the race, arguing he should not be allowed to continue accumulating delegates if he has no chance of being the nominee. Trump has 736 pledged delegates, followed by Cruz with 463, then Kasich with 143 -- with 1,237 needed to secure the nomination. Trump trails Cruz in Wisconsin, after some polls showed him leading by double-digits several weeks ago. Trump said Sunday that Kasich could be considered as a nominee at the GOP convention in July even without competing in the remaining nominating contests.\n\nThe Kasich campaign tried to flip the script, contending that neither Trump nor Cruz would have enough delegates to win the nomination outright going into the convention. \"Since he thinks it's such a good idea, we look forward to Trump dropping out before the convention,\" said Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf. Republican concerns grew about the prospect of convention chaos if Trump fails to lock up his party's nomination -- or even if he does.",
    " Title: Military Deployment to Puerto Rico: A Closer Look at the Pace and Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nThe deployment of military personnel to Puerto Rico, currently standing at around 5,000 National Guard forces and active military, is falling short of the needs of a population of 3.5 million in crisis. This is in stark contrast to the 22,000 troops deployed to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, as pointed out by meteorologist Eric Holthaus on Twitter.\n\nThe initial pace of military deployment for the disaster in Puerto Rico has been slow, but it appears that the relief effort is now gaining momentum. In the first six days after Hurricane Maria made landfall, the Navy had deployed just two ships, citing concerns that Puerto Rico's ports were too damaged to accommodate numerous large vessels. However, harrowing reports of U.S. citizens struggling without electricity, food, and water have prompted the Pentagon to accelerate the relief effort, even though territorial officials have not specifically requested assistance.\n\nThe issue of port congestion has been a point of contention, with some attributing military inaction to this factor and the reluctance to waive the Jones Act. However, it seems that a lack of preparedness may also be a significant factor. For instance, the hospital ship USNS Comfort, which was announced to be on its way to Puerto Rico, is still not en route, despite being ready to deploy as soon as the call comes.\n\nThe Comfort, a mammoth ship, was docked Tuesday in its home port of Norfolk, Virginia, with a minimal crew. It requires up to five days to stock up and prepare for departure. When reached on Tuesday afternoon, the commanding officer of the ship's hospital, Capt. Kevin D. Buckley, stated, \"The Comfort is ready to go, if the call comes.\"\n\nThe order to move the Comfort finally came a week after the storm, but the ship is still not underway, a delay that could have been avoided had preparations been made a week before Maria hit Puerto Rico, as soon as the power and course of the storm became clear. In comparison, during the Haiti disaster, the Comfort was ordered on its way immediately following the earthquake.\n\nWhile the White House has decided to allow foreign-built or flagged ships to deliver supplies during the emergency, it has restricted members of Congress from making official visits as official delegations to the hurricane-battered U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Congressional sources from both parties stated this on Wednesday. The office of Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), who had been organizing a visit to Puerto Rico by several representatives and senators from both parties, is now trying to find alternatives to assess the federal response thus far.\n\nThe San Juan Airport is open, though the speed of flights going in and out is severely restricted by the damaged infrastructure. The restriction on Congressional flights has some validity, though it has the notable side effect of preventing any Congressional oversight or evaluation of conditions on the ground.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Discusses High Expectations for Women in Public Eye, Acknowledges Different Styles and Approaches\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton discussed the high expectations placed on women in the public eye, particularly high-achieving women. Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential front-runner, stated that these expectations often lead to the assumption that women must perform at a higher level all the time.\n\nDuring the interview, Clinton commented on the unique challenges faced by women in politics, stating, \"I think Mika and I understand this, and maybe it's because still today, when you are a high-achieving woman\u2014particularly one in the public eye\u2014you really are just expected to perform at a higher level all the time.\"\n\nClinton went on to say, \"And there are not enough experiences with different styles or different approaches that women make. Men, my goodness\u2014you know, there's a million different ways you could be successful, you could communicate and all the rest of it. And look, I'm not telling you anything you don't know.\"\n\nHost Joe Scarborough had been discussing how his co-host, Mika Brzezinski, was doing more preparation for the interview than he was and asked Clinton if she ever looked at how her husband did things and thought \"it's not fair.\" Clinton responded, \"I am not a natural politician like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama.\"\n\nClinton explained that her approach to politics is rooted in service and a deep conviction to ensure opportunities for all. She stated, \"So for me, it really came through the root of service; it really came from my deep conviction that we had to make sure that this country we all love kept producing opportunities for everybody, and I see that narrowing, and I see people being left out, and it upsets me.\"\n\nClinton also acknowledged that her emotional investment in her work sometimes makes her approach more nerve-wracking, stating, \"And so I invest a lot of energy and a lot of my own emotion into what I do and I think sometimes, instead of that being as easy to understand as I would like it to be, it sometimes is a little nerve-wracking.\"",
    " Title: \"America's Progress and the Question of Comparative Normality: A Reflection on Spears' GLAAD Vanguard Award Speech\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Philadelphia, a city known for its historical significance, a sign at a march outside a Starbucks on April 16, 2018, serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing discourse surrounding societal norms and individuality. This discourse was further highlighted by Britney Spears' acceptance speech of the GLAAD Vanguard Award last week, which touched upon the emphasis society places on 'normalcy' and the uniqueness of each individual.\n\nSpears' speech, while heartfelt and sincere, sparked a thought-provoking question: \"Those who only know one country, know no country,\" as political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset once observed. This statement underscores the importance of understanding the unique characteristics of one's own country, as opposed to making comparisons that may not accurately reflect its true nature.\n\nIn the case of the United States, the discourse often revolves around allegations of deep-seated racism and sexism. While it is undeniable that discrimination exists, it is crucial to differentiate between acknowledging the presence of injustices and labeling the country as the most racist or sexist in the world. A quick search on Twitter for \"most racist\" and \"America\" reveals a plethora of such assertions.\n\nHowever, a closer look at the data paints a different picture. In 1958, 44% of white Americans said they would move if a black family moved in next door. Forty years later, that number had dropped to 1%. This significant decrease in racial prejudice is a testament to the progress made in American society.\n\nMoreover, the increasing rate of interracial marriages serves as a tangible example of this progress. In 1967, only 3% of newlywed marriages were interracial. By 2015, this rate had risen more than fivefold, to 17%. These statistics suggest that people willing to spend their lives with individuals of another race are not lying about their feelings.\n\nWhen considering America's racial dynamics, it is essential to ask, \"Compared to whom?\" By no plausible objective standard is America the most racist or bigoted country in the world, even among industrialized countries. In a 2014 study ranking countries by opposition to having a racially different neighbor, America ranked 47th (with 6% of the population saying they were opposed).\n\nFurthermore, the United States admits more immigrants than any other country and has democratically elected a racial minority head of state, a feat unparalleled by any other major power in the world.\n\nThe discourse on America's attitude towards homosexuality mirrors the racial discourse. While there has been a history of discrimination, it is important to remember that quick comparisons to countries without such a history may not be accurate or fair. Attitudes towards homosexuality have followed the same trend as race, with a significant decrease in prejudice over time.\n\nIn conclusion, while America is not without its problems, it is essential to question the comparative normality of societal attitudes. The progress made in race relations, as well as other areas, should not be overlooked or underestimated. Acknowledging and addressing injustices does not mean that America is the worst offender; rather, it means recognizing the need for continued growth and understanding the unique characteristics of our country.",
    " Title: Senate Holds Briefing on Election Security Amidst Ongoing Opposition from GOP Leadership\n\nThe United States Senate will hold a private briefing on election security this Wednesday, a move that has been long-sought by Democrats and comes amidst growing concerns about foreign interference in the 2020 elections. The briefing, which is expected to include officials from the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, is set to take place amidst Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's ongoing opposition to the consideration of election security legislation.\n\nWhile both parties have expressed concerns about potential interference by Russia and other foreign powers, the Republican party has been more reluctant to take up concrete measures. This reluctance is partly due to McConnell's resistance, as he views these laws as potentially giving the federal government too much control over state and local elections, and as a means to benefit the Democrats.\n\nThe briefing, while viewed as a victory for Democrats, may not lead to significant changes in Republican stances on election security. The actions of the Republican-controlled Senate up until this point suggest they might not be moved to take further action. Despite repeated warnings from high-level government officials, McConnell, in particular, has seemed relatively immovable on the issue.\n\nThe Senate has allowed several bills addressing election security to fall by the wayside, including the Protecting American Votes and Elections Act, the Defending the Integrity of Voting Systems Act, and the Foreign Influence Reporting in Elections Act. As a result, the US Senate, which allocated $380 million in election security funds last year, is now effectively promoting a do-nothing approach to a subject that special counsel Robert Mueller and countless national security officials have raised as a serious threat that requires additional action.\n\nThe inaction of the Senate, under McConnell's leadership, is not just a political message, but could have major consequences. Democrats are hoping an in-depth briefing about the risks the US faces might push Republicans to change course. The FBI Director, Christopher Wray, has gone so far as to call 2018 the \"dress rehearsal for the big show in 2020.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Iran Nuclear Agreement Critique: A Final Chance for Congress and Allies\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Trump's sharp criticism of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement on Friday, calling for stricter conditions on Iranian behavior to prevent the U.S. from withdrawing from the pact, has set the stage for a potential renegotiation or termination of the agreement.\n\nIn his speech, President Trump emphasized the need for a more stringent agreement, stating, \"As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we ignore a threat, the worse that threat becomes.\" He also made it clear that the agreement is under continuous review and that his administration has the power to cancel U.S. participation at any time.\n\nWhile some may have preferred a clean withdrawal from the nuclear agreement, the president's decision to give Congress and European leaders a final chance to address its flaws is commendable. The president's call to action was met with immediate endorsement from the Israeli and Saudi governments.\n\nThe president's ultimatum, in which he announced that he will terminate the agreement unless its flaws are fixed, was the most significant part of his speech. Given the low probability that Congress, U.S. diplomats, or European officials can devise and implement any substantial changes to the nuclear agreement, the deal's future is uncertain.\n\nCongress now has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose severe economic sanctions on Iran that were lifted by the nuclear agreement. Congress will also consider legislation addressing the agreement's shortcomings and \"triggers\" imposing sanctions in response to Iranian behavior.\n\nAny legislation or renegotiation of the nuclear agreement must address its three major flaws: allowing Iran to enrich uranium, operating a plutonium-producing heavy-water reactor, and the deal's weak inspection provisions. Other issues, such as Iran's missile program, support of terrorism, and meddling in regional conflicts, should also be addressed.\n\nWhile there has been some talk of extending the deal's \"sunset\" clause, such a fix would be meaningless without addressing the above changes concerning Iran's nuclear program. However, none of these vital changes is likely to be approved by Congress in legislation or agreed to by other nations who signed the Iran deal.\n\nCongress is unlikely to pass legislation with any substantial fixes to the agreement due to the opposition of moderate Republican senators and the need for bipartisan support. The Senate would require 60 votes to pass such legislation, making it challenging to secure the necessary support.\n\nFurthermore, based on a statement by a senior European Union official on Friday, European states plan to resist any efforts by U.S. officials to fix the nuclear deal. By not withdrawing from the pact immediately, President Trump is attempting to work with Congress and follow the law.\n\nIt's worth noting that President Trump can reimpose most sanctions on Iran himself if Congress fails to act. The president could take such action and impose additional sanctions as part of a withdrawal decision.\n\nIn the coming weeks, expect to see many pundits and members of Congress discussing various schemes to fix the nuclear deal. However, the nuclear deal with Iran appears to be all but dead, and in about two months, President Trump may put the Iran deal out of its misery.",
    " Title: HHS Reverses Obama-Era Rule, Defines \"Sex\" as Biological for Obamacare Nondiscrimination Policy\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has announced a new rule that defines \"sex\" as biological for the purposes of nondiscrimination under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The rule reverses a regulation implemented during the Obama administration that redefined \"sex\" to include \"gender identity\" and \"termination of pregnancy.\"\n\nThe new rule, which takes effect immediately, brings federal policy into compliance with court rulings that deemed the Obama-era interpretation of \"sex\" as unlawful. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas had previously enjoined and vacated the Obama-era provision, citing violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nRoger Severino, director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights, explained that the new rule \"updates the books to reflect the reality that 'gender identity' and 'termination of pregnancy' have been deemed unlawful interpretations of civil-rights law.\" The rule also maintains the Obama administration's decision not to include \"sexual orientation\" as a protected category under the definition of sex discrimination.\n\nOpponents of the Obama-era regulation had expressed concerns about its implications for health care and religious freedom. The policy required medical professionals to treat individuals according to their gender identity rather than their biological sex, which could lead to improper health-care decisions. The policy also raised religious-liberty and conscience rights concerns, particularly for health-care workers.\n\nThe decision to reverse the Obama-administration regulation is likely to be met with criticism from progressive activists and their allies in the media. The New York Times, for instance, had previously claimed that the Trump administration could \"define transgender out of existence.\"\n\nHowever, the move aligns with a key promise made by President Trump during his campaign and throughout his time in office, to undo Obama-era policies that redefined \"sex\" to include \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity.\" This move, though it comes near the end of his first term, is another step in showing his supporters, especially social conservatives, that he is willing to follow through on his promises.",
    " Title: James Carville Discusses 2016 Presidential Election and the State of the Republican Party\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with * \u2588\u2588\u2588's Hive, political strategist James Carville, a longtime confidant of the Clinton family, discussed the 2016 presidential election and the current state of the Republican Party.\n\nWhen asked about the election's outcome, Carville expressed his belief that the Democrats were poised for a significant victory. \"It's hard to look at it right now and come to any other conclusion than it is going to be a pretty sizable win for the Democrats,\" he said.\n\nCarville attributed the Democrats' advantage to demographic changes in the country, which he described as unfavorable to the Republican Party. He also pointed out that the Republicans' focus on non-college whites had not been successful in presidential years.\n\nBeyond demographics, Carville highlighted the negative impact of the last Republican presidency and the economic downturn on the party's prospects. \"The last time we had a Republican president, we had a disastrous war and a disastrous recession,\" he said. \"To the extent that peace and prosperity matter to anybody\u2014which have traditionally been the two biggest drivers in American politics\u2014they do not bode well for the Republicans.\"\n\nCarville also addressed the rise of Donald Trump and the shift in the Republican Party's base. He noted that Trump's appeal to ethnocentric, nationalistic sentiments resonated with at least half of the Republican Party, which he described as a significant departure from traditional Republican views.\n\nCarville also touched on the concerns within the Republican Party about losing an entire generation. \"There are a lot of people in the United States that genuinely\u2014and with some validity\u2014think their influence is shrinking,\" he said. \"Their lives have not turned out as they expected or hoped. Trump comes along and says, 'Of course this happened to you because of stupid politicians and immigrants.' He is appealing to people who look around, and their constant refrain is, 'This is not the same country that we grew up in.' And it's not.\"\n\nThe interview took place before the latest chapter in the Clinton email scandal broke, which has since prompted fresh accusations of preferential treatment to major Clinton Foundation donors and a \"pay to play\" culture during her tenure as Secretary of State. The scandal has added another layer of complexity to an already contentious election cycle.",

He emphasized his commitment to being the champion for the aspirations of all Americans and encouraged voters to cast their ballots on Tuesday.\n\nReflecting on the past, President Obama pointed to the administration's achievements, such as the end of the Iraq war, the death of Osama bin Laden, and the creation of nearly 5.5 million new jobs in the last two and a half years. He also highlighted improvements in home values, 401(k)s, energy independence, and the revival of the American auto industry.\n\nLooking ahead, the President outlined his vision for real change, emphasizing investments in education, job training, research, technology, and healthcare. He highlighted his administration's efforts to make college more affordable, recruit math and science teachers, and train community college students for high-demand jobs.\n\nPresident Obama also emphasized his commitment to manufacturing and innovation, stating that he is not the candidate who said \"let Detroit go bankrupt.\" He pledged to create a tax code that rewards companies creating jobs in the U.S. and supports clean energy jobs and technology.\n\nThe President also emphasized his commitment to reducing the deficit through spending cuts and asking the wealthiest Americans to return to the income tax rates they paid during the Clinton administration. He pledged to work with anyone, regardless of party, to move the country forward.\n\nIn conclusion, President Obama emphasized that the America he believes in is within reach, and the future he hopes for is within sight. He urged voters to cast their ballots on Tuesday to continue the progress made in education, job creation, energy, and opportunity for all Americans.",
    " Title: Florida High School Shooting Survivors Lobby for Assault Rifle Ban in Tallahassee\n\nAritcle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, dozens of students and parents from the school traveled to Tallahassee on Tuesday to lobby for a ban on assault-style rifles. The mass shooting, which claimed the lives of 14 students and three educators, has sparked a national debate on gun rights and stricter firearm controls.\n\nStudents from the high school were emotional as they arrived in Tallahassee, greeted by waves, cheers, and somber applause from fellow teens. Diego Pfeiffer, a senior at Stoneman Douglas High, told the crowd, \"We're here to make sure this never happens again.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, less than a week after the shooting, the Republican-controlled Florida House of Representatives rejected a bill to block sales of assault-style rifles in the state. Tyra Hemans, a 19-year-old senior who traveled to the state capital, said, \"I am not going back to school until lawmakers, and the president, change this law.\"\n\nStudent and parent activists from the high school in Parkland were expected to stage a rally on Wednesday at the statehouse. Fourteen students and three educators were killed, and 15 other people were wounded in the Feb. 14 attack. Nikolas Cruz, 19, a former student expelled from Stoneman Douglas High for disciplinary problems, was arrested and charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder.\n\nThe year before, Florida's Department of Children and Families had opened an inquiry into Cruz after he was reported to have been cutting himself. However, the case was closed in November of that year with the finding that he was receiving sufficient support.\n\nThe youth-led protest movement that emerged in the wake of the shooting attracted prominent celebrity supporters on Tuesday. Film star George Clooney and his wife Amal, a human rights lawyer, pledged to donate $500,000 to help fund a planned March 24 gun control march in Washington. Hollywood director Steven Spielberg and media mogul Oprah Winfrey later joined in contributing $500,000 each toward the march.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News poll released on Tuesday showed 77 percent of Americans believe the Republican-dominated U.S. Congress is doing too little to prevent mass shootings, with 62 percent saying President Donald Trump has not done enough on that front. Trump signed a memorandum on Tuesday directing the attorney general to draw up regulations banning devices that turn firearms into machine guns, like the bump stock used in October's mass shooting in Las Vegas.\n\nStudents and parents elsewhere in Florida and in other states, including Tennessee and Minnesota, staged sympathy protests on Tuesday, according to local media reports. Funerals continued for the young victims of Wednesday's attack. The U.S. Military Academy at West Point on Tuesday said it made a rare posthumous letter of acceptance to Peter Wang, a student of the school killed in the shooting. A Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps cadet, Wang had aspired to attend the elite academy.\n\nGun violence on public school and college campuses has become so commonplace in the United States during the past several years that education officials regularly stage drills to train students and staff about what they should do in the event of a mass shooting on school grounds. Gun ownership is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and remains one of the nation's more divisive issues. A federal ban on assault weapons, in force for 10 years, expired in 2004.",
    " Title: Lobbyists Push Back Against Potential Alterations to Mortgage Interest Deduction and Carried Interest Tax Breaks in Upcoming Tax Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final 15 days before the Senate Finance Committee's deadline for justifying tax provisions in the Tax Code, two significant tax breaks are under scrutiny: the mortgage interest deduction and the carried interest tax break. These tax breaks, which are among the most contentious in the current tax system, could face significant changes or elimination in the ongoing tax reform discussions.\n\n1. Mortgage Interest Deduction\n\nThe mortgage interest deduction, which allows homeowners to deduct up to $1 million in mortgage interest annually, including for vacation homes, is a substantial tax expenditure, making it a prime target during tax reform. The Congressional Budget Office projects the break will cost over $1 trillion over 10 years.\n\nCritics argue that the deduction, often considered the epitome of popular tax breaks, may undergo significant changes to reduce its value while still being accessible to middle-class homeowners. President Barack Obama has proposed capping all deductions, including the mortgage interest write-off, at 28 percent. Lawmakers could also focus the write-off more on lower-income homeowners by capping it at $500,000 and replacing the deduction with a credit, saving $213 billion, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n\nLobbyists, such as the National Association of Realtors, are emphasizing the positive impact of the mortgage interest deduction on the housing market, particularly in vacation communities. They argue that curbing the break could harm housing prices during a time when the U.S. is slowly recovering from a years-long housing crisis.\n\n1. Carried Interest Tax Break\n\nThe carried interest tax break, which allows hedge fund managers, private equity executives, and other Wall Street professionals to pay a special tax rate on profits-based compensation known as carried interest, is another contentious issue. Instead of paying ordinary income taxes, which top out at nearly 40 percent, carried interest is taxed as a capital gain, generally at a rate of 20 percent, with an additional 3.8 percent tax on investment income this year.\n\nThe carried interest tax break costs approximately $17 billion over 10 years. Democrats have long argued that the break is unfair, as Wall Street executives' pay is taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. With tax reform underway, they may finally succeed in taxing carried interest as ordinary income if lawmakers decide it's not worth spending time on the tax concerns of hedge fund and private equity managers.\n\nIndustry lobbyists, such as the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, have consistently fought off Democrats' efforts to eliminate the carried interest tax break, arguing that higher taxes would negatively impact the economy. They claim that increasing taxes on carried interest would harm partnerships that support thousands of companies across the country.\n\nAs the Senate Finance Committee works to overhaul the tax system, these two tax breaks, along with hundreds of others, will likely face significant changes or elimination. Lobbyists and industry groups will continue to advocate for their preservation, emphasizing the positive impact they have on the housing market and the economy.",
    " Title: FBI Fails to Act on Tip Regarding Florida School Shooter Nikolas Cruz\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) admitted on Friday that they had received a tip more than a month before the Parkland, Florida school shooting, in which 17 people were killed, that Nikolas Cruz owned guns, expressed a desire to kill people, and could potentially carry out a school shooting. However, the tip was not passed on or properly investigated.\n\nAccording to the FBI, a person close to Cruz called in with concerns about him on January 5, 2018. The tipster described Cruz's gun ownership, his erratic behavior, disturbing social media posts, and the potential of him conducting a school shooting. The bureau stated that the tip should have been forwarded to the Miami field office and investigated, but that didn't happen.\n\n\"Protocols were not followed,\" the FBI said in a statement, adding that the Miami field office did not receive the tip, and \"no further investigation was conducted at this time.\"\n\nThe FBI's failure to act on this tip is likely to generate scrutiny on how law enforcement handles its investigations in such cases. FBI Director Christopher Wray said, \"We are still investigating the facts. I am committed to getting to the bottom of what happened in this particular matter, as well as reviewing the processes for responding to information that we receive from the public.\"\n\nFlorida Governor Rick Scott called for Wray's resignation, stating, \"We constantly promote'see something, say something,' and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act.\"\n\nIn addition to the call to the FBI tip line, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said at a press conference Friday that his department had received about 20 calls regarding Cruz in the past few years. He did not give details about the calls but said he would investigate each one to make sure it was handled appropriately.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in a tweet, appeared to blame \"neighbors and classmates\" for not reporting Cruz to authorities. However, the FBI's statement is the latest piece of evidence that many people not only saw red flags in Cruz's behavior but tried to report them, and those warnings were not thoroughly pursued or fell on deaf ears.\n\nThis failure on the part of the FBI comes after questions over a YouTube comment posted last fall by someone named \"nikolas cruz\" that read \"Im going to be a professional school shooter.\" A man in Mississippi saw the comment on his YouTube channel and flagged it to both YouTube, which removed it, and the authorities.\n\nAt a press conference Thursday, FBI special agent Rob Lasky said that agents had spoken with the man who made the complaint, which tipster Ben Bennight confirmed with the New York Times. Lasky also said the FBI conducted database reviews and checks but was unable to identify the commenter.\n\n\"No additional information was found to positively identify the person who posted this comment,\" Lasky said.\n\nThis article has been updated with comments from Governor Rick Scott and the Broward County sheriff.",
    " Title: LGBT Uninsured Rate Among Low- and Middle-Income Americans Decreases by a Quarter Since Affordable Care Act Implementation\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report from the Center for American Progress reveals a significant decrease in the uninsured rate among low- and middle-income LGBT Americans since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The report, which relies on surveys of LGBT individuals earning less than 400 percent of the poverty line, shows a drop in the uninsured rate from 34 percent in 2013 to 26 percent in 2014.\n\nThe decline in the uninsured rate among LGBT individuals is slightly faster than the drop among the general population, where the uninsured rate fell by about a quarter. The gains were particularly large among lower-income groups, which were eligible for bigger insurance subsidies or the Medicaid expansion. The uninsured rate for LGBT individuals earning between 139 and 200 percent of the poverty line fell by 18 percentage points.\n\nThe report shows that 26 percent of LGBT Americans under 400 percent of the poverty line are uninsured, while among the general population, the number is 20 percent. LGBT people can face unique obstacles in gaining coverage, such as the lack of a federal law requiring companies to offer health benefits to their employees' same-sex partners. The report also suggests that anti-LGBT bias in hiring may push many LGBT people into unemployment or low-wage jobs that do not offer benefits such as health insurance coverage.\n\nOnly 38 percent of LGBT people under 400 percent of the poverty line have an offer of insurance through either their own or their spouse's employer, while among the general population, that number stands at 58 percent. The report also highlights disparities in coverage rates within the LGBT community, with gay and bisexual individuals having higher insured rates than lesbian women, and the uninsured rate among transgender populations being especially high. The report suggests that the uninsured rate among transgender populations has come down significantly under the Affordable Care Act, although the 2013 survey only included a smaller number of transgender individuals.\n\nA correction was made to an initial version of this story, which misstated the size of the decline of the uninsured rate for LGBT people. The correct figure is 24 percent.",
    " Title: Historic Flooding in Texas: Catastrophic Rainfall and Swift Government Response\n\nArticle:\n\nThe state of Texas is currently grappling with catastrophic flooding following the remnants of Hurricane Harvey, with the situation expected to worsen in the coming days. Houston, the fourth-largest city in the US, has already experienced a record 30 inches (75cm) of rain, turning roads into rivers. Forecasters predict that the total rainfall could nearly double by the end of the week.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has promised swift action to aid those affected, with a visit to Texas scheduled for Tuesday. He stated, \"Recovery will be a long and difficult road, and the federal government stands ready, willing, and able to support that effort.\" Trump is also dealing with Congress on funding, warning that the situation will be \"very expensive.\"\n\nAt least nine deaths have been reported in incidents related to the storm, with more than 3,000 people rescued in and around Houston. The area is expected to have received a year's worth of rainfall within a week. Officials expect half a million disaster victims to seek assistance in Texas, and 30,000 people to be housed in emergency shelters.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has warned of \"catastrophic and life-threatening flooding\" in south-eastern Texas, with additional rainfall of 15 to 25 inches expected. Army engineers have begun releasing water from two dams controlling water flowing along a major river into the heart of Houston to prevent water from spilling into neighboring communities, which could cause further damage.\n\nMany schools are closed, and Houston's two main airports have been shut down due to flooded runways. The Texas Gulf Coast, a key center of the US oil and gas industry, has seen some of the largest refineries in the country halt operations.\n\nResidents in the suburbs west of Houston have been wading through waist-high flooding for miles to reach shops, schools, and work. Many have been forced to form makeshift armadas using boats, jet skis, and inflatable rafts to navigate the treacherous waters.\n\nComparisons have been drawn with the disastrous evacuation of homes in New Orleans ahead of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which left thousands of people stranded in squalid conditions at the city's stadium. Tens of thousands of people have been ordered to leave parts of Fort Bend County, about 35 miles south-west of Houston, where a river is set to crest this week.\n\nDallas, 240 miles north of Houston, will set up a \"mega shelter\" at its convention center to house 5,000 evacuees, city officials said. However, Houston authorities have not issued a mass evacuation order. Mayor Sylvester Turner defended this decision, citing the \"crazy\" logistics of planning an evacuation of 2.3 million people.\n\nPolice Chief Art Acevedo stated that officers are focused on protecting the city from looters, with four people arrested on Monday.\n\nFor those willing to speak to a BBC journalist, please provide a contact number.

The interview also saw Warren addressing the long-standing controversy surrounding her Native American heritage, a topic that has been a point of contention in her Senate campaigns and could potentially complicate a presidential bid.\n\nWhen asked about the calls for genetic testing to resolve the heritage controversy, Warren shared a family history as recounted by her parents and grandparents. She stated, \"It's a part of who I am, and no one's ever going to take that away.\"\n\nSenator Warren, who is running for a second Senate term this year, has been accused of claiming Native American heritage to secure jobs, including a position as a Harvard law professor. She has acknowledged identifying as a minority, but denies using her status to further her career.\n\nPresident Trump has frequently referred to Warren, a Wall Street critic and potential White House rival, as \"Pocahontas,\" a notable Native American woman in colonial history, to highlight the controversy.\n\nIn the interview, Warren shared personal anecdotes about her family. \"My mom and dad were born and raised out in Oklahoma,\" she said. \"My daddy was in his teens when he fell in love with my mother. She was a beautiful girl who played the piano. And he was head over heels in love with her, and his family was bitterly opposed to that because she was part Native American.\"\n\nWarren went on to describe the hardships her parents faced during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, and their resilience in raising their children, including Warren and her older brothers, all of whom served in the military. She concluded, \"I know who I am because of what my mother and my father told me, what my grandmother and my grandfather told me, what all my aunts and uncles told me and my brothers.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Ruth Bader Ginsburg Align on Prisoner's Supervised Release Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined her conservative colleagues in a decision regarding a prisoner's supervised release case on Monday. The liberal justice, alongside Justices Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh, ruled that a criminal defendant, in this case Jason Mont, can be sentenced for violating his supervised release, even if the release expires while he is incarcerated ahead of facing new charges.\n\nMont, who had been indicted by a grand jury for multiple drug and firearm offenses, was released from federal prison on March 6, 2012, but was found guilty of two counts of cocaine trafficking and tested positive on several drug tests. His supervised release date was set for June 28, 2017.\n\nIn this case, Mont challenged the jurisdiction of the District Court, arguing that his supervised release had initially been set to expire on March 6, 2017. The court, however, concluded that it had authority to supervise Mont, revoked his supervised release, and ordered him to serve an additional 42 months' imprisonment to run consecutive to his state sentence.\n\nIn her dissent, Justice Ginsburg argued that time in pretrial detention should not be considered supervised release unless the charges against the defendant are dismissed or the defendant is acquitted. This, she stated, ensures that the defendant is not faulted for conduct he might not have committed, while otherwise giving full effect to the lawful judgment previously imposed on the defendant.\n\nThis surprising alliance between Ginsburg and Thomas comes a week after a tense argument over the case Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky Inc. The Court decided against taking up the question of the Sex Selective and Disability Abortion Ban, which, as Justice Thomas described it, bans abortions in which \"the mother is seeking the abortion solely because of the child's race, sex, diagnosis of Down syndrome, disability, or related characteristics.\"\n\nIn his 20-page opinion, Thomas wrote about the potential for eugenic manipulation in abortion, citing Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger's openness about the use of birth control for eugenic purposes. Ginsburg, in response, described Thomas's diatribe as \"displaying more heat than light.\" She reasoned that \"a woman who exercises her constitutionally protected right to terminate a pregnancy is not a'mother.'\"\n\nToday, the justices managed to find an issue on which they have common ground. The decision in the Mont case is a reminder of the complex and nuanced nature of the cases that come before the Supreme Court, and the often unexpected alliances that can form among the justices.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Immigration Bill Includes Pet Provisions for Specific Industries\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 844-page bipartisan immigration bill, a historic shift in policies such as a path to citizenship for 11 million unauthorized immigrants, there are provisions that cater to the interests of the senators who crafted it. These pet projects, or industry-specific provisions, are designed to address the needs of key sectors in their respective states.\n\nFor instance, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has advocated for more visas for the meat industry, a significant employer in his state. New York Democrat Sen. Charles Schumer, whose state has a large Irish population, has pushed for special treatment for Irish workers. Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio has sought assistance for the cruise-ship industry, a significant business in his home state. Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet has included a boost for ski areas in the bill.\n\nOne of the most contentious additions to the bill is the provision that sets aside up to 20,000 additional visas for meat cutters and trimmers. This move was spearheaded by Sen. Graham, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. The meat industry employed 158,480 Americans nationwide in May 2012, according to the Labor Department.\n\nIn South Carolina, broilers (chickens raised for meat) are the number one commodity, generating $698 million in 2011, nearly 27% of all agricultural cash in the state, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Turkeys were the second-largest commodity in the state.\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers International Union is not in favor of the visas to bring in more foreign workers, citing a lack of labor shortage in the industry. \"The way we view this is it's an earmark for meat and poultry, and we strongly, strongly oppose it,\" said Tim Schlittner, a spokesman for the labor union.\n\nSen. Bennet, working with an association that represents most of Colorado's ski resorts, has crafted a provision to make it easier for them to hire foreign ski instructors. Instead of using a visa program for temporary, low-skilled workers, ski instructors would be eligible to come to the U.S. under the same program that professional athletes use.\n\nSki areas are hiring fewer foreign workers for jobs such as housekeeping and lift-operating since the recession, but finding certified ski instructors, especially those who speak other languages and can communicate with foreign tourists, has been a problem. \"The perfect example of this is a certified ski instructor who speaks Portuguese,\" said Melanie Mills, president of Colorado Ski Country USA, which represents 21 of Colorado's 25 ski areas.\n\nFor Sen. Schumer, the immigration bill was an opportunity to weave in an extra 10,500 visas for Irish people with at least a high-school degree. Sen. Rubio, from hurricane-prone Florida, has inserted an opportunity for foreigners to come to the U.S. for 90 days to work on relief operations after state or federal disasters. He has also given a nod to the recently embattled cruise industry with a provision allowing certain foreigners to repair cruise ships made abroad, as well as other transportation equipment.\n\nFew business sectors have been more critical of immigration-bill provisions than the construction industry, but even it fared better than expected. Sen. Rubio and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who both advocated for the construction industry during negotiations, were not able to get a cap lifted that limits construction visas to 15,000. However, they did include a provision, which many in the construction industry had feared dead, allowing foreigners to work in higher-skilled jobs such as electricians, plumbers, and welders.\n\nDespite the victory, various construction groups said in interviews they would fight the overall cap on construction jobs. \"Obviously, this is just the first step of a long road,\" said Marco Giamberardino, executive director of government affairs at the National Electrical Contractors Association.",
    " Title: Martin Family Urges President Obama to Investigate Trayvon Martin's Shooting Death, Calls for Peaceful Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a television interview on Thursday, Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, called on President Barack Obama to thoroughly examine the circumstances surrounding her son's shooting death, stating that the verdict has sent a troubling message to American teenagers.\n\nAppearing on \"CBS This Morning,\" Fulton, accompanied by her husband, Tracy Martin, was asked what action she expected from the president. \"At least investigate what happened,\" Fulton said. \"At least go through it with a fine-tooth comb and just make sure all the T's are crossed and all the I's are dotted, because this is sending a terrible message.\"\n\nThe interview marked the first time Martin's parents had given television interviews since the verdict was announced last weekend, which found George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon Martin. Obama released a statement urging calm following the verdict, but has not publicly commented on the decision.\n\nThe Department of Justice is currently investigating whether it will bring a civil rights case against Zimmerman, although the White House has stated that Obama will not be involved in the decision-making process. Martin's family attorney, Benjamin Crump, indicated that they were considering legal options for a potential civil suit and were seeking the Justice Department's input.\n\n\"We're asking the Department of Justice to answer that question for us,\" Crump said. \"Can a private citizen with a gun profile and follow our children home? Because the United States Supreme Court doesn't even allow the police to profile people based on race, so this is an issue \u2013 we need to know because we got to know what to tell our children.\"\n\nTracy Martin also spoke on NBC's \"Today\" on Thursday, stating, \"Obviously, any time you have a person that makes an assumption that a person is up to no good, there's some type of profiling there. Was he racially profiled? I think that if Trayvon had been white, this wouldn't have ever happened. So obviously race played some type of role.\"\n\nThe Martin family also urged protesters to maintain peaceful demonstrations, with Fulton stating on NBC, \"We have always maintained to do things decent and in order, and we think the protests should be peaceful protests.\"\n\nEmotionally affected by the verdict, Martin's parents discussed the impact of the case on them. \"As parents, understanding how they reached that verdict, I'll never grasp that concept,\" Tracy Martin said in another interview on \"Good Morning America\" Thursday. \"We feel that the verdict, we didn't feel it was fair. And of course it's devastating.\"\n\nFulton also responded to one of the jurors who, anonymously speaking with CNN, placed some of the blame for Trayvon's death on him. \"I don't think she knows Trayvon. Trayvon is not a confrontational person. So instead of placing the blame on the teenager, we need to place the blame on the responsible adult. There were two people involved. We had an adult that was chasing a kid, and we had the kid, who I feel was afraid,\" Fulton said on CBS.",
    " Title: Bush and Obama Share Stage in Rare Display of Bipartisanship at White House Portrait Unveiling\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare display of bipartisanship, former President George W. Bush and current President Barack Obama shared the stage during the unveiling of Bush's official portrait at the White House. The event, attended by Bush's family, including his daughters Jenna and Barbara, as well as former President George H.W. Bush and first lady Barbara Bush, was marked by humor and camaraderie.\n\nBush, known for his jocularity, jokingly compared his portrait to that of George Washington, stating, \"I am pleased that my portrait brings an interesting symmetry to the White House collection: It now starts and ends with George W.\" He then turned to First Lady Michelle Obama, quipping, \"If anything happens, Michelle, this is your man.\"\n\nThe audience, comprising former Bush administration officials, family members, and friends, erupted in laughter. Bush's next line, advising Obama to \"gaze at his portrait\" whenever he had a significant decision to make and ask himself, \"What would George do?\" drew even louder laughter.\n\nRetired and living on his ranch in Crawford, Texas, Bush charmed the audience with his trademark humor, while the Obamas, in the midst of a heated re-election campaign, were tasked with playing gracious hosts and focusing on shared experiences and the pressures of the presidency.\n\n\"We may have our differences politically,\" Obama said, \"but the presidency transcends those differences.\" He thanked the Bush family for their assistance during the transition in late 2008 and for the advice the Bush daughters gave to Malia and Sasha.\n\nObservers would never guess, based on Obama's tribute to Bush in the White House State Room, that he had spent a significant portion of his presidency blaming Bush for numerous challenges, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the economic downturn, and soaring deficits.\n\nDespite the political differences, the White House maintained that there was mutual respect and appreciation between the two presidents. White House spokesman Jay Carney stated, \"There were differences, I'm sure, in the past when incumbent presidents have presided over these ceremonies. But there is so much in common for the men thus far who have occupied this office and for their families who have lived in the White House, that I think there is a great deal of respect and appreciation held by everyone who is participating.\"",
    " Title: The Balance Between Privacy and Progress: A Modern Dilemma\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the digital age, the balance between privacy and progress is a delicate one, as individuals grapple with the implications of voluntary and involuntary data sharing. The latest revelations highlight the issue, with Scarlett Johansson's nude photos being leaked, a Pennsylvania high school's remote activation of students' laptop cameras, and the tracking of internet users' activities by favorite websites.\n\nJohansson's case underscores the potential consequences of data breaches, as a hacker obtained and disseminated nude photos of the actress without her consent. In a similar vein, a Pennsylvania high school's decision to remotely activate students' laptop cameras while they were away from school has sparked controversy, raising questions about privacy and surveillance.\n\nMeanwhile, the tracking of internet users' activities by websites is becoming increasingly common, with programs like Disconnect revealing the extent to which personal data is being collected and analyzed. This information includes browsing habits, reading preferences, and purchasing history.\n\nIn response to these developments, some argue that individuals should be more concerned about their privacy. However, others contend that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary data sharing is crucial. Voluntary sharing, such as with Amazon or Facebook, is often seen as less problematic because individuals have the option to check privacy policies and make informed decisions. In contrast, government agencies, such as the National Security Agency (NSA), may access personal information without explicit consent.\n\nThe NSA's data mining activities have been a source of controversy, with concerns about privacy and potential misuse of information. However, the author argues that the important difference is not whether they know one's name, but rather whether the data sharing is voluntary.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's push for black box recorders in all cars is another example of this dilemma. While the bureaucrats argue that the data is needed to improve road safety and infrastructure, concerns about privacy and potential misuse persist.\n\nUltimately, the author suggests that individuals value the freedom to choose when they share personal information, and are willing to give up some privacy in exchange for progress. However, the line between voluntary and involuntary data sharing is increasingly blurred, and the implications of this trend are a topic of ongoing debate.",
    " Title: Police Use of Non-Lethal Weapons in U.S. Protests: A Closer Look at Tear Gas, Pepper Spray, and Rubber Bullets\n\nArticle:\n\nAs demonstrations against the police killing of George Floyd continue to escalate across the United States, law enforcement agencies are employing a range of non-lethal weapons to disperse protesters. These weapons, often described as non-lethal, include tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets. However, these tools have at times resulted in serious injuries.\n\nTear gas, also known as CS or CN gas, is a chemical compound powder that is sprayed from canisters. It produces a burning sensation in the eyes and mouth, causing temporary incapacitation.\n\nPolice have deployed tear gas, pepper spray, and flash-bang devices in cities such as Minneapolis, Seattle, and Washington D.C. Images from these protests show protesters fleeing as they are met with these non-lethal weapons.\n\nPepper spray, chemically distinct from tear gas, also causes a burning and watering of the eyes and skin. It is discharged from handheld devices and projectiles by police officers.\n\nIn addition to tear gas and pepper spray, police have used pepper balls, small projectiles containing chemical irritants. These projectiles can contain PAVA spray, an irritant similar to pepper spray, as well as CS gas. They can be shot from launchers or modified paintball guns.\n\nFlashbang grenades, which explode with bright light and sound to stun and disorient demonstrators, have also been used by police.\n\nRubber, plastic, and \"sponger\" bullets have been reported to have struck protesters. In some cases, these bullets have caused injury, with a 2017 survey published by the British Medical Journal finding that 2.7% of deaths were caused by such \"kinetic impact projectiles.\"\n\nProtesters have also reported being shot with wooden bullets by police forces. Images online show wooden dowel-shaped rods sliced into small, bullet-sized projectiles. The Columbus Police Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn Los Angeles, police have used rubber projectiles, and Mayor Eric Garcetti has stated that the police department will minimize their use going forward.\n\nAs the protests continue, it is crucial to understand the potential consequences of the non-lethal weapons being used by law enforcement. While these weapons are intended to control and disperse crowds, their use can result in serious injury and even death in some cases.",
    " Title: Germanwings Co-Pilot Concealed Illness, Tore Up Medical Leave Note Before Fatal Crash, Prosecutors Say\n\nA statement from German prosecutors on Friday revealed that Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot who is believed to have deliberately crashed a German airliner into the Alps, had concealed an illness from his employers and tore up a doctor's note calling for him to go on medical leave on the day of the tragic incident.\n\nPolice, during a search on Thursday at Lubitz's Dusseldorf apartment, found a torn medical certificate and other documents. Germanwings, the low-cost airline where Lubitz worked, stated in a Friday release that it had received no such sick leave note for the day of the ill-fated flight. Lufthansa, the parent-company of Germanwings, had previously declared that Lubitz was \"100% fit to fly.\"\n\nThe Dusseldorf prosecutors' office statement indicated that no suicide note or claim of responsibility from Lubitz was found, and no evidence of a political or religious background linked to the tragedy was discovered. The officials also stated that the search found no evidence suggesting a political or religious motive for the crash.\n\nThe statement revealed that police found medical documents \"indicating an existing illness and corresponding medical treatment.\" The prosecutor added that a torn-up current sick note, also valid for the day of the incident, was among the documents. This, according to the prosecutor, \"would -- according to preliminary evaluation -- support the assumption that the deceased had concealed his illness towards his employer and his occupational environment.\"\n\nThe nature of Lubitz's illness remains undisclosed, although German media outlets reported he may have suffered from depression. Dusseldorf University clinic stated that Lubitz visited the facility in February and March, most recently on March 10, for diagnosis but denied he was treated there for depression, according to Sky News reports.\n\nGermany's Federal Aviation Office has requested that Lufthansa provide access to Lubitz's medical records, which would then be sent to French investigators, according to DPA reports.\n\nThe cockpit voice recorder revealed that Lubitz deliberately locked the pilot out of the cockpit and then initiated a descent that led to the deaths of all 150 people on board the plane bound for Dusseldorf from Barcelona, French prosecutor Brice Robin said Thursday. No motive was provided.\n\nInvestigators searched Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf and the home of his parents in Montabaur, about 40 miles from Bonn. They were seen removing boxes and large blue bags from both residences.\n\nUnconfirmed reports circulating in the German media suggested that Lubitz, by all official accounts a skilled pilot with a distinguished training record who was not being monitored by security services, may have been suffering from depression.\n\nBild reported that on several occasions, Lubitz's training at Lufthansa's flight school in Phoenix, Ariz., was interrupted for mental health reasons after he had a \"serious depressive episode.\" The German tabloid reported that Lubitz may have undergone treatment after being what it called \"demoted\" several times during his training in the United States.\n\nThe newspaper referred to him as a mass murderer. It said the \"episode\" was noted on his medical records held by the aviation authorities. Der Spiegel also separately reported the findings that have not been confirmed.\n\nGermany's Federal Aviation Office would not confirm the report. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said Thursday that Lubitz's training was \"interrupted\" six years ago, but declined to elaborate.\n\nThomas Winkelmann, the low-cost carrier's chief executive, released a statement Friday saying that the airline has begun setting up a family assistance center in Marseille, France, and that briefings with family members will start there on Saturday.\n\n\"The suffering and pain this catastrophe has caused is immeasurable,\" he said in the statement. \"No words can express it and no amount of consolation is sufficient but we want to be there for visiting family members and friends if our support is desired.\"",
    " Title: NBC News Poll: Christie Trails Clinton in Hypothetical 2016 Match-Up, Faces Divided GOP - Early Stage Polling and the 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nAn early stage poll released by NBC News on Tuesday morning indicates that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie trails former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a hypothetical 2016 match-up, with a 47% to 42% lead for Clinton. The poll also suggests a divided Republican party, with Christie trailing other potential GOP candidates such as Jeb Bush, Rand Paul, and Ted Cruz.\n\nThe poll, which was conducted between February 13 and 16, surveyed 1,000 registered voters and has a margin of error of +/- 3.1 percentage points. It is important to note that neither Clinton nor Christie have officially declared their candidacy for the 2016 presidential race.\n\nThe first contest of the 2016 election cycle, if nothing changes, will be the Iowa caucuses, likely in January 2016. The general election is more than 1,000 days away.\n\nThe accuracy of polls taken at such an early stage in the election cycle is a matter of debate. For example, President Rudy Giuliani had high poll numbers in 2007 due to his time as the take-charge mayor of New York on 9/11, but he faded quickly once the GOP primaries got underway. Similarly, other potential candidates such as Colin Powell, Mario Cuomo, Gary Hart, Edmund Muskie, and others have decided not to run or have seen their poll numbers decline over time.\n\nWhile the polling numbers are interesting, it is still early in the election cycle, and the race is likely to change significantly as the candidates begin to campaign and the field narrows. It is important to take these polls with a grain of salt and to remember that the election is still more than a year away.\n\nIn the meantime, there are many other issues to discuss and analyze, and the political landscape is constantly evolving. As a journalist, I am excited to cover the 2016 election and to see how the race unfolds over the next year and a half. But for now, I will take a breather and enjoy the ride.",
    " Title: U.S. President Donald Trump to Meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin: A Look at the Anticipated Meeting and Expected Outcomes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an anticipated meeting this Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump will hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hamburg, Germany. This meeting, which has sparked concerns worldwide, is expected to be a significant event in the ongoing U.S.-Russia relations.\n\nThe meeting will reportedly include only six individuals: the presidents, their respective foreign ministers, Rex Tillerson and Sergey Lavrov, and two translators. This limited attendance has raised concerns, as Lavrov is a seasoned diplomat who has been instrumental in executing Putin's foreign policy since 2004. Tillerson, the U.S. Secretary of State, is expected to be the only other American official in the room.\n\nIn an ideal scenario, a U.S. president with a comprehensive understanding of Russian history and statecraft, and a respect for diplomacy, would use this meeting to address the issue of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. The president would unequivocally support investigations into election meddling, including any potential collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. The U.S. would also threaten to expose the hidden bank accounts and investments of senior Kremlin officials as a means to undermine Russia's status as a great power.\n\nHowever, it is widely expected that this meeting will not follow such a course. Trump's unpredictable and often fractious approach to diplomacy, combined with his apparent distrust of the U.S. diplomatic corps, has led to concerns that the meeting may not yield positive results. Instead, the meeting may focus on issues such as joint U.S.-Russian efforts to combat terrorism, as Trump has shown a greater interest in military matters.\n\nIt remains to be seen what the outcome of the meeting will be, but one thing is certain: the world will be watching closely as the two leaders engage in what promises to be a significant and potentially pivotal encounter.",
    " Title: Indiana Primary Polling: A Matter of Uncertainty as Trump and Cruz Battle for Victory\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Indiana prepares for its primary election on Tuesday, the race between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz remains uncertain, with both candidates holding significant leads in various polls. The state has seen less attention than other major primary contests, with only seven public telephone surveys in the past month, compared to nine in Wisconsin and 17 in New York.\n\nThe scarcity of public polling and the varying results, including one survey showing Cruz leading by 16 points and several recent surveys giving Trump similarly large leads, is due to a combination of factors. These include a longer primary process than some organizations budgeted for, a short one-week run-up to the primary, and unique state laws that make it more difficult to conduct some kinds of phone surveys.\n\nTed Cruz's campaign has been eager to dismiss the new Indiana surveys showing the Texas senator trailing Trump. Cruz stated on Mike Gallagher's syndicated conservative-talk-radio show that \"Indiana is neck and neck.\" Of the seven public polls conducted over the past three weeks, Trump leads six, with Cruz's only advantage coming from an Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne survey that showed Cruz with a massive 16-point lead.\n\nAndy Downs, the pollster for the IPFW survey, said his team was surprised by the results, questioning whether the results for Cruz and Trump were incorrectly reversed. The IPFW poll differs from the other surveys in two ways: a longer, 15-day field period and the lack of demographic weighting.\n\nDemographic weighting allows pollsters to adjust their surveys to ensure a representative sample. Without weighting, the poll may under-represent younger voters and over-represent older voters. Downs declined to weight the results due to the long time since Indiana held a competitive GOP primary.\n\nThe other public polls show Trump ahead, but by varying margins. Trump's slimmest lead came in a one-day survey conducted last Wednesday by Clout Research, with a 2-point advantage over Cruz. Trump's largest lead, 17 points, was in a poll conducted last Thursday and Friday by Gravis Marketing, a prolific but less-respected firm.\n\nThe most recent reliable poll, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey conducted last Wednesday-Friday and released on Sunday, showed Trump with a commanding 15-point lead over Cruz, 49 percent to 34 percent. Lee Miringoff, the director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, said the poll came in the wake of two newsmaking maneuvers the Cruz campaign has attempted: the deal with Ohio Gov. John Kasich to allow Cruz a one-on-one shot at Trump in Indiana, and naming Carly Fiorina as Cruz's running mate.\n\nCarly Fiorina, in response, criticized the Marist poll, stating that it has been \"way off\" in the past. Miringoff responded, citing a line from the Mel Brooks western spoof \"Blazing Saddles\": \"Can't you see that's the last act of a desperate man?\"\n\nMarist's biggest miss of the primary campaign was in the Michigan Democratic primary, where Bernie Sanders won by less than 1.5 points after Marist's final poll showed him 17 points behind Hillary Clinton. \"It's not accurate\" to say they have been \"way off,\" Miringoff said. \"In fact, we've had a very good track record in the primaries \u2013 which are not easy.\"\n\nIPFW's Downs acknowledged that the poll is out on a limb showing Cruz ahead, but he stressed that he doesn't yet know why his numbers differ from other pollsters. \"We really have no idea what the electorate will be,\" he said. The outcome of Tuesday's primary will provide valuable insights into the remaining GOP race and the overall presidential election.",

Ilhan Omar Calls for Impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh Amid Allegations; New York Times Alters Report Following Backlash\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) called for the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh following a report in The New York Times that alleged an eyewitness saw friends of Kavanaugh engage in an inappropriate act at a college party. However, the Times later amended its report on Sunday evening, stating that the female student involved did not recall the incident, according to friends, and declined to comment.\n\nThe initial report, which was adapted from a forthcoming book by two Times journalists, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly titled \"The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,\" did not include the detail that the alleged victim did not recall the incident. This information was added to the article on Sunday evening.\n\nBefore the Times amended the report, Democrats, including Omar, began calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment. On Sunday, Omar tweeted, \"Nothing terrifies this corrupt president more than the idea of Congress upholding the rule of law. We must open impeachment inquiries against Trump * and * Kavanaugh immediately. It's our constitutional duty.\"\n\nOmar has not commented or taken back her tweet as of Monday.\n\nThe Times' report was met with criticism from both the right and the left for omitting the detail that the alleged victim did not recall the incident. MSNBC's Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough questioned why the Times left out this information, stating, \"We were on the phone yesterday asking each other, wait a second, there's a woman who [Max] Stier claims was abused by Kavanaugh. Has she denied this? Has she claimed this happened? Why is there this glaring omission in the New York Times story?\"\n\nThe Times piece also failed to mention that the person making the new allegation, Max Stier, had served on former President Bill Clinton's defense team during impeachment proceedings. Kavanaugh had served on independent counsel Kenneth Starr's team.",
    " Title: The Rise of Political Polarization in the United States: A Closer Look at the Factors Influencing America's Divide\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States, a nation renowned for its democratic system, has been grappling with a significant increase in political polarization over the past decade and a half. Some experts even suggest that the nation is as divided as it was during the Civil War era. This polarization has led to name-calling, gridlock, and a lack of productive discourse.\n\nA recent BBC video investigates the division of Americans into two warring tribes, shedding light on the factors contributing to this polarized attitude. One such factor is the geographical location of individuals, with the place of residence playing a role in shaping political views and thought. The proliferation of hyper-partisan news and social media further exacerbates this issue, allowing Americans to live in ideological isolation, remaining within an echo chamber if they so choose.\n\nIn the past, American politics functioned differently. For instance, in 1994, the ideological divide was not as pronounced. According to the Pew Research Center, moderates constituted a majority of voters, and Democrats and Republicans were not as ideologically distant from one another. However, over the past two decades, the field of moderates has significantly shrunk, and Democrats and Republicans have moved further apart in terms of finding common ground.\n\nThe question remains: Can America find common ground and bridge the ideological gap? While it is hoped that this may occur in the future, the current state of affairs does not seem promising. Each American strives for what they believe is best for the country, but understanding complex issues and determining effective solutions is a challenging task.\n\nIn the future, it is hoped that Americans and American media can strive for integrity in their sharing of information, moving away from the democratization of unfounded opinion on social media. By fostering an environment that encourages open, informed dialogue, Americans may come to realize that they are in this together, regardless of their political leanings.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidate Amy Klobuchar Vows to Counter Restrictive Abortion Laws, Defends Late-Term Abortion in Certain Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on Fox News Sunday, Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) criticized new abortion laws in Republican-led states and pledged to take action to counter such measures if she wins in 2020.\n\nThe senator pointed to states such as Georgia, which passed the so-called \"heartbeat bills,\" prohibiting abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, typically after six weeks - a time when many women may not yet be aware they are pregnant. Last week, Alabama enacted a near-total ban on abortions at any point in time, even in cases of rape or incest.\n\nKlobuchar described these laws as \"dangerous\" and \"a place that we have never seen.\" She stated that these new laws would effectively make it impossible for women to access abortion, while also noting that some states are attempting to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, which would limit access to contraception.\n\nLawmakers, such as the sponsor of the Alabama law, have made it clear that the purpose of passing such sweeping restrictions on abortion is to provoke a legal challenge. Their aim is to bring a case before the Supreme Court, where a conservative majority might overturn Roe v. Wade, a landmark 1973 decision that established a woman's right to an abortion under the Constitution. If Roe v. Wade is overturned, individual states would be able to decide whether or not to keep abortion legal.\n\nTo combat this, Klobuchar promised that if Roe v. Wade is overturned, \"I would make sure that we are codifying Roe v. Wade into law.\"\n\nIn contrast, Republicans have expressed concern over bills that were proposed in states including Virginia and New York, which make broad allowances for abortion, permitting it at any time during a pregnancy under certain circumstances. The Virginia bill, which sparked outrage when Delegate Kathy Tran said it would allow abortion up until birth, failed in the state legislature. In January, New York passed the Reproductive Health Act, which removed certain restrictions on third-trimester abortions and allowed the procedure at any point in a woman's pregnancy in certain situations.\n\nWhen asked about laws like this, and whether she supports legislation that permits late-term abortions, Klobuchar said she does, in cases where the mother's life or health are in jeopardy.\n\n\"That is exactly what the Supreme Court ruling says and I am OK with that,\" she said.",
    " Title: \"Bernie Sanders' Lead in New Hampshire Challenges Hillary Clinton's 'Inevitability' Amidst Ongoing Scandals\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing race for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bernie Sanders is currently leading in the New Hampshire primary, according to recent polls. This development has sparked a shift in the political landscape, with many observers suggesting that Sanders' rise could potentially challenge the perceived 'inevitability' of Hillary Clinton's nomination.\n\nWhile Clinton continues to lead in national polls by a significant margin, the increasing presence of viable candidates like Sanders is being seen as a positive development by some, as it offers a stronger backup plan should Clinton's campaign be derailed by ongoing scandals.\n\nThe email imbroglio, which has been a constant source of controversy since it emerged in March, is currently the most pressing issue for Clinton's campaign. The handling of the scandal, the swirl of half-truths, denials, reversals, and revelations, has left many questioning the transparency of Clinton's campaign.\n\nThe past five months have seen a recurring sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and dread, reminiscent of the 1990s, as new allegations and counter-attacks from the Clinton camp have emerged. The ongoing email controversy, the potential slush fund run by her husband, and the association with billionaire investor Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged involvement in underage prostitution are all issues that have the potential to cause significant damage to Clinton's campaign.\n\nThe Epstein controversy, in particular, has raised concerns due to the numerous flights taken by Bill Clinton on Epstein's private jet, nicknamed the \"Lolita Express.\" While the nature and extent of Clinton's association with Epstein are still unclear, the potential for further revelations remains a concern for many.\n\nAs the primary season approaches, the question on many minds is when the next scandal will break, and whether it will occur before or after the primaries, the convention, or the debates. The ongoing scandals and the potential for more to emerge have led some to question Clinton's ability to maintain her 'inevitability' in the race for the Democratic nomination.\n\nIn this context, Sanders' rise in the polls is being seen as a positive development by some, as it offers a viable alternative should Clinton's campaign be derailed by ongoing scandals. The focus now shifts to the upcoming primaries and debates, where the candidates will have the opportunity to present their visions for the future of the Democratic Party and the country.",
    " Title: A Reflection on the Obsessive Focus on Political Scandals: Trump-Cohen Case and Beyond\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent court appearance of Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer, has brought renewed attention to allegations of personal misconduct and potential illegal activities. Cohen pleaded guilty to a range of crimes, including making hush money payments to two women at the president's behest, as revealed on Tuesday.\n\nThe revelations have sparked a flurry of reactions, with Trump's critics expressing satisfaction, while his supporters remain unwavering. However, the question remains: Has Cohen's court appearance changed anyone's perception of the president? It is doubtful.\n\nThis development has led me to reflect on the impact of our obsession with political scandals, particularly in the context of the current political climate. It is a reflection that I anticipate sharing more about in the coming days.\n\nThe United States faces significant challenges that require the government's full attention. On Tuesday, for instance, it was reported that Microsoft had detected the Russian military attempting to hack the websites of conservative think tanks. The U.S. continues to engage in low-intensity wars in Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen, without a clear strategic goal or measure of victory. Furthermore, an assertive and self-confident China is building islands in the South China Sea for military bases, potentially controlling crucial trade routes.\n\nOur preoccupation with the intricate details of illicit but consensual relationships between adults, or the gossipy West Wing intrigue, diverts attention from these pressing issues. I, for one, am exhausted and bored by the psychodramas that consume an unnatural portion of our collective attention.\n\nIt is not my intention to shame Trump's critics into silence with this reflection. I share this view regardless of political affiliation. During the Obama years, we were subjected to speculation about his birthplace, notably from Trump himself when he was still a private citizen. If you disagree with the president's policies, such as his plans to renegotiate trade deals or his efforts to secure NATO member contributions, by all means, express your dissent.\n\nHowever, this fixation on petty personal corruption serves as a harmful distraction. Trump's personal indiscretions are a sideshow. So were Bill Clinton's \"bimbo eruptions.\" Let us refocus our attention on the critical issues that demand our collective effort and understanding.",
    " Title: Trump Accuses China and EU of Currency Manipulation, Threatens Tariffs on All Chinese Imports\n\nPresident Donald Trump has criticized China and the European Union for manipulating their currencies and interest rates, stating that a stronger U.S. dollar and rising interest rates are undermining America's \"competitive edge.\" In a series of tweets on Friday, Trump also indicated his readiness to impose U.S. tariffs on all Chinese imports, amounting to approximately $500 billion, the value of all U.S. imports from China last year.\n\nTrump's comments come during a week when he is facing growing pressure over his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The president's lukewarm support for U.S. intelligence agencies' findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election has sparked criticism.\n\nIn an apparent reference to the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, Trump added, \"Tightening now hurts all that we have done. Debt coming due & we are raising rates -- Really?\"\n\nIn a CNBC interview that aired earlier on Friday, Trump stated, \"We are being taken advantage of and I don't like it.\" This marks a shift in an escalating trade war with countries the president accuses of trading unfairly, raising the prospect that the conflict could also morph into a currency spat.\n\nTrump's comments break with decades of tradition that presidents avoid commenting directly on the dollar or the path of U.S. monetary policy. The latter is usually seen as the domain of the Fed, while the U.S. Treasury secretary is typically the chief spokesman on the dollar.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected to face questions about the U.S.'s dollar policy and the Fed's independence during two days of talks with G-20 counterparts in Buenos Aires this week. Mnuchin has faced criticism from international counterparts about the U.S. talking about currencies before.\n\nViraj Patel, a foreign-exchange strategist at ING Bank NV, stated that Trump's comments likely put a ceiling on the recent U.S. dollar rally so far this year. There is a risk the dollar \"de-couples from interest-rate differentials as investors come to terms with the White House's mercantilist U.S.-dollar policy,\" Patel said.\n\nTrump's accusations that China and the EU are manipulating currencies contradict a Treasury Department semi-annual report released in April that refrained from naming any country a currency manipulator based on specific criteria.\n\nTrump's criticism of the Fed's series of rate increases and his comments on currency manipulation mark a departure from more than two decades of White House tradition of avoiding comments on monetary policy out of respect for the independence of the U.S. central bank. The Fed has raised interest rates five times since Trump took office in January 2017, with two of those coming this year under Chairman Jerome Powell, the president's pick to replace Janet Yellen. In the CNBC interview, Trump called Powell a \"very good man.\"\n\nThe U.S. economy has so far proven resilient to Trump's threat of taking a trade conflict to the next level. The president has already angered allies by slapping tariffs on steel and aluminum, and he is considering a widely-criticized move to levy duties on auto-imports. Trump earlier this month imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, with another $16 billion to follow soon. The administration has also released a list of 10 percent tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods, which could take effect as early as next month. China retaliated on the first wave of tariffs by slapping duties on the same dollar amount of U.S. imports, and Beijing has said it will fight against any further U.S. actions.",
    " Title: California Senator Diane Feinstein to Propose Legislation for Semi-Automatic Firearm and Large-Capacity Magazine Ban\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at reducing gun violence, California Senator Diane Feinstein has announced plans to introduce legislation in January that would ban the import, export, manufacturing, sale, and transfer of certain semi-automatic firearms, as well as ammunition clips holding more than 10 bullets. The bill, a revised version of the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, is intended to remove \"weapons of war\" from urban areas.\n\nDuring an interview with NBC's David Gregory on \"Meet the Press,\" Feinstein explained that the proposed legislation would prohibit the sale, transfer, transportation, and possession of these weapons and large-capacity magazines, not retroactively but prospectively. She added that ammunition clips, drums, or strips containing more than 10 bullets would also be banned if the bill becomes law.\n\nFeinstein's proposal is part of an ongoing effort to address gun violence in the United States. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is known for his armed security detail, has been vocal in his support of the bill and has called for gun control to become President Obama's top priority.\n\nHowever, a recent Gallup poll indicates that support for the reinstatement of an assault weapons ban is at an all-time low. The poll found greater opposition to a ban on semi-automatic guns or assault rifles (53% to 43%) compared to the initial asking of this question in 1996, when the numbers were nearly reversed (57% for and 42% against).\n\nDespite Mayor Bloomberg's advocacy, the poll also shows that support for the broader concept of making gun laws \"more strict\" is at its lowest by one percentage point (43%), with 44% preferring that gun laws remain as they are now, and 11% favoring less strict laws.\n\nIt is worth noting that mass shootings are not exclusive to the United States. Incidents of mass shootings have occurred in various countries, such as Norway, Finland, and Germany, demonstrating that the issue is not solely a result of insufficient gun control in the U.S.\n\nPresident Obama has indicated that he will use his executive power to push through new gun control measures before the new Congress starts. The specifics of these measures have yet to be announced.",
    " Title: New York Introduces Alcohol-Filled Traps to Combat Surge in Rat Population\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an effort to combat the city's rat infestation, New York officials have introduced a new method of rodent control. The system, which involves a machine, a trap door, and a pool filled with alcohol-based liquid, is designed to lure rats and subsequently send them to their demise.\n\nThe city, one of the most rat-infested in the United States, has seen rodents moving through rubbish and train tracks, causing disruption for many residents. The device, in essence, functions as a bucket that attracts rats and subsequently sends them to their death.\n\nAccording to Anthony Giaquinto, president of Rat Trap, the rodents are rendered unconscious by the liquid and eventually \"drown.\" The rodent carcasses are collected in a tank, capable of holding up to 80 dead rats.\n\nDuring a trial in Brooklyn, a total of 107 rats were lured and killed over a month-long period. In July 2017, the city announced a $32 million (\u00a326 million) program to cull thousands of rodents by installing rat-resistant bins and trialing a liquid bait designed to make rats infertile.\n\nRat sightings have reportedly increased by almost 38% to 17,353 last year, according to OpenTheBooks, a non-profit watchdog group.\n\nBrooklyn Borough President Eric Adams described the new solution as \"humane and environmentally friendly.\" He suggested that the device would be rolled out in some of Brooklyn's most rat-infested districts.\n\nHowever, not everyone is in support of the new method. Animal rights group PETA has criticized the approach, describing it as \"cruel and frightening.\" Elisa Allen, PETA's director, argues that the method will be ineffective in the long run, as it does not address the overall rodent population, which can rebound when animals remain fertile.\n\nListeners can tune in to Newsbeat at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays, or catch up on the news later.",
    " Title: Republican Senators Criticize Trump for Requesting China to Investigate Biden\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a rare move, three Republican senators have criticized President Donald Trump for asking China to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) stated on Saturday that the president made a mistake by involving China in the political investigation of a rival, calling it \"completely inappropriate.\"\n\nCollins joins Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) in speaking out against the president's actions. The criticism comes as House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry against Trump over his pressure on the Ukrainian president to probe the former vice president and his son over business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nTrump's request for China to investigate the Bidens comes as Hunter Biden had business dealings in China as well. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) found himself in a contentious exchange with NBC's Chuck Todd over comments he made to the Wall Street Journal. Johnson had said he \"winced\" at the suggestion that Trump was holding back military aid from Ukraine if the country didn't probe 2016 election meddling.\n\nJohnson explained during the Sunday interview that he didn't want aid tied to an investigation. \"When I asked the president about that, he completely denied it. He adamantly denied it. He vehemently, angrily denied it. He said, 'I'd never do that,'\" Johnson said, defending Trump.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) suggested that Trump was joking when he said Thursday morning that \"China should start an investigation into the Bidens.\" Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a top Trump ally in the House of Representatives, made similar comments Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump defended his requests to Ukraine and China to investigate Hunter Biden's business dealings on Twitter. \"There is NO WAY these can be legitimate transactions? As lawyers & others have stated, as President, I have an OBLIGATION to look into possible, or probable, CORRUPTION!\" Trump wrote.\n\nThe developments come as the impeachment inquiry against Trump continues, with the House Intelligence Committee set to hold its first public hearings this week. The inquiry centers around Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens in exchange for military aid.",
    " Title: Ethan Couch's Extradition Raises Questions on Equal Justice and Systemic Bias\n\nArticle:\n\nEthan Couch, the Texas teenager who was sentenced to probation and rehabilitation for manslaughter in a 2013 drunk-driving crash that resulted in the deaths of four people, is likely to face a harsher sentence as he is extradited from Mexico following his arrest for parole violation. The case, which has been a subject of controversy and debate, has once again brought to light questions about equal justice under the law and systemic bias in the American justice system.\n\nAt a press conference on Tuesday, Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson acknowledged that the justice system \"struggled to fulfill its promise\" in the Couch case the first time around. The manhunt for Couch concluded on the same day that a grand jury in Cleveland declined to bring charges against two police officers who killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice in 2014.\n\nThe Couch case, along with the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the man who killed Trayvon Martin in 2012, has been a subject of intense scrutiny and debate. The verdict in the Couch case, many argue, offered a stark contrast to the treatment of African-American defendants in similar circumstances.\n\n\"What we see is how apparently neutral rules are always applied case by case, whether it's parole officers or judges or police officers, based on cultural factors,\" says Daniel Filler, a law professor at Drexel University in Philadelphia.\n\nThe timing of Couch's capture has raised questions about equal justice under the law, with observers noting the juxtaposition of the Couch case and the Tamir Rice grand jury decision. The case has been a subject of discomfort for many Americans, with the verdict offering a stark example of separate justice systems in the United States, one for the rich and another for the poor.\n\nThe terms of Couch's parole suggest he could now face up to 10 years in prison, which would represent half the amount requested by prosecutors after the crash. The sentence came after Ethan pleaded guilty to four counts of manslaughter.\n\nThe Couch case has brought to light a growing list of disparities in the American justice system, with only 32 percent of Americans thinking the country has made enough changes to its justice system, according to a recent Pew Research Center report. The percentage of Americans who say that more change is needed has risen from 46 to 59 percent in the same span.\n\nProfessor Filler notes that events like the capture of Couch in Mexico raise public awareness about glitches in the promise of equal protection, which in turn can act as a check on the law. \"Every time you add a layer of risk that someone will detect misconduct, I think you increase the chances that misconduct [in the justice system] will be reduced,\" Filler says.",
    " Title: Tea Party Groups Raise Concerns Over Immigration Bill, Threatening President Obama's Speedy Approval\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Senate has passed its version of the immigration bill, the focus has shifted to the House, where the bill now lies. Republicans in the House have announced they will take up their own version of the legislation. President Obama, during his Africa trip, called on the House to \"get this done\" before the August recess. However, the House lawmakers are already facing conservative calls to slow down the process.\n\nIf the debate extends into August, when Congress takes a nearly month-long recess, the prospects for a speedy approval could become more uncertain. During the 2009 August recess, the Tea Party famously helped stall ObamaCare by storming town hall meetings and other events. Tea Party groups may be preparing to mount demonstrations during the summer break.\n\nEarlier this week, dozens of conservative groups, including the Cincinnati Tea Party, sent a letter to House Speaker John Boehner urging him to declare the Senate package \"dead on arrival.\" They expressed concerns that the Senate bill, by providing up to 11 million illegal immigrants a path to legal status, would make life harder for U.S. workers struggling to reach the bottom rung of the economic ladder.\n\nThe Tea Party's influence on the Republican Party's stance on immigration remains to be seen. On health care, the movement was largely united against ObamaCare. On immigration, the party is split. Fourteen Republican senators voted for the bill that passed the Senate last week. Several influential conservative economists have argued that immigration legislation would be beneficial for the economy, with newly legalized workers and an enhanced legal immigration system providing the economy with the boost it needs.\n\nTea Party supporters argue that these conservatives are falling for the \"amnesty\" ruse, claiming that the mass legalization will override any security improvements. Political strategists view immigration as an important issue that the Republican Party should not ignore. However, Tea Partiers have a powerful tool at their disposal - the ability to threaten wavering lawmakers with a primary challenge.\n\nIn South Carolina, Tea Party activists staged protests at Sen. Lindsey Graham's office, a key Republican who helped draft the bill. Ron Hughes, with the South Carolina Tea Party Coalition, stated that activists would \"love\" to see Graham face a primary challenge. \"We wanted a full-time conservative senator, and he has not done that for us,\" he said.\n\nHouse Republicans have stated they will proceed at their own pace, on their own bills, when it comes to immigration. Last Sunday, they dismissed a prediction by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., that the House would simply pass the Senate bill. \"The House will not simply take up and pass the Senate bill,\" a Boehner spokesman said. \"Our legislation will reflect our principles, particularly on border security.\"",
    " Title: Fox News Cuts Back on Airing President Trump's Rallies, Concerns Rise Among White House and Campaign Officials\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Fox News, a network that has been a stalwart supporter of President Donald Trump, has been cutting back on airing his campaign rallies. This shift in coverage has raised concerns among White House and campaign officials, as they see a potential loss of a prime-time megaphone to the President's base.\n\nDuring the past week, Fox News aired clips and highlights from Trump's rallies but largely stuck with its regular weekday prime-time programming. On some occasions, the network opted to air other programming instead, such as the Utah Senate debate or coverage of Hurricane Michael. This shift in coverage was particularly noticeable during the midterms, with less than a month remaining before the elections.\n\nOne senior White House official expressed concern about the network's decision, stating that they would be looking into the matter and wouldn't be surprised if White House communications director Bill Shine, a former Fox News executive, was in touch with former colleagues about the trend.\n\nCampaign officials are equally concerned about the loss of national coverage. A Senate Republican campaign staffer noted that the coverage of Trump rallies exposes their campaigns to a national audience that they don't typically reach. They reported seeing an increase in new sign-ups and small-dollar donations as a result of the coverage.\n\nA source close to Trump described the declining coverage as a \"huge loss on the state and local level for Republicans because they're certainly not going to get any of that on other cable networks.\" The source added that if the network stops taking them completely, it might create a problem.\n\nNeither Fox News nor the White House responded to requests for comment.\n\nAccording to Nielsen ratings, Trump's campaign speeches tend to follow a similar pattern, and this year's numbers have ranged from 2.5 to 3.5 million viewers, depending on various factors. In 2017, Trump's events at times drew more than 4 million viewers on Fox News, a number he hasn't come close to in 2018.\n\nThe sheer number of rallies is a significant factor in Fox News' decision to cut back on airing them. A person familiar with Fox News' decision-making stated that the network doesn't want to give up so much prime-time real estate. They also noted that too much repetition could lead to lower ratings, particularly during a busy news period like the first week of October, when Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination was still up in the air.\n\nCompounding the issue, Fox News can't take commercial breaks while Trump is speaking, costing the network some of its best advertising slots. With so many rallies and little promise of a ratings boost, there's not much incentive for the network to clear airtime.\n\nFormer Fox News host Eric Bolling, who left the network in September 2017, noted that nightly rallies aired live and in full would probably subject Fox News to even greater scrutiny. The channel has often been described as a \"propaganda machine\" by Trump's political opponents, many of whom claim its coverage of his administration has at times been sycophantic.\n\nDespite the recent changes, Trump has not faulted the network for its programming decisions. At his Tuesday-night rally in Iowa, which wasn't aired, he heaped praise on his \"great friends\" at Fox News.",
    " Title: American Service Members Halt Train Attack in Europe, Saving Lives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events on August 21, two American service members thwarted a potential tragedy on a train traveling from Amsterdam to Paris. Two individuals were injured in the attack, one of whom was a U.S. Airman, identified as Spencer Stone, and a person with dual French/American citizenship.\n\nAccording to fellow service member Alek Skarlatos, who was interviewed, the incident unfolded as they returned from Afghanistan. Mr. Skarlatos, a specialist in the Oregon Army National Guard, stated that he and Airman First Class Spencer Stone, along with another friend, noticed a man carrying an AK-47 and a handgun.\n\n\"I looked over at Spencer and said, 'Let's go,'\" said Mr. Skarlatos. \"And he jumped. I followed behind him by about three seconds. Spencer got the guy first, grabbed the guy by the neck, I grabbed the handgun.\"\n\nThe suspect, a 26-year-old Moroccan man, was identified by Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve of France on Saturday as a known member of the radical Islamist movement. However, the French police have not yet fully confirmed his identity. The man was arrested in Arras on Friday night and was being interrogated early Saturday at the headquarters of the antiterrorism police outside Paris.\n\nFrench news reports suggest that the suspect denied having terrorist aims, claiming he intended to rob the passengers. However, the arsenal described by the minister, including a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a Luger automatic pistol, nine cartridges, and a sharp blade, paints a different picture. The blade, referred to as a \"cutter\" by the interior minister, was used to wound Mr. Spencer.\n\nThe violent encounter lasted barely two minutes. If not for the quick action by the two American servicemen and the suspect's malfunctioning automatic rifle, many lives could have been lost. \"It could have been a real carnage,\" said Chris Norman, a British businessman who helped restrain the suspect after he had been subdued.\n\nMr. Norman, interviewed on television, recounted the harrowing incident: \"The guy actually came up, he pulled out a cutter, started cutting Spencer. He cut Spencer behind the neck, he nearly cut his thumb off. We eventually got him under control.\"\n\nThis incident serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing global threat of terrorism and the bravery of those who put their lives on the line to protect others.",
    " Title: Trump Proposes Compromise on Immigration Policy, Offering Permanent Status for DACA, TPS, and Central American Minors in Exchange for Border Wall Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in policy, President Donald Trump has proposed a compromise on three contentious immigration issues, marking a retreat from his previous stances on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), Temporary Protected Status (TPS), and the Central American Minors (CAM) program. The White House described the move as a \"good faith\" effort to break the long-standing gridlock on immigration reform.\n\nThe proposal, announced on Saturday, involves restoring and legalizing the DACA, TPS, and CAM programs, offering a permanent solution for those currently benefiting from these initiatives. In return, Trump is seeking $5.7 billion for his border wall project and changes to expedite the deportation of illegal immigrant families and address abuses in the asylum system.\n\nThe White House also proposed items that both sides generally agree on, such as more technology to scan for drugs in vehicles at legal border crossings and an increase in the number of immigration judges to reduce the backlog of cases.\n\nVice President Mike Pence stated that the DACA proposal is a significant change, as Trump had previously expressed reluctance to act on DACA until the Supreme Court had ruled on his 2017 attempt to phase out the program. The proposal would provide a three-year guarantee of protections for those currently using DACA.\n\nRegarding TPS, the Homeland Security Department has signaled an end to protection for as many as 300,000 individuals, some of whom have been protected for two decades. The White House, in immigration negotiations last year, resisted adding TPS holders to any deal, but this resistance has now dissipated.\n\nThe Trump administration canceled the Obama administration's CAM program in 2017, which aimed to provide asylum applicants in Central American countries a chance to apply from their home countries. The program saw limited participation and was terminated, drawing criticism from Democrats who argued that the president was forcing people to undertake the dangerous journey north. Trump is now proposing to restart the CAM program, this time with full legal protections.\n\nDemocrats have expressed a preference for a full pathway to citizenship for the 1.5 million people who could qualify for DACA and the hundreds of thousands under TPS. They also criticized Trump's offer as disingenuous, stating that he had created problems by rescinding protections for DACA recipients and TPS holders only to offer temporary solutions to address them.\n\nThe Senate, led by Republicans, is scheduled to vote on Trump's plans next week. However, House Democrats are unlikely to support the proposal. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, rejected the president's proposal and stated that her chamber will vote instead on areas of overall agreement, such as immigration judges and scanning technology.",
    " Title: Donald Trump Jr.'s Speech: A Case of Repurposed Content, Not Plagiarism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent political discourse, allegations of plagiarism have been a recurring theme. The Melania Trump plagiarism saga made headlines last week, and Donald Trump Jr.'s speech was soon under scrutiny as well, with claims of plagiarism emerging. However, a closer look at the situation reveals a different story.\n\nThe similarities between the speech written by Frank Buckley, who also penned Donald Jr.'s speech, and an earlier essay by Buckley, are undeniable. Yet, the speechwriter's repurposing of his own work for the Trump campaign, with permission, negates any claims of plagiarism.\n\nCritics persisted, arguing that self-plagiarism is still technically unethical in an academic setting. However, context is crucial in this case. The defense mounted by the Obama camp during the 2008 cycle, when similar allegations surfaced, provides a useful comparison. Obama's use of unoriginal passages without attribution was defended, as the passages were from a friend and Obama had received permission to use them.\n\nIn this political context, if the granting of permission serves as the standard for acceptability, then Donald Trump Jr. is in the clear. This viewpoint was echoed by one of Obama's former speechwriters, Jon Favreau, on Twitter last night.\n\nIt is essential to note that the sitting Vice President has also been accused of plagiarism in the past. As the political season unfolds, it is crucial to maintain a clear understanding of the nuances and context surrounding these allegations.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, I offer some analysis: the political landscape is complex, and it is our responsibility as journalists to present facts accurately and fairly, without bias or prejudice.",
    " Title: White Ex-Congresswoman Halvorson Emerges as Front-Runner in Race to Fill Jackson's Seat\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming special election on February 26, a former Democratic congresswoman, Debbie Halvorson, is the frontrunner to replace Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. in a majority-black district that encompasses Chicago and its surrounding areas. Despite being a white Democrat and an NRA-backed candidate, Halvorson's extensive political experience and narrow but critical base of support in suburban and rural areas of the district could potentially secure her the Democratic nomination, and consequently, the seat.\n\nHalvorson, who was defeated by Jackson in a primary last year, has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association in two of her previous congressional campaigns. This, coupled with the district's significant African-American population (54%), raises questions about her potential victory. However, the crowded Democratic field, with 16 candidates vying for the nomination, could lead to a splintering of the black vote, creating a path for Halvorson.\n\nTo clinch the Democratic nomination, Halvorson may only need to secure as little as 20% of the vote, given the district's liberal leanings. Black leaders, concerned about Halvorson's lead in the polls, are now focusing on gun control as a central issue in the contest, aiming to portray her as an NRA ally who is insensitive to Chicago's escalating gun violence.\n\nReverend Michael Pfleger, a Roman Catholic priest and gun control activist in Chicago, has expressed his opposition to Halvorson, stating, \"The NRA gives Debbie Halvorson an 'A' rating. That tells me she should not be the representative from the 2nd District. If she gets an 'A' rating from the NRA, she gets an 'F' from me.\"\n\nThough Halvorson has described herself as a conservative Democrat, she voted with her party more than 90% of the time in Congress. She supported cap-and-trade bills, President Barack Obama's health care and economic stimulus measures, and positions herself as an experienced politician ready to hit the ground running in Washington after Jackson's resignation in November.\n\nHowever, it is her stance on guns that is drawing the most attention. Though her primary rivals have not directly attacked Halvorson, the campaign's focus on guns is seen as a strategy to differentiate herself from the front-runner. The outcome of the election remains uncertain, but the race is shaping up to be a significant test of the district's political dynamics and the role of gun control in the electoral process.",
    " Title: Young Conservatives Push for Shift in GOP's Stance on Same-Sex Marriage\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of young conservative activists is advocating for a change in the Republican Party's approach to social issues, particularly same-sex marriage, as they believe the current stance is driving away younger voters who would otherwise support the party. The young conservatives argue that the GOP's exclusionary positions force young voters to choose between two parties, and a shift within the GOP could attract them.\n\nRyan Rauner, a leader of NextGen GOP, organized an event last week in Arlington, Virginia, stating, \"We need more compassion, empathy, and tolerance, and, unfortunately, sometimes tolerance means tolerating intolerance. What we can never tolerate is the power of government being used by one group against another because they disagree with their beliefs or their lifestyle. That's not freedom; that's not equality.\"\n\nAccording to Gallup polling released Wednesday, a record 60 percent of Americans now support same-sex marriage, a significant increase from 2009. Among younger Americans, the issue is even more settled, with conservative activists suggesting that some lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender voters could leave the Democratic Party if they feel the GOP is hostile to them.\n\nJerri Ann Henry, the campaign manager for Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry, stated, \"There are a lot of LGBT people out there who are brilliant small business owners, who hold to the principles of limited government, strong families, fiscal conservatism, and strong national security\u2014things that we as Republicans love\u2014but they don't have a place in the Republican Party right now.\"\n\nWhile the issue of same-sex marriage is important to voters, only 26 percent said it is a make-or-break issue, and a candidate must share their opinion on the issue to win their vote. Among those, support for traditional marriage helps Republicans more than it hurts, with 37 percent of those who oppose gay marriage saying a candidate must agree with them, compared to only 27 percent who support recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nRepublican analysts, however, doubt that the 2016 elections will see any major policy shifts for Republicans on the issue, with Mary Anna Mancuso, a former campaign director for former Florida Republican Rep. Connie Mack's Senate race and founder of Political Hype, stating, \"I think that it's an issue that polls well, but I'm not sure it's an issue that's going to vote well.\"\n\nIn reaching young voters, harnessing a digital campaign will likely be critical, and Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio, two already-announced candidates, have done well on that score. Alex Patton, owner of Ozean Consulting, suggested that on a national level, it would be in a candidate's best interest to stress issues that rank higher on the scale of importance for millennials, such as job security and growing the economy, rather than same-sex marriage.\n\nThe young conservatives at the rally do not expect same-sex marriage to be the deciding factor in the 2016 election, but they want to see more Republicans embrace it. Sara Coleman, a realtor who attended the rally, stated, \"Overwhelmingly, Republicans across the country are still going to be viewed as anti-that, anti-equality, and [anti-] marriage, and it's a shame. But all you can do is develop these little core groups, let them rise up, and eventually they will become the norm.\"",
    " Title: Trump Submits Written Responses to Mueller's Inquiry on Russian Election Interference\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development in the ongoing investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, President Donald Trump has submitted written answers to the questions posed by Mueller's team, according to Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani stated on Tuesday that the responses addressed only the questions related to the pre-election period and focused on Russia, and did not include any post-election questions or questions about potential obstruction of the investigation. Trump's answers were submitted before the president departed for his Thanksgiving holiday in Florida.\n\nGiuliani emphasized that Trump did not plan to answer questions about whether he attempted to obstruct the investigation following his election, such as the firing of former FBI Director James Comey. The lawyer stated, \"It is time to bring this inquiry to a conclusion.\"\n\nTrump's responses reportedly addressed topics such as the June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr., other members of Trump's campaign team, and a group of Russians, as well as potential connections to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Roger Stone, a longtime Trump ally with ties to WikiLeaks who is also under investigation.\n\nGiuliani described the questions as detailed, complex, and multipart, but declined to disclose the exact number of questions. Mueller has already brought charges against some former Trump aides, including his former campaign chairman and his former national security adviser, as well as a number of Russian individuals and entities.\n\nU.S. prosecutors are also reportedly preparing to pursue a criminal case against Assange, having obtained a sealed indictment that was revealed in an unrelated criminal case filing last week. WikiLeaks is known for publishing documents that were previously not public, and during the campaign, the group published Democratic emails that U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded were hacked by Russia.\n\nTrump's lawyers have been negotiating with Mueller's prosecutors since last year over whether the president would sit for an interview. Trump himself has offered mixed responses regarding his willingness to be interviewed. In a recent interview, he stated that he was unlikely to do so, explaining, \"We've wasted enough time on this witch hunt, and the answer is, probably, we're finished.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether Mueller would subpoena Trump to testify, potentially leading to a legal and political battle. Earlier this month, Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and appointed Matthew Whitaker as his replacement on an acting basis, renewing calls for legislation to protect Mueller's work. As a private citizen, Whitaker criticized the Mueller probe.\n\nLisa Kern Griffin, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at Duke University, expressed skepticism about much of what had been asked falling outside the scope of legitimate authority, as Giuliani maintained. \"The special counsel has a broad mandate to determine what took place during the campaign and to determine whether there has been an effort to obstruct that investigation,\" Griffin said. \"As other presidents have found out, they are not above the law.\"",
    " Title: Presidential Debate: Strategies for Clinton and Trump in the Race for the White House\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the highly anticipated presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump approaches, the stakes are high. The first one-on-one showdown is expected to attract an audience rivaling the 80 million who watched Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter in 1980. One-third of voters consider the debates crucial in deciding their presidential preference, making it a significant opportunity for both candidates to make their case.\n\nThe debates will likely be characterized by political and personal attacks, with a tendency for departures from the truth, particularly from Donald Trump, who has a history of disregarding factual constraints.\n\nHillary Clinton, the second least popular major-party presidential nominee in modern polling history, needs to strike a balance between providing a compelling vision and avoiding being redefined by Trump. She must address the concerns of today's Democratic coalition, a diverse group with varying interests. Expect Clinton to emphasize her commitment to social justice issues and an overhaul of the U.S. immigration system, while reminding black and Hispanic voters of Trump's past comments about President Barack Obama's birthplace.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, will need to present a more presidential image and demonstrate a command of policy to run the federal government. His unpredictability, a trait that has been both his strength and weakness, will be a challenge to manage. Already, we've seen this in his controversial Twitter invitation to Gennifer Flowers, a woman with whom Bill Clinton reportedly had an affair, to attend the debate as his guest.\n\nBoth candidates will need to navigate the debates carefully, avoiding distractions and focusing on the issues that matter to voters. Clinton will need to engage with Trump's statements in real-time, challenging him when he strays from the truth, while Trump will need to prosecute the case against Clinton without resorting to exaggerations and falsehoods.\n\nIn the end, the debates will be a critical test of the candidates' preparedness, discipline, and ability to present a compelling vision for the future of the United States. The stakes are high, and the debates could very well determine the next President of the United States.",
    " Title: GOP Divided Over Proposal to Allow Undocumented Immigrants to Serve in U.S. Military\n\nArticle:\n\nA contentious debate is unfolding within the Republican Party over a bill that would allow undocumented immigrants, often referred to as Dreamers, to serve in the U.S. military. The proposal, spearheaded by Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), has sparked a divide among lawmakers, with some advocating for the cause and others opposing it.\n\nCesar Vargas, a Dreamer and co-director of the Dream Action Coalition, is one of the individuals who stands to benefit from this legislation. Vargas, a high-achieving graduate of a prestigious Brooklyn high school and a law school honors student, has been unable to fulfill his dream of joining the armed forces due to his immigration status.\n\n\"I believe that because this country has given me so much, I want to be able to give back,\" Vargas said in an interview. \"This is the reality for us. This is the country we call home... What it really comes down to is the commitment to serve the country you call home, the country you want to wear a uniform for.\"\n\nRep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) has been a vocal advocate for this cause, pushing a bill that would grant legal status to young undocumented immigrants who serve in the military. An amendment to a must-pass defense-policy bill, sponsored by Gallego, would encourage the Pentagon to consider allowing immigrants brought to the country as children to serve.\n\nHowever, this amendment has faced opposition from conservative lawmakers, who argue that it could jeopardize the passage of the $612 billion defense-policy bill, which typically receives broad bipartisan support. Led by Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks, more than two dozen House Republicans wrote a letter to the chairman of the House Rules Committee, threatening to oppose the defense bill if the immigration provision was not removed.\n\n\"The language contained in Rep. Gallego's amendment contradicts the House's previous position and is a severe threat to the passage of the NDAA \u2014 legislation which funds the essential programs that America's military requires,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nBrooks, who has been critical of the amendment, claimed that it could lead to Pentagon force reductions and that \"Americans are being handed pink slips as they serve in Afghanistan.\" He also expressed concern about the amendment potentially exempting Dreamers from citizenship and lawful immigrant requirements to serve in the military.\n\nIn response, Gallego said he was surprised by the amendment's controversy and accused Republicans of using it for political gain. \"This is something that is really important, not because these young men and women have a right to be in the military,\" Gallego said. \"No one has a right to be in the military. It's the opportunity and the privilege to serve in the military that we should extend to anybody that's in this country... they should have the opportunity to serve and repay their country.\"\n\nThe amendment passed with the support of House Armed Services Committee Democrats and six Republicans: Reps. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), Chris Gibson (R-N.Y.), Frank LoBiondo (R-N.J.), Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), and Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.).\n\nCoffman, who served in both Iraq wars, expressed his support for the amendment despite opposition from many of his Republican colleagues. \"I'm disappointed in my colleagues for fighting this,\" Coffman said. \"I'm not sure why they're so opposed to this. I've been in the Congress side by side with people who are opposed to this, but yet they themselves did not want to serve. These young people ought to have the opportunity to serve.\"\n\nThe bill is expected to be taken up by the full House this week and then must go to the Senate, where Arizona Sen. John McCain leads the Armed Services Committee. McCain has stated that there will not be a similar provision included in his committee's version of the bill.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes Freeze on Vehicle Fuel Economy Standards, Challenging California's Emissions Authority\n\nThe Trump administration has taken a significant step towards dismantling one of former President Barack Obama's key environmental initiatives, proposing to freeze vehicle fuel economy requirements at the 2020 level and revoke California's authority to set stricter tailpipe emissions standards.\n\nIn a joint proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Thursday, the agencies aim to cap fleet-wide fuel economy at 37 miles per gallon starting in 2020. Under the Obama administration's plan, the fleetwide fuel economy would have gradually increased to approximately 47 miles per gallon by 2025.\n\nThe proposal also seeks to revoke California's authority under the Clean Air Act, which has allowed the state to set more stringent emissions limits and an electric-vehicle sales mandate. This move is expected to face strong opposition from California's leaders, environmentalists, and automakers who have expressed concerns about the potential for a patchwork of federal and state standards.\n\nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao stated, \"There are compelling reasons for a new rulemaking on fuel economy standards for 2021-2026. More realistic standards will promote a healthy economy by bringing newer, safer, cleaner, and more fuel-efficient vehicles to U.S. roads.\"\n\nThe proposal initiates a 60-day public comment period, during which automakers, California, and environmentalists are expected to voice their concerns. A final rule could be finalized by the end of 2018 or early 2019.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that the proposed freeze will have a \"negligible\" impact on air quality and increase the earth's temperature by 3/1000th of one degree Celsius by 2100. The administration also claims that its preferred plan for fuel economy will result in $502 billion in savings for vehicles built between 1975 and 2029.\n\nHowever, the efficacy of these cost estimates is a subject of debate. Nic Lutsey, an engineer at the International Council on Clean Transportation, stated, \"This would be utterly unprecedented. Nobody in any regulatory agency has ever done a cost-benefit analysis anything like this. There's no evidence that efficiency regulations have depressed sales and added fatalities as a result\u2014in any market in the world.\"\n\nThe outcome of this proposal and its cost estimates will significantly impact the plan's public acceptance and its ability to withstand court challenges, as California, 16 states, and the District of Columbia have already filed a lawsuit challenging the plan's scientific underpinnings.",
    " Title: Trump Warns Iran Over Protests, Urges Government to End Violence and Restore Internet Access\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of escalating protests and public outrage in Iran, President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to the Iranian government on Sunday, urging them to refrain from harming their own citizens.\n\n\"To the leaders of Iran - DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS,\" Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday morning. \"Thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you, and the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching. Turn your internet back on and let reporters roam free! Stop the killing of your great Iranian people!\"\n\nThe protests, which grew on Sunday, followed the Iranian government's admission that it accidentally shot down a Ukrainian airliner last week, resulting in the deaths of all 176 passengers and crew members. The incident occurred shortly after Iran launched ballistic missiles at U.S. military bases in Iraq, bringing Washington and Tehran to the brink of all-out war.\n\nThe demonstrations in Iran reveal a growing discontent within the country, as anger is now being directed towards the Iranian government itself. Initially, Iranian leaders denied responsibility for the downing of the plane, only to later reverse their stance as the truth became clear.\n\n\"They are lying that our enemy is America, our enemy is right here,\" a group of Iranian protesters shouted during a demonstration in Tehran, according to Reuters. Protesters also reportedly chanted \"Death to the dictator,\" referring to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nIranian leaders have expressed remorse for the incident and pledged to prosecute those responsible.\n\nTrump administration officials on Sunday reaffirmed their willingness to engage in negotiations with the Iranian government to permanently end Iran's nuclear weapons program. Simultaneously, U.S. officials sought to exploit the growing protests and create a rift between the government in Tehran and Iranian citizens.\n\n\"They want the same things that most people around the world want. They want prosperity,\" Defense Secretary Mark Esper told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" program on Sunday. \"They want the ability to live their lives, to raise their children. And we do support those same aspirations for people wherever they are. I just think you see a very corrupt regime that the Iranian people are finally standing up and trying to hold them accountable.\"",
    " Title: Trump Administration Unveils New Healthcare Transparency Rules, Facing Industry Resistance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at promoting competition and reducing costs, the Trump administration has unveiled new rules that require insurers and hospitals to disclose upfront the actual prices for common tests and procedures. The sweeping changes, however, face stiff resistance from the healthcare industry and could potentially be challenged in court.\n\nThe final rule will apply to hospitals, while a proposed regulation will apply to insurance plans. The disclosure requirements for hospitals will not take effect until 2021, and the timing for insurers is yet to be determined. The rules do not directly affect doctors.\n\nThe new rules are designed to illuminate the complex maze of healthcare prices, enabling informed patients to find quality services at the lowest cost. For instance, the cost of an MRI scan can vary by hundreds of dollars depending on where it is performed.\n\nUnder the new regulations, insurers will be required to create individualized estimates of what patients would owe out-of-pocket due to deductibles and copayments. Hospitals will be required to publish the prices for the 300 most common services that can be scheduled in advance, such as a knee replacement, a Cesarean-section delivery, or an MRI scan. They will also have to disclose what they would accept if the patient pays cash.\n\nThe information will be updated annually, and hospitals will also be required to publish all their charges in a format that can be read on the internet by other computer systems. This will allow web developers and consumer groups to create tools that patients and their families can use.\n\nIn addition, insurers will be required to create an online tool that policyholders can use to get a real-time personalized estimate of their out-of-pocket costs for all covered healthcare services and items, from hospitalization to doctor visits, lab tests, and medicines. They will also be required to disclose negotiated rates for their in-network providers, as well as the maximum amounts they would pay to an out-of-network doctor or hospital.\n\nThe disclosure requirements are part of an executive order President Donald Trump signed this summer. The healthcare industry, however, has expressed concern, arguing that the push for disclosure goes too far and could potentially violate their private contracts. They contend that the government would force them to publicly disclose rates they negotiate as part of private contracts, which are normally beyond the purview of authorities.\n\nIf the industry does go to court, it could be a long time before consumers see any major changes. The ultimate goal of the new rules is to empower patients by providing them with the information they need to make informed decisions about their healthcare and to drive down costs through increased competition.",
    " Title: Grand Jury Decision in Eric Garner Case Sparks National Debate on Police-Community Relations\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the announcement of a grand jury decision on Wednesday not to indict a New York police officer in the death of Eric Garner, politicians and community leaders have weighed in on the issue, highlighting the broader concerns of minority communities regarding fair treatment by law enforcement.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder stated that the cases of Eric Garner and Michael Brown will be investigated by the Department of Justice. The incident, which occurred in July, has sparked nationwide discussions on police-community relations and civil rights.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand expressed her condolences to the Garner family and stated, \"The death of Eric Garner is a tragedy that demands accountability. Nobody unarmed should die on a New York City street corner for suspected low-level offenses.\"\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called the circumstances surrounding Garner's death \"tragic\" and emphasized the importance of respecting the legal process and rule of law. He also acknowledged the need for further investigations and potential improvements to the system.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-Brooklyn/Queens, questioned the grand jury's decision, stating, \"I don't see how you put the video together, you put the coroner's report together, and you don't get one of those two charges, (second-degree manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide) at least as a charge to go to a trial and have a jury ultimately decide guilty or innocence.\"\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton has called for a national march in Washington, D.C. on December 13 to halt police brutality and demand the prosecution of NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo, the officer involved in the Garner case. Sharpton's National Action Network will meet with the National Urban League, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, and the Black Women's Roundtable on Thursday in New York City to discuss further action.\n\nGarner's mother, Gwen Carr, expressed her doubts in the justice system, stating, \"How could we put our trust in the justice system when they fail us like this? They didn't only fail me, they failed many of us. And if we don't take care of this, they may fail you in the future.\"\n\nStaten Island Borough President James Oddo called for calm and emphasized the importance of peaceful protest and advocacy for change. Police commissioner Bill Bratton assigned extra police for Staten Island in anticipation of potential protests following the grand jury decision.\n\nPatrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, issued a statement expressing remorse for Garner's death but not accepting responsibility for the actions that led to it.\n\nThe family of Eric Garner continues to mourn his loss, with his mother, Gwen Carr, expressing her heartache and calling for change in the justice system. The Garner case serves as a reminder of the critical issues of police-community relations and civil rights that our nation continues to face.",
    " Title: Las Vegas Shooting: Witness Accounts and Latest Updates as Death Toll Rises to 50\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting incident at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, survivors and witnesses continue to share their harrowing experiences as the death toll rises to 50. The attack, which also left 406 injured, took place on Sunday night, with the gunman opening fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel.\n\nAs flashing red and blue lights from countless ambulances and police cars illuminated the Strip, survivors stood teary-eyed and shocked at the Rebel gas station behind the MGM Grand. Many made calls to their families, wondering where they would go, with many hotels under lockdown due to the ongoing police operation.\n\n\"The news said it all,\" said Jackie Hoffing, her eyes glassy, still in a clear state of trauma. \"We were there enjoying our time, and it was very obvious it was gunfire coming down into the crowd.\"\n\nThe two gold towers of the Mandalay Bay overlook the site where the concert was being staged. Jason Aldean was beginning his set when the shooter opened fire.\n\n\"It sounded like something was wrong with the speakers,\" said William Walker of Ontario, California. \"Jason Aldean kept playing through three rounds of it. Then once he stopped everyone took it more seriously...\"\n\nPeople piled up behind police cars, and ex-military guys were saying, \"Give me a gun, I'm going to get these fuckers.\" William Walker\n\n\"I started kicking down fences to take shelter behind the buildings,\" said Desiree Price, from San Diego. \"It sounded like machine-gun fire. Bullets hit concertgoers and sparked off the pavement. Hundreds ran. Others ducked or fell on top of one another.\"\n\nTwo girls hid behind a car with us, right outside the concert, said Desiree Price, from San Diego. \"We huddled together. That's why I have their blood on me. One girl was shot in her leg, the other had it in her shoulder. It didn't stop so we all ran \u2013 we kept going.\"\n\nEmily Anderson, also from San Diego, said, \"I saw a lady get hit in the leg and her boyfriend dragging her out and everyone was running. It was chaos.\"\n\nMany said the gunshots sounded as though they were coming from different directions \u2013 and getting closer each time the shooter reloaded.\n\n\"We were under a big spotlight and someone said, 'Turn off the light,'\" William Walker recalled. \"They shut it off and you could see and hear bullets hitting the ground. People piled up behind cop cars, and ex-military guys were saying, 'Give me a gun, I'm going to get these fuckers.'\"\n\nTaking cover under a table, Kevin Kropf, from Orange County, California, waited until tactical police units came in.\n\n\"I didn't want to get up because I didn't want to get mistaken for a bad guy and get shot,\" he said. \"I saw a couple people on the street covered up with sheets, and them loading one girl into the back of a truck. She was definitely dead...she looked to be in her mid-20s and whoever she was with, her husband, was in the back of the truck too. He was a mess.\"\n\nThe streets between the concert grounds and the nearest medical center were a non-stop convoy of ambulances and police.\n\n\"I want to find my friends,\" said Desiree Price. \"I want to go to my hotel room. I want to go home.\"\n\nShe reunited at the Rebel gas station with a friend who had taken shelter with dozens of others in a stranger's condo.\n\n\"I'm still shaking,\" Krista Metz said. \"Every time I start thinking about it I start shaking again.\"\n\nReports of gunmen and shootings at other hotels circulated on Reddit and Twitter, adding to the chaos and panic. Survivors kept emerging from apartment buildings, motels, parking garages, and other emergency shelters. They had nowhere to go, since the Strip remained on lockdown.\n\n\"We've been in the Motel 6,\" said Jackie Hoffing, \"We had stopped in the lobby and thought we were safe, but then they came in and said, 'The suspect is here. Everybody has to run.' It was another stampede. We knocked on a random door and went in there \u2013 about 15 of us \u2013 and hid in the bathroom for two and a half hours.\"\n\n\"I was texting my children,\" she added. \"I thought we were going to die. I told them, 'I love you.'\"",
    " Title: Andrew Yang Proposes Licensing Reform to Boost Mobility and Economic Dynamism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to revitalize America's economic dynamism, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang has unveiled a plan to streamline occupational licensing requirements, aiming to encourage mobility and job mobility across the nation. The proposal, titled \"Get America Moving Again,\" seeks to address the issue of onerous regulations that have been hindering mobility in many parts of the country.\n\nAccording to data from the Tax Foundation, mobility in the United States has been declining since 1948, with only 11.2% of Americans moving in 2015-2016, a significant drop from the 22.2% in 1948. Yang's plan aims to reverse this trend by facilitating the movement of lower-income individuals to areas with better job prospects.\n\nA key aspect of Yang's proposal is the increased recognition of occupational licenses across states. Currently, only three states\u2014Arizona, Montana, and Pennsylvania\u2014have adopted this practice. By recognizing out-of-state licenses, workers would no longer be trapped in the state where they began their careers due to the costly and burdensome licensing process when they relocate to a new state to pursue the same profession.\n\nThe proposal also addresses the financial aspect of relocation by offering a tax credit, capped at $1,000, for moving expenses. This tax credit aims to offset the costs associated with moving, a benefit that was previously available through a deduction in the tax code but was eliminated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n\nGarrett Watson, Special Projects Manager at the Tax Foundation, suggests that Yang's proposed tax credit for moving expenses could stimulate economic growth. However, Watson emphasizes that the tax credit would need to be part of a broader reform package, including reducing licensing burdens and easing zoning laws to drive down the cost of housing, to make a significant impact.\n\nA 2017 paper by labor economists Janna Johnson and Morris Kleiner found that workers in licensed professions are 36% less likely to move across state lines than workers in non-licensed professions. The study also revealed that nationwide, workers in licensed professions lose out on between $178 million and $711 million they could have earned by moving to a different state.\n\nIn essence, Yang's proposal aims to make it easier for Americans to move and find better job opportunities, thereby boosting economic dynamism and mobility across the country. The plan is one of several initiatives Yang has proposed as part of his presidential campaign, which centers on a Universal Basic Income.",
    " Title: Trump's Town Hall Performance in Wisconsin: A Sales Pitch, Not a Policy Discussion\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a town hall setting moderated by Greta Van Susteren on Sunday evening, Donald Trump presented an hour-long performance in Madison, Wisconsin, that left the audience with a sense of a sales pitch rather than a substantive policy discussion. The event, coming after a challenging week for Trump, did not see any significant clarification or restatement of his controversial statements.\n\nTrump reiterated his plans to repeal Obamacare, replace it with a system offering multiple options, and ensure coverage for all while keeping costs low. He also emphasized his intention to lower taxes for the majority of Americans, with the exception of wealthy hedge fund managers who, in his view, are not paying their fair share.\n\nThe candidate reaffirmed his stance on renegotiating trade deals, starting with the Iran nuclear agreement, and bringing jobs back from countries like China and Mexico. However, he provided few details on how these ambitious plans would be executed.\n\nTrump also addressed the opioid crisis in New Hampshire, offering specific solutions, such as cutting off the drug supply and making a call to Mexico's president to discuss the issue.\n\nDespite the lack of specifics, Trump's performance was reminiscent of his characteristic salesmanship, drawing comparisons to the boxing strategy of Muhammad Ali, known for his \"Rope a Dope\" technique. Trump's approach, like Ali's, involves talking extensively while avoiding specifics, a strategy that has proven effective in capturing public attention.\n\nHowever, while Trump was \"Rope a Doping\" in Madison, Ted Cruz's campaign was gaining momentum in North Dakota, securing at least 18 of the 25 delegates, either supporting Cruz or opposing Trump. The long-running Republican nomination battle is far from over, and Trump continues to press on.\n\nCruz's grassroots campaign and Trump's marketing-focused approach highlight the stark differences between the two candidates, with Trump positioning himself as the product and the number one salesman. The race for the Republican nomination remains a heated contest, with both candidates demonstrating their unique strategies to win over voters.",
    " Title: Trump's Unorthodox Foreign Policy Approach: Achievements and Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 16 months of his presidency, Donald Trump has made a significant impact on foreign affairs, surprising critics and detractors with his unorthodox approach. While his domestic achievements have been limited to the passage of a large tax cut and the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice, his foreign policy actions are far more extensive.\n\nTrump has taken steps to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, planned a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, made gains against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and increased troop levels in Afghanistan.\n\nRepublican strategist Alex Conant, who worked for Trump rival Sen. Marco Rubio during the 2016 primaries, acknowledged that Trump's foreign policy has exceeded the expectations of his critics. However, the president's approach is seen as unpredictable, with few experts certain of Trump's exact position on foreign policy issues.\n\nJoel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of State during the Obama administration, stated that Trump \"really lacks a clear, coherent approach around which adversaries, allies, and the agencies can orient themselves.\" The recent visit of French President Emmanuel Macron to Washington, hoping to save the Iran nuclear deal, is an example of this lack of a clear approach.\n\nTrump's unorthodox approach is evident in his handling of North Korea. When Trump threatened to \"totally destroy\" North Korea during a speech at the United Nations, many experts predicted a downward spiral in relations and feared war. Instead, Trump agreed to a meeting with Kim in response to an offer conveyed through South Korea, a move that is being seen as a considerable boost for Trump's approach.\n\nJames Jay Carafano of the Heritage Foundation argued that the idea of Trump as a chaotic figure is exaggerated. \"This is not a scattershot president. This is not a presidency lurching from fire to fire,\" he said. \"This is a president going out very deliberately and pursuing policy.\"\n\nTrump's foreign policy achievements may not translate into electoral benefits, as voters primarily care about issues that impact them directly. However, incorporating foreign policy achievements into a broader narrative could potentially yield political gains. As the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem opened, Jared Kushner stated, \"When President Trump makes a promise, he keeps it.\"\n\nThe world looks to the United States for predictability and stability, and many people have concerns about the instability that Trump's unorthodox approach may bring. The Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage, primarily focused on Donald Trump's presidency.",
    " Title: \"Al Franken's Impact on the Polarization of American Politics: A Hypothetical Scenario\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of political speculation, a hypothetical scenario emerges that places Sen. Al Franken at the center of the polarization, gridlock, and negative sentiments that have characterized Washington for the past decade. This is not a personal indictment of Franken, but rather an exploration of the potential consequences of a different political landscape had Franken lost the Minnesota Senate race in 2008 by several hundred votes instead of winning by a razor-thin margin that prompted months of recounts.\n\nIn this alternate reality, Senate Democrats would have only 59 votes in December 2009, and would have needed to corral at least one Republican vote to pass ObamaCare. President Obama, however, faced little real resistance in Congress to start his presidency, and this lack of need to work with the opposition set the stage for the polarization to come.\n\nWithout a Democratic supermajority, Obama would have been forced to negotiate with Republicans (or, at least, former Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine) and settle for incremental health care reforms that his then-Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel recommended. The GOP would still have been opposed to any Democratic health care reforms, but the antipathy would have been muted because a few Republicans would have supported the legislation. Instead of provoking a pitched partisan showdown that culminated with then-House Minority Leader John Boehner exclaiming that the Congress had \"shattered the bonds of trust\" with the American people, Obama could have tempered the wrath of the Republican opposition.\n\n\"In a democracy, you can only ignore the will of the people for so long and get away with it,\" Boehner presciently argued before the House's fateful ObamaCare vote. \"If we defy the will of our fellow citizens and pass this bill, we are going to be held to account by those who have placed us in their trust.\"\n\nImagine, for a moment, the state of the 2010 midterms without ObamaCare in the equation. Republicans would have run against the stagnant economy with some success. But without the galvanizing opposition to Obama's health care law\u2014Republicans netted a whopping 63 House seats that year\u2014Democrats would likely have narrowly kept control of Congress, and continued to press forward with Obama's agenda. Tea-party-aligned Republicans would have been elected, but absent the wave, not enough to form the concerted opposition that emerged. Veteran Blue Dog Democrats like Reps. Ike Skelton, Gene Taylor, and Chet Edwards (among others) would likely have been reelected, and become bridge-builders between parties.\n\nThe notion of moderate pragmatism prevailing might sound like fantasy to readers who have watched the political cage-fighting over the last seven years. But even in our polarized times, politics is still primarily about self-interest.\n\nObama acted against his political self-interest in pushing ObamaCare through Congress, but given the divided government that ensued, it then made some sense for him to play to his base in his reelection campaign and stick to his liberal principles after winning. At the same time, Republicans would have been committing political malpractice if they ignored the tea-party tsunami that enveloped the country in 2010. With intensifying energy on the Right, the biggest political threat to members emerged from within their own party, and they adapted accordingly.\n\nThe question then becomes: Who started the fire? Obama certainly deserves some of the blame, and he even admitted recently that one of his biggest regrets as president was the polarization that he's leaving behind. The problem is that he hasn't connected his early actions with what transpired.\n\nThe notion that Obama was fated to face an intransigent Republican opposition has always been off-base. He won a historically-high 53 percent of the vote in 2008, bringing Democratic congressional seats that they hadn't won in decades, including ones in rural Alabama and Louisiana. He even won 40 percent of non-college-educated whites\u2014a remarkable tally given how despised he is among this constituency today. Democrats had all the political tools they needed to press Obama's widespread personal popularity into an agenda that could pick off enough moderate Republicans to succeed. (Just consider an alternate reality in which legislation addressing income inequality, job-skills training, and the costs and quality of college education were the centerpieces of an Obama agenda after the recession.)\n\nBut it's also understandable that Obama, eager to be seen as a historically-consequential president, would want to spend all of his political capital early on the Democratic dream of expanding public access to health care\u2014political backlash be damned.\n\nThat's where Al Franken comes in. If it weren't for 312 voters in Minnesota, Obama's ambitions would at least have been curtailed by legislative realities, and the trajectory of his presidency would have looked much different. Franken, the first insult comic to get elected to the Senate, circuitously paved the way for the rise of a much different type of entertainer\u2014Donald J. Trump.",
    " Title: First Amendment Rights and the Sterling Scandal: A Discussion on Privacy and the Marketplace of Ideas\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling's controversial remarks about black people, questions have arisen regarding the violation of his First Amendment rights. However, it is crucial to understand that while Sterling's rights were indeed infringed upon, his First Amendment rights remain intact.\n\nThe First Amendment protects individuals from governmental punishment due to their speech. The National Basketball Association (NBA), as a private club, has the authority to discipline Sterling as it sees fit. The criticism leveled against Sterling is not a violation of his First Amendment rights, but rather a demonstration of the First Amendment in action.\n\nThe marketplace of ideas is a fundamental concept of the First Amendment. Individuals express their ideas, and the public decides which ideas are valid and worthy of acceptance. In the case of Sterling, his ideas have failed in the marketplace of ideas, and it is generally agreed that his views are unpopular and unacceptable.\n\nHowever, the question of legality arises in the context of the recording of Sterling's conversation with V. Stiviano. In California, it is illegal to record a conversation without the knowledge or consent of both parties. The recording featuring Sterling and Stiviano may have been obtained illegally, and the leaking of the recording was morally wrong.\n\nThe issue of privacy is a significant concern in this case. In today's digital age, our private conversations and actions can be recorded and disseminated without our knowledge or consent. This raises questions about the boundaries of our personal privacy and the potential for our private conversations to be used against us in the public sphere.\n\nThe Sterling scandal serves as a reminder that we live in a world where privacy is increasingly scarce. Our intimate conversations, photos, and personal information can be shared without our consent, and the consequences can be devastating. The Sterling story is not just about the exposure of a bigot, but also about the erosion of privacy and trust in our society.\n\nIn conclusion, while Sterling's views are widely condemned, the means by which they were exposed raises questions about the legality and morality of recording and disseminating private conversations without consent. The Sterling scandal serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of privacy in our increasingly interconnected world. As we move forward, it is essential to consider the implications of our actions and the potential consequences of our actions in the digital age.",
    " Title: New Congress Takes Office, Republicans Prioritize Healthcare Reform, Cabinet Confirmations, and Regulatory Rollbacks\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 115th Congress officially took office on Tuesday, with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan presiding over the swearing-in ceremony. The Republican Party, now in full control of both chambers and the White House for the first time in almost a decade, expressed eagerness to tackle a long list of legislative priorities.\n\nOne of the top items on the agenda is the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Cory Gardner, a Republican lawmaker from Colorado, vowed to \"repair the damage\" of Obamacare, citing its broken promises, soaring premiums, failing insurance markets, and dwindling choices.\n\nIn addition to healthcare reform, House lawmakers are planning bills to roll back thousands of federal regulations imposed by the Obama administration, covering areas such as the environment, drilling, and businesses.\n\nThe confirmation of President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet nominees is another pressing matter. Democrats have vowed to make the confirmation process challenging, with reports suggesting they plan to target at least eight of Trump's 15 cabinet picks.\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich expressed concern that the incoming administration might \"lose their nerve\" in taking on the Democrats, particularly during the confirmation process and potential Supreme Court nominations.\n\nCongressional Republicans have already backed down from a controversial plan to revise congressional oversight, following criticism from both sides over the decision to rein in the independent Congressional Ethics Office and place it under the oversight of the House Ethics Committee.\n\nPresident-elect Trump has also faced a series of foreign policy challenges, including dealing with Russia in light of the election hacking controversy, defeating ISIS, and managing the ongoing chaos in Syria. Most recently, North Korea announced on New Year's Day that it was close to test launching an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. Trump responded on Monday, tweeting, \"It won't happen\" on his watch.\n\nThe new Congress and Trump administration will face a multitude of domestic and foreign policy challenges in the coming years, with the healthcare reform, cabinet confirmations, regulatory rollbacks, and foreign policy issues being just a few of the key issues they will need to address.",
    " Title: Justice Department Declares Case Against Andrew McCabe Closed, Allegations of Lying to Investigators Dropped\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, the Justice Department announced on Friday that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe will not face charges following an investigation into allegations that he lied to investigators about a leak to the media. The decision, which is likely to stir controversy, comes after the department's inspector general found that McCabe \"lacked candor\" regarding an aide's conversation with the Wall Street Journal about the FBI's investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nIn a letter to McCabe's attorneys, the department stated, \"based on the totality of the circumstances and all of the information known to the government at this time, we consider the matter closed.\"\n\nThe decision is expected to be met with disapproval from President Trump, who has been vocal in his criticism of McCabe. Trump has repeatedly attacked McCabe online and in public remarks, with McCabe being a frequent target of Republican leaders who allege political bias within the FBI.\n\nMcCabe's wife ran for the state legislature in Virginia as a Democrat, sparking early accusations that he might be favoring Hillary Clinton. Later, McCabe was dismissed after investigators concluded he was not truthful about an incident involving the disclosure of information to a reporter. He was relieved of duty in March, just hours before he was due to retire.\n\nMcCabe has consistently maintained his innocence and has described himself as a victim of political retribution. In response to the Justice Department's decision, McCabe's lawyers stated, \"At long last, justice has been done in this matter.\" They added, \"We said at the outset of the criminal investigation, almost two years ago, that if the facts and the law determined the result, no charges would be brought. We are pleased that Andrew McCabe and his family can go on with their lives without this cloud hanging over them.\"\n\nThe allegations against McCabe stemmed from a report by the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General, which found that McCabe \"lacked candor\" when he claimed he did not know who authorized an aide to discuss the FBI's investigation into the Clinton Foundation with the media.\n\nThe Justice Department's decision not to prosecute McCabe comes a day after Attorney General William Barr publicly criticized Trump's tweets, stating that they \"make it impossible for me to do my job.\"\n\nMcCabe has filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department, alleging that his March 2018 dismissal by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions was a politically motivated act of retribution by Trump and \"unlawful.\"",
    " Title: Virginia Democrats Face Political Quandary as Scandals Engulf State Leadership, Focus Shifts to Black Women\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of a tumultuous political landscape, Virginia's Democratic party is grappling with a series of scandals that have tarnished the state's executive branch. The allegations against three high-profile Democrats, including Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, have created a challenging situation, particularly as the party's 2020 presidential primary heats up and boasts a record number of black and female candidates.\n\nState Senator J. Chapman Petersen, a white Democrat, acknowledged the political dilemma, stating, \"To show a firm grasp of the obvious, the optics would be difficult and the substance would be difficult.\" The situation becomes more complex given the political influence of women and African-Americans, who played a significant role in the Democrats' victories in the 2017 top Virginia races and the 40-seat win in the House midterm elections in November.\n\nWith the Republicans barely holding onto their legislative majority in the Virginia Capitol, Democrats were counting on these two voter blocs to secure victories in the upcoming election of all 140 delegates and state senators. Amidst this, some Democrats in Virginia are advocating for a shift in focus towards their most loyal constituency: black women.\n\nFollowing the emergence of sexual assault allegations against Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax by Vanessa Tyson, a California political scientist, on Friday, several senior Virginia Democrats have suggested that if Governor Ralph Northam refuses to resign, he should appoint State Senator Jennifer McClellan to replace Fairfax if he quits or is impeached. However, it is uncertain whether Northam could appoint any successor to Fairfax due to conflicting provisions and interpretations of the Virginia Constitution and state law.\n\nSenator McClellan, a longtime Richmond legislator with statewide ambitions and a close relationship with Senator Tim Kaine, is a black woman who is being considered as a potential replacement. When asked about McClellan, C. Richard Cranwell, a former state Democratic chairman and legislator, stated, \"Jennifer would make an exceptionally good lieutenant governor.\"\n\nAs the political landscape in Virginia continues to evolve, the focus on black women as a key constituency and potential political leader underscores the growing political power of these demographics within the Democratic party. The developments in Virginia serve as a reminder of the importance of representation and the role it plays in shaping the political discourse and decision-making processes.",
    " Title: House of Representatives Passes Bill to Protect State Medical Marijuana Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted early Friday to prevent the federal government from interfering with medical marijuana laws passed by 32 states and the District of Columbia. The bill, which received 218 yes votes, including 49 from actual Republicans, aims to protect state-level medical marijuana programs from federal intervention.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a former aide to President Ronald Reagan, was among the leading advocates for the bill. Rohrabacher, who acknowledged that times have changed, argued that strict federal policies regarding medical marijuana were causing more harm than good.\n\n\"Some people are suffering, and if a doctor feels that he needs to prescribe something to alleviate that suffering, it is immoral for this government to get in the way,\" Rohrabacher said. \"The state governments have recognized that a doctor has a right to treat his patient any way he sees fit, and so did our Founding Fathers.\"\n\nHowever, not all Republicans supported the bill. Virginia's Frank Wolf, who chairs the House committee that wrote the $50 billion appropriations bill on which the marijuana language was tacked, questioned the legitimacy of medical marijuana. Wolf pointed out that several medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, American Cancer Society, and the American Glaucoma Society, among others, opposed medicinal marijuana.\n\nTwo doctors who are also members of Congress, Louisiana Republican Rep. John Fleming and Maryland GOP Rep. Andy Harris, expressed concerns about the potential negative effects of marijuana on brain development and the imprecise nature of marijuana prescriptions.\n\nIn response, Georgia Republican Rep. Paul Broun presented a counterargument, stating that the components in marijuana are useful for some conditions and are less dangerous than some narcotics prescribed by doctors.\n\nThe vote result surprised even those who had been lobbying for the bill for over a decade. Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, noted that the proposal had received the most votes previously in the House (165 in 2007).\n\n\"We expected that we'd get close to passing it, and then pass it next year,\" Tvert said. \"But clearly things are moving forward very quickly at the federal level just as they are at the state level. People are fed up with the current state of marijuana laws.\"\n\nAlthough the bill has only cleared the House, Rohrabacher and his Democratic co-sponsors admitted that they did not have Senate supporters lined up yet to move the language in that chamber. Democratic Rep. Jared Polis, whose state of Colorado allows non-medicinal marijuana, emphasized that the will of the House is important on this issue.\n\n\"Congress is far from leading the country in this regard. Rather, we're catching up with where the country already is,\" Polis said.",
    " Title: Analysis: Democratic Presidential Candidates, Trump's Approval Ratings, and the 2020 Election Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2020 presidential election landscape is taking shape, with the Democratic candidates receiving encouragement from recent polling, while maintaining criticism towards President Joe Biden and offering thoughts on the speeches of contender Pete Buttigieg.\n\nThe polling data shows a challenging picture for President Donald Trump, with his approval rating significantly lower than in the key states he won in 2016, such as Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa. However, it is important to note that a lot can change between now and the November 2021 election, and it is true that state-level polls underestimated Trump's support in 2016.\n\nThe head-to-head polling does not provide a clear picture of events 18 months in the future, but it does suggest that there is no counterintuitive process whereby Trump secures the votes of people who say he is doing a bad job as president. The public is expressing a desire to vote for any Democrat, and the strongest pattern so far indicates that better-known Democrats perform better than more obscure ones.\n\nRather than being complacent or paralyzed by fear, Democrats should take a modest amount of reassurance from Trump's bad polls and focus on other issues. The real question is whether voters will continue to support Biden as it becomes clearer that his promise of bipartisanship may mean that the rich will continue to come first.\n\nThe issue of bipartisanship has been a topic of discussion, with some arguing that Biden is wrong to imply that Republicans in Congress will negotiate in good faith if Trump is no longer in office. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has stated that he will continue to be the 'grim reaper' and block any legislation from a Democratic president, while promising to further pack the Supreme Court if a vacancy arises during an election year.\n\nBiden and other Democratic candidates should run against McConnell and the Trump Republicans in Washington, according to some. The Democratic Party's donor class is also a factor in the election, with many putting their faith in Biden due to his promise of bipartisanship.\n\nRegarding Buttigieg's speech, some argue that he is an heir to Obama's cautious and intellectual worldview, but with a focus on values rather than realism. Buttigieg is a liberal internationalist who is looking beyond interventions to challenges posed by great powers, bridging the gap between the Obama and Clinton wings of his party. However, others contend that Buttigieg still has work to do to articulate his vision and policies effectively.\n\nIn summary, the 2020 election landscape is taking shape, with the Democratic candidates receiving encouragement from recent polling, while maintaining criticism towards President Trump and offering thoughts on Buttigieg's speech. The issue of bipartisanship and the role of the Democratic donor class is a topic of discussion, with some arguing that Biden's promise of bipartisanship may mean that the rich will continue to come first. Buttigieg's focus on values and liberal internationalism is also a point of contention, with some arguing that he still has work to do to articulate his vision and policies effectively.",
    " Title: \"Caution Advised: Polling Challenges from 2016 Election Persist in 2020, Experts Warn\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape, polls serve as a beacon for reporters, providing insights into the shifting tides of public sentiment. However, this year, these numbers have garnered less attention from me, given the unpredictable nature of the 2020 election due to the coronavirus, economic downturn, and racial unrest. Yet, several recent headlines have piqued my interest.\n\nOne such headline, published in Politico, declared, \"We're thinking landslide.\" This article, based on interviews with over 50 Republican officials from across the country, looks beyond the current political climate and sees an improving economy, a waning pandemic, and a diminishing impact of unreliable polls on President Donald Trump's re-election prospects.\n\nA North Carolina Republican official was quoted as saying, \"We're calling him 'Teflon Trump.' Nothing's going to stick, because if anything, it's getting more exciting than it was in 2016.\"\n\nThe Washington Examiner corroborated this sentiment with comments from veteran GOP pollster Neil Newhouse. He stated, \"I'm still convinced there is a shy Trump supporter, a hidden Trump vote. I'm convinced that number is at least 2 to 3 points.\"\n\nThe \"shy Trump supporter\" phenomenon may have contributed to the inaccurate polling of the 2016 election. National polls had shown Hillary Clinton winning the popular vote by 3 percentage points; she won by 2 points. However, election-eve polls in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan failed to predict Trump's victories in those states, ultimately deciding the election in his favor in the Electoral College.\n\nThe Trump campaign has seized upon the \"shy voter\" theme, leading to another headline in Politico: \"Trump has a point about the polls.\" The point is that pollsters, particularly in battleground states, are still grappling with the same issues they faced in 2016 - not just shy voters, but also potentially inadequate consideration of non-college-educated white voters.\n\nCourtney Kennedy, director of research at the Pew Research Center and the lead author of a report on 2016 polling flaws, told Politico, \"Some of the fundamental, structural challenges that came to a head in 2016 are still in place in 2020.\"\n\nThis warning is significant for both campaigns and voters. If pollsters do not rectify these issues, both parties must proceed as if the polling might be off. In other words, when it comes to polls, caveat emptor - buyer beware.",
    " Title: Romney Shifts Strategy, Emphasizing Policy Prescriptions and Broader Issues in Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, is altering his campaign strategy, with a new focus on \"status quo versus change\" as the central theme. This shift, as announced by chief strategist Stuart Stevens, will see Romney's campaign move away from the narrow economic focus that has been the cornerstone of his strategy since his 2008 primary campaign.\n\nThe change comes as polls show President Barack Obama gaining ground in crucial swing states, particularly Ohio. Romney's advisers concluded that a course correction was necessary to counter this trend. Stevens emphasized that the economy will remain the dominant focus, but the campaign will now address a broader range of issues, including foreign policy, the threat from China, debt, and the tone in Washington.\n\nOn Monday, Romney unveiled a new ad, \"The Romney Plan,\" which counters Obama's emphasis on economic growth for the middle class and outlines Romney's policy proposals. In the ad, Romney states, \"My plan is to help the middle class. Trade has to work for America. That means cracking down on cheaters like China. It means opening up new markets.\"\n\nA second ad, \"Failing American Families,\" released on the same day, is more critical, with a male narrator stating, \"Barack Obama: More spending. More debt. Failing American families.\"\n\nThe new ads mark a departure from Romney's previous series of ads, \"A Better Future,\" which focused on state-specific statistics and Romney's plans to improve each state's economy. Some Romney officials had advocated for a more negative approach to move the numbers as needed.\n\nRomney is also expected to emphasize policy solutions when he speaks to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Los Angeles on Monday. He plans to address the Hispanic vote, a demographic that has been largely supportive of Obama, by proposing improvements to \"legal immigration.\"\n\nRomney's prepared remarks for the speech include, \"I will work with Republicans and Democrats to permanently fix our immigration system. I believe we can all agree that what we need are fair and enforceable immigration laws that will stem the flow of illegal immigration, while strengthening legal immigration.\"\n\nStevens suggested that Romney's campaign is performing better than many pundits recognize, and that the Middle East unrest and economic uncertainty will help Romney regain momentum and alleviate concerns among GOP insiders.",
    " Title: Charles Kupperman Declines to Testify in Trump Impeachment Inquiry, Seeks Court Ruling on Compliance with House Subpoena\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, Charles Kupperman, former White House official and top aide to John Bolton, failed to appear for a scheduled meeting with House investigators on Monday. Kupperman, who was the deputy national security adviser, filed a lawsuit on Friday seeking a court ruling on whether he should comply with the House subpoena to testify or comply with a White House order to stay away.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee, led by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), had been expected to press Kupperman to corroborate key elements of a top U.S. diplomat's account that Trump built a shadow foreign policy team around his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate a political rival, and that Trump held up U.S. military aid for Ukraine as leverage.\n\nIn a statement, Schiff rejected Kupperman's move as a ploy to delay his appearance and stated that the House Democrats do not intend to wait for the court ruling and are prepared to move ahead with their impeachment inquiry. \"The lawsuit that Dr. Kupperman filed in district court has no basis in law... we expect the court will make short shrift of that argument,\" Schiff told reporters.\n\nOther members of Congress, including Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), left open the possibility that Kupperman could appear at some point, but offered no timeline for when the court process might be resolved.\n\nKupperman's lawyer, Charles Cooper, stated in a statement on Friday that his client \"takes no position on whether the command of the Legislative Branch or the command of the Executive Branch should prevail; he seeks only to carry out whichever constitutional obligation the Judicial Branch determines to be lawful and binding on him.\"\n\nHouse investigators called the lawsuit a stall tactic and accused Kupperman of working with the White House to stonewall Congress. They sent him a letter on Saturday stating that their subpoena \"remains in full force\" and that Kupperman is legally obligated to appear on Monday.\n\nKupperman's lawyer said the White House had no advance notice of the lawsuit and stated that it was not discussed or coordinated with anyone from the White House. \"We believe the arguments of both Branches are substantial and offered in good faith,\" Cooper wrote, stating that it would not be appropriate for Kupperman to resolve what he called a \"momentous Constitutional dispute.\"\n\nNicholas Rostow, who served as legal adviser to the National Security Council in George W. Bush's White House, stated that he expected the congressional subpoena to take precedence over the White House claim, but cautioned that the court may take a different view. \"The court may say this is an odd duck because the House has not voted on whether this is an official impeachment inquiry, so executive privilege might still apply,\" Rostow said.\n\nPeople who know Kupperman describe him as a conservative, honest, and straightforward individual. Dennis Ross, a former ambassador and top adviser to Republicans and Democrats on Middle East policy, compared Kupperman to Sgt. Joe Friday from the television series Dragnet, a character known for sticking to the facts. \"Charlie has always been very conservative but also honest and a straight shooter,\" Ross said. \"He has strong views like Bolton about Russia and Putin. Neither he nor Bolton would have turned a blind eye to what they saw as fundamentally inappropriate and wrong behavior.\"\n\nKupperman has expressed some controversial hard-line views in his past work, including with Frank Gaffney, the founder of the Center for Security Policy, who has advocated curtailing immigration and has repeatedly denounced Muslims. However, a former Bush administration official stated that Kupperman was also known to be \"quietly instrumental\" in helping to strengthen and build National Security Council staff during his time in Trump's White House.\n\nKupperman started at the National Security Council two months after Bolton's first deputy, Mira Ricardel, was pushed out of her post following an argument with first lady Melania Trump's office. Despite their political differences, Ross said he never knew Kupperman to be anything but straightforward. \"It'll be the real facts,\" Ross said. \"It won't be something else. It won't be alternative facts.\"",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader and President Obama Face Off Against Republican Senator Ted Cruz Over Obamacare Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas accused Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of adopting a non-negotiable stance on the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Cruz, who has been leading the charge to defund Obamacare, claimed that a potential government shutdown over the issue would be the fault of Reid and President Barack Obama, who have stated they will not negotiate on the matter.\n\nCruz argued that Reid's position is one of unyielding resistance, stating, \"His position is 100 percent of Obamacare must be funded in all instances, and other than that he's going to shut the government down.\"\n\nEarly Sunday morning, the House passed a compromise bill, which Cruz described as a delay in the implementation of Obamacare for a year, rather than a complete defunding. Cruz emphasized that while he believes Obamacare should be repealed, his current focus is on defunding it. The House's most recent vote, he said, represents a compromise, as it only delays the implementation rather than outright defunding.\n\nWhen host David Gregory questioned Cruz's ability to sway the Senate toward his position, given the lack of public protest against the Affordable Care Act, Cruz countered by stating, \"The only people who are not listening to the argument are the career politicians in Washington.\"\n\nSome of Cruz's fellow Republicans have expressed concern that a government shutdown could harm the party. However, Cruz compared his actions to those of former Senator Phil Gramm (R-Texas), who in 1993 opposed the Clinton healthcare initiative and successfully persuaded other Republicans to resist the passage of what Cruz called \"Hillarycare Lite.\"\n\nAs the countdown to the implementation of Obamacare continues, Cruz's efforts to defund or delay the law remain a contentious issue in Washington.",
    " Title: Democrats Show Flexibility on Revenue Targets in Fiscal Cliff Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing negotiations to avoid the fiscal cliff, incoming House Democratic Caucus chair Xavier Becerra has indicated a willingness to negotiate on the revenue target, signaling a shift in the Democrats' stance on the issue. The Democrats, who have been advocating for raising tax rates on high-income earners and opposing entitlement changes, are showing signs of flexibility regarding the government's revenue collection.\n\nHowever, several Democratic lawmakers have stated that they are not necessarily committed to the multitrillion-dollar revenue target President Barack Obama is proposing, as long as they secure tax rate increases for the wealthy and prevent significant revisions to Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Xavier Becerra, the incoming Democratic Caucus chairman, told media outlet \u2588\u2588\u2588 that a balanced approach could result in almost any revenue number. \"So long as you come out with a balanced approach, you could come up with almost any number,\" Becerra said.\n\nThe year-end tax debate has primarily focused on the extent to which Republicans are willing to accept tax increases. House Democrats, who have been sidelined in the talks between House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Obama, could play a crucial role if a year-end budget package is negotiated. With the Republicans likely to face defections, Democrats in the House will likely be called upon to move the package through to completion.\n\nMost Democrats are unlikely to oppose the White House, but the administration is already softening its stance on the revenue it seeks to generate through a fiscal cliff deal. After initially requesting $1.6 trillion in revenue, the administration presented Republicans with a proposal this week that reduced the request to $1.4 trillion.\n\nMost Democrats are aiming for a deal that closely mirrors Obama's opening bid and reject the $800 billion in revenue offered by Republicans as insufficient. If lawmakers were to pursue a middle ground between the Republican and Democratic offers, they would find themselves in the vicinity of $1.2 trillion. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) stated that this revenue goal is acceptable to her.\n\nRep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ), a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means panel, also suggested a deal could be reached at $1.2 trillion, but not at a lower amount. \"The president could come down to $1.2 trillion,\" Pascrell said. \"I don't think he'll go any lower if he did.\"\n\nOther Democrats have expressed a willingness to negotiate further. In the Senate, Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-MT) has discussed a deal that raises $1 trillion in revenue. Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-CA), who will join the Ways and Means Committee next year, stated, \"There is a lot of middle ground between $1.6 trillion and $800 billion.\"\n\nAnother incoming Ways and Means Democrat, Pennsylvania's Allyson Schwartz, said, \"Nothing is set in stone.\" This flexibility in revenue targets indicates a potential path forward for the fiscal cliff negotiations, as both parties seek a compromise to avoid the impending tax increases and spending cuts.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Hopefuls Distance Themselves from Obama's Policies Amidst 2020 Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Detroit, the Democratic presidential candidates are distancing themselves from former President Barack Obama's policies, despite the ongoing admiration among voters for the former president. The candidates argue that Obama's administration was a failure on immigration, healthcare, and trade.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, who once referred to Obama as his \"brother from another mother,\" criticized Obamacare, the trade deal negotiated during the Obama administration, and the high number of deportations during Obama's tenure. When asked if he would continue the Obama administration's deportation policies, Biden said, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nSenators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey also took aim at Obama's legacy, criticizing the Affordable Care Act and the former president's immigration policies, respectively. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio criticized the Obama Justice Department's handling of the 2014 killing of Eric Garner.\n\nIn response, Biden defended Obama's immigration record, citing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) deportation amnesty granted to illegal immigrant \"Dreamers.\" He argued that the number of deportations was not a fair measure of the administration's accomplishments.\n\nDemocratic strategist Zach Friend, who worked on Obama's 2008 campaign, stated that it was a mistake to criticize Obama's legacy, as his popularity among Democrats has been as high as 97% in recent polls. Friend argued that the focus should be on President Trump's current policies rather than on criticizing Obama's legacy.\n\nThe Rev. Wendell Anthony, president of the Detroit NAACP, agreed, stating that the focus should be on Trump \"because his record is destroying the nation and who we are.\"\n\nDespite the criticism, the continuing appeal of Obama was evident during the Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez's opening remarks at the debate, where he asked, \"Am I the only one who misses Barack Obama in this room?\" The crowd responded with a roar of applause.\n\nCriticizing Obama's time in the White House is a risky move for any of the 2020 hopefuls, as they risk alienating the party's voters who romanticize the not-so-long-ago days of the Obama administration. The move is particularly treacherous for Biden, who is running as Obama's political heir with the promise of restoring the normalcy of the Obama era.\n\nObama voters were irked by the attacks on the former president's policies at the debates. Francois Demonique, a professional chauffeur in Detroit, said he \"felt bad\" seeing Obama's legacy dragged through the mud. Demonique, who moved to the U.S. from Liberia more than 30 years ago and got his U.S. citizenship to vote for Obama, was especially distraught that Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts want to replace Obamacare with \"Medicare for All\" government-run health care.\n\nIowa-based Democratic strategist Jeff Link stated that it is smart for Biden to keep Obama close because the good in the eyes of primary voters far outweighs the bad. Link argued that Biden's words against the former president may have been \"in the heat of the moment\" of the debate and noted that he tried to repair any damage afterward.\n\nThe Democratic Party has moved dramatically to the left since Obama was in office. Some of the strongest challengers to Biden, who remains the front-runner, are far-left champions Senators Sanders and Warren. Another powerful contender, Senator Harris, is more moderate but also is embracing parts of the far-left agenda, including a variation of Medicare for All.\n\nDarrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, stated that it was an effective strategy for Biden to tap into Obama's popularity with the party's voters. However, West noted that it will be challenging for Biden to defend Obama's record on deportation and trade, as the party has moved well to the left on those issues, and no one is going to accept those policies as the right ones at the current time.",
    " Title: The Controversial Protest: An Examination of Colin Kaepernick's Actions and Their Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the world of professional sports, controversy often follows those who dare to challenge the status quo. Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49er quarterback, has found himself at the center of such a storm, with his decision to not stand during the national anthem causing a significant stir in the sports community and beyond.\n\nKaepernick's actions, he claims, are a form of protest against the treatment of black people and people of color in America. He stated, \"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way.\"\n\nThis decision has been met with a mix of support and criticism. While some applaud Kaepernick for using his platform to bring attention to social issues, others view his actions as disrespectful to the flag and the anthem. The anthem, originally an English drinking song called \"To Anacreon in Heaven,\" has been the national anthem of the United States since 1931, beating out other contenders such as \"America, the Beautiful\" and \"Dixie.\"\n\nThe controversy has led to a surge in sales of Kaepernick's jersey, with fans burning the jersey as a form of protest. This, in turn, has generated revenue for Kaepernick, as he receives a cut of the proceeds from jersey sales.\n\nThe internet has been ablaze with reactions to Kaepernick's actions, with a range of opinions expressed. Some fans have taken pride in the unique American right of freedom of speech and expression that Kaepernick is exercising, while others have criticized his methods and the message he is conveying.\n\nKaepernick's actions have sparked a larger conversation about social issues in America, with some viewing him as a hero for using his platform to bring attention to these issues, while others view him as a distraction from the game of football. Regardless of one's perspective, it is clear that Kaepernick's actions have made a significant impact, both on and off the field.\n\nAs Kaepernick continues to sit during the national anthem, it remains to be seen how long this controversy will continue and what impact it will have on his career and the broader conversation about social issues in America. One thing is certain, however: Kaepernick's actions have undeniably made a mark on the sports world and beyond.",
    " Title: First Lady Michelle Obama Urges Maximum Contributions for Democratic Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to bolster Democratic chances in the upcoming midterm elections, First Lady Michelle Obama made a fundraising appeal in Chicago on Thursday. The event, held in her hometown, was part of a series of fundraising events the Obama administration has been organizing in recent weeks.\n\nAddressing a crowd of donors, Michelle Obama urged them to contribute the maximum allowable amount. \"Write the biggest, fattest check that you can possibly write,\" she said. \"Writing those checks is the single-most impactful thing that you can do right now.\"\n\nThe President, who concluded a three-day fundraising swing on the West Coast earlier, has been actively participating in these events to raise funds for the committees responsible for electing Democrats to office. The Democrats' prospects of capturing the House seem slim, and the Republicans are aiming to secure the six Senate seats they need to take control of the Senate.\n\nDespite President Obama's approval ratings reaching record lows, he remains a draw at high-dollar fundraisers. In the past month alone, he has attended events in New York, Texas, Colorado, Washington state, and California. His recent journey west included stops in Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.\n\nIn addition to the official Democratic committees, Obama has also appeared at several events for two Democratic super PACs, despite his past opposition to outside groups with unlimited fundraising potential. These events, while not officially labeled as fundraisers, are understood to attract high-dollar donors who contribute generously before leaving.\n\nMichelle Obama, in her fundraising pitch, acknowledged the issue of money in politics but emphasized the need for Democrats to match the Republicans' fundraising efforts. \"We can't just stake out the moral high ground and feel good about ourselves - we need to act,\" she said.\n\nDuring her remarks, Michelle Obama expressed her continued belief in her husband's ability to bring about positive change, a sentiment that seemed to counter Vice President Joe Biden's recent remarks suggesting that some of the campaign promises made in 2008, such as hope and change, have not yet materialized.\n\n\"When folks ask me whether I still believe everything we said about hope and change back in 2008, I tell them that I believe it more strongly than ever before,\" she said. \"While we still have plenty of work to do, we have truly made so much of that change we've been talking about.\"",

James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wisconsin), one of the principal authors of the Patriot Act.\n\nSensenbrenner, who stated that his legislation was never intended to create a program that allows the government to demand the phone records of every American, joined Amash in urging Congress to halt the program. \"The time has come to stop it,\" Sensenbrenner declared.\n\nOpposing this move, however, were not only President Barack Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, but also top figures from the defense and intelligence community. On Tuesday, the NSA's director, General Keith Alexander, provided classified briefings to lawmakers regarding the program, and the White House issued a statement urging lawmakers to reject the measure.\n\nOn Wednesday, James L. Jones, the retired Marine Corps general who served as Mr. Obama's national security adviser from 2009-10, added his name to an open letter in support of preserving the NSA's programs. The letter, signed by more than half a dozen top national-security officials from the Bush administration, stated that denying the NSA such access to data would leave the nation at risk.\n\nRepresentative Mike Rogers (R-Michigan), a vocal supporter of the program, took a personal swipe at Amash, a popular figure on social media, stating that the House was not in the business of garnering \"likes\" on Facebook. Rogers argued that the calling log program was an essential tool for preventing terrorist attacks.\n\n\"This is not a game,\" Rogers asserted, \"This is real. It will have real consequences.\"\n\nDespite such appeals, many rank-and-file Republicans and Democrats appeared unfazed. Representative Jared Polis (D-Colorado), a supporter of the amendment, argued that if the Obama administration felt strongly about defending the program, President Obama would have spoken out personally. Instead, the White House released a statement under the name of the press secretary, Jay Carney.\n\n\"The press secretary says hundreds of things every day,\" Polis said.\n\nThe divisions within Congress seemed to mirror the ambivalence in the nation. In a CBS News poll released Wednesday, 67 percent of Americans considered the government's collection of phone records a violation of privacy. At the same time, 52 percent viewed it as a necessary tool to help find terrorists.",
    " Title: Clinton's Personal Fundraising for Super PAC Sparks Controversy Among Progressive Critics\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton's decision to personally raise funds for a super PAC supporting her presidential campaign has stirred controversy among her progressive critics, who view the move as a contradiction to her populist rhetoric and a demonstration of her alleged disconnect with middle-class voters.\n\nThe former Secretary of State's involvement with Priorities USA, a super PAC that supports her campaign, has highlighted the contrast between her and her only declared rival, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. While Clinton has pledged to get big money out of politics, her personal fundraising for a super PAC is seen as a departure from her campaign's initial stance.\n\nClinton's campaign has explained the decision as a matter of political necessity, citing the need for resources to counter the significant financial backing of Republican candidates and the Koch Brothers' $1 billion pledge for the 2016 campaign. However, the move has invited criticism from progressive activists who view it as a symptom of a larger disconnect between Clinton and middle-class voters.\n\nSenator Sanders, an independent who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, has been a vocal opponent of super PAC donations. He has no national fundraising operation and has little to lose by going after millionaire and billionaire donors. Last week, Sanders told CNN that Clinton's decision to personally court super PAC donors was \"unfortunate.\"\n\nPhil Noble, a South Carolina Democratic activist and supporter of former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, a potential Democratic candidate for president, said the development underscores what progressives view as a \"fundamental disconnect\" between Clinton and middle-class voters.\n\n\"It's not that she raises a bunch of money for a PAC that causes her problems with middle-class voters. That is a symptom as opposed to the ailment,\" Noble said. \"The larger illness is she is out of touch with middle-class voters -- she does have a lifestyle and a history that is about as alien to middle-class voters as corporate jets are to a Subaru.\"\n\nActivists pushing Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren to challenge Clinton see campaign finance reform as a major issue. \"Being a true champion for working families like Elizabeth Warren is about clearly and unequivocally supporting such critical priorities as a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United,\" said Erica Sagrans, campaign manager for Ready for Warren, a movement dedicated to drafting Sen. Elizabeth Warren into the 2016 race.\n\nThe Democratic Party's evolving relationship with super PACs has been a topic of debate for years. While Democrats initially opposed Citizens United, they have increasingly embraced super PACs over the years, despite their rhetoric against such political entities. In 2012, President Barack Obama reversed course, declaring after years of keeping his distance from super PACs that his campaign would participate in raising money for Priorities USA.\n\nClinton's personal involvement with Priorities USA marks the latest chapter in the Democratic Party's evolving relationship with super PACs. Clinton's allies also see that her fundraising prowess and the depth of her connections with the kinds of donors who can cut multi-million dollar checks will likely make her a formidable competitor against any Republican candidate she may face in the general election. Officials are careful to emphasize, however, that Clinton and everyone else involved with her campaign will strictly follow the law as they solicit funds for Priorities USA.\n\nThe 2016 money race is well underway on the other side of the political aisle. Declared GOP candidates including Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as expected candidates like former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, are on a fundraising tear. They've shown no signs of distancing themselves from super PAC money. The stiff competition against Republican money is a reality that some progressive leaders say they can't ignore.\n\nFormer Vermont Governor and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said it would be unwise for Clinton to reject super PAC money. \"Unfortunately, if you don't play by the same rules everybody else does, you end up losing elections,\" said Dean, founder of Democracy for America, one of the groups behind the draft Warren movement. \"The key is to change the rules, and I think we have a much better chance of doing that with her as president than we do with one of the Republicans.\"",
    " Title: Mueller's Office Disputes BuzzFeed Report on Trump-Cohen Allegations, but Stop Short of Denying Overall Claim\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a rare public statement, special counsel Robert Mueller's office on Friday disputed a blockbuster report from BuzzFeed News that alleged President Donald Trump directed his former attorney, Michael Cohen, to lie in his testimony before Congress.\n\nDespite worldwide coverage and intense interest, Mueller's office has stayed mostly quiet on reports regarding the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. But on Friday, Mueller's office took the rare step of calling BuzzFeed's story \"not accurate.\"\n\n\"BuzzFeed\u2019s description of specific statements to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u2019s Congressional testimony are not accurate,\" said Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller's office.\n\nThe BuzzFeed report alleged that Trump instructed Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Organization\u2019s pursuit of a deal to build a luxury residential high-rise in the center of Moscow, hoping to conceal these actions during his presidential bid.\n\nThe story also asserted that Mueller's office knew of the president's alleged actions after obtaining information through internal emails, text messages, and multiple interviews.\n\nThe report revived discussions about the possibility of impeaching Trump and emboldened House Democrats who vowed to investigate the allegations.\n\nWhile Mueller's office disputed how BuzzFeed characterized statements, documents, and testimony in its story, the statement did not include specifics or a sweeping denial of the story's overall theme: that the president directed Cohen to lie to Congress.\n\nBuzzFeed responded Friday, saying the news organization remained \"confident in the accuracy of our report.\"\n\n\"We are continuing to report and determine what the special counsel is disputing,\" BuzzFeed said in a statement.\n\nThe news organization's Editor-In-Chief, Ben Smith, asked that Mueller's office be more clear as to what was inaccurate in the story.\n\n\"In response to the statement tonight from the Special Counsel's spokesman: We stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what he's disputing,\" Smith said on Twitter.\n\nNevertheless, the response from Mueller's office is sure to embolden the president and his supporters. Trump called news of the Mueller team statement a \"sad day for journalism\" but a \"great day\" for the country.\n\nWithin minutes of the statement being aired on cable news shows, the president started retweeting supporters who called BuzzFeed fake news and the story \"nonsense.\" Some of those he retweeted, including his campaign manager Brad Parscale, used this as a chance to attack other stories over the years about Trump and his Russian contacts as \"fake news.\"\n\nTrump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, also responded on Twitter by praising Mueller's office for disputing the report, attacking the press, and calling for an investigation into who leaked information to BuzzFeed for its story.\n\n\"I commend Bob Mueller\u2019s office for correcting the BuzzFeed false story that Pres. Trump encouraged Cohen to lie,\" Giuliani said. \"I ask the press to take heed that their hysterical desire to destroy this President has gone too far.\"\n\nEven before Mueller's team got involved, Trump, who frequently calls the media \"fake news,\" lashed out about the report and Cohen's credibility.\n\n\"Lying to reduce his jail time!\" the president wrote on Twitter.\n\nCohen, 52, is expected to begin a three-year prison sentence in March after pleading guilty to federal financial crimes, campaign finance violations, and lying to Congress, which was at the heart of the BuzzFeed story.\n\nCohen admitted he was not truthful when he told the Senate and House Intelligence Committees that all discussions about a Moscow development had ceased in January 2016, knowing that such efforts had continued through at least June \u2013 in the heat of the campaign and as Trump repeatedly denied any links to Russia.\n\nProsecutors have asserted in court documents filed late last year that the tower project \"likely required the assistance of the Russian government.\" And if completed, the company stood to gain hundreds of millions of dollars from Russian sources in licensing fees and other revenues.\n\nThe court documents did not address whether Cohen's false statements about the Moscow tower discussions were prompted by any other consideration than an attempt to personally shield the campaign from public association with Russia.",
    " Title: US Opposition Calls for Trump's Interpreter to Testify over Putin Summit Discussions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could potentially escalate the ongoing controversy surrounding President Donald Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, opposition politicians are urging the subpoenaing of Marina Gross, Trump's interpreter during the Helsinki meeting, to testify before the U.S. Congress.\n\nSenator Robert Menendez, the lead Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has called for Gross to appear before the committee, citing the need for transparency and clarity regarding the private discussions between the two leaders.\n\nThe summit, which took place on Monday in Helsinki, has been a subject of controversy, with President Trump having to correct his own words from the press conference. It is highly unusual for an interpreter to be questioned, especially given that the two leaders met privately for two hours with only their interpreters present.\n\nDemocrats argue that, as the only other American official present in the room, Gross can and should provide details of what the two presidents said to each other. Senator Menendez told MSNBC, \"We want the interpreter to come before the committee. We want to see the notes. We're going to have a massive effort to try to get to what happened.\"\n\nRepresentative Bill Pascrell stated that the \"concessions\" Mr. Trump had made in public to Mr. Putin meant \"Congress and the American public deserve to know the details of their private conversation.\" If Gross declined to appear before the committee, she should be subpoenaed, he wrote.\n\nInterpreters are typically meant to be all but invisible at summits, and Gross is a U.S. State Department employee with years of experience translating at the highest level, according to CNN.\n\nRepublican Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he would consider the calls to summon Gross but questioned the idea. \"They're not policy people,\" he told reporters. \"They are in some cases contract folks. In the future, would any notes even be allowed to be taken if you started doing this kind of thing?\"\n\nCorker also pointed out that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was in Helsinki with Mr. Trump, would be questioned by the committee next week.\n\nIn Russia, Konstantin Kosachev, head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of parliament, said the idea of questioning an interpreter set a dangerous precedent that threatened the \"whole idea of diplomacy.\" The Associated Press reports this statement.\n\nGamal Helal, an Arabic interpreter and senior adviser to four U.S. presidents and seven secretaries of state, told CNN he could not remember such a situation. \"It would be a horrible precedent if a president was not free to talk one-on-one with a head of state... If he [Mr. Trump] spoke in English, there would be no other way for Congress to know what he said, except to ask the president himself. Or Putin.\"\n\nWhile the summit was held behind closed doors, the two leaders gave a news conference afterwards at which Mr. Trump shocked many by defending Russia over the allegations of election interference. Contradicting his own intelligence agencies, he said there had been no reason for Russia to meddle in the vote.\n\nA day later, Mr. Trump came out to say he had \"misspoken\" and did actually accept U.S. intelligence agencies' findings that Russia had interfered. However, a new row developed when the U.S. leader appeared to disagree with U.S. intelligence over whether Russia was still targeting American elections.\n\nInvestigations into the alleged interference, denied by Russia, continue, and last week, the U.S. justice department charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking Democratic officials in 2016.",
    " Title: Democratic Representatives Boycott State of the Union Address Over President Trump's Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that marks a growing dissent among Democratic lawmakers, Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson announced on Sunday that she will boycott President Trump's State of the Union address, citing the President's recent controversial remarks about Haiti and African nations.\n\nWilson, who was elected in 2010 and made headlines last year for her public disagreement with Trump over his telephone call to the widow of a fallen soldier, stated in a late Sunday release that she will not attend the Jan. 30 speech.\n\n\"For the first time since I began serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, I will not be attending the president's State of the Union address,\" Wilson said. \"I have no doubts that instead of delivering a message of inclusivity and an agenda that benefits all Americans, President Trump's address will be full of innuendo, empty promises, and lies.\"\n\nWilson joins Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), John Lewis (D-Ga.), and Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) in boycotting the event.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, in an interview with MSNBC over the weekend, expressed her reasons for boycotting the event, stating, \"Why would I take my time to go and sit and listen to a liar? Someone who lies in the face of facts, someone who can change their tune day in and day out. What does he have to say that I would be interested in? I don't appreciate him, and I wouldn't waste my time sitting in that house listening to what he has to say. He does not deserve my attention.\"\n\nRep. John Lewis made his announcement on Friday, citing reports that Trump had referred to some African countries as \"s--tholes\" in a conversation with lawmakers about immigration.\n\n\"I can not in all good conscience be in a room with what he has said about so many Americans,\" Lewis said on MSNBC Friday. \"I just can not do it. I wouldn't be honest with myself.\"\n\nRep. Earl Blumenauer said he would be skipping the event before Trump's remarks became public, but said it would be a waste of time, and he was staying home.\n\n\"Rather than listening to another destructive, divisive speech by Trump, I will not attend this year's annual address to Congress,\" Blumenauer said in a statement. \"Instead, like I did during his inauguration, I'll be working at home listening to Oregonians about what they think about the State of the Union.\"\n\nIn response to the accusations of racism, President Trump addressed the issue on Sunday, stating, \"I'm not a racist. I am the least racist person you have ever interviewed. That I can tell you.\"\n\nThe State of the Union boycott isn't the only protest planned by Democrats. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) plans to wear black in order to stand in solidarity with victims of sexual harassment, while other House lawmakers say they are planning on inviting victims of sexual assault to attend the president's first State of the Union address.\n\n\"Some members will be bringing survivors of sexual assault and advocates as their guests,\" an aide to Florida Rep. Lois Frankel told NBC News.\n\nOther ideas that have since been nixed include holding mock trials with the women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct.\n\nIn 2016, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) skipped former President Barack Obama's last State of the Union address. That same year, three conservative Supreme Court judges -- Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Antonin Scalia -- were also a no-show.\n\nScalia, who died in 2016, had missed the State of the Union address more than a dozen times, and called the event \"a childish spectacle.\"",
    " Title: Florida Senate Rejects Assault Weapons Ban, Advances Bill to Arm Some Teachers Following Parkland Shooting\n\nIn a closely contested vote, the Florida Senate has rejected a proposal to ban assault weapons and advanced a bill that would allow some teachers to carry firearms in schools, following the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\nThe vote on Saturday saw the amendment that aimed to ban assault weapons attached to a wider bill fail in a largely party-line vote, with the final tally being 20-17 against the ban. Two Republicans joined all of the Senate's 15 Democrats in support of the proposal, according to the Miami Herald.\n\nThe full bill, known as the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, is expected to pass the state Senate on Monday and then move to the Florida House. The bill includes measures such as raising the minimum age to buy a rifle or a shotgun to 21 from 18, banning the use, sale, or possession of bump stocks, and providing $400 million in funding for schools to address mental health issues.\n\nFollowing the Senate's rejection of the assault weapon ban, Stoneman Douglas student Jaclyn Corin tweeted, \"This breaks my heart, but we will NOT let this ruin our movement. This is for the kids.\" Fellow classmate David Hogg, who has become one of the school's leading activists on gun safety, tweeted, \"Elections are going to be fun!\"\n\nAn amendment to remove a provision to train and arm some teachers also failed. The bill's passage through the Senate comes amidst criticism of the Broward County school system and sheriff's department for not acting on red flags regarding the mental health problems and potentially violent behavior of the accused 19-year-old shooter, Nikolas Cruz.\n\nThe bill's progression through the legislative process reflects the ongoing national debate on gun control and school safety in the aftermath of the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history. The bill's eventual passage and the outcome of the ensuing negotiations between the Senate and House will have significant implications for gun laws in Florida and potentially beyond.",
    " Title: Reflecting on the Political Landscape: The Role of Government and the Pursuit of a Content Life\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent election, it is evident that the political landscape has once again proven to be a significant force in shaping societal norms and expectations. The campaign trail, as always, has left many questioning the role of government in our lives and the impact of political promises on our daily lives.\n\nThe political process, with its constant promises of a utopian society, often overshadows the importance of family, community, and personal responsibility. The pursuit of happiness, as envisioned by our founding fathers, seems to have taken a backseat to the political enterprise that has come to dominate our affairs.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, for instance, made grand promises about singlehandedly improving the insurance system, yet failed to deliver on those promises. Similarly, the removal of Confederate battle flags was expected to bring about racial understanding, but the reality has been far more complex. The movement to enforce mutual consent for sexual relations at college parties is another example of political intervention that has raised more questions than answers.\n\nBoth major political parties seem to have a propensity for imposing their ideals upon society, with Democrats often resembling stern schoolmarms and Republicans encouraging centrally conceived, centrally managed projects. The current obsession with Title IX rules governing sex on college campuses is a testament to this trend, with political figures drawing up rules and regulations in an attempt to define personal conduct.\n\nThe question arises: Who are we, as a society, supposed to be? And how do we become the individuals we aspire to be? The answer, it seems, lies not in the hands of political regulators, but in the power of individual character and the discourse of civilized societies.\n\nThe role of a democratic society is not to dictate who we are, but to protect the inborn right to a life of freedom, virtue, and, ultimately, contentment. This right, once familiar to Americans, has become less so in recent years. It is time for us, as a society, to reclaim this right and to remember that the pursuit of a content life is not a political endeavor, but a personal one.",
    " Title: Kentucky's Affordable Care Act Enrollment: A Double-Edged Sword for Sen. Mitch McConnell in Senate Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the closely watched Senate race in Kentucky, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, who is statistically tied with his Democratic opponent, has been vocal in his criticism of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or \"Obamacare.\" However, the ACA may not be the campaign issue that Sen. McConnell hopes it will be.\n\nAccording to a survey by The New York Times/Kaiser Family Foundation, people in Kentucky disapprove of the ACA, but they also sense that it is broken yet helpful, particularly through the state-run exchange, \"kynect.\" More than 1 in 10 residents is now covered by kynect, and this year, more than 413,400 people were enrolled in kynect by mid-April.\n\nStephen Voss, an associate professor of political science at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, suggests that Obamacare as a political issue will likely be \"a wash\" for Sen. McConnell. Voters in Kentucky are open to the help that the ACA represents, specifically through kynect.\n\nIn the state, about 80 percent of kynect customers are covered by the Medicaid expansion, and the other 20 percent have chosen the exchange's private plans. In areas devastated by the recent collapse of the coal industry, such as Hazard, coverage for the poor is especially welcome.\n\nStephen Kelly, a young man who recently moved to Hazard, has a wife and two sons and a master's degree in Christian ministry. After signing up for Medicaid under kynect, he underwent a physical and lab tests, which he had not had \"in quite some time.\" This is the first time he has had health insurance.\n\nWhile the ACA is helping him and his family, Mr. Kelly has mixed feelings about the law. While it is helping those who need it, he notes that his father, who lives in Harlan, Ky., is seeing his insurance costs skyrocket.\n\nThe ambivalence of Kentuckians toward the ACA is reflected in the April poll by The New York Times/Kaiser Family Foundation. People don't like it, but they don't want to scrap it either. A majority \u2013 55 percent \u2013 disapprove of the health-care law. But a majority also say their representative in Congress should work to improve the law, not repeal it and replace it with something else.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. McConnell's Democratic opponent, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, who favors the keep-and-fix approach, has avoided talking about the health-care law. Her supporters call kynect \"Beshearcare,\" after the governor.\n\nState Sen. Robert Stivers (R) predicts that people will experience \"sticker shock\" when health insurance enrollment notices go out for the new year, just before the election. If that comes to pass, McConnell may well benefit from his anti-ACA message. However, until then, the new law \"loses its power as an issue\" because of the ambivalence about it, according to Professor Voss.",
    " Title: Biden's Marijuana Policy and Criminal Justice Record Under Scrutiny in 2020 Presidential Race\n\nIn a recent public appearance, a potential 2020 Democratic candidate expressed concerns about the growing market for marijuana sales in middle schools, highlighting the lack of ID checks and the potential dangers this poses to minors. This statement, made by a yet-to-be-named candidate, underscores the evolving landscape of marijuana policy within the Democratic party.\n\nThe candidate who may face the most scrutiny on this issue is former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who, during his tenure in the 1980s and 90s, was a key figure in the \"war on drugs.\" His policies, which included tough mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, contributed to an era of mass incarceration, with significant economic and social repercussions for minorities.\n\nJohn Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in state and federal marijuana policy, stated, \"In 1994 Biden had a fairly mainstream position, but in 2020 that position is so far from the mainstream of Democratic politics that it is almost offensive.\" Hudak further characterized Mr. Biden's history on criminal justice issues as his \"biggest liability in the 2020 primary.\"\n\nMr. Biden has acknowledged some aspects of his record, particularly a 1980s law that mandated harsher penalties for crack cocaine compared to powder cocaine, a disparity that disproportionately affected African-Americans. He has since referred to this law as \"a big mistake.\"\n\nSpokespersons for Mr. Biden, who has reportedly told aides he is 95 percent committed to entering the presidential race, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTwo Democratic senators, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who are opposed to federal marijuana legalization, represent battleground states in the Midwest, where politics tend to be less progressive than in coastal states that have led the way in legalizing cannabis for adult use. This dynamic could potentially influence the party's stance on marijuana policy in the upcoming election.",
    " Title: ASEAN Foreign Ministers Express Concern Over South China Sea Tensions, Seek Dialogue with China\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint statement issued at the conclusion of their annual retreat in Vientiane, Laos, the foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) expressed their \"serious concern\" over recent developments in the disputed South China Sea region. The ministers reaffirmed the importance of maintaining peace, security, and stability in the area, which is at the center of a territorial dispute involving China and several ASEAN countries, including Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia.\n\nTensions have escalated since China began a massive land reclamation program in 2013. Recent satellite imagery suggests that China has installed surface-to-air missiles in a disputed area in the Paracels chain, prompting accusations that Beijing is militarizing the area.\n\nThe joint statement noted the ministers' concerns over the land reclamations and escalation of activities in the South China Sea, stating that these activities have \"eroded trust and confidence, increased tensions, and may undermine peace, security, and stability in the region.\"\n\nVietnam's foreign minister, Pham Binh Minh, told reporters as he left the meeting that he was \"seriously concerned about the situation\" and called for the \"non-militarization\" of the South China Sea. Cambodia's foreign minister, Hor Namhong, said ASEAN would seek a meeting with China over the matter, though no date or venue had been set.\n\nOther matters were on the agenda as well. The ministers reiterated their perennial call for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. They also addressed Islamic extremism, in the wake of an attack in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta in January that left eight people dead.\n\n\"The threat is real. It's no longer fictitious or mere imagination,\" said Malaysia's foreign minister, Anifah Aman.\n\nOther topics included ways to bring about ever closer economic cooperation since the advent of the ASEAN Economic Community at the end of last year.",
    " Title: Rowan County Clerk's Absence Leads to Issuance of First Same-Sex Marriage License\n\nIn a historic and emotionally charged event at the Rowan County Courthouse in Kentucky, a same-sex couple, James Yates and William Smith, were granted a marriage license after five previous unsuccessful attempts. The couple, who braved protesters outside the courthouse, entered the clerk's office as the sun rose over the mountains.\n\nThe county clerk, Kim Davis, who had previously denied them a marriage license, was in jail due to contempt of court charges for defying the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage. In her absence, Deputy Clerk Brian Mason issued the license to Yates and Smith.\n\nThe couple, now the first same-sex pair to receive a marriage license from Rowan County, were greeted with chants of \"Love has won\" as they exited the courthouse. \"I don't want her in jail,\" Yates said, referring to Kim Davis. \"No one wanted her in jail. We just wanted the licenses given out.\"\n\nKim Davis' husband, Joe Davis, was also present outside the courthouse, leading a group of protesters who viewed this as a moral fight. \"We don't hate these people,\" he said. \"We don't hate nobody. We just want to have the same rights that they have.\"\n\nThe legality of the marriage licenses issued today is still uncertain, as they do not bear Kim Davis' signature. This event marks a significant step forward for civil rights in Rowan County, as the couple's victory underscores the fact that civil rights are not subject to personal beliefs.",
    " Title: Attorney General Jeff Sessions Responds to President Trump's Criticism in Unusual Rebuttal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unprecedented move, Attorney General Jeff Sessions responded to repeated criticisms from President Donald Trump by defending his tenure at the Department of Justice in a statement on Thursday. The statement comes days after Trump criticized Sessions in a Fox News interview, accusing him of failing to control the Justice Department.\n\nSessions' statement read:\n\n\"I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in, which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the President's agenda -- one that protects the safety and security and rights of the American people, reduces violent crime, enforces our immigration laws, promotes economic growth, and advances religious liberty.\"\n\nHe continued, \"While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations. I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action. However, no nation has a more talented, more dedicated group of law enforcement investigators and prosecutors than the United States. I am proud to serve with them and proud of the work we have done in successfully advancing the rule of law.\"\n\nThe statement appears to be a direct response to Trump's criticism of Sessions in a Fox News interview on Wednesday, where he said, \"I put in an attorney general that never took control of the Justice Department. Jeff Sessions never took control of the Justice Department and it's a sort of an incredible thing.\"\n\nTrump's criticism of Sessions was not limited to this statement. He also told Fox News host Ainsley Earhardt that \"even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself and then you would not have put him in.\" Trump added that the only reason he gave Sessions a job in his administration was because he was loyal. And, in perhaps the most cutting and personal attack, Trump said this of Sessions: \"He took the job and then he said, 'I'm going to recuse myself.' I said, 'What kind of a man is this?'\"\n\nSessions' statement marks a rare instance of him directly responding to a Trump attack. The only other time, according to reports, was back in February when Trump tweeted about the Inspector General's investigation into the FBI's handling of the Russia investigation. Sessions responded by saying he had \"initiated the appropriate process that will ensure complaints against this department will be fully and fairly acted upon if necessary.\"\n\nSessions' statement on Thursday seems to be a response to Trump's anger over the conviction of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the plea deal of former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen on Tuesday, which came as a result of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe. Trump has publicly expressed his belief that the investigation is illegal and that Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation is the root of his political problems. However, legal experts have consistently maintained that Sessions' decision to recuse himself was the right thing to do, given his role as a prominent surrogate for Trump during the 2016 campaign and his failure to disclose several interactions he had with Russians during the campaign.\n\nDespite Trump's repeated criticisms of Sessions, the President has not fired him, with his lawyer Rudy Giuliani stating in May that Trump has \"some grievances\" with Sessions but is not going to fire him before the Mueller investigation is over. However, with Sessions' latest statement, it seems that he is goading Trump to get rid of him.",
    " Title: President Obama Promotes Infrastructure Investment Plan to Boost U.S. Job Creation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to stimulate private sector investment in infrastructure and create jobs, President Barack Obama visited the port of Miami on Friday. Addressing a crowd, he emphasized the importance of rebuilding the nation's infrastructure to strengthen the economy.\n\n\"There are few more important things we can do to create jobs right now and strengthen our economy over the long haul than rebuilding the infrastructure that powers our businesses and our economy - our roads, our bridges, our schools, and our ports like this one,\" President Obama said.\n\nThe president's plan, named the \"Rebuild America Partnership,\" consists of three components: the creation of a $10 billion national infrastructure bank, the establishment of new \"America Fast Forward Bonds\" for infrastructure investment, and the expansion of funding for the TIGER and TIFFIA infrastructure programs.\n\n\"Let's rebuild this country we love. Let's make sure we're staying on the cutting edge. Let's make sure we've always got the best ports. Let's make sure we've got the best airports. Let's make sure we've got the best rail lines. Let's make sure we've got the best roads. Let's make sure we've got the best schools,\" he said. \"We're going to push on this issue each and every day and make sure we get the middle class going again.\"\n\nBefore delivering his speech, the president toured a tunnel project at the port of Miami, which is undergoing a $2 billion renovation funded by government and private money. \"Breaking ground on more projects like this tunnel that I just saw means more good construction jobs that can't be outsourced,\" Obama said. \"They have to be done right here in America, and they end up getting people good pay and good opportunities to raise their family.\"\n\nAlan Krueger, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, stated that the program will total $21 billion but assured that it would not increase the deficit. Details of the costs of the program will be outlined in the president's budget, which will be presented on April 10.\n\n\"They will not increase the deficit by a dime because they are paid for in our budget,\" Krueger told reporters aboard Air Force One Friday. The president's speech was delivered in front of a crane manufactured by a Chinese company called ZPMC.",
    " Title: Charlotte Police Claim 70% of Arrested Protesters Were Out-of-State Residents, Sparking Debate on Influence of George Soros\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, Todd Walther, spokesman for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Fraternal Order of Police, has claimed that 70% of the protesters arrested during the demonstrations had out-of-state identification cards. Walther stated that the unrest was not caused by local protestors, but rather by \"outside entities\" instigating the violence.\n\nAccording to a tweet by CNN's OutFront, Walther made these comments during an interview with Erin Burnett on CNN. The tweet, which can be found at <https://twitter.com/OutFrontCNN/status/777400580007309312>, states, \"Charlotte police: 70% of arrested protesters had out of state ID's, outside entities are causing these problems.\"\n\nThis statement has sparked debate and raised questions about the influence of outside groups on the protests. In 2014, during the Ferguson riots, liberal billionaire George Soros was accused of funding social justice organizations and turning local protests into national flashpoints.\n\nIn an article published by The Washington Times in 2014, it was reported that Soros donated $33 million to social justice organizations during the Ferguson protests. The article states, \"Still not buying it? As The New American recently reported, Ken Zimmerman, the director of U.S. programs at Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations (OSF), denied last year that Soros had funded BLM, saying it was just a rumor.\"\n\nHowever, it was later revealed that the OSF had given at least $650,000 directly to BLM, according to documents published by DCLeaks.com. The documents also revealed that the OSF's funding of BLM was intended to \"dismantle\" America and recast it according to the vision of Soros and his leftist cohorts.\n\nThe communist-on-its-face nature of the demands of organizations under the BLM umbrella, as well as the deep-pocketed funding by Soros, the Center for American Progress, the Ford Foundation, and Borealis Philanthropy, have led some to believe that BLM is a tool of social revolutionaries aiming to destroy America and build a dystopia in its place.\n\nWith Hillary Clinton's poll numbers declining and a debate looming, some are questioning whether the sudden appearance of \"out of state\" protesters in Charlotte was an attempt to shift the focus away from Clinton's email scandal and other controversies. George Soros, a major donor to the Democratic Party, has been mercurial in his political donations, contributing to both Clinton and Barack Obama in 2008, but not since.\n\nSoros, who founded the Quantum Fund in 1969 with $12 million, is now worth $24.7 billion and continues to invest through Soros Fund Management, a family firm. As a political donor, Soros has contributed $54 million to federal candidates and committees since 2003. The Open Society Policy Center, the advocacy arm of his philanthropic network, spent $8.2 million on lobbying Washington in 2015 and focuses on international human rights, immigration, foreign aid, public health, and criminal justice reform, among other issues.",
    " Title: U.S. Presidential Campaign Shifts Focus to Foreign Policy Amid Middle East Unrest\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a sudden change of pace, the U.S. presidential campaign has delved into a second day of intense foreign policy debate, with Republican nominee Mitt Romney continuing his criticism of President Barack Obama's approach to the recent attacks on U.S. diplomatic posts in Cairo and Benghazi, Libya.\n\nAt a rally in a northern Virginia suburb of Washington, Romney expressed his condolences to the families of the American diplomatic workers who perished in the Benghazi attack, including Chris Stevens, the American ambassador to Libya. However, he swiftly transitioned to a critical assessment of the United States' global position under Obama's administration.\n\n\"As we watch the world today, sometimes it seems that we're at the mercy of events instead of shaping events, and a strong America is essential to shape events,\" Romney said.\n\nMeanwhile, Obama, also campaigning on Thursday, did not address Romney's criticisms but issued a warning to the perpetrators of Tuesday's killings.\n\n\"I want all of you to know that we are going to bring those who killed our fellow Americans to justice,\" Obama said to applause at a campaign stop in Colorado. \"I want people around the world to hear me, to all those who would do us harm, no act of terror will go unpunished. It will not dim the light of the values that we proudly present to the rest of the world.\"\n\nThe aggressive stance from Obama contrasted with the image Romney began painting of the president late Tuesday, when his campaign issued a statement calling the Obama administration's response to the assault on the U.S. embassy in Cairo \"disgraceful.\" This statement was issued before news broke that America's ambassador to Libya had died in an attack on a consulate in Benghazi.\n\nOn Wednesday, Romney continued his approach, stating that Obama had \"demonstrated a lack of clarity as to a foreign policy.\"\n\n\"I think it is a terrible course for America to stand in apology for our values,\" Romney also said. \"That instead when our grounds are being attacked and being breached that the first response of the United States must be outrage at the breach of the sovereignty of our nation. And apology for America's values is never the right course.\"\n\nIn his remarks, Romney again accused the Obama administration of sympathizing with the instigators of the violence in Cairo, citing a statement released by the American embassy there stating it \"condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims.\"\n\nHowever, a timeline of events Tuesday suggests Romney was mistaken in this allegation, as the violence came after the first statement was published. A later tweet from the embassy, which was subsequently deleted, indicated the embassy was standing by their original statement and also condemning the protests.\n\nReaction to Romney's sharply negative tack has been mixed. Obama, along with other Democrats, pushed back, saying Romney was injecting politics during a time of still-developing international crisis. Like Romney, Obama did not mince words about his political opponent.\n\n\"Gov. Romney seems to have a tendency to shoot first and aim later,\" Obama said during an interview with CBS. \"As president, one of the things I've learned is you can't do that. It's important for you to make sure that the statements that you make are backed up by the facts and that you've thought through the ramifications before you make them.\"\n\nFormer Ambassador Nick Burns, who served in the administrations of former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said he was \"dismayed\" by Romney's choice to inject politics into what he said was a \"very difficult situation\" for the United States.\n\n\"I think it's time for Americans to stand together and I hope Gov. Romney would stand with the administration,\" Burns said, also on CNN.\n\nRepublicans have largely refrained from criticizing their party's nominee, at least publicly. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee and the ranking Republican member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, would not support or chastise Romney's stance on CNN Thursday morning, saying only that he agreed Obama's policy toward the Middle East was weak.\n\n\"Now the tick tock back and forth is something, frankly, I didn't pay attention to,\" McCain said on \"Starting Point.\"\n\n\"I do know this. Americans are outraged when our embassy is attacked and the Egyptian government does not take the proper measures to protect it,\" McCain continued. \"How much that affects our relationship with Egypt, I think, is something we have to carefully calibrate, recognizing how important a role Egypt is in the entire Middle East.\"\n\nOther conservative voices, including the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, also attempted to shield Romney from critics.\n\n\"As Tuesday's events showed, pandering to Islamists who would use the video to inflame anti-American sentiment is not going to stop the protests,\" read the editorial, which was published under the headline \"Romney Offends the Pundits.\"\n\n\"His political faux pas (sic) was to offend a pundit class that wants to cede the foreign policy debate to Mr. Obama without thinking seriously about the trouble for America that is building in the world,\" it continued.\n\nThis week's deviation to foreign policy comes after more than a year of a near-singular campaign focus on jobs and the economy. The topic re-entered the political discussion following the Republican National Convention at the end of August, when Democrats piled on Romney for not mentioning Afghanistan in his speech accepting the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nLater, during their own convention, Democrats highlighted support for American troops currently in war zones and the president's successful foreign policy actions, including the mission that killed Osama bin Laden. This particular thread was viewed by many as successfully positioning Obama ahead of Romney on an issue that Democrats have traditionally not seen as a strength.\n\nVoters consistently say in polls Obama would better handle America's relationships with other countries if re-elected. In the latest CNN/ORC International survey released earlier this week, Obama had a 54% - 42% advantage over Romney on foreign policy.",
    " Title: A Retrospective on Hillary Clinton's Controversial History of Honesty and Trustworthiness\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Hillary Clinton's health scare during a 9/11 commemoration ceremony, the Democratic presidential nominee's long-standing reputation for dishonesty and lack of trustworthiness has once again come under scrutiny.\n\nFrom her involvement in the White House Travel Office scandal during her husband's presidency to her claims about braving sniper fire in Bosnia and her secret email setup as secretary of state, Clinton has left a trail of questionable truths and false statements that date back over a quarter-century.\n\nThe Democratic nominee has often dismissed these accusations as right-wing hit jobs. However, her campaign's attempt to downplay her health issues and the subsequent fallout has brought these past controversies to the forefront.\n\nRepublican strategist Ed Rollins traces Clinton's problem with veracity back to her 1992 interview on \"60 Minutes,\" where she defended her husband, then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton, from accusations of a 12-year extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers.\n\nClinton's statement, \"I'm not sitting here some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette,\" has been a point of contention, with the truth of her words remaining uncertain. The interview, however, is credited with saving Clinton's campaign and launching a political legacy marked by scandal.\n\nAnother of Clinton's early brushes with truthfulness came during the White House Travel Office scandal in 1993, when she was accused of orchestrating the firings, which were believed to be intended to make room for hiring friends of the Clintons. The independent counsel investigating the scandal, known as Travelgate, found that Clinton's statements denying her involvement were \"factually inaccurate.\"\n\nSimilarly, FBI Director James B. Comey outlined numerous lies Clinton told the public about her secret email server as secretary of state, including misrepresentations about the number of devices she used, the classification of emails, and the extent of her email turnover to the State Department.\n\nClinton's mischaracterization of Comey's statements and her subsequent reversal of positions on various political issues have also raised questions about her honesty.\n\nSome of Clinton's breaks with the truth have seemed trivial, such as her claims about her grandparents being immigrants or her connection to Sir Edmund Hillary. However, more significant discrepancies, like her statements regarding the Benghazi attack and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, have raised concerns among voters.\n\nAs the 2016 presidential race continues, Clinton's history of questionable truthfulness and her campaign's handling of her health issues will likely remain a point of contention for both supporters and critics alike.",
    " Title: Rising Car Loan Delinquencies Pose Challenge for America's Working Poor\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heartland of America, a once-essential ingredient for employment - owning a car - has become increasingly costly for millions of low-wage earners, despite a prolonged economic growth and low unemployment. According to the New York Federal Reserve, more than 7 million Americans are already 90 or more days behind on their car loans, with serious delinquency rates among borrowers with the lowest credit scores seeing the fastest acceleration.\n\nThe roots of this problem can be traced back to the 2008 financial crisis, when automakers drastically reduced production in the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. A decade later, this has made used 10-year-old vehicles, typically more affordable for low-wage earners, a relative rarity.\n\nAccording to data provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 by industry consultant and car shopping website Edmunds, the average price of that vintage of vehicle is $8,657, still nearly 75% higher than in 2010 despite some softening in prices over the last year. In contrast, the average new car has seen a price rise of 25% in that same time period.\n\n\"This is pinching people at the worst point possible,\" said Ivan Drury, Edmunds' senior manager of industry analysis. \"If you need basic A to B transportation, you have to get an older car that needs more repairs and has more wear-and-tear issues.\"\n\nMonthly auto payments for Americans making under $40,000 have remained flat since 2017, while those in higher wage brackets have seen their payments rise, according to a Cox Automotive Inc analysis for \u2588\u2588\u2588. This might seem like good news, but to Cox chief economist Jonathan Smoke, it indicates poorer Americans are stretched so thin they can not afford to pay more.\n\nWeak lending standards in recent years are partly to blame for the rising delinquency rates, which Warren Kornfeld, a senior vice president on Moody's financial institutions team, said are approaching record highs despite a solid economy. Auto lenders are belatedly tightening lending standards, but it may already be too late, he said.\n\n\"The economy is masking the true performance of auto loans,\" Kornfeld said. \"If we hit a downturn today, the performance of auto loans would not look very good.\"\n\nResearch from the New York Fed earlier this year showed that while delinquency rates among borrowers with high credit scores have remained steady and low, for subprime borrowers they have been rising, pushing up the overall delinquency rate. Around 8% of loans originated by lower-score buyers with a credit score below 620 were categorized as seriously late, \"a development that is surprising during a strong economy and labor market,\" Fed researchers wrote.\n\nFor many Americans, a lack of a car means a lack of a job. Hollis Heyward, a 30-year-old father of two, makes $10 an hour working at a warehouse in Freeport, a rural town of 25,000 about 115 miles (185.07 km) northwest of Chicago. In the midst of a divorce, all he could afford was a gray 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix with close to 200,000 miles on it, which he bought for $1,300 cash - a fraction of the average new car price.\n\nSuddenly also stuck paying off the loan on his future ex-wife's car, Heyward had to rework the loan with local used-car dealer Gordy Tormohlen of Good People Automotive. Under his \"workout\" deal, Heyward is paying the loan's principal only, and Tormohlen has waived the interest payments. Heyward's monthly payment is now around $120 per month, down from around $350 before the workout.\n\n\"Right now, it's hard to make ends meet,\" said Heyward. \"But I am not the kind of guy to walk away from my commitments.\"\n\nTormohlen, 59, a second-generation dealer, said his business is up 10% this year as auto finance companies tighten lending standards. He said the market feels like it did before the financial crisis hit in 2008, when consumers were over-extended with debt.\n\n\"Americans have grown too comfortable with debt, and the time has come to pay the piper,\" he said.\n\nTormohlen is a \"Buy Here, Pay Here\" dealer, offering subprime loans that he finances himself at 19%, which is higher than a bank but lower than many finance companies. He said he can work directly with struggling customers like Heyward, whom he has known for a decade, but worries that large finance companies with tens or hundreds of thousands of borrowers will be in deep trouble when a downturn hits.\n\nIndeed, according to the New York Fed, more than 1 million more Americans are behind on their car loans now than at the peak of delinquencies in 2010 after the financial crisis.\n\n\"The big lenders who do not know their customers are going to have a problem when the economy turns,\" Tormohlen says.\n\nExpensive older used cars are exacerbating the problem, and it may take years for them to return to more affordable levels. George Augustaitis, director of automotive industry analytics at CarGurus Inc (CARG.O), an online marketplace for new and used cars, said late this spring his team started to notice an \"accelerating decline\" in the number of available vehicles under $10,000, which typically would include vehicles between eight and 12 years old.\n\nIn an analysis for \u2588\u2588\u2588, CarGuru's data shows a falling share of inventory of Great Recession-era cars, while the number of online \"leads\" from consumers seeking those vehicles has remained steady. In fact, the average American car is the oldest on record, and CarGurus' Augustaitis said the available inventory of vehicles costing under $10,000 will not return to more normal levels until 2022, reflecting rising car production after the Great Recession.\n\nKen Shilson, president of the National Alliance of Buy Here, Pay Here Dealers (NABD), said American consumers have become too comfortable with debt, and subprime customers have been \"poisoned\" by easy access to capital for much of the long economic expansion. But he added that those customers will be forced by tighter underwriting to seek even older vehicles.\n\n\"The American way is to always live beyond your means, and Americans aren't good at making life adjustments,\" Shilson said. \"But there's a reality check coming, and many subprime buyers will be forced to find more affordable transportation.\"",
    " Title: Unemployment Rate Drops to 7.8 Percent; 114,000 Jobs Added to Payrolls: A Closer Look at the September Labor Report\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported a decline in the nation's unemployment rate to 7.8 percent in September, despite a relatively weak job growth of 114,000 jobs added to private and public payrolls. The decrease in the jobless rate, which is the first time it has been below 8 percent since President Obama took office in January 2009, is partly attributed to an increase in the number of Americans who found part-time jobs.\n\nThe BLS report, which is based on a household survey, showed an estimated 873,000 more people reported being \"employed\" in September compared to August, the biggest one-month jump since June 1983. Conversely, the figure on payroll employment, based on a survey of public and private employers, showed a gain of 114,000 jobs. The discrepancy between the two figures can be explained by a 582,000 increase in the number of people who took part-time work \"for economic reasons\" last month.\n\nThe unemployment rate, which is based on a survey of households, is an estimate of the labor force's unemployment status. The figure on payroll employment, on the other hand, is based on a survey of employers and provides a count of the number of jobs in the economy. The sampling error on the business establishment survey is plus or minus 100,000 jobs, while the sampling error on the household survey is plus or minus 280,000 jobs.\n\nThe BLS report also showed that there were 456,000 fewer people counted as being among the unemployed last month. Additionally, the economy created 86,000 more jobs in July and August than initially estimated, with employers adding 146,000 jobs per month from July through September, up from 67,000 in the previous three months.\n\nThe report is sure to be a hot topic on the campaign trail, with President Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney offering their respective takes on the economy. President Obama said the report is a \"reminder that this country has come too far to turn back now,\" while Romney described the report as \"not what a real recovery looks like.\"\n\nThe broader unemployment rate, which includes \"marginally attached workers\" and people who are employed part-time for economic reasons, remained unchanged last month at 14.7 percent. The choice in this election, according to Romney, is clear: \"Under President Obama, we'll get another four years like the last four years. If I'm elected, we will have a real recovery with pro-growth policies that will create 12 million new jobs and rising incomes for everyone.\"",
    " Title: Jeb Bush's Presidential Campaign: Awaiting Primary Vote, Facing Challenges, and Gaining Support\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, Jeb Bush's presidential campaign is gearing up, with the first primary votes still approximately 10 months away. Bush's team is taking a measured approach, allowing time for adjustments and candidate development, as the Republican party shows no signs of coalescing behind another candidate.\n\nScott Reed, the top political adviser to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, commented, \"Raising money is an important part of the game. But it's not the whole game.\"\n\nKristy Campbell, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, stated in an email, \"As Governor Bush considers the possibility of a run, he's working hard to earn the support of people throughout the party and deliver a positive message about how conservative reforms can restore opportunity and prosperity for more Americans.\"\n\nIn January, Bush's allies began using the phrase \"shock and awe\" to describe his strategy of securing as many of the party's major donors and policy experts as possible. The aim was to establish Bush as the sole credible contender for the Republican establishment's blessing. Bush successfully deterred Mitt Romney, the 2012 nominee, from mounting another campaign. However, his organization will not disclose its finances until July.\n\nDespite positioning himself as the Republicans' best hope in the general election, recent polls show Bush performing no better against Hillary Rodham Clinton than Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin or Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. He also lags behind Mr. Walker in Iowa, a state known for rejecting candidates perceived as the party's inevitable nominees.\n\nColleen Platt, a City Council member in University Park, Iowa, questioned, \"If he's going to run for the presidency because his father and his brother were president, is that why we should support him?\"\n\nThere is also lingering suspicion of Mr. Bush among the Tea Party grassroots, a sentiment that emerged during his focus on business and philanthropic interests. As the race unfolds, Bush's campaign will need to address these concerns and solidify his position within the Republican party.",
    " Title: Biden Denies Inappropriate Conduct Allegations, Promises to Listen and Learn\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of Nevada Lieutenant Governor candidate Lucy Flores' accusation that former Vice President Joe Biden inappropriately kissed her during a 2014 campaign event, Biden has issued a statement denying any wrongdoing but expressing a commitment to listen and learn from any allegations of misconduct.\n\nFlores, a former Nevada state representative, alleged in an article published on Friday that Biden \"planted a big slow kiss on the back of my head.\" In response, a Biden spokesperson denied that the vice president or his staff were aware of Flores' discomfort.\n\nBiden, in his statement on Sunday, said, \"In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support, and comfort. And not once -- never -- did I believe I acted inappropriately.\"\n\nHe continued, \"If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention.\"\n\nFlores, in an interview with CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, expressed her satisfaction with Biden's statement, stating, \"I'm glad that he's willing to listen... If he is saying he never believed that was inappropriate, then frankly I believe that's a little bit of a disconnection... I want him to change his behavior and I want him to acknowledge that it was wrong.\"\n\nThe allegations have led to a flood of pictures showing Biden with various women at campaign events and other administration functions surfacing on social media. Vox.com published a piece on Friday titled, \"Lucy Flores isn\u2019t alone. Joe Biden\u2019s got a long history of touching women inappropriately,\" which catalogued several alleged episodes of misconduct by the former vice president.\n\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway, speaking to \"Fox News Sunday,\" defended Biden, stating, \"This woman Lucy is very bold to come forward, and I would remind the audience that she shares Joe Biden's political party...

As the three prominent senators each have sought to draw a sharp contrast with President Trump, who has faced his own misconduct allegations, the claims have highlighted vulnerabilities that could become major liabilities not only in a heated Democrat Party primary, but also in the general election.",
    " Title: The Importance of Understanding the U.S. Constitution: A Call to Familiarize Ourselves with the Foundational Document\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Americans, we celebrate our Declaration of Independence on July 4th with grandeur and pomp. However, the significance of September 17, Constitution Day, often goes unnoticed. This day marks the adoption of the U.S. Constitution, a document that has played a pivotal role in shaping our republic and preserving our independence.\n\nThe Constitution, unlike the Declaration of Independence, lacks the flair and pageantry of our national birthday. Yet, without this landmark document, it is unlikely we would still be celebrating the declaration in the 21st century. Understanding the Constitution is crucial to making sense of our history, government decisions, and the rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Constitution outlines the structure of our government, the powers of its branches, and the rights of its citizens. Without this understanding, it is impossible to form an informed opinion about the decisions reached by the courts or the actions of government agencies that affect our lives daily.\n\nAccording to Thomas Ginsburg, Zachary Elkins, and James Melton, authors of \u201cThe Lifespan of Written Constitutions,\u201d the average life span of a constitution since 1789 is only 17 years. The U.S. Constitution, however, has endured for over two centuries, a remarkable achievement given the numerous wars and periods of transformation and upheaval it has weathered.\n\nTo help understand the Constitution, resources like \"The Heritage Guide to the Constitution\" are available. This guide, first published in 2005 and now in a revised edition, provides expert analysis of every clause, relevant court cases, interpretations, and an overview of the Constitution's creation. It is used by law schools nationwide and is a valuable tool for any citizen who wants to understand the law of the land.\n\nAs former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III writes in the guide, \"The continued success and viability of our democratic Republic depends on our fidelity to, and the faithful exposition and interpretation of, this Constitution, our great charter of liberty.\"\n\nSo, the next time September 17 rolls around, consider taking a moment to familiarize yourself with the U.S. Constitution. It is not a daunting task, and understanding it can provide a deeper appreciation for the foundation of our democratic republic.",
    " Title: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney Hints at Possible Delay of Obamacare Individual Mandate Due to Website Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, White House press secretary Jay Carney has hinted at the possibility of a delay in the implementation of the individual mandate under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, due to ongoing issues with the healthcare law's enrollment website.\n\nDuring a press briefing on Monday, Carney did not directly confirm a delay but stated that if individuals were unable to enroll in Obamacare due to the glitchy website, they would not be penalized. This is the first official indication that the president may be considering a delay in the implementation of the individual mandate.\n\nThe individual mandate, a key provision of the Affordable Care Act, requires uninsured Americans to sign up for health insurance. If they do not, they could face a fine. Carney was asked if people would have to pay a fine if they were unable to enroll in Obamacare due to the website's issues.\n\nThe administration has been under pressure to delay the implementation of Obamacare, with Republicans pushing for a delay for months. The White House has consistently rejected these calls, insisting that the program would be ready to roll out on October 1. Those who sought a delay in return for fully reopening the government were criticized by the White House.\n\nThe White House's handling of the Obamacare rollout has been criticized, with the website experiencing numerous technical issues since its launch on October 1. The administration has struggled to fix these issues, with some experts suggesting that the code may need to be rewritten, a process that could take weeks or even months.\n\nThe White House has yet to provide details on how a delay would be implemented or who would be responsible for overseeing the process. It is unclear whether the administration will ask Congress for the delay or if they will impose it unilaterally.\n\nThe White House's handling of the Obamacare rollout has been widely criticized, with some calling it a \"clusterfark.\" The administration has been unable to provide a clear timeline for when the website issues will be resolved, and there have been reports of individuals being unable to enroll in the program.\n\nThe White House has also been criticized for using \"photo-ops\" to showcase individuals who have successfully enrolled in Obamacare. However, it has been reported that some of these individuals are not actually enrolled in the program, or have not been able to find coverage through the exchanges.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the administration will formally announce a delay in the implementation of the individual mandate, and if so, how it will be implemented. The White House has yet to provide a clear timeline for when the website issues will be resolved, and it is unclear who will be held accountable for the ongoing technical issues.",
    " Title: Montana GOP House Candidate Greg Gianforte Charged with Misdemeanor Assault Ahead of Special Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Montana law enforcement officials have charged GOP House candidate Greg Gianforte with misdemeanor assault following an alleged physical altercation with a reporter Wednesday evening, just hours before voters head to the polls. The incident occurred at the candidate's campaign headquarters in Bozeman.\n\nThe Guardian reporter, Ben Jacobs, claims that Gianforte allegedly slammed him to the floor as he posed questions about the Republicans' ObamaCare repeal plan. However, Gianforte denies the allegations.\n\nGallatin County Sheriff Brian Gootkin issued a statement Wednesday night, stating that Gianforte had been cited for misdemeanor assault. The statement reads, \"Following multiple interviews and an investigation by the Gallatin County Sheriff's Office, it was determined there was probable cause to issue a citation to Greg Gianforte for misdemeanor assault. The nature of the injuries did not meet the statutory elements of felony assault.\"\n\nAn audio recording of the incident, released by The Guardian, captures the initial exchange between Gianforte and Jacobs. In the recording, Gianforte initially brushes aside Jacobs' question about the new Congressional Budget Office score of the House GOP's American Health Care Act, which passed the House earlier in the month.\n\nThe altercation ensues after Jacobs persists with his questions. \"We'll talk to you about that later,\" Gianforte says in the recording. \"Yeah, but there's not going to be time,\" Jacobs responds.\n\nGianforte then asks Jacobs to contact the candidate's spokesman. Before Jacobs can respond, sounds of an altercation erupt. \"I'm sick and tired of you guys,\" Gianforte screams. \"The last guy who came in here you did the same thing. Get the hell out of here!\" Jacobs later posted pictures of the broken glasses from the back of an ambulance.\n\nGianforte's office offered a different account, stating that Jacobs encroached on \"a separate interview in a private office\" and \"aggressively shoved a recorder in Greg's face.\"\n\nHowever, eyewitness accounts from several Fox News reporters contradict Gianforte's story. Fox reporter Alicia Acuna stated, \"Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground behind him.\" Acuna and others \"watched in disbelief as Gianforte then began punching the man, as he moved on top the reporter and began yelling something to the effect of 'I'm sick and tired of this!'\"\n\nDemocrats have seized on the news, calling on Gianforte to quit the race and for Republicans to condemn his conduct. \"Greg Gianforte must immediately withdraw his candidacy after his alleged violent assault of an innocent journalist,\" said Tyler Law, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The group also launched an 11th-hour Facebook ad campaign highlighting the episode in hopes of swaying voters heading to the polls Thursday.\n\nThursday's special election pits Gianforte against Democrat Rob Quist in a contest to replace former GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke, who is now heading President Trump's Interior Department. Gianforte is seen as a slight favorite in the race.\n\nGianforte is expected to appear in court before June 7. He faces a maximum sentence of six months in jail, a $500 fine, or both. Sheriff Gootkin, a Gianforte supporter, acknowledged his donation to the Republican candidate in his statement. However, he added, \"this contribution has nothing to do with our investigation which is now complete.\"",
    " Title: Trump Disputes Wall Street Journal's Account of Interview on Kim Jong Un Relationship\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump contested the Wall Street Journal's account of an interview with him last week, in which he was quoted as saying he probably had a \"very good relationship\" with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The President argued that he used a conditional tense, stating \"I'd probably\" have a good relationship, which he considered a \"big difference.\"\n\nThe White House released a portion of the audio from the interview, which it claimed showed Trump saying \"I'd.\" The Wall Street Journal, in turn, released its own audio that it said supported its version of the events.\n\nThe President's comment about a potential relationship with Kim Jong Un is significant, as any suggestion of direct contact between the two leaders, who have exchanged threats and insults, would indicate a significant shift in the U.S.-led pressure campaign against Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nTrump has previously referred to Kim as a \"maniac\" and \"little rocket man,\" while Kim has called Trump a \"mentally deranged U.S. dotard.\" Fears of war have somewhat abated after the first round of intra-Korean talks in over two years last week, ahead of February's Winter Olympics hosted by South Korea. North Korea has announced its participation in the Games.\n\nOn Sunday, when asked about resolving the North Korea standoff, Trump said, \"We'll see what happens.\" He mentioned upcoming meetings, possibly referring to further talks planned between North and South Korea. \"Hopefully it's all going to work out,\" Trump added. \"We have great talks going on, the Olympics you know about, a lot of things can happen.\"\n\nIn the Wall Street Journal interview, Trump was asked whether he had spoken with the North Korean leader. \"I don't want to comment on it. I'm not saying I have or haven't. I just don't want to comment,\" he had said.\n\nTrump, currently at his oceanfront Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, tweeted on Sunday, \"Obviously I didn't say that. I said 'I'd have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un,' a big difference. Fortunately, we now record conversations with reporters... and they knew exactly what I said and meant. They just wanted a story. FAKE NEWS!\"\n\nA White House official stated that the delay in publicly disputing the Journal's account was due to a failed attempt to get the paper to correct the record. \"The reason there was a delay is because we had several calls and emails with WSJ, starting Friday morning, asking them to issue a correction. They refused, and so we pushed out our own clarification,\" the official said.",
    " Title: GOP Candidates Embrace Hardline Immigration Stance in TV Ads, While Democrats Focus on Healthcare in 2018 Midterms\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 House Republican candidates are airing a significant number of TV ads emphasizing a hardline stance on immigration, according to a Kantar Media analysis of data from the Campaign Media Analysis Group (CMAG). This shift in messaging is a stark contrast to the midterm elections in 2014.\n\nRepublicans have aired over 14,000 campaign ads this year promoting a Trump-style immigration platform. This barrage of ads highlights the concerns of House GOP leaders about the potential risks for GOP candidates in the fall election if a legislative fix for DREAMers, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, is passed.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, are focusing on ads that promise to protect Obamacare, shore up Social Security, and expand Medicare. One such ad by California Democrat Paul Kerr recounts his family's financial devastation due to medical bills after his mother was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease.\n\nThe competing messages illustrate the significant ideological divide between the two parties. They are not just discussing issues differently; they are promoting different issues to mobilize activists and win hotly contested primaries.\n\nKyle Kondik, a political analyst with the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, noted, \"It sometimes feels like the two parties are talking to two different countries.\"\n\nIn many ways, they are, especially in primaries, Kondik said. Republicans appeal to a whiter, older, more rural electorate, while Democrats court a more diverse, younger, urban constituency.\n\nThe GOP's focus on immigration is particularly notable, given that it was not among the top 10 issues Republicans spent their ad dollars on at this point in the 2014 midterms. In that cycle, GOP contenders attacked President Obama, bashing the Affordable Care Act and promising to rein in government spending.\n\nNow, immigration ranks second only to pro-Trump spots in GOP campaigns across the country. Brian Murray, a GOP consultant based in Arizona, attributes this shift to Trump's impact during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nIn Washington, House GOP leaders are grappling with the immigration issue, which is causing division within the party and potentially jeopardizing House Speaker Paul Ryan's grip on power. Moderate Republicans are pushing for legislation that would grant legal status to DREAMers, while conservatives are demanding legislation to slash legal immigration and authorize construction of Trump's proposed border wall.\n\nSome strategists warn that the GOP's full-throated embrace of Trump's anti-immigration positions in primaries could harm them in the fall. A Pew Research Center poll in January showed that 74% of Americans support granting permanent legal status to DREAMers, and 60% oppose expanding the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic candidates have focused overwhelmingly on health in their advertising, running more than 26,000 ads on the subject. Of those, over 8,500 Democratic spots promise to protect or expand Medicare.\n\nThe ideological divide between the parties is also evident in the primary races. In Montana's only House seat, for instance, Democrat Grant Kier promises in a TV spot to fight Trump on climate change, oppose his health care plan, and protect women's health care choices. However, this could potentially harm Democrats in the general election, according to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with House Republicans.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2018 midterms are shaping up to be a battle of contrasting ideologies, with Republicans focusing on immigration and Democrats emphasizing healthcare. The grass-roots wings of both parties are demonstrating a significant divergence in the issues that are motivating them.",
    " Title: Trump Legal Team Files Lawsuit to Block Congressional Subpoena of Financial Records from Mazars USA\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to challenge a congressional subpoena, attorneys for President Donald Trump and the Trump Organization have filed a lawsuit against House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings on Monday. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, aims to block Mazars USA, a longtime accounting firm for the company, from complying with the subpoena issued by Cummings.\n\nThe lawsuit, which also names Peter Kenny, chief investigative counsel for the oversight committee, as a defendant, alleges that Cummings has overstepped constitutional limits on Congress' power to investigate and that the subpoena lacks a \"legitimate legislative purpose.\" The lawsuit further argues that the subpoena threatens to expose \"confidential information\" and seeks to declare the subpoena \"invalid and unenforceable.\"\n\nJay Sekulow, one of the president's attorneys, stated, \"We will not allow congressional presidential harassment to go unanswered.\" The lawsuit claims that House Democrats are using their newfound majority to investigate \"every aspect\" of President Trump's personal finances, businesses, and his family, and are \"singularly obsessed\" with finding politically damaging information on the president.\n\nThe White House has been accused of \"unprecedented stonewalling on all fronts\" by Mr. Cummings, who has not produced a single document or witness to the oversight committee this year. In response, Mr. Cummings stated, \"The president has a long history of trying to use baseless lawsuits to attack his adversaries, but there is simply no valid legal basis to interfere with this duly authorized subpoena from Congress.\"\n\nThe subpoena demands financial statements and supporting documents from Mazars for President Trump, the Trump Organization, and other entities, covering documents from 2011 to 2018. The subpoena was issued to corroborate testimony from Michael Cohen, President Trump's longtime former lawyer and fixer, about the president's financial information.\n\nCohen, who testified to the committee in February, has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, among other crimes. In a memo to committee members announcing his intention to issue the subpoena, Mr. Cummings said financial statements Cohen provided to the committee in 2011, 2012, and 2013 raise \"serious questions\" about President Trump's representations of his financial condition.\n\nIn a separate battle between Mr. Trump and congressional Democrats, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal has given the IRS a new April 23 deadline to turn over six years' worth of President Trump's personal tax returns, as well as returns for some associated organizations, like one of his golf courses. The lawsuit filed by the Trump legal team is the latest signal from Mr. Trump's legal team that they plan to push back strongly against what one of his attorneys called \"presidential harassment\" from a newly empowered Democratic majority in the House.",
    " Title: Impact and Implications of U.S. Tariffs on Chinese Imports: A Focus on Technology and Intellectual Property\n\nThe ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China are set to escalate, with the potential impact of the proposed tariffs on Chinese goods being significantly larger and more concentrated than the steel and aluminum measures. According to Joseph Parilla of the Brookings Institution, the steel and aluminum tariffs would affect approximately $33 billion in imports, excluding Canada and Mexico, which are expected to be exempt from the measures. In contrast, the China tariffs could affect at least $50 billion in annual imports.\n\nChinese companies have been actively investing in American businesses, with annual Chinese acquisition deals totaling tens of billions of dollars, according to Rhodium Group. These investments have spanned various sectors, including non-strategic assets like movie theaters and the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York, as well as cutting-edge areas such as semiconductors and start-ups related to autonomous driving. China's strategic acquisitions are aimed at upgrading its technological capabilities and countering the perceived American stranglehold on fundamental technologies, which it views as a long-term economic and security threat.\n\nUnlike the metal tariffs, which have caused divisions within the Trump administration and opposition from many Republican lawmakers and businesspeople, the technology-focused moves against China are likely to find political support on Capitol Hill and in certain industries. Daniel DiMicco, a steel executive and trade adviser to the Trump campaign, stated, \"Their theft costs us over $350 billion per year, so the bigger the better.\" This refers to the forced transfer of intellectual property and other unfair practices alleged by the administration.\n\nThe business community, which once defended trade with China despite accusations of intellectual property theft, has grown increasingly dissatisfied with the adverse treatment in the Chinese economy. With the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises playing an ever-larger role in the market, the environment for American companies has deteriorated.\n\nHowever, American business groups have expressed concern over the possibility that U.S. tariffs could prompt other countries to raise their own trade barriers. As the trade tensions between the U.S. and China continue to escalate, it remains to be seen how these developments will shape the global economic landscape.",
    " Title: Obama's Austin Visit: A Political Move Amidst Economic Agenda Amidst Stalled Congressional Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at reiterating his economic agenda, President Barack Obama visited Austin, Texas, this week, a trip that Republican officials have criticized as a campaign-style stunt with little potential to boost the economy or create jobs. The Republican National Committee released a statement titled \"Obama's Jobs Strategy: Pivot Back to the Economy Every So Often.\"\n\nIn his State of the Union address this year, President Obama outlined an economic plan that included a renewed focus on manufacturing, increased funding for early childhood education, a rise in the minimum wage, and greater investment in infrastructure. While some Republicans have shown support for parts of this agenda, there is little evidence that the majority of it will be passed in the current Congress, which has become increasingly gridlocked on fiscal matters.\n\nHowever, aides to the president argue that events such as the ones in Austin, though possibly futile in their immediate impact, are essential to maintain pressure on Republicans and demonstrate to Americans that President Obama remains committed to his economic agenda. The risk for President Obama is that such events may appear as costly excursions with minimal economic improvement. Aides, however, counter that the president would likely face criticism if he announced an agenda in the State of the Union address and did not actively pursue it.\n\nThe president's political advisers recall the lessons learned during his first two years in office, when he largely remained in Washington, focusing on shepherding his health care legislation through Congress. His approval ratings and mood plummeted, leading aides to believe that frequent travel is important.\n\nIn Austin, President Obama was scheduled to meet with local residents and technology entrepreneurs, officials said. He was also set to tour a facility of Applied Materials, a Silicon Valley-based company that manufactures the complex equipment needed to produce silicon chips for computers, phones, and other high-tech devices.",
    " Title: Deadly Riot in Altamira Prison Leaves 57 Inmates Dead, 16 Decapitated\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 At least 57 prisoners were killed by other inmates during clashes between organized crime groups in the Altamira prison in northern Brazil Monday, with 16 of the victims being decapitated, according to prison officials.\n\nThe riot, which erupted around 7 a.m., took place between the Rio de Janeiro-based Comando Vermelho and a local criminal group known as Comando Classe A. A fight initiated by the Comando Classe A, who set fire to a cell belonging to one of the prison's pavilions, housing members of the Comando Vermelho.\n\nThe fire, which spread rapidly due to the prison's old container units, prevented police forces from entering the building for several hours. Two prison staff members were held hostage but were eventually released.\n\nState prisons chief Jarbas Vasconcelos described the incident as a targeted attack, stating, \"It was a settling of accounts between the two groups, not a protest or rebellion against the prison system.\"\n\nAuthorities have not found any firearms following the riot, only makeshift knives. Prison authorities said 46 inmates will be transferred to other prisons, with 10 of them going to stricter federal facilities.\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro, who was elected on the promise of curbing widespread violence in Brazil, including in the country's often overcrowded, out-of-control prisons, has yet to comment on the incident.\n\nThe Altamira prison, located in the city of the same name, had 343 detainees for a maximum capacity of 163, according to a July 2019 report from the National Justice Council. State prisons chief Jarbas Vasconcelos stated that the situation did not meet the official requirements to be considered overcrowded.\n\nThe judge who filed the report described the overall state of the prison as \"terrible.\" In many of Brazil's prisons, badly outnumbered guards struggle to retain power over an ever-growing population of inmates who are able to run criminal activities from behind bars.\n\nThe killings echoed those of 55 inmates who died in a series of riots in May in several prisons in the neighboring state of Amazonas. In early 2017, more than 120 inmates died in prisons across several northern states when rival gangs clashed over control of drug-trafficking routes in the region.\n\nPara state authorities spent the afternoon in Altamira, drafting a security plan to avoid possible retaliations in the region. Police forces from the nearby municipality of Santerem were sent as reinforcement in the coming weeks. Prison authorities said they had not received any prior intelligence reports of an upcoming attack.\n\nThe prison is run directly by the state, not a third-party private operator as in the Manaus prisons where the riots took place in May. Last year, inmates had already set fire to another wing inside the same prison unit, according to the state prosecutors' office.",
    " Title: Former Vice President Al Gore Expresses Optimism on Climate Change Debate, Citing Shift in Republican Stance\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, former Vice President Al Gore expressed optimism about the future of the climate change debate, suggesting that Republicans are growing weary of global warming deniers. Gore, who is a prominent climate change activist, compared the current climate change debate to historical movements such as the civil rights movement, the anti-apartheid movement, the nuclear arms race, and the abolition movement.\n\nGore argued that activists are in the process of \"winning the conversation\" on climate change, just as activists won these historical movements. He pointed to the debate over smoking, stating that people once thought Senator Frank Lautenburg of New Jersey was \"crazy\" for pushing legislation that would ban smoking in airplanes, but the political landscape eventually shifted in favor of such legislation.\n\nGore also highlighted the efforts of Organizing for Action, the political group formed from President Barack Obama's re-election campaign, which earlier this month delivered unicorn statues to Republican deniers in Congress as part of a larger push to \"hold members of Congress accountable for their positions on climate change.\"\n\nGore credited President Obama for his aggressive new climate change strategy, which includes limiting pollution from existing coal-fired power plants and issuing directives requiring the EPA to establish carbon pollution standards for plants that are already active. Gore expressed being \"very encouraged\" by these policy moves.\n\nHowever, Gore acknowledged that the process of \"winning the conversation\" on climate change has been stalled in the past due to the resistance of a small group of denialists who fly into a rage when the topic is mentioned. He likened this resistance to a family with an alcoholic father who becomes enraged when certain subjects are discussed, leading others to avoid the topic to maintain peace. Gore argued, however, that the ability of these denialists to halt progress is waning every day.",
    " Title: US Urges Iran to Reroute Aid Ship to Djibouti, Citing UN Humanitarian Hub\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington has called on an Iranian ship, reportedly carrying humanitarian aid to Yemen, to alter its course and head to Djibouti, where the United Nations is overseeing humanitarian deliveries, according to US officials on Tuesday. The US military is tracking the ship, the Iran Shahed, after Tehran announced plans to send warships to escort the vessel to Yemen.\n\nPentagon spokesman Colonel Steven Warren told reporters that the ship, currently in the Gulf of Oman, was not under naval escort at the moment. \"We are monitoring the Iranian ship,\" he said. \"We are aware of the Iranians' statement that they plan to escort this ship with warships.\"\n\nThe Iranian state news agency IRNA earlier quoted a naval commander, Rear Admiral Hossein Azad, saying naval forces would be \"safeguarding\" the vessel. Iran's Red Crescent had announced last week that it would send a ship carrying 2,500 tons of humanitarian aid to Yemen, where Iran-backed Huthi rebels are fighting pro-government forces supported by a Saudi-led coalition.\n\nWhen asked if the US military would attempt to search the ship or prevent it from docking in Yemen, Warren declined to comment. \"If the Iranians are planning some sort of stunt in the region, they know as well as we do that it would be unhelpful and in fact could potentially threaten the ceasefire (in Yemen) that has been so painstakingly brought about,\" Warren said.\n\nThe US Navy has bolstered its presence in the Gulf following Iran's seizure of a Marshall Islands-flagged vessel in the Strait of Hormuz. Iranian authorities later released the ship, citing a commercial dispute with Denmark's Maersk group, which chartered the vessel.\n\nThe US officials urged Iran to deliver the humanitarian aid to the United Nations humanitarian aid distribution hub in Djibouti, stating that this would allow the aid to be rapidly and efficiently distributed to those in Yemen who require it.",
    " Title: Elizabeth Warren Advocates for Criminal Indictment of Sitting Presidents, Citing Obstruction of Justice\n\nIn a statement released on Friday, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren called for Congress to pass a law that clarifies the Justice Department's ability to indict a sitting president for criminal activity, including obstruction of justice.\n\nWarren's call comes in response to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and Mueller's statement this week that Justice Department policy prevented him from bringing charges against a sitting president.\n\nMueller's report concluded that Russia repeatedly interfered in the 2016 election and that Trump's election campaign had multiple contacts with Russian officials, but did not establish a criminal conspiracy with Moscow to win the White House. The report declined to make a judgment on whether Trump obstructed justice, although it outlined 10 instances in which Trump tried to have Mueller fired or otherwise impede the investigation.\n\n\"When the federal government tried to investigate, Donald Trump did everything he could to delay, distract, and otherwise obstruct that investigation,\" Warren's statement said. \"That's a crime. If Donald Trump were anyone other than the president of the United States, he would be in handcuffs and indicted.\"\n\nWarren urged Congress to pass a law making it clear that presidents can be indicted for criminal activity, including obstruction of justice. She also suggested amending statutes relating to such obstruction to allow for indictment when a president abuses the powers of office.\n\nWarren criticized Trump's Attorney General, William Barr, saying he had \"acted like Trump's personal defense attorney.\" She promised that if she is elected, she would ensure her appointees reverse a Justice Department opinion that argues a sitting president cannot be indicted.\n\n\"Donald Trump is not a king. No president is. And our democracy only works if everyone can be held accountable,\" Warren said.",
    " Title: Court Ruling Reveals NSA Metadata Querying Violations, Sparking Debate on Oversight Effectiveness\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, a recent court ruling has revealed that the National Security Agency (NSA) had been routinely violating the standards for querying metadata, according to Judge Bates' recounting. The ruling, which was obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a free speech and privacy rights group, following a lawsuit, concluded that the requirement for oversight of the NSA's metadata collection had not functioned effectively due to these violations.\n\nSenator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, had fought last summer to declassify the basic fact that the surveillance court had ruled against the NSA. In a statement, Mr. Wyden, an outspoken critic of NSA surveillance, described the declassification of the ruling as \"long overdue.\" He argued that while the NSA had increased privacy protections for purely domestic and unrelated communications that were swept up in the surveillance, the collection itself \"was a serious violation of the Fourth Amendment.\"\n\nMark Rumold of the Electronic Frontier Foundation praised the administration for releasing the document with relatively few redactions, although he criticized the time and the difficulty in obtaining it. However, he also said the ruling showed the surveillance court was not equipped to perform adequate oversight of the NSA. \"This opinion illustrates that the way the court is structured now it can not serve as an effective check on the NSA because it\u2019s wholly dependent on the representations that the NSA makes to it,\" Mr. Rumold said. \"It has no ability to investigate. And it\u2019s clear that the NSA\u2019s representations have not been entirely candid to the court.\"\n\nA senior intelligence official, speaking to reporters in a conference call, portrayed the ruling as showing that NSA oversight was robust and serious. He said that some 300 NSA employees were assigned to seek out even inadvertent violations of the rules and that the court conducted \"vigorous\" oversight.\n\nThe ruling focused on a program under which the NSA has been searching domestic Internet links for communications\u2014where at least one side is overseas\u2014in which there are \"strong selectors\" indicating insider knowledge of someone who has been targeted for foreign-intelligence collection. One example would be mentioning a person's private email address in the body of an email. The revelation of these violations has sparked a debate on the effectiveness of the NSA's oversight mechanisms, with critics arguing for more robust and independent oversight.",
    " Title: GOP Leaders and Conservatives Skeptical of Immigration Bill Progress in 2014\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, conservative Republicans have expressed doubts about the possibility of an immigration bill being passed this year, citing a lack of trust in President Obama's administration to enforce strict security measures.\n\nAt a Heritage Foundation event, Republican House members voiced their reservations, stating that while they acknowledge the House GOP leaders' principles as a starting point for discussion, it is premature to attempt to pass a bill at this time.\n\nRep. Raul Labrador, an Idaho Republican who was part of a group working on a comprehensive immigration bill last year but dropped out, stated that President Obama should spend this year demonstrating his commitment to security measures before Republicans consider action in 2015, should they regain control of the Senate.\n\n\"We need to have the trust with this administration, and that trust is not there,\" Mr. Labrador said. \"Until we have that trust, there will be no immigration reform, and it would be a mistake for leadership to push that.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner released principles last week that called for increased security but also for illegal immigrants to be granted legal status, with a specific pathway to citizenship for young adult illegal immigrants. However, Mr. Boehner himself stated on Tuesday that Republicans have yet to decide whether to move forward with a bill this year.\n\nRep. Joe Barton, a Texas Republican, noted that while it is not the right time to advance a broad bill, the principles themselves are beneficial for \"beginning a dialogue with the Hispanic community on conservative principles.\"\n\nThe Senate passed a comprehensive bill in June, which includes citizenship rights for most illegal immigrants, with a bipartisan 68-32 vote. However, even this legislation has faced challenges.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the Senate bill, stated on Tuesday that he does not see a way to align the Senate bill with the House's current discussions.\n\n\"I don't see how you get to an outcome this year with the two bodies in such a different place,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats had hoped the release of the principles would facilitate an agreement this year, but the two sides remain far apart on significant issues. House Republicans have insisted on addressing immigration in a series of bills, while the Senate passed a single, comprehensive measure.\n\nAnother contentious issue is citizenship. The Senate bill offers a new specific pathway for most illegal immigrants to become citizens in about 13 years, while the House Republicans' principles call for illegal immigrants to receive some form of legal status, but only specify a path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants, often referred to as the \"Dreamers,\" who are considered the most sympathetic cases.",
    " Title: Trump's Debut: A Shift from Political Outsider to Mainstream Candidate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 election cycle, Donald Trump, the self-proclaimed political outsider, found himself not only a part of the official GOP field but the central focus of the debate. However, as the two-hour event unfolded, Trump's dominance began to wane, and he was no longer the sole star of the show.\n\nEntering the debate as the frontrunner, Trump was expected to dominate the stage. Yet, as the debate progressed, he was drawn into the fray, engaging in debates with other candidates and responding to questions from the moderators. This marked a shift from his usual controlled appearances, friendly rallies, and one-candidate news conferences, where he excels at dominating.\n\nOne of the most notable moments of the debate came when Megyn Kelly asked Trump about his myriad insults to various women. In response, Trump made a rather petulant reference to Kelly herself not being \"very nice\" to him. The evening began with a challenge to Trump from Fox newsman Bret Baier, who wanted to know if anyone onstage was unwilling to commit to supporting the eventual Republican nominee in 2016. Trump immediately raised his right hand, causing both boos and a few cheers from the live crowd.\n\nTrump's response that he could not pledge to support the nominee \"if it's not me,\" adding that it would have to be someone he respected, may resonate with many Republicans in the days to come. This statement, while in line with his many statements of independence in the past, had a different ring to it on this stage on this night.\n\nThe sharpest exchange of the night did not even involve Trump. It stemmed from Sen. Rand Paul's making a brief speech about his opposition to phone records being gathered by the National Security Agency. When he said he wanted to collect records of terrorists, not citizens, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie interrupted to ask how Paul would tell one number from another.\n\nOther candidates found ways to hold the camera when they could. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the 16th candidate to enter the race, benefited from a friendly local crowd and a compact message about balancing budgets and creating jobs. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has been running third in national polls, talked about winning three times in a blue state and about hardening his stance on immigration after talking to \"the American people.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz talked about religious liberty and his father's conversion to Christianity, prompting Walker to talk about his Baptist faith as well. The only actual ordained minister onstage, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, also stressed his moral convictions in talking about the Planned Parenthood controversy.\n\nNeurosurgeon Ben Carson had a neat formulation for his closing statement, suggesting his status as a physician would be appropriate for national leadership. It was a charming summation with a neat barb in it, but it was perhaps the only time he broke through all evening.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, the youngest candidate in the field, made his usual points about understanding and representing the future. If it's about experience, he said, Hillary Clinton will be the next president. Contrast would be the key, he said, his expression the embodiment of \"fresh face.\"\n\nEarlier Thursday, seven additional candidates who did not make the cut for the evening debate met in a slightly less confrontational format, also in Cleveland, also on Fox. Here the apparent standout was businesswoman Carly Fiorina, who would have been the visual highlight in any event as the only participant in fuchsia.\n\nFiorina was controlled, crisp, and gimlet-eyed. And while she did not have a chance onstage with Trump, her question for him was perhaps the best of either session. \"Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care, and on abortion,\" Fiorina said, \"I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?\"\n\nAs the 2016 election cycle progresses, it remains to be seen if Trump can continue to make up the rules as he goes along. The sharp exchange between Rand Paul and Chris Christie, the controlled performance of Carly Fiorina, and the clear message of John Kasich indicate that the other candidates are not afraid to challenge Trump and make their own mark in the race.",
    " Title: Senator Rand Paul Secures Assurance from Attorney General Holder: No Use of Drones to Kill Noncombatant Americans on U.S. Soil\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Senator Rand Paul declared victory on Thursday after Attorney General Eric Holder assured him that the president does not have the authority to use a drone to kill a noncombatant American on U.S. soil, an assurance Paul had sought during his 13-hour filibuster the day before.\n\nDuring the filibuster, which delayed a vote on CIA director nominee John Brennan, Paul had demanded the administration clarify the government's authority to kill on U.S. soil. The filibuster ended past midnight early Thursday morning, and the Senate voted, 63-34, to confirm Brennan later Thursday afternoon.\n\nShortly before the vote, Holder sent a terse letter to Paul that read: \"It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: 'Does the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?' The answer to that question is no.\"\n\nIn response, Paul said Thursday that \"we're proud to announce that the president is not going to kill unarmed Americans on American soil.\" He later took to the floor to promote the attorney general's response, as the Senate moved to confirm Brennan.\n\nThough Paul's 13-hour stand drew praise from all sides of the political spectrum, the senator also took heat Thursday from some in his own party who claimed he stirred unnecessary fear about the use of drones.\n\nSenator John McCain, R-Ariz., said, \"The senator should know better,\" arguing that some of the concerns raised about drone missile attacks on Americans, like Paul's suggestion that the U.S. could have killed Jane Fonda when she went to North Vietnam, were \"ridiculous.\"\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., displayed a sign that showed the number of Americans killed in the U.S. by Al Qaeda\u20142,958\u2014versus the number killed in the U.S. by drones, which is zero.\n\nPaul, however, argued that he was raising concern about how future presidents might use their drone authority.\n\nPaul told Fox News the critical senators \"think the whole world is a battlefield, including America.\"\n\n\"I do not think the laws of war apply to America. I think the Bill of Rights do,\" Paul said.\n\nWhile the Obama administration increasingly employs armed drones as a pivotal counterterrorism tool overseas, domestic law enforcement agencies are also moving to broaden the use of surveillance mini-drones over the next several years. The Federal Aviation Administration projects as many as 10,000 licensed systems by 2017.\n\nThe lethal drones used in Pakistan are a far cry from the unarmed eyes in the sky used in America. But Paul and a host of other lawmakers see constitutional pitfalls across the board\u2014namely focusing on how armed, and unarmed, drones might someday be used against American citizens.\n\nPaul and the senators from both sides of the aisle who joined him on the floor Wednesday described a bleak future in which an unscrupulous government might use drones against its own population if left unchecked.\n\n\"Your notification is the buzz of propellers on the drone as it flies overhead in the seconds before you're killed. Is that what we really want from our government?\" Paul asked.\n\nLawmakers have already started pushing legislation to rein in the drone program\u2014legislation that might get a second look after Paul's dramatic performance Wednesday.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., and Ted Poe, R-Texas, last month introduced a bill to regulate domestic drones much like the government regulates wiretaps. It would require officials to obtain a warrant in order to perform many kinds of surveillance with those drones. Further, it would prohibit law enforcement drones from being equipped with firearms or explosives in U.S. airspace.\n\n\"As we enter this uncharted world of drone technology, Congress must be proactive and establish boundaries for drone use that safeguard the constitutional rights of Americans,\" Poe said in a statement last month.\n\nThe use of armed drones in U.S. airspace fueled Paul's lengthy filibuster Wednesday. Before he took the floor, Paul announced that he had received a letter from Holder, which opened the door, in extremely rare circumstances, to using a drone to kill someone within U.S. territory. Holder said \"catastrophic\" attacks such as the Sept. 11 attacks or the attack on Pearl Harbor are examples of circumstances where the president could conceivably feel such an action is necessary.\n\nTestifying on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Holder agreed that it would be unconstitutional to use a drone on American soil against a U.S. citizen or a suspected terrorist who did not pose an imminent threat.\n\nPaul, during his filibuster, said he wanted a formal assurance from the administration that it would not use drones to kill noncombatant Americans, which prompted the Holder letter on Thursday.",
    " Title: Pollsters Face Challenges in Balancing Sampling and Bias as Presidential Election Nears\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2012 presidential election approaches, pollsters are grappling with the challenge of accurately representing the electorate while minimizing bias in their surveys. With President Obama and congressional Democrats surging in polls, Republicans are increasingly questioning the validity of the surveys, with some accusing pollsters of intentionally trying to demoralize GOP voters.\n\nPollsters argue that their sampling methods are designed to yield an accurate representation of voter demographics by party, gender, ethnicity, and other categories. However, this is easier said than done, especially when surveys usually sample fewer than 1,500 people. The question for pollsters then becomes whether to tweak the data to give added weight to responses from groups that often go underrepresented in polls, such as Republicans, young voters, and minorities, to come up with a sampling that better represents the electorate.\n\nCharles Franklin, who runs the Marquette University Law School poll, which is tracking the presidential and U.S. Senate races in Wisconsin, adjusts weights for gender, age, and ethnic balance but not for political party. He argues that an increase in participation by a certain party can be an indicator that it is more energized than the other side.\n\nDemocrats historically hold a turnout edge in presidential elections, but their advantage often fluctuates. In 2008, 39 percent of presidential voters were Democrats compared with 32 percent who were Republicans, according to exit polling. The parties each represented 37 percent of the electorate in 2004, which was the Republicans' largest share in decades.\n\n\"Forcing there to be a certain percentage of your electorate denies that change,\" Mr. Franklin said. \"There's a legitimate debate as to which way to go, and I don't think it is by any means a settled statistical question.\"\n\nScott Rasmussen, founder of Rasmussen Reports, which has President Obama with a 1-point lead over Mitt Romney, said, \"We absolutely know that party affiliation is the best single indicator of how someone is going to vote.\"\n\nPollsters are also dealing with issues brought on by technology and changing demographics. Many polls continue to collect their data from calls to landlines rather than cellphones, which could increase responses from older voters who rely on their home phones and minimize participation among younger voters. Mr. Rasmussen predicts that polling might move entirely online in five to 10 years.\n\nThe different methods and varieties of approaches among the various pollsters mean poll watchers need to take individual surveys with a grain of salt. \"Look across all of the polling,\" Mr. Franklin said. \"Don't just try to believe that one poll is always right or that one is always the best. If you see all of the polls pointing in the same direction, that's certainly more reliable.\"",
    " Title: Global Climate Strike: Youth Lead the Way in Demonstrations Across 139 Countries\n\nArticle:\n\nYoung people and adults from around the world participated in the global climate strike on Friday, marking what is expected to be the largest such demonstration to date, with 4,638 events scheduled in 139 countries. The demonstrations were organized by the Fridays for Future movement, inspired by 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nThunberg, who testified at a Capitol Hill hearing on Wednesday, urged U.S. lawmakers to take \"real action\" in addressing climate change. The Fridays for Future website states, \"With the worsening climate destruction, this goal of going to school begins to be pointless. Why study for a future, which may not be there?\"\n\nThe youth participating in the climate strike demonstrations showed a flair for language, with pithy and pointed protest signs such as \"We are skipping our lessons to teach you one\" and \"When leaders act like kids, kids act like leaders.\"\n\nMany also mixed humor with urgency, such as riffing off of Nelly's 2002 hit \"Hot in Herre\" with \"It's getting hot in here, so take off all your coal.\"\n\nSocial media platforms like Twitter and Facebook were flooded with shots of climate strike crowds across the globe. Primary school pupils in Abuja, Nigeria, called for climate action, while activists in other countries demanded climate justice.\n\nThe demonstrations come as the Amazon rainforest continues to burn, with some activists using the hashtag #WrongAmazon to highlight the connection between deforestation and climate change.\n\nThe global climate strike is a testament to the growing movement of young people demanding action on climate change, and a call for world leaders to take the issue seriously and take real action to address it.",
    " Title: Virginia Governor Ralph Northam Declares Juneteenth an Official State Holiday\n\nIn a significant move, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam announced on Tuesday that Juneteenth, a day commemorating the end of slavery in the United States, will be an official holiday in the state, which was once the capital of the Confederacy.\n\nThe holiday, also known as Emancipation Day and Freedom Day, is celebrated annually on June 19. Texas first made it a state holiday in 1980. The holiday will be a paid day off for all state employees, and Governor Northam believes Virginia will be only the second state to do so.\n\n\"It's time we elevate this,\" Northam said of the June 19 commemoration. \"Not just a celebration by and for some Virginians but one acknowledged and celebrated by all of us.\"\n\nGovernor Northam is granting every executive branch employee this Friday as a paid holiday, and he will work with the legislature later this year to pass a law codifying Juneteenth as a permanent state holiday. The legislation is expected to pass the Democratic-controlled legislature with little trouble.\n\nJuneteenth marks June 19, 1865, when news reached African Americans in Texas that President Abraham Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing slaves living in Confederate states two years earlier. When Union soldiers arrived in Galveston to bring the news that slavery had been abolished, former slaves celebrated.\n\nThe announcement comes less than two weeks after Northam announced he was ordering the removal of a statue of General Robert E. Lee along Richmond's prominent Monument Avenue. It is one of the country's most iconic monuments to the Confederacy. Earlier this year, Northam signed legislation scrapping Lee-Jackson Day, a state holiday named after two Confederate generals.\n\nNearly forced from office last year after a racist yearbook photo surfaced, Northam has won widespread praise among black lawmakers for his actions in Virginia following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck as he pleaded for air.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced last week that he has rescheduled a campaign rally that was planned in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Juneteenth. The announcement of the rally had sparked an outcry because Tulsa was the site of one of the worst instances of racial violence in U.S. history in 1921, when hundreds of African Americans were massacred by a white mob that burned black-owned businesses and homes.\n\nGovernor Northam was joined Tuesday at his news conference by musician Pharrell Williams, who is from Virginia. Williams said Juneteenth deserves the same level of recognition and celebration as Independence Day.\n\n\"Here's our day, and if you love us, it'll be your day too,\" Williams said.\n\nIn a statement, state House Republican Leader Todd Gilbert echoed the same sentiments.\n\n\"July 4th is the birthday of our nation, but Juneteenth is the day where it truly began to fulfill its promise of freedom for all,\" Gilbert said. \"For the first time since enslaved Africans landed at Jamestown in 1619, the chains of bondage were finally cast off.\"\n\nJoseph Rogers, a 29-year-old activist who has been a regular protester in Richmond during more than two weeks of demonstrations over Floyd's killing, hailed Northam's announcement.",
    " Title: Boehner Unveils Plan B as Fiscal Cliff Negotiations Stall\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that signals a potential impasse in ongoing fiscal cliff negotiations, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) unveiled a new legislative strategy on Tuesday, aiming to pass a bill that would increase tax rates for income exceeding $1 million while extending rates for the rest of Americans.\n\nDuring a closed-door meeting with fellow Republicans, Boehner presented the so-called \"Plan B,\" a proposal that has already been dismissed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and the White House, who argue it still favors the wealthy. The House Democrats are unlikely to support Boehner in gathering the 218 votes necessary to pass the bill, as indicated by the No. 2 House Democrat, Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer.\n\nThe vote, expected to take place this week, is intended to provide a safety net for House Republicans, should the nation plunge into the fiscal cliff and see income tax rates rise for all. If President Barack Obama continues to accuse Republicans of prioritizing the wealthy, the backup plan allows them to counter that it is not the case.\n\nDespite recent progress in talks between Obama and Boehner, there is still a significant distance to cover. The success of the GOP fallback plan remains uncertain, with the potential to rekindle negotiations or further complicate the situation.\n\nBoehner shared his Plan B with Obama during a phone call on Monday night, prompting Obama to inform Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that negotiations with the White House had stalled. White House advisors Rob Nabors and Gene Sperling addressed both the Senate and House Democratic caucuses on Tuesday.\n\nWith taxes set to rise for everyone in 13 days, followed by tens of billions of dollars in Pentagon and federal agency spending cuts, Boehner's decision to put his bill on the floor underscores the current state of negotiations. As of Monday evening, the two sides appeared to be inching toward an agreement, with Boehner conceding on his earlier insistence that tax rates should not rise for the wealthy and offering the president $1 trillion in new revenue\u2014a significant concession that was unimaginable a year ago.",
    " Title: Debt and Deficit Issues Take a Back Seat in Democratic Presidential Debates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the four-hour-long Democratic presidential debates, the words \"deficit\" and \"debt\" were scarcely mentioned, with the former only appearing once. This reluctance to address the ballooning annual budget deficits and overall debt, a long-standing issue in the United States, is a reflection of the campaign's focus on popular policies that could pose significant budget challenges.\n\nPolicies such as expanding Medicare health coverage, offering government assistance to reduce college costs, and alleviating student debt are among the Democrats' most popular proposals going into the 2020 election. While Democrats argue they have viable plans to cover the costs of these proposals, Republicans counter that their tax-the-rich solutions are unrealistic.\n\nOn the other side of the political divide, Republicans are equally hesitant to discuss the issue, having supported President Donald Trump's massive tax cuts and increased military spending, two key drivers of the deficit increase. By backing Trump, many Republican lawmakers have effectively abandoned their commitment to balanced budgets and reducing the national debt, a concern that Senator Rob Portman, a Republican and former White House budget director, lamented.\n\nEconomists worry that the rising debt will lead to higher interest costs, increasing the pressure on future governments to make deep spending cuts or even causing the United States to default on its debt payments, which could have catastrophic global consequences. Bill Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank focused on fiscal policy, likened the situation to termites undermining a porch: \"You step on the porch and everything's fine... Then one day, you fall through.\"\n\nWhen running for president, Trump claimed he would pay off the national debt in about eight years. However, since taking office in January 2017, the national debt has increased by $2.45 trillion. The total debt outstanding, accumulated over many years of deficits, is now $22.4 trillion, its highest level ever, equating to approximately $68,000 of debt for every American.\n\nThe deficit has risen from $666 billion in fiscal 2017, the final year of President Barack Obama's administration's impact on budgets, to an expected $900 billion this year, and is projected to exceed $1 trillion a year by 2022. The prospect of such high and rising debt poses substantial risks for the nation, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nWith the U.S. economy expanding, inflation and unemployment low, and the stock market near record levels, the government could be expected to take advantage of the strong fundamentals to reduce deficits. However, the opposite is happening. When asked about rising deficits last month, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow downplayed concerns, stating, \"It doesn't bother me right now.\"\n\nDuring a campaign stop in Marshalltown, Iowa, former Vice President Joe Biden accused Republicans of running up the nation's debt as a pretext for seeking cuts to federal retirement and healthcare benefits later. \"Folks, this is a sham,\" said Biden, who has led most polls in the early days of the Democratic primary race.\n\nMarlene Rush, a Marshalltown community organizer, said Biden was \"the first Democrat I've heard actually mention the deficits.\" Rush added, \"I appreciate that. Deficits matter. For Republicans, it seems, they only care about the deficit when Democrats are in the White House.\"\n\nThe first set of Democratic primary debates on June 26-27 in Miami passed without any of the 20 candidates offering up ideas to control debt or deficits. When asked about paying for the expansion of public benefits if they win the White House, Senator Kamala Harris responded, \"I hear that question, but where was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill that benefits the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in this country?\" Harris' response was met with silence from the other candidates on the stage.\n\nAlthough Republicans portray Democrats as the party of big spending, the last time the budget was balanced was under Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1998 and for the next three years. This run ended under Republican George W. Bush, who slashed taxes and fought wars abroad while presiding over large domestic spending increases. Obama, another Democrat, ran deficits high at the start of his presidency to address a deep recession, then trimmed them in his final years in office as the economy picked up.\n\nNow, neither party shows any interest in offering detailed policies to tackle the debt in the 2020 campaign, preferring to focus on healthcare, immigration, and climate change. Maya MacGuineas, head of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group focused on budget reform, described this era as \"an era of hyper-partisanship with both parties engaging in free lunchism to try to appeal to voters.\"\n\nLast year, the House of Representatives and Senate formed a special bipartisan panel to examine ways to improve how budgets are written. However, it failed to make any recommendations, and its operating expenses added about $500,000 to the national debt.",
    " Title: Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber's Resignation: A Tale of Hubris and a Greek Tragedy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber, who has been in office for an unprecedented four terms, finds himself in the midst of a political scandal that has echoes of a Greek tragedy. The governor's decision to resign and subsequent change of mind, followed by a state investigation, has left Oregon political observers questioning the hubris that may have clouded his judgment.\n\nJake Weigler, an Oregon Democratic strategist, draws a parallel between Kitzhaber's current predicament and the failure of the state's healthcare exchange website under the Affordable Care Act. \"It was audacious and big and bold\u2014and it fell on its face,\" he noted, referring to the healthcare exchange.\n\nWeigler further compares Kitzhaber's administration's approach to policy-making, suggesting that the governor's assertive and aggressive style, while effective in setting the conversation across the state, may have lacked the necessary caution.\n\nThe root of the scandal appears to be the governor's relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, Cylvia Hayes, who has been linked to Kitzhaber since his 2002 campaign. Their relationship, which began in August, has been a source of scrutiny and headaches for the governor due to Hayes' private consulting work during his 2010 campaign and her subsequent advisory role in energy policy.\n\nRecent developments have seen Hayes advising Kitzhaber and state employees on energy policy while being paid by a group advocating for specific policies. Additionally, she has not disclosed some of her income from the state, and the governor reportedly tried to erase his personal emails from public records, raising further questions about the situation.\n\nThese developments have led to a criminal investigation by the state Attorney General and an FBI investigation as well. Despite the scandal breaking last October, Kitzhaber managed to secure reelection. However, the situation reached a tipping point when it threatened to undermine the Oregon legislature's agenda.\n\nFew lawmakers were willing to work with Kitzhaber going forward, and Democrats do not want to \"tarnish an agenda\" that had wide support in the legislature by keeping it pinned to a scandal-marred governor. State Sen. Elizabeth Steiner Hayward, who called the saga a \"Greek tragedy,\" expressed concern that it would sink the governor's legacy.\n\nDemocrats, largely united in calling for Kitzhaber's resignation, believe that the state will be in good hands if he steps down. His successor, Secretary of State Kate Brown, is seen as more of a Democratic loyalist than Kitzhaber. She will also make history as the nation's first openly bisexual governor.\n\nChad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, praises Brown, saying, \"While she'll make history as the nation's first sitting LGBT governor, the more important truth is that she's supremely capable of leading the state to better days ahead.\"",
    " Title: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina Exit 2016 Presidential Race After New Hampshire Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint announcement on Wednesday, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former HP executive Carly Fiorina suspended their respective Republican presidential bids following a disappointing performance in the New Hampshire primary. The two candidates, who were once considered promising contenders, have now exited the race, leaving a still-crowded GOP field to vie for their support.\n\nAccording to sources, Christie gathered his campaign team in Morristown, New Jersey, and held a conference call to announce his decision. The announcement was expected after Christie returned home following his sixth-place finish in the primary contest. Fiorina, who finished seventh, also announced her withdrawal from the race.\n\nIn a statement on Facebook, Christie expressed his commitment to the principles he campaigned on, stating, \"I ran for president to say that the government needs to once again work for the people, not the people work for the government.\" He added, \"I leave the race without an ounce of regret.\"\n\nFiorina, the only female GOP candidate in the 2016 race, announced her decision in a written statement, stating, \"While I suspend my candidacy today, I will continue to travel this country and fight for those Americans who refuse to settle for the way things are and a status quo that no longer works for them.\"\n\nChristie's campaign was marked by the George Washington Bridge scandal, which tarnished his political image. Despite his efforts to focus on drug addiction, a major issue in New Hampshire, voters gravitated more toward Ohio Governor John Kasich, who finished second in the primary. Trump and Texas Senator Ted Cruz finished first and third, respectively, followed by Christie, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio.\n\nFiorina's political career began in 2010 when she ran for Senate in California and lost to incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer by 10 points. Throughout her presidential bid, Fiorina emphasized her business experience, having started her career as a secretary, earned an MBA, and worked her way up at AT&T to become a senior executive at the telecom giant. However, she was also dogged by questions about her record at Hewlett-Packard, where she was hired as CEO in 1999 and was eventually fired six years later after leading a major merger with Compaq and laying off 30,000 workers.\n\nWith the exit of Christie and Fiorina, the Republican primary race continues to heat up as the remaining candidates vie for the party's nomination.",
    " Title: Sen. Lindsey Graham Criticizes Current Background Check System, Questions Democratic Push for Expansion\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on CNN's State of the Union, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) voiced his opposition to Democratic efforts to pass new gun-control bills, particularly those that expand background checks. Graham argued that the current system is broken and needs improvement before any expansion should be considered.\n\nGraham pointed out that in 2020, approximately 76,000 individuals who failed a background check were not prosecuted, and in 2010, around 9,000 felons who failed a background check were also not prosecuted. He emphasized the need to address the existing system before moving forward with new legislation.\n\nThe senator also stated that the current proposals would not have prevented the Sandy Hook massacre, as the shooter did not fail a background check. Furthermore, Graham declared that he would not join the five Senate Republicans who have pledged to filibuster any legislation that infringes on the Second Amendment, provided that alternative amendments are allowed.\n\nSenate Democrats have shifted their focus to background checks since bans on semi-automatic weapons are no longer a priority. New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that background checks are the \"sweet spot\" because they would do a significant amount of good and have a good chance of passing. Schumer is working with both Democrats and Republicans to create a background check bill that would be acceptable to 60 senators and effectively address gun violence.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid is expected to bring legislation to the floor next month. The debate on gun control and the future of gun legislation in the United States continues as both parties grapple with finding a solution that addresses gun violence while respecting the Second Amendment.",
    " Title: U.S. International Trade Commission Reports Positive, Yet Modest, Economic Impact of Trans-Pacific Partnership\n\nThe U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has released a report stating that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would have a positive, yet modest, impact on the U.S. economy. The report predicts that TPP would increase real GDP by nearly $43 billion annually by 2032 and support an additional 128,000 full-time jobs.\n\nAccording to the ITC, the agriculture and food sector would see the most significant gains, with a $10 billion boost, or 0.5 percent, by the 15th year of the deal. On the other hand, the manufacturing, natural resources, and energy sectors would collectively lose $10 billion, or 0.1 percent, after 15 years.\n\nThe ITC was asked by Congress to assess the economic impact of the proposed trade deal involving the United States and 11 other countries. President Obama strongly supports the pact and signed it in February, but the deal is currently on hold without congressional approval.\n\nThe TPP is intended to open markets for U.S. exporters and farmers, protect intellectual property, and strengthen the U.S. political position in Asia. President Obama has stated that TPP allows the U.S. to write the rules of the road in the 21st century, which is especially important in a region as dynamic as the Asia-Pacific.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees with the ITC's findings. Lori Wallach of Public Citizen argues that the pact could have disastrous effects for most Americans' jobs and wages. Wallach states that the report's findings are based on the same widely criticized methodology and unrealistic assumptions that have resulted in past ITC reports systematically overstating the benefits from trade deals that ended up causing serious damage.\n\nIn the past, trade deals have been a contentious issue, with critics fearing massive job losses and supporters predicting large economic gains. The Congressional Research Service found that the net overall effect of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on the U.S. economy was relatively modest, with neither the predicted job losses nor the large economic gains materializing.\n\nThe ITC report's forecast for TPP's impact won't be known for a long time, as the proposed trade deal could take anywhere from five to 30 years to come into effect. The TPP is expected to bring about small changes gradually over a long period.\n\nTrade has become a central issue in this year's election cycle, with candidates such as Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders expressing strong opposition to the TPP. The outcome of the TPP's impact remains to be seen, and the debate over its benefits and drawbacks will likely continue.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Hints at 2016 Presidential Run in Iowa, Leaves Decision Unclear\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton, a frontrunner in many early presidential polls, made a return to Iowa on Sunday, a state she last visited in 2008 during her unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination. The former Secretary of State, who has not yet announced her intentions for the 2016 presidential race, appeared alongside her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at the annual steak fry event hosted by U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin.\n\nThe event, a must-attend for state Democratic activists, provided little insight into Clinton's presidential plans, but did not dampen the widespread belief that she will indeed run. The gathering, held in Indianola on a beautiful September day, was Harkin's last, as he is retiring after five terms.\n\nCindy Pollard, a 57-year-old who served as a precinct captain for Clinton in 2008, was among the enthusiastic crowd. \"I was a precinct captain for Hillary. I've been decided,\" Pollard said.\n\nClinton's speech, following speeches by Iowa Democrats running for U.S. Senate, House seats, and governor, was filled with subtle hints about her potential candidacy. She mentioned her new memoir, \"Hard Choices,\" and said, \"There are many more chapters to be written in the amazing life of Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nAs the crowd chanted her name, Clinton playfully acknowledged the elephant in the room. \"It is true I am thinking about it,\" she said, referring to a potential presidential run, but added, \"for today that is not why I'm here.\"\n\nThe crowd, which included potential voters like Linda Dedecker, an accountant from Ames, and Karen Hill of Marshalltown, seemed to take Clinton's ambiguity in stride. Dedecker, who was wearing a Clinton button, said, \"I'm considering her,\" but added, \"I don't know who else is going to run.\"\n\nClinton's return to Iowa, a state where she finished third in the 2008 caucuses, was a reminder of the importance of understanding the state's unique caucus system. Some, like Hill, offered advice for Clinton's 2016 campaign: \"Don't take anything for granted\u2014come and hang out with us for a while.\"\n\nThe event also saw a push for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to enter the race as a progressive alternative to Clinton. One Warren supporter emphasized the importance of not anointing Clinton so early, before any official declarations of candidacy. Clinton's appearance in Iowa, while not revealing her decision, has certainly kept the speculation about her presidential plans alive.",
    " Title: President Trump Calls for Border Legislation, Cites Immigration Crisis and DACA\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Monday, President Donald Trump reiterated his stance on the country's immigration policies, criticizing Democrats for failing to reach a deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the ongoing immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe President stated, \"Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large 'Caravans' of people enter their country. They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don't allow them to do their job. Act now Congress, our country is being stolen!\"\n\nTrump also expressed his view on DACA, stating, \"DACA is dead because the Democrats didn't care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!\"\n\nThese comments follow threats Trump made Sunday on Twitter that there would be \"NO MORE DACA DEAL.\" The messages come after a report revealed photos of more than 1,000 migrants from Central America heading through the streets of Mexico on their way to the United States, with Mexican immigration officials doing nothing to stop the flow.",
    " Title: GOP Candidates intensify efforts to outmaneuver each other ahead of Super Tuesday\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Republican primary race heats up, Donald Trump's rivals are making a last-ditch effort to undermine each other in a bid to boost their own chances before Super Tuesday. The goal is to secure a viable challenge against the billionaire front-runner, who has won three consecutive contests so far.\n\nAhead of Thursday's crucial debate in Houston, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich have all claimed to be the only candidate capable of derailing Trump. Ben Carson, who has lagged behind in previous contests, has chosen a different approach, characterizing his distant finishes as evidence that \"things are starting to happen.\"\n\nOhio Governor John Kasich's campaign, despite poor performances in South Carolina and Nevada, issued a defiant call on Thursday for Rubio to withdraw from the race. Kasich's spokesman, Chris Schrimpf, tweeted, \"@ JohnKasich is the ONLY candidate who can beat @ realDonaldTrump on 3/15. @ marcorubio needs to do the right thing & suspend campaign.\"\n\nRubio, who has yet to win a primary contest but has been steadily gaining endorsements, has been positioning himself as the best candidate to win a general election in November and take on Trump. During a forum with host Megyn Kelly on Wednesday, Rubio acknowledged that Trump is the frontrunner but emphasized, \"I've been an underdog my entire life.\"\n\nThe candidates will face off in Thursday's debate, a potential final opportunity to define themselves as the anti-Trump candidate before the more than a dozen states holding contests on Super Tuesday. A near-sweep by Trump on Tuesday would be detrimental for the remaining candidates.\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz argued on Wednesday that he, not anyone else, is the best alternative candidate, as he is the only other candidate who has won a primary contest, the Iowa caucuses. Cruz stated, \"My campaign is the only campaign that can beat Donald [Trump] and has beaten Donald.\"\n\nTrump, however, has consistently argued that if other candidates drop out, their support would not necessarily gravitate to the other non-Trump candidates. Trump contends that he would also pick up some of that support.\n\nLarry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, supports Trump's view, stating, \"Trump will get a share. He might not get a majority, but he'll get a share.\"\n\nThe pressure is most intense on candidates Kasich and Ben Carson, whose campaigns have struggled in the polls and performed poorly in the first four contests. Carson, despite a fourth-place finish in Nevada, declared to supporters that \"things are starting to happen.\"\n\nCarson seemed to acknowledge the pressure in a fundraising email on Wednesday, stating, \"Without a strong showing on Super Tuesday, it's going to be very tough for my campaign. That's the honest truth.\"\n\nKasich, however, told reporters that \"the people calling for me to get out are the people who are inside the Beltway... I'm certainly not listening to a bunch of lobbyist insiders.\"",

Denny Heck Announces Retirement, Leaving Vacancy in Democratic-Leaning Washington District\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heartfelt statement, U.S. Representative Denny Heck (D-WA) announced his retirement from Congress, citing his disillusionment with the political process following the impeachment inquiry and the investigation into Russian election interference.\n\nHeck, who has served in Congress since 2013, expressed his disappointment in the actions of some of his colleagues, stating, \"I will never understand how some of my colleagues, in many ways good people, could ignore or deny the president\u2019s unrelenting attack on a free press, his vicious character assassination of anyone who disagreed with him, and his demonstrably very distant relationship with the truth.\"\n\nHeck, a Washington state native, served a decade in the state House, beginning with his election in 1976. He also served as chief of staff to then-Washington Governor Booth Gardner during Gardner's second term in Olympia. He first ran for Congress in 2010, losing to now-Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-WA). Two years later, he won a different seat created by the post-2010 redistricting.\n\nIn Congress, Heck led recruitment efforts for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) for the past two cycles, personally drafting many of the newly elected Democratic freshman members, including Reps. Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) and Susie Lee (D-NV).\n\nHe ran unsuccessfully last year to serve as chairman of the committee, losing a four-way race to Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-IL).\n\nWashington's 10th District, which Heck represented, is a Democratic-leaning territory. Heck won reelection last year with 62 percent of the vote, and Hillary Clinton carried the district by an 11-point margin in 2016.\n\nHeck's retirement will likely result in a crowded field of candidates vying to succeed him. Under Washington's top-two primary system, all candidates will run together on the same ballot, regardless of party, in the Aug. 4 primary, with the top two finishers advancing to a head-to-head general election.\n\nPossible Democratic candidates for the seat include Olympia Mayor Cheryl Selby, Phil Gardner, Heck's district director, state Reps. Beth Doglio, Christine Kilduff, and Mari Leavitt. Heck already had a Democratic challenger next year: truck driver Joshua Collins.",
    " Title: Pope Francis' U.S. Visit: A Week of Controversy, Political Maneuvers, and Religious Freedom Debates\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Pope Francis embarks on his highly anticipated visit to the United States, the week ahead promises a whirlwind of events, political maneuvers, and contentious debates on religious freedom and social issues.\n\nFrom the streets of Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City, to the halls of Congress and the United Nations, the pontiff's visit is set to be a memorable one, not just for the religious ceremonies, but also for the political and social undercurrents that will surface.\n\nIn Cuba, the pope was given a warm send-off by Fidel and Raul Castro, with the brothers expressing their solidarity and shared political ideologies. The pope's denunciation of capitalism and America's economic system has been welcomed by the Castro brothers, who view it as a softening of President Obama's stance on the Cuban embargo.\n\nIn Washington D.C., the pope is expected to address a joint session of Congress, where he may face a boycott from some Catholic members due to disagreements on religious liberty and abortion issues. The White House, in turn, has been criticized for snubbing representatives of the anti-abortion movement, a cause of high priority for American bishops.\n\nIn New York City, the pope will visit the United Nations, where he may hear a reprise of Marxist bloviation. The pope's visit to Philadelphia will culminate in a speech at the Independence National Historical Park, where he can deliver his final thoughts on the issues at hand.\n\nThroughout his visit, the pope is expected to navigate a complex web of political and social issues, from capitalism and social justice to religious freedom and abortion. His actions and words will be closely watched by Catholics, Protestants, and political leaders alike, making this a week that will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact on the religious and political landscape of the United States.\n\nWesley Pruden, editor in chief emeritus of The Washington Times, aptly sums up the week ahead as a \"busy week\" for the pope, filled with \"crosstown traffic in the chaos\" that will be his most memorable gift to the tale of three cities.",
    " Title: The Debate Over the Iran Nuclear Deal: A Look at the Prospects of a \"Better Deal\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Iran nuclear deal is being debated in Congress, with a September vote looming, the option of rejecting the current deal in favor of a \"better deal\" is gaining traction. On Wednesday, Rep. Grace Meng (D-NY) announced her opposition to the deal, stating that \"the world could and should have a better deal.\" However, the likelihood of renegotiating and toughening the deal if Congress rejects it and overcomes a presidential veto is a contentious issue.\n\nThe debate centers on the perception of Iran and whether the United States should be entangled in such a complex deal, and whether Iran should be allowed to possess any uranium enrichment program at all. Critics of the Iran deal argue that there is historical precedent for renegotiating and amending international agreements, and that Iran is so intent on getting a deal with the US that Tehran could be brought back to the negotiating table after a congressional rejection.\n\nMark Dubowitz, an international sanctions expert and executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) in Washington, says, \"Congress should require the administration to renegotiate certain terms of the proposed [deal] and resubmit the amended agreement to Congress.\" He cites nearly 80 multilateral agreements that Congress has either rejected or for which it has required amendments.\n\nHowever, senior administration officials involved in the Iran negotiations say there is no chance the deal could be renegotiated, and they warn that rejection of the deal would likely result in a ramped-up uranium enrichment program, shrinking \"breakout\" time for Iran to rush to produce a nuclear weapon if it chose to. Secretary of State John Kerry called the prospect of a \"better deal\" a \"fantasy.\"\n\nNonproliferation experts echo this position, saying the Iranian nuclear program was already too advanced years ago to reduce it any more than what the deal reached on July 14 does. Jeffrey Lewis, director of nonproliferation studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, Calif., says, \"The most important thing now is to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon in the next 10 to 15 years, and this deal does that.\"\n\nOthers are less certain the deal blocks Iran's paths to a nuclear weapon, but they believe a renegotiated deal could. FDD's Mr. Dubowitz sees three different directions the Iran nuclear issue could take if Congress rejects the current deal and holds out for an agreement \"renegotiated on better terms.\" However, many regional experts say that prospects for wooing European allies to join the US in pressing for a tougher deal, if Congress rejects the one now before it, are dim.\n\nLooming large over the calls for a return to negotiations are strong suspicions on the part of deal supporters that the \"better deal\" advocates really have no interest in a stronger deal at all, but instead want to thwart any US agreement with the Iranian government. \"We had a 'better deal' in Iraq after 1991 [following the Gulf War], there were no restrictions, inspectors could go where they wanted when they wanted, and that deal wasn't good enough,\" says Dr. Lewis, adding that \"we still went to war. So really I don't believe them when they say they just want a 'better deal' this time.\"\n\nDoubters of the sincerity of the seekers of a \"better deal\" say it's telling to note that the sponsor of the TV ad campaign demanding a better deal is a group called Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran, which is backed by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel organization lobbying Congress hard for the deal's defeat. \"There really is no 'better deal' for [such critics] in the sense of an agreement that leaves any nuclear program in the hands of the current Iranian government,\" Lewis says. \"Any deal is bad because it means living with the Islamic Republic.\"",
    " Title: Study Reveals Higher Lead Levels in American Children with Private Well Water Sources\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has found that American children whose homes rely on private wells for drinking water are 25 percent more likely to have high lead levels in their blood than those with access to regulated community water services. The research, which is the first to specifically analyze lead exposure in children who rely on private wells, highlights the need for an overhaul of the Safe Drinking Water Act to provide support for households relying on private wells.\n\nThe study, conducted by researchers from the Indian University school of public health, examined the water sources and health records from almost 60,000 children in North Carolina. The researchers found that children relying on private wells had blood lead concentrations that were 20 percent higher, on average, than children with community water service.\n\nThe study also found that children living in older, lower-value houses suffered higher lead levels and had higher risks of elevated blood lead, as did those in majority-Black neighborhoods. \"Risks are especially high for children in low-income households and in African American neighborhoods that remain excluded from access to nearby municipal water service\u2014a legacy of discriminatory zoning practices,\" said Jackie MacDonald Gibson, author of the study and chair of the department of environmental and occupational health at the Indian University school of public health.\n\nLead, a heavy metal which has no smell and is invisible to the naked eye, is a suspected carcinogen and highly toxic to the brain and nervous system, as well as most other organs. The water scandal in Flint, Michigan, in 2014 exposed concerns about lead in regulated city drinking water supplies, but little attention has been paid to dangerous contaminants in unregulated private wells which provide drinking water to 42.5 million Americans, the equivalent of 13 percent of the population.\n\nThe increased exposure is probably due to corrosion of indoor plumbing and well components. Private wells are excluded from the Safe Drinking Water Act, which since 1991 has required all community water utilities to monitor lead levels as part of the Lead and Copper Rule provision. This means households with private wells must monitor their own water quality, and, when necessary, replace parts and install and manage their own corrosion-control systems. But it is seldom done, according to Gibson, because lead control requires awareness of the risks, knowledge about testing, and money.\n\n\"This study highlights the need for an overhaul of the Safe Drinking Water Act to provide support for households relying on private wells,\" Gibson said. \"That includes financial support, and education and support on proper testing. No level of lead exposure is safe. This is an issue that must continue to be addressed.\" The increased exposure is linked to reduced IQ, ADHD, school failure, and criminality, according to the CDC.",
    " Title: George Papadopoulos Disputes Jeff Sessions' Testimony on Trump-Putin Summit Prospect\n\nIn a recent interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" George Papadopoulos, the former Trump campaign adviser who was recently sentenced to two weeks in prison for lying to investigators, claimed that Attorney General Jeff Sessions was \"quite enthusiastic\" about the prospect of a summit between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAccording to Papadopoulos, during a roundtable of campaign officials in 2016, he shared his connection that could establish a summit between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. President Trump, then a candidate, reportedly nodded but did not seem committed, while Mr. Sessions seemed \"quite enthusiastic\" about the prospect, according to Papadopoulos.\n\nHowever, Sessions has testified that he pushed back on the idea. Papadopoulos said, \"All I can say is this was a meeting from about two years ago \u2014 my recollection differs from Jeff Sessions'.\"\n\nOn Friday, Papadopoulos was sentenced to two weeks in prison for lying to federal investigators about his contacts with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who supposedly told him in 2016 that Russia had damaging information on Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump's Democratic opponent.\n\nPapadopoulos also said he had no recollection of sending an email about the possible dirt to John Mashburn, a Trump campaign and White House official who has reportedly testified to congressional investigators he thought he got such an alert about possible Clinton dirt from Papadopoulos.\n\n\"If I did send an email, and especially if others were copied on it, I'm sure that evidence would have [been] introduced by now,\" Papadopoulos said. \"If that email was sent, even if I deleted it, if that's what people believe I did, there would be a copy somewhere else.\"\n\nPapadopoulos also expressed uncertainty about whether special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation will reveal actual collusion between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. \"All I can say is that my testimony might have helped move something towards that, but I have no idea,\" he said.\n\nPresident Trump himself has repeatedly said there was \"no collusion.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Presidential Campaigns Adapt to Coronavirus Outbreak: Biden, Sanders, and Trump Shift to Virtual Events and Remote Work\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the campaigns of Democratic candidate Joe Biden and independent candidate Bernie Sanders, as well as the incumbent Republican candidate Donald Trump, have made adjustments to their operations.\n\nBiden, in a sober speech delivered from his home, announced that his campaign would be holding its fundraisers online indefinitely and that staff at its Philadelphia headquarters would work from home starting this weekend. The Sanders campaign, similarly, has instructed all staff to work from home.\n\nThe Trump campaign, while not mandating work-from-home for its employees, is giving them the option to work remotely from March 13-16, as the Arlington, Va. headquarters undergoes sanitization.\n\nField organizing, a crucial aspect of campaigning, has become vastly more complicated due to the outbreak. The Republican National Committee (RNC) has moved its National Week of Training, a nationwide effort to recruit and activate supporters, to online and phone-based formats. The committee is also planning an upcoming online training day for volunteers.\n\nThe Trump campaign, known for its digital infrastructure and database of contact information, is betting on its ability to reach key voters online. The reelection effort recently set up a new website, ArmyforTrump.com, designed to serve as an online hub for volunteers.\n\nTim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, stated, \"The Trump campaign is built on data and uses technology to its highest advantages, so is better positioned to virtually engage voters than any other campaign.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign, in its Thursday memo, announced the closure of all field offices to the public and plans to organize voters through phone banking, text messaging, virtual events, and other distributed organizing models. The Sanders campaign, in response to the outbreak, has halted all door-to-door canvasses and is moving to digital formats and outreach wherever possible.\n\nWhile Trump advisers express concerns about the president's response to the coronavirus and its impact on his reelection hopes, they remain relatively optimistic. However, they acknowledge the political danger posed by the spreading virus and the accompanying school and office closures, as well as the loss of life.\n\nBiden is using the crisis as an opportunity to present himself as a steady leader who will return the country to normalcy after a turbulent Trump presidency. During a Thursday speech on the outbreak, Biden charged that \"public fears are being compounded by a pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by his adversarial relationship with the truth.\"\n\nRon Klain, a top Biden campaign adviser who coordinated the Obama administration's response to an Ebola outbreak in late 2014, stated, \"The No. 1 question right now is what's your response to this coronavirus?\"",
    " Title: Trump's Foreign Policy Shift: A New Approach to Iran and Beyond\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant departure from his predecessor's policies, President Donald Trump is pursuing a more confrontational approach to foreign policy, particularly in relation to Iran. This shift, according to sources familiar with the President's thinking, is a reflection of Trump's belief that his personal efforts to negotiate and pressure global rivals can yield results that eluded his predecessors.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump announced the U.S.'s withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, a move that has sparked criticism and concern from European allies and increased tensions in the Middle East. The decision, according to Trump's allies, is part of a broader strategy to dismantle elements of former President Barack Obama's foreign policy agenda and reshape international relations.\n\nMark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who advocated for changes to the Iran deal, described Trump's approach as \"The Art of the Deal\": refusing to be bound by existing agreements that are not in America's interest, exiting or threatening to exit such agreements, and applying maximum pressure to negotiate better terms.\n\nThe potential risks of this approach were evident in the hours following Trump's announcement, as Syrian officials reported Israeli airstrikes on Iranian targets near Damascus, and Israel warned residents in the Golan Heights of potential Iranian attacks, raising fears of escalating conflict in the region.\n\nCritics argue that Trump's approach lacks a clear strategy and could lead to chaos. Former CIA Director and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta stated, \"The result is that he takes steps which create a great deal of chaos without any kind of strategy as to what you do next.\"\n\nTrump's supporters, however, point to the ongoing negotiations with North Korea as evidence of the approach's success. For months, Trump's belligerent rhetoric and threats of military action against North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, have been met with a response: talks between the U.S. and North Korea.\n\nThe administration faces challenges in persuading European allies to cooperate, particularly in light of the U.S.'s withdrawal from the Iran deal. European leaders, led by French President Emmanuel Macron, have distanced themselves from the U.S. decision and vowed to work with Iran to salvage the agreement.\n\nTrump is relying more on Israel and Saudi Arabia, Iran's two main regional adversaries, to counter Iran's influence. This shift increases the risk of broader regional conflicts, according to some analysts.\n\nWith a revamped national security team, Trump is challenging the status quo, advocating for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan, and moving forward with plans to open the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. The embassy's opening next week marks a significant departure from previous estimates that it might not occur for years.\n\nTrump's approach to foreign policy, some argue, bears similarities to President Ronald Reagan's strategy for confronting the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Reagan's style, while controversial, ultimately led to a historic reduction in nuclear weapons through negotiation.\n\nHowever, there are differences. While Reagan relied on the recommendations of his seasoned national security team, Trump has reportedly chafed at the guidance of his own advisers, leading to a high turnover rate among top officials.\n\nAs Trump continues to implement his foreign policy agenda, the world watches with anticipation and apprehension, awaiting the outcomes of this new approach to international relations.",
    " Title: Republican Tax Policy Makers Unveil Corporate Tax Cut Plan, Avoiding Individual Tax Rate Reduction\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - The Republican \"Big Six\" tax policy makers, led by top Trump administration officials and congressional Republican leaders, are set to release a plan on Wednesday that aims to reduce corporate tax rates, while avoiding a reduction in the top individual tax rate of 39.6 percent.\n\nThe \"Big Six,\" which includes Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, and two tax committee chairmen, have been working on the plan for months. However, they are still undecided on key issues, such as whether to allow businesses to write off new investments immediately, how to lower tax rates for small businesses, and whether to cut middle-class taxes by doubling the standard deduction for individuals and families.\n\nUnder pressure from corporate America, the team is expected to call for a corporate income tax target rate within a range of 18-23 percent, down from the current rate of 35 percent. The Big Six is expected to refrain from cutting the top individual tax rate, a move that many Republicans in the House of Representatives could find difficult to accept.\n\n\"They're not going to cut the highest income tax rate. They're not,\" predicted Stephen Moore, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank who helped write Trump's campaign tax plan.\n\nOverhauling the tax code was a key pledge for Trump in his 2016 presidential campaign. However, after eight months in office, he has made only limited progress. Washington has achieved no major tax overhaul since 1986.\n\nTrump portrays lower corporate taxes as a boon to workers, saying they would lead to more jobs and higher salaries. A rate cut on corporate profits could also be used to benefit shareholders and offer up more executive bonuses, however.\n\nSenator Ron Wyden, top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said this week that the leaked details of the Big Six meetings paint a picture of an unprecedented tax giveaway for the most fortunate and biggest corporations.\n\nLobbyists said they do not expect the Big Six to offer many details about the tax loopholes and deductions that could be eliminated to help pay for tax cuts. Instead, the plan is expected to focus on lowering corporate tax rates and simplifying the tax code.\n\nThe Big Six is also expected to address the estimated $2.6 trillion in U.S. corporate profits held overseas by requiring companies to bring the money home at rates of 3.5 percent for reinvested profits and 8.75 percent for on cash and equivalents. To offset lost revenue, the Trump administration plans to forecast a flood of new tax revenue in coming years, based on aggressive assumptions of tax-fueled economic expansion.\n\nHowever, Senate Republicans have shown signs of moving away from such \"dynamic\" scoring of any tax legislation impact. Two senators, including a prominent fiscal hawk, agreed this week to a \"static\" score that could allow tax reform to lose up to $1.5 trillion over the next decade. Senate Republicans are also likely to avoid budget baseline changes to generate savings for tax reform on paper, which could well mean the Big Six plan would balloon the federal budget deficit.\n\n\"Without those, the price goes up. There's no other way to look at it,\" said John Gimigliano, a former House Ways and Means Committee tax counsel who leads federal legislative and regulatory services at KPMG LLP.",
    " Title: The Historical Precedent of Military Appointments in U.S. Administration and the Trump Administration's Nominees\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent appointments of retired military generals to cabinet-level positions in the Trump Administration has sparked controversy, with critics labeling it as a \"militarization\" of the government. However, a closer look at history reveals that choosing military men for top positions is not unprecedented, nor is it necessarily a cause for concern.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's nominees for national security adviser, defense secretary, and secretary of homeland security are all retired generals: Michael Flynn, James Mattis, and John Kelly, respectively. High-ranking officers such as General David Petraeus and Admiral Michael Rogers have also been rumored for other positions in the Trump administration.\n\nThese nominees are not only retired but also seasoned veterans with extensive experience in managing thousands of soldiers and interacting with key leaders worldwide. The criticism of the Flynn, Mattis, and Kelly nominations is largely politically motivated, similar to past partisan frenzies over issues such as the \"war on women\" or the \"climate of hate.\"\n\nComparing the scrutiny of these nominees to those with backgrounds in banking, politics, or law is unwarranted. In the past, presidents have appointed retired military personnel to cabinet positions or high-ranking positions in their administrations. For instance, Barack Obama appointed five retired generals and one retired admiral to either Cabinet posts or high-ranking positions in his administration.\n\nUnder Obama, General David Petraeus became CIA director, while Michael Flynn served as Obama's director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Retired general Eric Shinseki was head of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and retired general James Jones was national security adviser. Retired admiral Dennis Blair and retired general James Clapper served as successive directors of national intelligence.\n\nHistorically, retired generals and admirals have served in the executive branch, with President Harry Truman appointing General George Marshall (of Marshall Plan fame) as secretary of state and later secretary of defense. General Omar Bradley was head of the Veterans Administration while still on active duty. Dwight Eisenhower, without prior elected office, proved a most-effective Republican president.\n\nThe chief complaint about Trump's appointments is that too many generals will mean too great a likelihood of war. However, historical evidence points to the opposite conclusion. Generals were not the proverbial \"best and brightest\" who argued for military intervention in Vietnam, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, or the bombing of Libya in 2011.\n\nIn fact, retired generals and flag officers have traditionally been against sending their own troops into what they see as optional wars abroad. Their occasional harangues about building up military power are predicated on notions of peace-through-strength deterrence: The more powerful the military is perceived abroad, the less likely it will be needed to be used.\n\nConversely, the reliance on ex-senators and politicians with law degrees to fill important executive positions, despite their lack of outside-the-Beltway administrative experience, is a more significant concern. In 2008, Obama's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 consisted mainly of having been a Harvard Law School grad and, briefly, a U.S. senator. As a result, he looked to people with similar backgrounds for some key appointments, such as former senator and lawyer Joe Biden as vice president, former senator and lawyer Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, and later, former senator and lawyer John Kerry as secretary of state.\n\nThe current state of affairs, from the collapse of several Middle Eastern nations to the failed reset with Russia to the outrageous Iran deal, is not evidence of success at the State Department. An Obama appointee with a similar background, former senator and lawyer Ken Salazar, was not an especially successful secretary of the interior.\n\nLawyers, Ivy League graduates, and former politicians usually dominate presidential appointments. How have these stereotypical profiles worked out? We are currently nearing $20 trillion in national debt, stagnating under nonexistent economic growth and near-zero interest rates, and suffering from record labor nonparticipation rates. We are seeing a failed health-care system, a discredited IRS and VA, and the worst racial relations in half a century. Generals did not compile that record. Lawyers and lifetime Washington politicians did.",
    " Title: Democratic Political Group Launches Ad Campaign Questioning Bernie Sanders' Electability and Health in Nevada\n\nArticle:\n\nA political action committee (PAC) affiliated with the Democratic Party has initiated a new ad campaign in Nevada, targeting presidential candidate Bernie Sanders' electability and health ahead of the state's presidential nominating caucuses on February 22.\n\nThe Democratic Majority for Israel PAC (DMFI) has reportedly purchased over $175,000 worth of cable and network ad time this week, according to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filings. The ads are set to air for a week, starting this Saturday.\n\nThe exact extent of DMFI's Nevada ad buy was not immediately available, as the group had not yet filed an independent expenditure report with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as of Friday morning. However, FCC filings suggest the total size of the buy exceeds $175,000.\n\nIn the run-up to the Iowa caucuses earlier this month, DMFI aired an ad that questioned Sanders' ability to win a general election and raised concerns about the Vermont senator's health. A woman featured in the ad stated, \"I do have some concerns about Bernie Sanders' health, considering he did have a heart attack.\"\n\nMark Mellman, a Democratic consultant who runs DMFI PAC, declined to provide specifics about the Nevada ad, stating only that it would differ from the Iowa ad.\n\nDMFI's funding primarily comes from a few high-dollar donors. Stacy Schusterman, a Tulsa oil and gas heiress, donated nearly $1 million to DMFI PAC in December, according to FEC records. The group also received $495,000 from venture capitalist Mark Gary Lauder.\n\nThe new ad campaign against Sanders comes as he attempts to gain ground in the race for Democratic delegates in the third presidential nominating contest. Sanders trails former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg by two delegates despite strong performances in both Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nDMFI's plans for a Nevada offensive against Sanders were first reported by Mediaite. FCC filings posted on the agency's website on Wednesday and Thursday show DMFI has purchased ad time on broadcast stations in Las Vegas and Reno, as well as various statewide cable programs.",
    " Title: U.S. Court of Appeals Orders Judge to Respond to Michael Flynn's Request to Dismiss Charges\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has instructed the judge presiding over the criminal case against former President Donald Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn to respond to a petition in which Flynn's lawyers are seeking to force the judge to grant a Justice Department request to dismiss the case.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals, in a move that could potentially expedite the legal process, has given District Judge Emmet Sullivan 10 days to respond to an emergency petition filed by Flynn's lawyers seeking to compel Sullivan to dismiss the charges.\n\nThe Department of Justice, in a significant reversal on May 7, asked Sullivan to drop the charges, drawing criticism from Democrats and retired career prosecutors who accuse Attorney General William Barr of politicizing the U.S. criminal justice system to go easy on Trump's friends and associates.\n\nA retired Army lieutenant general who also advised Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russia's U.S. ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the weeks before Trump took office. Flynn, charged as part of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that documented Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election to boost Trump's candidacy, later sought to withdraw his plea and accused the FBI of deceiving him. The Department of Justice's decision to ask Sullivan to drop the charges followed public pressure from Trump and the Republican president's political allies.\n\nSullivan, in a previous ruling, signaled reluctance to drop the charges, appointing a retired judge to advise whether Flynn should face an additional criminal contempt charge for perjury. Sullivan has scheduled an in-person court hearing in the case for July 16.\n\nFlynn served as national security adviser in the first weeks of Trump's presidency before being fired for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his dealings with Kislyak.",
    " Title: A Reassessment of U.S. Policy Towards Syria: Letting Assad Win Could Have Prevented the Current Chaos\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of recent terrorist attacks in various cities worldwide, the focus has been on Syria as the root cause of the ongoing instability in the region. A common narrative suggests that if the United States had taken a more active role in Syria's civil war, the Islamic State (ISIL) might not have gained traction, and the scale of the war might have been significantly smaller. However, a closer examination of the situation reveals that this conventional wisdom is flawed.\n\nThis article argues that providing lethal aid early in the conflict would have exacerbated the situation, accelerating the war rather than slowing it. A more effective policy could have prevented the chaos now engulfing the region. The U.S. and its partners should have allowed Assad to win.\n\nSeveral key points are worth considering when examining the origins of the Syrian civil war. First, the moderate opposition was weak, with limited resources and combat experience. While there were Syrians who peacefully protested and hoped for a secular alternative to Assad, they were no match for a well-trained Syrian army supported by Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah.\n\nSecond, the opposition was disorganized and lacked coherent leadership. While names like Assad, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and Abu Mohammad al-Julani are familiar, few can name leaders within the moderate Syrian opposition, such as the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian National Coalition.\n\nThird, Assad and his allies had a clear objective: maintain power. Syria's allies were unburdened by the regime's atrocities, as they had a vested interest in the outcome. In contrast, the U.S. found itself in a catch-22, as attacking Assad would help extremist rebels, while attacking extremist rebels would help Assad. Unwilling to back either party and without a viable alternative, the U.S. had no clear goal or strategy.\n\nIn this context, Washington chose a third way. When President Obama called on Assad to step down in August 2011, the U.S. invested in the dictator's defeat without implementing policies to facilitate that outcome. The possibility of Assad winning the war outright was no longer an option, and U.S. acquiescence to a political solution in which Assad remained became increasingly difficult.\n\nTo address the situation, the U.S. imposed additional sanctions on the Syrian government, froze Syrian assets under U.S. control, prohibited commercial ties with Damascus, and blocked the import of Syrian oil. The U.S. also established supply routes, funneled money, intelligence, and non-lethal aid to handpicked rebels, many of whom later switched sides. Physical supplies included communications equipment, night vision goggles, bulletproof vests, pickup trucks, food, medicine, and more.\n\nHowever, these actions did little to prevent Assad's victory or end the war. Instead, they inadvertently fueled the conflict, allowing extremist elements to gain strength and attract recruits from around the world. By doing enough to avoid accusations of inaction, the U.S. poured fuel on a fire that might have extinguished itself, and watched as others poured on more.\n\nIn conclusion, the main problem with U.S. policy towards Syria is not that the administration did too little early in the conflict. It is that the administration did too much. If the U.S. and its partners had not intervened, Assad would have likely stamped out the civil war before it began. A brutal dictator would have retained control of his country, but the death toll would be lower, Syria would be more stable, the refugee crisis might not have happened, and ISIL might never have taken its current form. When we look at Iraq and Libya, we see obvious examples of the unintended consequences of intervention. We should see that when we look at Syria, too.\n\nSeth Cantey is an assistant professor of politics at Washington & Lee University with a focus on international security, American foreign policy, and Middle East politics.\n\nTo read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers, go to the Opinion front page, follow us on Twitter @USATOpinion, and sign up for our daily Opinion newsletter.",
    " Title: North Dakota Senators Heitkamp and Cramer Emphasize Civility in Final Debate Ahead of Midterms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a display of political unity amidst a divisive political climate, North Dakota Senators Heidi Heitkamp and Kevin Cramer, who are running against each other in the upcoming midterm elections, agreed on the need for more civility in American politics during their final debate on Thursday. The debate took place just hours after the arrest of Cesar Sayoc, a pro-Trump supporter, for sending dangerous packages to CNN and Democratic leaders who have criticized President Trump.\n\nBoth candidates acknowledged that no one is to blame for Sayoc's actions other than himself. This harmony comes after critics have accused President Trump of using divisive rhetoric, which some believe sparked one of his supporters to terrorize the nation this week.\n\nSen.

Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican who was shot and wounded by a left-wing partisan last year, speaking in the aftermath of the attack. \"He never once mentioned Democratic politics,\" Ms. Heitkamp said. \"Looking at that as an example, the message couldn't be clearer\u2014we all need to quit blaming. There is only one person responsible here,\" she said.\n\nBoth candidates agreed that everyone should be accountable for their words, with Rep. Cramer, a Trump-ally, stating that debates, like the one they held Thursday, are an opportunity to celebrate political civility. \"Let's look to North Dakota as an example,\" he said.\n\nThe two have been in a fierce race, with Sen. Heitkamp trying to hold onto her seat in the U.S. Senate this November in a state where President Trump won by 36 points. However, she has seen her poll numbers sink after voting against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. In a poll released this week, she is behind Rep. Cramer by 16 points, a significant increase from the four-point deficit she had prior to her vote against the president's high court pick.\n\nDespite the setback, Sen. Heitkamp's campaign has received more than $12 million in donations during the first two weeks of October, the majority of which came from individual donors, according to a recent filing with the Federal Elections Commission. Former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the bomber's targets earlier this week, is heading to campaign for Sen. Heitkamp, kicking off her statewide tour in Fargo next week.\n\nBoth lawmakers agreed on the need for a border wall and increased security to deter illegal immigrants from entering the country, as thousands of migrants from Central America are heading to the border through a caravan. \"We can not leave our borders unprotected. The rule of law has to be imposed\u2014if there is 4,000 today, there will be a million tomorrow,\" Ms. Heitkamp said, separating herself from many of her Democratic colleagues who have balked at a wall along the southern border.\n\nBoth lawmakers also saw eye to eye on the Paris Climate Accord, disagreeing with President Trump's decision to pull out of the agreement. However, they sparred over the Affordable Care Act and whether to fix the law as it exists, or to repeal and replace it entirely. Rep. Cramer said money should go to the states, where they can provide better health care options for constituents, while Sen. Heitkamp said not to throw the baby out with the bath water\u2014and instead, fix areas of the healthcare law which aren't working.",
    " Title: AFL-CIO President Warns Hillary Clinton of Political Consequences Over Pacific Trade Pact Support\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark warning to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the head of the nation's most powerful labor union, Richard Trumka, has vowed to defeat President Obama's key trade legislation in the House next month. Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, predicted that no more than 20 House Democrats would vote for the Trade Promotion Authority, a bill that passed the Senate on Friday.\n\nThe labor leader's comments, made in an interview with Capital Download, indicate a growing rift between the Democratic president and the country's biggest labor federation over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade deal among the United States and 12 other Pacific Rim nations. The TPP requires Congress to approve or reject the agreement without amendments.\n\nMany labor unions have frozen campaign donations as they lobby against the legislation. The battle between the Democratic president and the AFL-CIO underscores the complex politics of Obama's attempts to pass legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress during the final two years of his tenure. It also exposes challenges ahead for Clinton, who has avoided declaring her view of the TPP since becoming a presidential candidate.\n\nTrumka criticized the TPP, stating, \"It's not gold. It's going to cost us jobs and it's going to lower wages in this country.\" He expressed uncertainty about Clinton's stance on the issue, saying, \"She's going to have to answer that.\"\n\nIf Clinton supports the TPP and the fast-track authority, there will be political costs, Trumka cautioned. \"It will be tougher to mobilize working people,\" he said, adding that it would make it more difficult to secure the AFL-CIO's endorsement.\n\nWhen asked whether Obama's presidency had been good for working Americans, Trumka paused before responding, \"The president's been seriously handicapped in his ability to deliver things for the American public, because you've got a determined opposition in the Republican Party that will actually hurt the country to deny him a victory.\"\n\nIn the Senate vote, Trumka was surprised to have lost the support of Democratic senators Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, Chris Coons of Delaware, and Patty Murray of Washington state. When the interviewer commented that it's hard to defeat a president, he replied, \"We'll see.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Executive Order on Immigration: A Political Move Amid Economic Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked debate and controversy, President Donald Trump announced on Monday that he would be signing an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration to the United States in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The order, which is more limited than initially suggested, will halt the issuance of permanent residency visas, or green cards, for 60 days.\n\nUnder the order, the U.S. will not issue green cards to new immigrants, but will not affect temporary workers. There are reported exceptions for workers in \"essential\" professions and family members of U.S. citizens. The full details of the order have yet to be released.\n\nTrump stated that the decision was made to \"protect the jobs\" of Americans amid an unprecedented spike in unemployment caused by lockdown measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. Immigration has already been significantly curtailed during the outbreak due to travel restrictions and a pause in most visa processing procedures.\n\nThe economic impact of the order is a subject of debate among economists. Limiting restrictions to green card applicants, who represent a fraction of the immigrant workforce, may have little to no impact on jobs, many economists say.\n\nTrump's conservative allies argue that the order is a sincere, if limited, attempt to ensure that jobs are reserved for the more than 20 million Americans who have become unemployed since the start of the crisis.\n\nOthers see the order as a political tactic. Cutting immigration was a key element of Trump's platform in the 2016 election. Doubling down on that strategy could serve to invigorate his base supporters and distract from the administration's response to the virus, which has received significant criticism.\n\nSome of the president's liberal critics argue that he is using the crisis as an opportunity to impose an anti-immigrant agenda that has been high on the Republican to-do list since long before the pandemic began.\n\nThe initial 60-day freeze on new green cards could be extended indefinitely depending on economic conditions, Trump said. He also said the administration was considering a \"secondary order\" that could further limit immigration down the road.\n\nThe pandemic has provided an opportunity for Trump to enact his wish list of immigration policies, according to some analysts. White House adviser Stephen Miller has long advocated for shutting down most immigration, legal and illegal. In the coronavirus, he may have found his opening.\n\nOthers argue that Trump is looking for anyone else to blame for the crisis. He has been accused of cycling through scapegoats, including immigrants, public health officials, governors, and the news media, in an attempt to deflect accountability for his administration's response to the pandemic.\n\nThe order's impact on the economy and job market remains to be seen, but it is clear that the pandemic has provided an opportunity for Trump to advance his immigration agenda. Whether this move will ultimately benefit the American people or serve as a political distraction remains to be determined.",
    " Title: Israel's Historic Election Yields No Clear Winner as Netanyahu and Gantz Tie in Seats\n\nArticle:\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 Preliminary vote tallies indicate no clear winner in Israel's historic election, with the incumbent Likud party of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Blue and White party of rival Benny Gantz reportedly tied at 32 seats each. Three surveys also suggest that Netanyahu did not secure enough seats in the Knesset to form a right-wing majority government coalition without Blue and White or Avigdor Liberman's Yisrael Beytenu party.\n\nExit polls on Channel 12 show a dead heat between Likud and the Blue and White party. Official results are not expected to be announced until Wednesday afternoon local time.\n\n\"We're still waiting for the results,\" Netanyahu told supporters early Wednesday morning at the Likud election headquarters in Tel Aviv. \"But one thing is clear, the State of Israel is at a historic turning point. We are facing immense opportunities and immense challenges... including the existential threat from Iran.\"\n\nNetanyahu also stated that Israel will never have a government \"that leans on Arab, anti-Zionist parties.\"\n\n\"We were busy with the campaign for too long,\" Gantz said. \"And with your permission, we will be waiting for another day or two, and we wish the people of Israel a good and desirable unity government.\"\n\nTuesday's election is considered a referendum on Netanyahu, who has served as Israel's longest-running prime minister. This election is unprecedented as it marks the first time Israel has held elections twice in the same year. Netanyahu's Likud party won the election in April, but the prime minister's inability to form a government coalition weeks after the election led millions of Israelis back to the polls on Tuesday.\n\nAfter casting his ballot in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said the vote would be \"very close.\"\n\n\"It's not in the bag,\" he told Israelis in Jerusalem. \"But if you go (vote), we will win.\"\n\nGantz voted in his hometown of Rosh Haayin and urged fellow Israelis to end Netanyahu's long reign as prime minister.\n\n\"We will bring hope, we will bring change, without corruption, without extremism,\" he said.\n\nThere was plenty of drama as Israelis made their way to the polls. Police reported at least 29 arrests and 69 investigations were launched against individuals suspected of voting fraud and other violations. Voting slips were vandalized, several people illegally filmed inside the voting booths, and one man cut the power at a polling site and stole several voting slips. One suspect even threw a firework outside a polling station outside Jerusalem.\n\nIsraeli media also reported that the Blue and White website was shut down due to a cyberattack hours before polls closed. The party said the \"significant cyberattack\" was carried out in a wide-scale operation.\n\n\"Over 500 attempted breaches were detected from various servers abroad,\" the party said.\n\nDespite the drama, both Likud and Blue and White are cautious not to celebrate any perceived victory too early. Party leaders are waiting for the final vote to be counted.\n\nOfficial results will only come out in the next week, and forming a government can take another month or more after that. If no government is formed, Israelis will go to a third round of elections. For now, Israelis are waiting to see if a government is formed and what it will look like.",
    " Title: Beijing Wins Bid for 2022 Winter Olympics in Low-Key Manner\n\nArticle:\n\nChina's capital city, Beijing, has been selected to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in a joint bid with Zhangjiakou, a nearby city known for its ski resorts. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced the decision on Friday, with Beijing beating out the Central Asian city of Almaty, Kazakhstan. This marks the first time a city has hosted both the winter and summer games.\n\nThe announcement was met with a subdued response in Beijing, contrasting the jubilant celebration that followed the city's successful bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics. The low-key reaction is attributed to a variety of factors, including less popularity of winter sports in China, a more restrained publicity campaign, and a diminished sense of significance due to Beijing's previous Olympic hosting experience.\n\nAccording to the Beijing 2022 Bid Book and state media, the total budget for the games is $3.9 billion, with $1.98 billion allocated for operations and $1.92 billion for infrastructure. Notably, the budget does not include a new 108-mile high-speed train line linking Beijing with the mountain venues.\n\nThe games will utilize 12 venues, half of which are recycled from the 2008 Summer Games. The average snow depth at the alpine skiing venue in February is 5.3 inches. Six venues are new, all but one of which are located in the far suburbs of Yanqing or at Zhangjiakou, where the skiing and sledding events will be held.\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics is expected to bring 350 billion yuan (approximately $56.4 billion) in investment, primarily to Zhangjiakou and the surrounding rural areas. A high-speed rail line connecting Beijing to Zhangjiakou is already underway, financed and built by state-run railway engineering companies.\n\nChina's state-run Xinhua News Agency reported in July that the games would generate significant economic benefits, with the investment primarily focused on developing Zhangjiakou and its surrounding areas. The games are seen as an opportunity to cater to China's growing middle class, with the ski resorts outside Zhangjiakou now attracting large numbers of Beijing residents seeking leisure activities.\n\nWhile the 2008 Olympics were marked by tight security measures and a focus on national ambitions, the 2022 games seem to be more focused on addressing the leisure needs of China's prosperous population. As one Zhangjiakou official noted, \"We hope we can meet the needs of this emerging middle class.\"\n\nThe disposable income of greater Beijing's 21 million residents has nearly doubled since 2008, reaching 43,910 yuan per capita last year. Not everyone is a fan of the winter sports, however. Among the thousands of performers organized to watch the IOC ceremony was 21-year-old subway worker Xiao Shuai, who expressed indifference towards winter sports and noted the challenges of traveling to Zhangjiakou for skiing.\n\nOlivia Geng in Beijing and Will Davies in Hong Kong contributed to this article.",
    " Title: Unprecedented Political Shift: Donald Trump's Presidential Victory and the Rural White America Rebellion\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a political landscape that has left many in shock, rural white America has staged an unprecedented rebellion in the 2016 presidential election, propelling billionaire developer Donald Trump to the White House. This unexpected turn of events has overthrown a Washington establishment and challenged a pundit class that, as recently as Tuesday afternoon, believed Hillary Clinton was on the brink of a tight but clear victory.\n\nThe Republican surge, largely unnoticed by polling, has ensured the party's continued control of the House and Senate. \"The polls underestimated two forces \u2013 one was voter discontent and the other was Republicans' loyalty to their party's nominee despite the ambivalence about Trump expressed by GOP leaders,\" says Columbia University political science professor Donald P. Green in an email.\n\nThis election result will lead to at least four years of a Washington dominated by one party, potentially leading to a significant shift in the nation's direction on key issues such as foreign policy, trade, immigration, healthcare, and the environment.\n\nTrump's victory marks a reversal of the narrative of the past few years. Many conservative white voters have felt economically, militarily, and culturally disenfranchised, perceiving the country as slipping away. Now, they have emphatically turned the tables on Democratic voters.\n\nAfter Clinton called Trump to concede the election, he offered her his congratulations for \"a very, very hard-fought campaign.\" He also called for reconciliation, stating it was time to heal the nation's wounds and come together \"as one united people.\"\n\n\"I pledge to every citizen in our land, that I will be president for all Americans,\" he said. \"For those who have chosen not to support me\u2026 I am reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so we can unify our great nation.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen if any party can hold the presidency for three consecutive terms, and this may have played a role in Trump's victory. However, his win seems a foretold story, as his core supporters \u2013 whites without college degrees \u2013 turned out in record numbers and supported him to an unprecedented degree.\n\nThis mixed up the nation's long-standing order of electoral swing states. Trump took Florida and Ohio before midnight, and won the election in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Exurban and rural areas were the Trump heartland, with significant support in places like Newton County, Georgia, about an hour outside of Atlanta.\n\nAl Fortune, a trucking company manager, had a long list of policy issues he expected Trump to address if elected: job creation, conservative healthcare reform, and energy independence from the Middle East. Exit polls on Tuesday night showed Trump winning 80 percent or more of voters who rated \"change\" as their top priority.\n\nAs for Democrat Hillary Clinton, her loss is likely to spark a battle of bitter recriminations among Democrats, with the liberal faction, personified by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, pushing for radical change in the party agenda.\n\nTrump, of course, represents a major change in GOP identity, focusing unabashedly on white Americans \u2013 contrary to the desires of party leadership \u2013 and rejecting mainstream Republican principles such as free trade. While that strategy won him the White House in 2016, the changing demographic landscape of the US, with a fast-growing Hispanic population and a declining percentage of whites, may challenge the approach in coming years.\n\n\"It's not a good strategy in the long-term,\" noted Matthew Wilson, an associate professor of political science at Southern Methodist University, as Trump's victory hung in the balance.",
    " Title: Chicago's Homicide Rate and the Debate on Gun Control: A Comparative Analysis of Chicago, Georgia, and Virginia\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, forty individuals were shot over the Easter weekend in Chicago, with nine fatalities. This violent spree, occurring in a city known for its stringent gun control laws, has sparked a renewed debate on the effectiveness of such measures.\n\nChicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy reported that the city's declining homicide tally is \"still ahead of where we were last year.\" In 2013, Chicago recorded 415 homicides, a decrease of 18% from the previous year's 503. However, critics argue that the city's efforts to curb gun violence through stricter gun laws may not be yielding the desired results.\n\nWhile Chicago's homicide rate improvement could be attributed to the gradual relaxation of its gun laws, other states, such as Georgia, are taking a different approach. Georgia legislators are currently reviewing and repealing archaic gun-control restrictions. From July 1, law-abiding residents will be allowed to carry guns into taverns without restriction and enter churches, schools, and government buildings under certain circumstances.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal, a Republican, defends this move, stating, \"This bill respects the rights of private-property owners, who still set the rules for their land and their buildings.\" Critics of the expansion of gun rights predict that this law will lead to increased violence, but evidence from states like Virginia suggests otherwise.\n\nVirginia, which abolished its ban on guns in bars four years ago, has seen a decrease in violent crime at drinking establishments. When the Richmond Times-Dispatch investigated crimes committed by concealed-carry permit holders, it could only find one instance of a permit holder propositioning a waitress. Violent crime at drinking establishments dropped 5%.\n\nRespecting Virginians' right to keep and bear arms has made the commonwealth a safer place. Last year, there were just eight homicides in all of Fairfax County, five in Alexandria, and none in Arlington County. In contrast, the District of Columbia, with its strict gun control measures, recorded 103 homicides.\n\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has been known to capitalize on crises, may want to consider learning from Georgia and Virginia's approaches to gun control. The debate on gun control continues to be a contentious issue, but the evidence suggests that respecting citizens' right to bear arms may lead to a safer environment.",
    " Title: Government Shutdown Looms as Bipartisan Agreement Remains Elusive\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the clock ticks down to midnight, the federal government is on the brink of a shutdown, with no clear solution in sight. The House-passed bill, which failed to garner enough support, has left lawmakers scrambling for a last-minute deal to avoid a government shutdown, the first since 2013.\n\nThe Senate, and consequently the House, are now starting from scratch, with any new package facing a real time crunch to pass through both chambers before the deadline. The most likely outcome at this point is a government shutdown, as both parties dig in their heels over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which shields undocumented children of immigrants from deportation.\n\nDemocrats, who have been largely united in their demands to address DACA in any legislation, are not in a compromising mood. They view this as their one piece of leverage in Washington and are determined to use it to protect DACA recipients. They also believe they will win the politics of the blame game, as the average American will likely question why the GOP, which controls the House, Senate, and White House, cannot keep their own house in order.\n\nRepublicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, are in a more compromising mood, aware that the history of shutdowns does not look favorable for their side if Friday's deadline comes and goes without a deal. The strategy for Republican congressional leaders is also complicated by President Donald Trump, who seems to be veering back and forth on whether a deal should be made and what should be in the deal.\n\nAs the focus shifts from finding a solution to avert a shutdown to preparing for the political fallout from a shutdown, momentum appears to be on the side of a shutdown. With no obvious solution or much interest in finding one on either side of the aisle, the government shutdown looms large. The White House's decision to hold a press briefing, featuring Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, suggests it has pivoted toward positioning for a likely shutdown.",
    " Title: Lawmakers Face Potential Exodus Over Obamacare Premium Hikes\n\nArticle:\n\nQuiet conversations about the potential impact of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, are taking place among lawmakers and their aides on Capitol Hill. The issue at hand is the impending increase in health insurance premiums for these individuals due to a provision in the health care law that will transition them from the current government-subsidized health care plans to the government health care exchanges.\n\nThe fear is that the government-subsidized premiums will disappear at the end of the year under a provision in the health care law, which could make their benefits exorbitantly expensive. Democratic and Republican leaders are taking the issue seriously, but they need more specifics from the Office of Personnel Management on how the new rule should take effect.\n\nIf the issue isn't resolved, and massive numbers of lawmakers and aides bolt, many on Capitol Hill fear it could lead to a brain drain just as Congress tackles a slew of weighty issues, such as fights over the Tax Code and immigration reform. The problem is far more acute in the House, where lawmakers and aides are generally younger and less wealthy.\n\nSeveral aides have already given lawmakers notice that they'll be leaving over concerns about Obamacare. Republican and Democratic lawmakers said the chatter about retiring now, to remain on the current health care plan, is constant.\n\nRep. John Larson (D-Conn.), a Connecticut Democrat in leadership when the law passed, said he thinks the problem will be resolved. \"If not, I think we should begin an immediate amicus brief to say, 'Listen, this is simply not fair to these employees,'\" Larson told a news outlet. \"They are federal employees.\"\n\nRepublicans, never a fan of Democratic health care reform, are more vocal about the potential adverse effects of the provision. Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) said, \"This is the law.... It's going to hinder our ability with retention of members, it's going to hinder our ability for members to take care of their families.\"\n\nAlabama Rep. Jo Bonner said the threat is already real, especially for veteran lawmakers and staff. If they leave this year, they think they can continue to be covered under the current health care plan. \"I've lost one staffer who told me in confidence that he had been here for a number of years and the thought of losing the opportunity to keep his health insurance on Dec. 31 [forced him to leave],\" said Bonner, who had already planned his resignation from Congress. \"And then I've got another staff member that I think it will be a factor as she's contemplating her future.\"\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, contained a provision known as the Grassley Amendment, which says the government can only offer members of Congress and their staff plans that are \"created\" in the bill or \"offered through an exchange\" \u2014 unless the bill is amended. Currently, aides and lawmakers receive their health care under the generous Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, with the government subsidizing upward of 75 percent of the premiums for the health insurance plans. In 2014, most Capitol Hill aides and lawmakers are expected to be put onto the exchanges, and there has been no guidance whether the government will subsidize those premiums. This is expected to cause a steep spike in health insurance costs.",
    " Title: Conservative Group Criticizes McConnell for Fiscal Cliff Deal Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nA conservative advocacy group, ForAmerica, has launched a series of online ads targeting Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) for his role in negotiating the fiscal cliff deal. The ads, which read \"Mitch McConnell: Whose side are you on?\", are part of a campaign to express disapproval of McConnell's actions during the fiscal cliff negotiations.\n\nBrent Bozell, president of ForAmerica, stated, \"This is a statement we're making, and I suspect there will be more statements that are going to be coming out. It is a statement to make it emphatically clear that what the minority leader did was 100 percent unacceptable. Conservatives are going to hold him responsible for this.\"\n\nThe ad buy is reportedly a \"five-figure\" amount and will be distributed through Google display ads and Facebook in Kentucky, as well as running on The Daily Caller and Drudge Report in Washington. McConnell is up for reelection in 2014 and is hoping to fend off a conservative primary challenge.\n\nAfter negotiations between House Speaker John Boehner and President Barack Obama broke down, McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) took over negotiations. McConnell called in Vice President Joe Biden at the final minute when negotiations reached an impasse. The McConnell-Biden framework ended up becoming the basis for a deal.\n\nBozell, who vocally opposed the fiscal cliff deal that involved tax increases, made clear that his ire is aimed at McConnell for signing off on a deal. \"When Republicans agree to do what they did agree to do, then they are just as much tax-and-spend Democrats as Democrats are,\" Bozell said.\n\n\"Do I have any confidence that Republicans will stand by [McConnell's] statements a couple of days ago that the talk about tax increases are over? None,\" Bozell said. \"It is a fluid situation. There are some serious battles coming up. I'm not writing off anything. If Republicans find their mojo and rediscovered their soul and try to do the right thing, we'll support them, but they just can't count on us anymore.\"\n\nThe ads come as McConnell faces criticism from the right for his role in the fiscal cliff deal, which included tax increases. The conservative group's campaign is an attempt to hold McConnell accountable for his actions and express dissatisfaction with the deal's outcome.",
    " Title: Pennsylvania Focus Group Declares Hillary Clinton the Winner in First Presidential Debate, but Remains Pessimistic About Choices\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a focus group of undecided voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was declared the clear winner in the first presidential debate, but the participants remained deeply pessimistic about their choices in November. The group, selected and paid to participate in a focus group conducted by Republican pollster Frank Luntz in Philadelphia on Monday, shared entrenched views that voters across the country have expressed over the past 18 months.\n\nThe visceral electoral anger that helped fuel Donald Trump's rise during the primaries was felt in the room at the National Constitution Center, where the mood was perhaps best encapsulated by Luntz's opening question: \"How the hell did we get here?\"\n\nThe Pennsylvania voters described Clinton as a \"liar,\" \"corrupt,\" \"secretive,\" and \"self-centered.\" They labeled Trump as \"scary,\" \"fake,\" an \"egomaniac,\" and a \"shape-shifter.\"\n\nThe battleground state voters watched the debate from a room inside the National Constitution Center while Luntz's team tracked their snap reactions throughout the 90-minute debate. On display behind the voters were large, expressionistic paintings of an American flag, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Trump, and Clinton by artist and GOP darling Steve Penley.\n\nAt the end of the debate, 16 of the 27 participants agreed that Clinton had won, while just six believed Trump had won the debate. In near uniformity, the voters said the outcome of the debate was the result of Trump's failure rather than Clinton's success.\n\nAsked to react to their performances, the voters offered that Trump's was \"strong start, weak finish,\" \"bombastic,\" \"sloppy,\" and \"verbose.\" When asked to respond to Clinton's performance, the answers were markedly positive: \"firm,\" \"powerful,\" \"strong,\" and \"informed.\"\n\nTrump struggled to defend himself against attacks by Clinton over his denigration of women, insensitivity on race relations, and an assertion that he avoided paying federal taxes for years. The freewheeling Republican nominee repeatedly interrupted Clinton and drew sardonic laughs from both the audience in New York and the voters in Pennsylvania, when he claimed to have a \"winning temperament.\"\n\n\"He dug his own grave by just talking and talking,\" said one woman named Marti G, who described herself as truly undecided.\n\nOn the monitor tracking the voters' reactions to the candidates, which was visible to the handful of reporters observing the group, even those leaning toward the Republican nominee disapproved of his windy response when Clinton ticked off possible reasons Trump may not want to disclose his tax returns.\n\nAs the lines on the screen plummeted, Luntz, sporting a pair of American Flag Nike sneakers, bounded over to the small group of reporters. \"Donald Trump just got nuked,\" he said. \"And I don't know if he can recover from this debate.\"\n\nUntil that point, Trump appeared to be doing a better job appealing to the firmly undecided voters in the room. He was at his best when he was railing against the political system. But support for him cratered when he began to defend his years of questioning Barack Obama's citizenship.\n\nClinton wove the so-called birtherism issue \u2013 which she referred to as a \"racist lie\" \u2013 into a larger narrative, accusing Trump of having \"a long record of engaging in racist behavior.\" As she spoke, many of the voters in the room agreed with her, especially among those already leaning towards her.\n\nAfter the debate, the voters lamented that too much time was spent discussing birtherism. Overall, the voters rated Clinton's response on issues of race higher than Trump's, and after the debate, several people flatly labeled the Republican nominee a racist.\n\n\"He's come to the black community because he wants our vote, not because he truly cares about [me] as a black person,\" said Ragni Lee, of Collegeville, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe group included women and men who were reluctant to support either candidate, including a lifelong conservative voter who would rather sit out than vote for Trump, a millennial who supported Bernie Sanders in the primary but has been persuaded by Clinton, and a middle school teacher who says Trump \"lost\" her when he began denigrating Muslims.\n\n\"When I looked at my Muslim students and I knew he was talking about them, he lost me,\" said Judy McDermott, who remains \"really undecided.\"\n\nHillary Clinton shows strength over Trump in one of history's weirdest, wildest debates. Yet some left the first debate impossibly conflicted and even more pessimistic than when they arrived.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton is not a good candidate and Donald Trump is just a despicable person,\" Nicole Gerson, an attorney in Philadelphia, reflected after the debate. She said Trump's criticism of Clinton steered her away from the Democrat but not in his direction.\n\n\"I'm actually thinking of voting for Gary Johnson,\" she said, naming the Libertarian candidate. \"Maybe the third party will finally become more viable so we're not left with such extreme candidates. It's a vote for the future.\"",
    " Title: Study Finds Facebook's Fact-Checking Efforts May Have Unintended Consequences\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent study conducted by MIT, it has been revealed that Facebook's efforts to combat fake news may have unintended consequences. The study found that the platform's fact-checking warnings may inadvertently lead users to assume that unmarked content is accurate.\n\nDavid Rand, one of the authors of the report and a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, explained, \"Putting a warning on some content is going to make you think, to some extent, that all of the other content without the warning might have been checked and verified.\"\n\nThe researchers have coined this phenomenon the \"implied truth effect.\" Given the vast scale of Facebook's platform, which has 1.25 billion daily users, and the sheer amount of content posted, fact-checkers are unable to keep up.\n\nThe study involved over 6,000 participants who were shown a variety of real and fake news headlines as they would appear on Facebook. Half of the group was shown stories without any fact-checking tags, while the other half was shown a typical Facebook feed consisting of a mix of tagged and untagged posts.\n\nThe results showed that the use of \"false\" tags, which are used to flag inaccurate content, significantly reduced participants' willingness to share fake stories from 29.2% to 16.1%. However, the study also found that unmarked false stories were believed to be true and shared 36.2% of the time.\n\nOne-fifth of the study's participants believed that unmarked posts had already been fact-checked.\n\nRand, who is an unpaid advisor to Facebook's efforts to combat fake news, suggests that one solution is to employ more fact-checkers so that all news content posted to Facebook is checked.

    " Title: Trump Announces Potential Vice Presidential Picks as Convention Nears\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of developments on Monday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump named three potential running mates for the upcoming party convention in Cleveland later this month. The three individuals named were Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, and Indiana Governor Mike Pence.\n\nTrump spent time with Pence and his family on Sunday, and was due to meet Ernst in New Jersey on Monday. Ernst, a first-term senator and Tea Party endorsee, made headlines in 2014 with her campaign ad featuring her background of growing up on an Iowa farm and her promise to \"know how to cut pork\" in Washington. In 2015, she delivered the Republican response to Barack Obama's State of the Union address.\n\nCotton, a 39-year-old senator who has been mentioned as a potential 2020 presidential candidate, has not been as often named among potential Trump vice presidential picks as Pence and Ernst. In his NBC interview, Trump praised Cotton for his performance on \"Meet the Press\" and said he was \"great\" despite a \"one-sided\" interview by Chuck Todd.\n\nTrump's choice of vice president has been a topic of much speculation, with some names such as Newt Gingrich, Chris Christie, and Jeff Sessions also being mentioned. However, Gingrich, who has expressed interest in the position, may be too forthright, as he recently criticized Trump for \"screwing up\" the election.\n\nThe convention, which starts on July 18, is expected to be a major event for the Republican party, with many big names set to speak. Possible speakers include former Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, and boxing promoter Don King. However, some celebrities, such as Super Bowl-winning Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka, have passed on the convention.\n\nTrump's daughter Ivanka predicted that the convention would be \"a great combination of our great politicians, but also great American businessmen and women and leaders across industry and leaders across really all sectors.\" She added that the convention would be \"a convention unlike any we've ever seen.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign has also been in touch with aides to Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who has reportedly been trying to win a speaking slot. Other potential speakers include former United Nations ambassador John Bolton, West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito, and Washington representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers.\n\nTrump's choice of vice president will be a crucial decision for his campaign, and it is expected that he will use his business acumen to put together a program that appeals directly to the American people. Ohio Republican party chairman Matt Borges said, \"He's going to have to bring all his skills to bear to make this work, not just in Cleveland, but for the next four months.\"",
    " Title: White House Tensions Mount as 'Saturday Night Live' Skit Sparks Controversy Over Sean Spicer's Portrayal\n\nArticle:\n\nThe portrayal of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer in a recent 'Saturday Night Live' sketch has caused a stir within the White House, with sources close to President Trump expressing discomfort and concern over the gum-chomping, super soaker-wielding caricature of Spicer, played by actress Melissa McCarthy in drag.\n\nAccording to sources, it was not just the lampooning of Spicer as a press secretary who makes up facts, but his portrayal by a woman that was most problematic for the president. The unflattering send-up by a female comedian was not considered helpful for Spicer's longevity in the high-profile job, where he has struggled to strike the right balance between representing an administration that views the media as the \"opposition party,\" and developing a functional relationship with the press.\n\nThe White House's discomfort was evident in Trump's uncharacteristic Twitter silence over the weekend, and sources said the caricature of Spicer by McCarthy struck a nerve and was upsetting to the press secretary and his allies.\n\nOn Monday, Spicer was traveling aboard Air Force One from Florida to Washington, D.C., and joked about the sketch in an interview with Extra, saying, \"Melissa McCarthy needs to slow down on the gum chewing; way too many pieces in there.\"\n\nSpicer's allies were trying to put a positive spin on the incident, with one person close to Spicer saying, \"He takes the job seriously but does not take himself that seriously.\" This person added that the instant-viral skit helped Spicer reach a new level of fame and that he should \"embrace it.\"\n\nHowever, on Tuesday, Spicer faces the uncomfortable task of facing reporters once again in the briefing room, where the elephant in the room will be the unflattering McCarthy caricature. White House sources said they expect him to cut the tension with humor, and that he has already been on a charm offensive, reaching out to reporters and wishing them happy birthdays, and making self-effacing jokes about his first stumble out of the gate.\n\nSpicer has been fighting to repair his troubling first impression behind the lectern, where he took no questions and made false statements about the crowd size at Trump's inauguration, losing some of his credibility with the room of reporters he faces off with every day. Internally, people close to Trump are eager to point out that Spicer was not Trump's first choice for the high-profile position of press secretary, but that Chief of Staff Reince Priebus pushed for the former Republican National Committee spokesman to get the job.\n\nThe \"SNL\" clip was seen by some in Trump's orbit as devastating because it was accurate. One Trump ally said, \"I thought they had Sean down pretty good.\" In a phone interview on Monday afternoon, Spicer tried to tack away from the skit, saying, \"I would much rather have the focus be on the president's agenda and the success he's having.\" When pressed about his own reaction to the skit, he demurred, saying, \"It doesn't really matter what I think.\"",
    " Title: The Influence of Hard-Line Faction on Speaker Boehner and the Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing government shutdown has shed light on the significant influence of a small group of hard-line House Republican members, who have reportedly forced Speaker John Boehner to abandon his initial plan for a temporary government funding bill.\n\nIn mid-September, Boehner, in a statement, acknowledged the diversity within his caucus, stating, \"We've got 233 members\u2014all of whom have their own plan. It's tough to get them on the same track. We got there.\"\n\nBoehner's plan, which would have likely avoided the shutdown by allowing a symbolic vote on defunding the Affordable Care Act, was abandoned due to the hard-liners' insistence on a harder stance.\n\nThe following day, Boehner held a rally in the Capitol, celebrating a government funding bill vote that also defunded the health care law. Several members present at the rally, including those who had attempted a coup on the House floor in January, were part of this hard-line faction.\n\nRepresentative Steve King of Iowa, one of the hard-liners, commented, \"I think the speaker is stronger today than he was yesterday. And he was stronger yesterday than he was the day before. If we continue in that direction, we're going to be in pretty good shape.\"\n\nDespite the 30 hard-liners predominantly occupying safe seats in deep-red districts, they face minimal pressure from their constituents. Representative Ted Yoho, a freshman Republican from Florida, stated, \"I come from a very conservative area, and my constituents are saying, 'Don't blink, don't cave in, don't back up.'\"\n\nThe question on everyone's mind in Washington is whether Boehner will ultimately yield and bring up what's called a \"clean CR\" \u2013 the short-term spending bill the Senate passed with Obamacare funding intact. This bill is believed to pass easily on the House floor with a combination of Democratic and Republican votes.\n\nRepresentative Marlin Stutzman, another hard-liner, argues that passing a clean CR at this time would be detrimental to the Republican conference and weaken Boehner's negotiating ability in the future.\n\nDavid Hopkins, a political scientist at Boston College, suggests that the hard-liners' actions could potentially threaten Boehner's speakership, as they are not viewed as allies by this faction and may attempt to depose him as speaker.\n\nBecause Republicans have a relatively slim majority in the House, the hard-liners wield more power than their numbers would suggest. Hopkins estimates that at least 50 other Republicans are hesitant to distance themselves from the hard-liners, fearing reprisal from outside activist groups or primary challenges.\n\nThe remaining Republicans have not taken steps to discourage the hard-liners, according to Hopkins. He states, \"The way this has gotten portrayed has been the villains in this story are these 30 guys on the end, and the innocent victims are the rest of the Republican caucus. And I think the rest of the Republican caucus is implicated in this strategy. They've gone along.\"\n\nAs long as the majority of Republicans continue to align with the hard-liners, there is no reason to expect Boehner to deviate from their stance.",
    " Title: Freedom Caucus Threatens to Release Own Tax Reform Plan as Deadline Looms\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus, a conservative group of Republican lawmakers, has warned White House officials that they may release their own tax reform plan if the administration and GOP leaders do not act swiftly on a unified plan.\n\nOn Thursday, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Vice Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) delivered this message to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, and White House legislative liaison Marc Short during a meeting at the White House. The White House officials expressed concern about the Freedom Caucus releasing their own legislation, fearing it could prevent Republicans from uniting behind one plan.\n\nMeadows downplayed the possibility of the group releasing their own legislation, stating that the White House has assured him that action is imminent. However, conservatives are eager to deliver on a major campaign promise after the failure of the Obamacare repeal bill in the Senate. If necessary, they are prepared to forge ahead on their own.\n\n\"I'm not threatening my own tax bill if we don't get our way,\" Meadows said. \"At the same time, if we don't make decisions in the near term on what we're going to do, [we might] put forth something.\"\n\nThe White House officials would prefer to avoid dealing with dissent from the Freedom Caucus. However, they are also concerned about keeping conservatives in the fold after President Trump cut a budget deal this week with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), surprising his own party.\n\nWhen Mnuchin met with Republicans on Friday morning and asked them to vote for the deal, he was jeered and hissed by the room. Trump has encouraged legislators to \"hurry\" on a tax plan in September, but debates are still ongoing between the House and the Senate on specifics, including whether to allow immediate business expensing and deciding how much the corporate tax rate can be lowered. Trump has repeatedly pushed for a 15 percent rate, even as some of his top advisers say it is not mathematically possible.\n\nThe possibility of the Freedom Caucus going rogue on tax reform has alarmed administration and Capitol Hill Republicans working on the issue. GOP leaders believe that a single, unified tax bill backed by Trump, the House, and the Senate is critical to success.\n\nMeadows stated that his conversations with the White House and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) are about making decisions and starting debates on the merits of rates and expensing models, rather than allowing the so-called Big Six or Secret Six to negotiate something and present it to the rest of the GOP conference.\n\nConservatives are desperate for a win to show to constituents back home. An antsy Meadows listed six major tax reform questions that have yet to be answered, from the exact corporate tax rate to how business expensing will be handled. \"Those are six items that you and I can't answer, and if we can't answer them, then we don't have any idea what we're doing on tax reform,\" he said.\n\nMeadows also mentioned that several Freedom Caucus members are crafting tax legislation. Axios reported earlier this week that one such plan would lower the corporate tax rate to 16 percent, a more aggressive cut than the Big Six believes Congress can achieve.\n\nHowever, the meeting appears to have persuaded conservatives to hold off\u2014at least for now. \"The only way that a plan from the Freedom Caucus would be introduced is if there is inaction on behalf of the Big Six, and we're still talking about principles weeks from now,\" said Meadows, who argued that there was \"no need\" for his group to drop a plan at the moment.\n\n\"I'm not saying that I'll never put out a bill,\" he continued. \"But as long as they put out a bill and negotiate in good faith over the next few weeks, there will be no Freedom Caucus bill or a need for a Freedom Caucus bill.\"",
    " Title: California and New Jersey Primaries Yield Mixed Results for Democrats, Republicans in Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of primary elections held across eight U.S. states on Tuesday, California and New Jersey emerged as key battlegrounds for the upcoming midterm elections, with Democrats and Republicans vying for control of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Governor's seat in California.\n\nCalifornia's unique electoral system, which advances the top two vote-getters to the election regardless of party, raised concerns for Democrats in conservative suburbs south of Los Angeles. However, Democratic candidates managed to overcome these challenges and advance to the final vote, as did Republican John Cox in the race for Governor.\n\nIn the 48th Congressional District, where voters chose Democrat Hillary Clinton over President Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election but re-elected longtime Republican Representative Dana Rohrabacher, the battle for a place on the November ballot was particularly dramatic. With 414 of 415 precincts reporting early Wednesday, Rohrabacher easily won a spot on the November ballot. Two Democrats, Harley Rouda and Hans Keirstead, were next, separated by fewer than 100 votes, leaving the race too close to call. About 1,000 votes behind the two Democrats was Republican Scott Baugh. If the final tally puts him ahead of them, it could set up a general election fight between Rohrabacher and his fellow Republican, ending Democrats' chances to take that seat.\n\nIn the race for Governor, Democrat Gavin Newsom's first-place finish over a field of 27 candidates was expected. However, Republican John Cox's presence as the second candidate to advance to the November ballot could potentially boost Republican voter turnout, improving the party's chances in Congressional races.\n\nIn New Jersey, establishment-backed Democrats muscled past liberal challengers in key congressional races, setting up contests in November that will test the question of whether more moderate candidates will fare better against Republicans in swing districts. In southern New Jersey, state Sen. Jeff Van Drew, a conservative Democrat, appeared set to prevail over left-leaning candidates. He will face Republican Seth Grossman, a former city and county official, who emerged from a four-way contest.\n\nIn a suburban New Jersey district, former Obama official Tom Malinowski was well ahead of two Democrats backed by independent liberal groups and will take on the moderate Republican Leonard Lance in what is expected to be a competitive race. Democrats also hope to capture two other Republican-held seats in the state.\n\nRepublicans control both chambers of Congress. While Democrats need only a net total of two seats to take command of the Senate, Democratic senators must defend a bevy of seats in rural states such as Indiana, Montana, North Dakota, and West Virginia that supported Trump two years ago.\n\nVoters on Tuesday also went to the polls to choose candidates in primaries in Iowa, Mississippi, Alabama, Montana, South Dakota, and New Mexico. A number of women won Democratic contests, continuing a trend that began earlier this year. Women will represent the party in key House races in Iowa, New Jersey, and New Mexico, based on Tuesday's results.",
    " Title: Hagel Acknowledges Potential Ground Force Deployment in Iraq, Emphasizes No Combat Troops\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has acknowledged that he may consider recommendations to place ground forces in Iraq to assist local forces in locating targets, but clarified that these forces would not engage in combat. Hagel made these statements during an interview with CNN at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California.\n\nPresident Obama, during the G20 summit in Australia, reiterated his stance on U.S. ground forces in Iraq, stating that he has not changed his mind about deploying them. He also emphasized that General Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has not advised him to send U.S. troops to fight.\n\nHowever, President Obama did not rule out the possibility of deploying ground troops in the most dire of circumstances, such as if ISIL were to obtain a nuclear weapon. In such a scenario, he suggested, General Dempsey would recommend sending U.S. ground troops to retrieve the weapon, and he would order the operation.\n\nDuring the same seminar, Hagel declined to comment on whether any top members of the Khorasan Group had been killed by U.S. airstrikes in Syria. He did, however, affirm that the group still poses a significant threat, planning and plotting attacks against U.S. interests, particularly in Europe.\n\nThe seminar, which also featured Republican Sen. John McCain, former defense secretaries Leon Panetta and Robert Gates, and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, saw a heated discussion on the White House and Pentagon's strategy to combat ISIS.\n\nSen. McCain, in a blistering critique, stated that \"no one outside the Joint Chiefs of Staff believes we have a strategy\" to defeat and degrade ISIS, as set forth by the administration. Former defense secretaries Panetta and Gates, who have recently published critical books about Obama, also participated in the discussion.\n\nIn a related note, Jeh Johnson emphasized that the potential for a lone wolf attack inspired by ISIS poses a significant threat to the United States.",
    " Title: Rep. Rashida Tlaib Breaks Ranks, Announces Impeachment Resolution for President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that breaks ranks with House leadership, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) has announced her plans to file a resolution to impeach President Trump. The freshman progressive made the announcement on Wednesday, surrounded by a group of supporters who wore shirts and held signs with statements such as \"He's a Racist\" and \"#TimeToImpeach.\"\n\nTlaib, in a statement, expressed her concerns about the ongoing constitutional crisis and its impact on the ability of Congress to address pressing issues. \"We want to be able to work on these economic justice issues, racial justice issues and everything,\" she said. \"But guess what? There is a wall there, and a constitutional crisis that is not going to be able to have us be able to do our jobs as American Congress members to push a lot of these agendas forward.\"\n\nTlaib argued that the last election was a mandate for impeachment proceedings against Trump. \"This last election was a calling,\" she continued. \"I mean we saw record turnout in an election year where people wanted to elect the jury that would begin the impeachment proceedings to Donald Trump.\"\n\nIn an attempt to maintain party unity, Tlaib argued that her party agrees the president needs to be impeached. \"This is not to say that we disagree,\" she continued. \"I think that every single colleague of mine agrees there are impeachable offenses. That's one thing we all agree on.\"\n\nTlaib's decision to file the motion is contrary to the desire of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other senior Democrat leaders. The Washington Examiner reports that Democrat Caucus Chair, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), called the announcement \"premature.\"\n\nSpeaker Pelosi has continually pushed back on the notion that the Democrats' priority is impeachment. Party leaders maintain they're waiting to hear from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election before making their final decision.\n\n\"When the facts are known, then we can make a judgment,\" Pelosi said last week according to Fox News. In a February interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, Pelosi shared her concerns about impeachment, finding the process to be \"disruptive\" to the nation.\n\nTlaib's move comes at a divisive time in the Democrat Party, as House Democrats attempt to establish a measure addressing recent anti-Semitic remarks from freshman Democrats Rep. Ilhan Omar and Rep. Tlaib. Senior leaders want to maintain Jewish support; however, the newer House members want the measure to include protections from Islamophobia.\n\nRep. Tlaib also faces her own turmoil as she stands accused of breaking campaign rules. Fox News reports Tlaib is under questioning for campaign records that reveal she paid herself $17,500 after midterm elections. The FEC rules no one can receive salary payments \"beyond the date he or she is no longer a candidate.\"\n\nAfter making the public impeachment announcement from Capitol Hill, Rep. Tlaib took to Twitter to announce the resolution would be introduced later this month. \"Today, I announced that later this month, I will be introducing a resolution to have the Judiciary Committee move on investigating grounds for impeachment,\" Rep. Tlaib wrote. \"Our democracy must be protected.\"",
    " Title: Immigration Reform Back on the Agenda: A Shift in GOP Strategy Amidst Record Hispanic Voter Turnout\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, top Republicans have signaled a renewed interest in immigration reform, a topic that has been largely absent from the legislative agenda for the past five years. This sudden focus on immigration reform underscores the growing concern among Republicans about the increasing disengagement of Latinos from their party.\n\nThe resurgence of immigration as a priority issue in Washington, D.C., signals a potential shift in the Republican Party's approach, which has been marked by conservative hardliners setting the agenda on immigration after several failed attempts to pass a bill during the Bush administration.\n\nDespite the challenges of enacting a comprehensive overhaul, given the deep-rooted opposition within GOP ranks to creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, the renewed interest in tackling the issue suggests a significant change in the political landscape.\n\nThis development is another indication of the Republicans' acknowledgment of the need to adapt to changing demographics. The 2012 elections saw a record Hispanic voter turnout, which significantly contributed to President Barack Obama's victory.\n\nKansas Sen. Jerry Moran, who is running for the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairmanship, emphasized the importance of addressing the immigration issue and engaging with Latino voters. \"It's clear to me,\" Moran said, \"if Republicans are going to have the opportunity to be in the majority, we clearly have to determine how we deal with minority and Latino voters. In some fashion, the way we have dealt with immigration gives us a black eye. And we need to figure out how to talk about issues and pursue policies that matter to Latino, Hispanic voters.\"\n\nRepublicans are not the only ones under pressure. Latino leaders have expressed expectations for Obama to deliver on his promise of immigration reform, a promise he failed to fulfill during his first term.\n\n\"The Latino giant is wide awake, cranky, and taking names,\" said Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union and a leader of Latino mobilization in battleground states.\n\nObama has indicated that he plans to pursue a broad immigration reform proposal early next year. In the past, the president had promised to introduce a comprehensive immigration reform bill during his first year in office but did not follow through due to a lack of Republican support. Facing pressure from the Latino community to show progress on the issue, Obama took executive action last summer to allow certain young immigrants to remain in the country.\n\nVice President Joe Biden expressed optimism about the prospects of immigration reform, stating, \"I feel very optimistic about, in my view, immigration reform.\" Biden added, \"It's a different day.\"",
    " Title: White House Acknowledges Involvement in Shaping Benghazi Talking Points, Emphasizing Stability Image\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House admitted on Wednesday that it withheld an email from Congress and the media regarding Susan Rice's controversial \"talking points\" about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack due to the memo not being directly related to the attack itself.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney stated, \"This document was explicitly not about Benghazi, but about the general dynamic in the Muslim world at the time.\"\n\nA government watchdog group obtained an email this week that revealed the White House's involvement in shaping the administration's message about the September 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi, Libya, to portray them as spontaneous anti-U.S. protests that did not occur in that city. Four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, were killed in the attack.\n\nThe internal email, dated September 14, 2012, was sent from Ben Rhodes, President Obama's assistant and deputy national security adviser, to White House press officials. In the email, Mr. Rhodes listed as a \"goal\" the White House's desire \"To underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure or policy.\"\n\nThe email, titled \"RE: PREP CALL with Susan, Saturday at 4:00 pm ET,\" detailed White House involvement in preparing Rice, then-U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, for her upcoming appearances on Sunday television talk shows.\n\nThe email and others provide the clearest evidence to date that top presidential aides sought to use the anti-American protests sweeping across the Middle East in 2012, as well as the aftermath of the Benghazi terrorist attack, to project an image of President Obama's foreign policy as \"steady and statesmanlike,\" just weeks before his re-election.\n\nMr. Carney explained the White House's decision to withhold the Rhodes memo from congressional and media inquiries, stating, \"It was explicitly not about Benghazi.\"\n\n\"The overall issue of unrest in the Muslim world and the danger posed by these protests... was very much a topic in the news at the time,\" Mr. Carney added, referring to protests in Egypt and elsewhere directed at the U.S. over an anti-Muslim video produced in America.\n\nUnder the heading \"Goals\" for Rice's Sunday talk show appearances, Mr. Rhodes wrote to other White House communications officials that a main objective of Rice's interviews should be to \"reinforce the president and the administration's strength and steadiness in dealing with difficult challenges.\" A second goal was to link the Benghazi attack\u2014and those on other diplomatic sites across the Middle East\u2014to the obscure anti-Muslim video and to insist that the protests were not \"rooted\" in a \"broader failure of [administration] policy.\"",
    " Title: Unemployment Claims Reach 17 Million in Three Weeks; Senate Stalemate Over Small Business Aid\n\nIn the past three weeks, nearly 17 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits, with long lines of people waiting for food assistance in various states. Many states are struggling to process the influx of unemployment claims.\n\n\"How long it takes will vary by states,\" said Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia. In Washington, Thursday, Senate Republicans pushed for an additional $250 billion to help small businesses in dire need, but the aid was blocked by Democrats who are demanding a $500 billion bill to offer more support to health care providers and state and local governments.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) stated during a speech on the floor, \"We need more funding, and we need it fast.\" However, Democrats argue that the bill was designed to fail and was a political stunt.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) argued from the Senate floor, \"This was in fact, designed to fail.\"\n\nThe unemployment rate is feared to reach 15% soon, and White House officials are eager to stave off a severe recession. Companies in areas free from outbreaks could potentially reopen in May, but the decision to restart the economy is largely out of the federal government's hands, as many governors have issued stay-at-home orders through the end of May or later.\n\nPresident Trump stated during his daily coronavirus briefing, \"We're at the top of the hill. Pretty sure we're at the top of the hill, and now we're going downward. In some cases, we've already started that process.\"\n\nHealth officials say social isolation methods are working, and Dr. Anthony Fauci now predicts the American death toll will be 60,000, down from earlier, more dire, predictions of 100,000 to 240,000.\n\n\"We have to be prepared that when the infections start to rear their heads again that we have in place a very aggressive and effective way to identify, isolate, contact, trace,\" Dr. Fauci told CBS News.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan group of senators is calling on China to immediately close all wet markets where fresh meat and produce is sold in unsanitary conditions. This comes after the director of the Chinese CDC admitted, \"The origin of the new coronavirus is the wildlife sold illegally in a Wuhan seafood market.\"",
    " Title: Obama Vows to Pursue Executive Action on Immigration Despite Congressional Opposition\n\n Article:\n\nPresident Barack Obama, during a diplomatic trip to Asia, has reaffirmed his commitment to taking executive action on immigration reform, despite facing opposition from Congress and Republican leaders.\n\nAt a joint news conference with Myanmar dissident leader Aung San Suu Kyi, Obama expressed his frustration with the ongoing stalemate on the issue, stating, \"They have the ability to fix the system. What they do not have is the ability to do is expect me to stand by with a broken system in perpetuity.\"\n\nThe president emphasized that unless Congress issues legislation first, he is determined to act before the end of the year on proposals that are expected to include extending amnesty and work permits to possibly millions of illegal immigrants. Obama stated, \"I gave the House over a year to at least give a vote on the Senate bill. They failed to do so.\"\n\nRepublican leaders, such as Speaker John Boehner, have threatened that Obama's decision to act will lead to an adversarial relationship with Congress. Boehner reportedly told reporters, \"We're going to fight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path.\"\n\nIn response, Obama warned Republicans against a governance approach where \"having a disagreement on a single issue suddenly [becomes] a deal-breaker on every issue.\" He added, \"Democracy cannot work that way.\"\n\nThe president's comments come as Republicans grapple with a strategy to derail his plans. A rift is developing within the party about the best way forward, threatening to undermine the party's post-election pledges to proceed with unity.\n\nOne potential strategy being considered is to leverage the upcoming spending bill to force Obama to stand down. At least 50 conservative lawmakers are pushing for this approach, which could lead to a government shutdown if the president refuses to comply.\n\nAnother option under consideration is to allow the executive action to take effect but work to undermine its provisions incrementally over the coming months. A lawsuit over the president's misuse of his authority is also an idea that has been floated.\n\nThe timing for Obama's announcement has not been decided, but reports suggest it may be made as soon as next week. The details of the plan are still being finalized, but it is believed that the proposal may grant amnesty to as many as 5 million illegal immigrants and authorize amnesty for parents of children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents, giving them the right to obtain work documents.\n\nImmigration rights supporters and Democrats are urging Obama to extend amnesty to as many migrants as possible. In recent days, they have been rallying behind the president's decision to take action, arguing that it is not out of step with other presidents who have acted unilaterally on major issues.",
    " Title: U.S. Faces Economic Uncertainty as Fiscal Cliff Negotiations Loom\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the deadline for the Fiscal Cliff negotiations approaches, the political drama unfolding in Washington is far from solving the nation's budget woes. The Budget Act of 2011 mandates a nine-year $1.2 trillion deficit reduction program, or automatic cuts in annual defense and non-entitlement outlays each equal to $54.7 billion, set to take effect on January 1. Simultaneously, the Bush Tax cuts, the 2 percentage point payroll tax holiday, and other programs expire.\n\nThe combined impact of these spending reductions and tax increases could lead to catastrophic consequences for the economy. Unemployment could surge past 15 percent, state government finances could collapse, homeowners could default on mortgages, and hundreds of banks could fail.\n\nTo avoid this calamity, President Obama and House Republicans are expected to agree on a compromise that involves raising taxes on high-income Americans by $100 to $150 billion and curbing spending by an equal amount. However, these efforts may still not be enough to prevent the economy from slipping into recession, depriving the federal government of tax revenues and further exacerbating the budget gap.\n\nThe federal deficit currently exceeds $1 trillion, up from $161 billion in 2007, the last year before the financial collapse. Spending has increased by approximately $1 trillion, as outlays for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other entitlements have increased by an amount equivalent to the entire 2013 defense budget.\n\nBy the end of the decade, runaway entitlement spending will require drastic cuts to the military or crippling many other domestic spending programs to prevent ballooning deficits. The only reasonable solution, according to the article, is to raise the Social Security retirement age to 70 and pattern U.S. health care reforms after other national systems that better contain costs.\n\nThe Germans and Dutch spend one-third less on health care than the United States, as their governments more aggressively regulate prices, better ration care, and spend less on lawsuits. Democrats, hamstrung by unions, are reluctant to require Americans to work longer, and are too beholden to tort lawyers and the medical establishment for campaign support. Republicans, on the other hand, refuse to admit more competition to adequately slow rocketing health care costs.\n\nOver the next decade, without a significantly higher retirement age, effective price controls in health care, and tort reform, federal spending and the national debt will skyrocket. Mounting interest payments, investor reluctance to buy U.S. Treasurys, and consequent draconian cuts in spending will thrust the United States into the crisis now gripping Greece and Spain.\n\nMore immediately, even modest tax increases and spending cuts threaten a second recession, as President Obama and Congress have failed to address the dysfunctions that created the bubble and bust of the 2000s and made the economy overly dependent on deficit spending. From 2001 to 2005, the trade deficit doubled to over $700 billion, due to subsidized imports from China, restrictions on U.S. sales into the Middle Kingdom, and rising oil prices. This loss of demand for U.S.-made goods and services should have instigated a recession; however, Chinese and Middle East oil exporters stepped up purchases of U.S. securities, helping to finance questionable mortgages, car loans, and credit card debt. Americans spent more than they earned, and the boom continued into 2007. When homeowners and other borrowers could no longer service their debts, defaults and bankruptcies resulted, and the economy crashed.\n\nA huge trade deficit with China and on oil continues, but now the federal government is doing the extra spending and borrowing for us. If budget negotiations reduce the deficit by $200 to $300 billion, as is likely, GDP will contract $350 to 500 billion, and unemployment will rise above 10 percent.\n\nPresident Obama and House Republicans indicate no interest in confronting Beijing to force a more equitable trading relationship with the Middle Kingdom. Slashing oil imports requires the President to permit more drilling in the Gulf, off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and in Alaska, and for Republicans to embrace alternative energy sources and more aggressive conservation measures.\n\nIn conclusion, absent major changes in trade and energy policies to boost domestic demand and growth, budget deficit reduction is not possible without another long, hard recession. And absent genuine deficit reduction, the country is headed for economic chaos by the end of the decade.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's June Medical Services Decision: A Narrow Victory for Abortion Rights and a Potential Future Challenge\n\nIn a 5-4 ruling on Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law that required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, preserving access to abortion services for Louisiana's residents. However, the decision, in the case of June Medical Services v. Russo, may not be as favorable to abortion rights as it initially appears, according to legal writer Mark Joseph Stern in Slate.\n\nThe outcome of the case is a victory for Louisiana's three remaining clinics, which can now remain open. But, as Stern explains, the Supreme Court's ruling is not an unqualified endorsement of a constitutional right to choose. In fact, the chief justice, John Roberts, cut back protections for women seeking abortions and laid the groundwork for a future erosion, if not outright reversal, of Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling in June Medical Services is similar to its 2016 ruling in the case Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, which struck down a similar law in Texas. In Whole Woman's Health, the Court ruled that Texas' admitting privileges law imposed an 'undue burden' on the constitutional right to abortion. Since Louisiana's law is indistinguishable from Texas', it should have been plainly unconstitutional under Whole Woman's Health. However, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals effectively defied precedent by upholding the Louisiana regulation.\n\nThe big question in June Medical was whether Roberts, who dissented in Whole Woman's Health, would nonetheless invalidate Louisiana's law on the grounds of stare decisis, or respect for precedent. And that's exactly what Roberts did, with a catch. The Court actually splintered 4-1-4: Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the four liberals, the chief justice wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment, and the four other conservatives dissented. Although Roberts supported Breyer's bottom line holding, he declined to join Breyer's opinion.\n\nBecause the chief justice's opinion is narrower than Breyer's, it is 'controlling' - that is, it's the law of the land. Advocates on both sides of the abortion debate will thus be scrutinizing Roberts' concurrence for years to come. And it gives both sides reason for encouragement.\n\nAccording to Stern, Roberts' decision in June Medical does not necessarily mean that Roe v. Wade will not be overturned at some point. In short, Roberts - alone among the conservatives - agreed with the liberals that Louisiana cannot pretend its law creates no real burden for abortion patients in the face of ample evidence that it would shutter clinics. But the chief justice then whittled down the holding of Whole Woman's Health, replacing its balancing test with a stingier rule that may give states broader leeway to restrict abortion. Roberts expressly disavowed Breyer's test, which weighed a law's benefits to patients against its burdens.",
    " Title: New Pass-Through Tax Loophole in GOP Tax Bill Favors Wealthy at Expense of Most Americans, Analysis Reveals\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy, the new pass-through tax loophole in the recently passed Republican tax bill is drawing criticism for its potential to disproportionately benefit the wealthy at the expense of the average American.\n\nAccording to reports, Republican leaders, including Senator Bob Corker, who has a real estate partnership in Tennessee, have denied that the loophole was included to win over his vote. With the GOP able to afford to lose only two votes, Senator John McCain's absence due to his cancer treatment has made Corker more influential.\n\nDespite Republican claims that the provision was not \"airdropped\" into the tax bill during conference committee negotiations, and that its main purpose was to ensure pass-through businesses were not unfairly treated due to the corporate tax cut, the loophole has been criticized as another example of Congress' efforts to maximize benefits for the wealthy.\n\nPresident Trump has claimed that the tax bill would \"cost me a fortune\" and that his accountants are \"going crazy now.\" However, this claim has been labeled as \"fake news.\" With the new loophole, the president's statement has become even more questionable.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the 20% deduction for pass-through income would cost the government $414.5 billion in lost revenue over 10 years. This is approximately 29 times the annual federal funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which covers nearly nine million children from low-income families.\n\nThe tax bill's generosity towards real estate titans stands in stark contrast to its stinginess towards the average wage earner. Average wage earners who would initially receive modest tax cuts would see these benefits disappear by 2025. Homeowners and others in high-cost states, such as California, New Jersey, and New York, would see their once-sizeable deductions for state and local taxes shrink to a maximum of $10,000 a year, which could potentially reduce home values.\n\nFurther, the tax bill would permanently change how tax brackets are adjusted for inflation, pushing more people into higher tax brackets over time even if they received only modest raises in salary.\n\nThe new pass-through tax loophole has raised concerns about the fairness and impact of the tax bill on different income groups and regions, with critics arguing that it disproportionately benefits the wealthy at the expense of the average American.",
    " Title: A New Era: Unprecedented Shift in Media Coverage of President-elect Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, the media's coverage of President-elect Donald Trump has shown a marked shift in tone, mirroring the inclusiveness demonstrated by Trump himself in his post-election interactions with former critics. This change in approach has been met with a mix of praise and criticism, as some view it as a positive evolution, while others see it as a blatant flip-flop.\n\nPresident-elect Trump, who was not expected to win the election by many, has reached out to critics such as Mitt Romney, Nikki Haley, and Rick Perry, who had previously criticized him harshly during the campaign. Trump's temporary truce with the media, even visiting the New York Times, has been noted, as well as his rethinking of some campaign promises, such as his abandonment of support for waterboarding, his open-mindedness on climate change, and his decision to keep two key parts of Obamacare.\n\nHowever, this positive assessment is balanced with more critical perspectives. Some argue that Trump's post-election evolution is merely a series of flip-flops, while others view it as a necessary adaptation to the role of President-elect. The media's focus on Trump's evolving views has been met with a range of reactions, from left-handed compliments to criticism of his campaign promises.\n\nCNN's Fareed Zakaria, who had previously called Trump a \"cancer on American democracy,\" has since expressed hope that Trump will continue to flip-flop on his positions. From the right, Trump critic Kathleen Parker has criticized Trump's campaign promises, while acknowledging her happiness with his new positions.\n\nTrump's efforts to bring establishment Republicans into his administration have also been met with scrutiny, with the media focusing on the potential nomination of Mitt Romney as secretary of State and the appointment of Nikki Haley as U.N. ambassador. The question of whether Trump should divest himself of his real estate empire to avoid conflicts of interest has also been a topic of discussion, as has the role of Jared Kushner in the administration.\n\nThe media's coverage of Trump's presidency is expected to remain adversarial, as is the relationship between the media and an incoming leader of the free world. However, those who believe Trump is being covered the way President-elect Obama was may have a short memory, as the media's coverage of Obama was markedly different during the same period.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Ruling on Same-sex Marriage: A New Era of Religious and LGBT Rights Conflict\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic decision, the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that states cannot ban same-sex marriage, establishing a new civil right and marking a significant victory for gay and lesbian advocates. The ruling, however, has sparked a new wave of debate and potential conflict between religious and LGBT rights.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, in his response to the ruling, urged celebrants to remember that many Americans oppose same-sex marriage based on deeply held religious beliefs. He emphasized the importance of protecting these beliefs as part of the country's commitment to religious freedom.\n\nThe decision, while acknowledging the right of faith groups to object to same-sex marriage, has been met with criticism from more conservative justices and religious groups. They argue that the ruling fails to fully address the First Amendment's \"free exercise\" clause, which they believe encompasses not just preaching and teaching, but also the \"free exercise\" of faith in various activities, including religious ceremonies, charitable works, and business operations.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, in his dissent, argued that the majority's nod towards religious liberty was a \"weak gesture,\" and that the ruling could have \"ruinous consequences.\" He suggested that the ruling could lead to conflicts between competing definitions of marriage, potentially forcing pastors and churches to participate in and endorse same-sex marriages.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia also expressed concerns about the potential clash between religious liberty and the new right to same-sex marriage. They raised questions about the implications of religious institutions, such as religious colleges and faith-based adoption agencies, when their practices conflict with the new right to same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Catholic Church and Evangelicals, who make up about 25% of the country's population, have pledged to fight the legal implications of the ruling. They fear that their sacred beliefs about marriage and sexuality could be compromised in the face of cultural and legal demands.\n\nThe Catholic Church and Evangelicals are not alone in their concerns. Archbishop William Lori of Baltimore, the U.S. Catholic bishops' point-man on religious rights, predicted a surge of legal controversies affecting the organization and running of their ministries. The Catholic Church, in particular, is concerned about the ruling's lack of acknowledgment of their right to follow their teachings when intersecting with the broader society.\n\nThe skirmish between religious and LGBT rights is expected to endure for years, potentially leading to casualties on both sides. Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, called \"religious liberty\" the \"next front in the skirmish in American life.\"\n\nIn his signature scathing style, Justice Scalia accused his colleagues of playing God, stating that the ruling on same-sex marriage \"is not of special importance to me.\" However, he added, \"who it is that rules me, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage has undoubtedly opened a new chapter in the ongoing battle between religious and LGBT rights. As the nation moves forward, it remains to be seen how this conflict will unfold and how the two sides will navigate their differences in the years to come.",
    " Title: Ferguson Grand Jury Decision Delayed, Protests Continue as Community Awaits Verdict in Michael Brown Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nResidents in Ferguson, Missouri, remain on edge as the city awaits a decision from a grand jury on whether to indict police officer Darren Wilson for the shooting death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black man. The grand jury decision, initially expected as early as this weekend, is now delayed until Monday at the earliest, according to a federal law enforcement official who spoke to media outlets on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly on the matter.\n\nProtesters took to the streets again Saturday evening, chanting slogans such as \"No justice, no peace\" and \"Mike Brown means, we've got to fight back.\" They later gathered at the Ferguson police station before moving back into the street when police in riot gear appeared. Two people were arrested for unlawful assembly, according to St. Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman.\n\nAuthorities have set up barricades around the building where the grand jury has been meeting, as well as in a shopping center parking lot where police set up a makeshift command center in the aftermath of Brown's death. Police and protesters are planning ahead, with police leaders meeting five times with some protest group leaders, resulting in them agreeing to 11 rules of engagement, such as avoiding the use of excessive force and communicating to de-escalate tense situations.\n\nPresident Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have called for people to temper their reactions. The president spoke during an ABC News interview, saying people who were upset should not use the grand jury's decision as \"an excuse for violence.\" Holder urged law enforcement officials to minimize the potential for confrontations during demonstrations.\n\nJoining in the call for calm is Michael Brown's father. In a video statement released Thursday, he said he, his family, and the entire region \"are hurting... But hurting others and destroying property is not the answer.\"\n\nIf violence or unrest does erupt, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon will call in the National Guard. He declared a state of emergency earlier this week. Some schools in the area are preparing for what comes next. The Jennings school district decided to close its schools on Monday and Tuesday, lengthening the Thanksgiving break for its students and avoiding having them in school during potential demonstrations.\n\nRegardless of what happens, Wilson reportedly is resigning from Ferguson's police force.

    " Title: Exploring the Alternative: A New Perspective on Allocating Capital and Labor in a Socialist Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from the traditional capitalist model, a new approach to allocating capital and labor is being proposed, one that prioritizes social equality and addresses regional disparities. This new system aims to move beyond the traditional financial market, focusing on the distribution of capital not just for its highest return, but to support underperforming firms and promote overall social and economic development.\n\nThe concept of sectoral councils is central to this new model. In each sector, such as healthcare, education, or manufacturing, workers from the respective firms would elect representatives to a sectoral council. These councils would be responsible for creating plans that benefit the entire sector, with the allocated capital distributed in a manner that improves the productivity and quality of every firm within that sector.\n\nThis system also emphasizes equality across sectors, with centralized research and development to ensure equal access to innovative technologies and resources. This multi-layered planning approach includes central planning, sectoral planning, regional planning, and individual firm planning, allowing for a more comprehensive and adaptable economic system.\n\nEconomist F.A. Hayek's argument that capitalism is the only system capable of revealing latent information and capacities through markets is acknowledged. However, the counterargument is that capitalism, under its current structure, systematically hides information, while socialism encourages information sharing. Hayek's focus on the capacities of entrepreneurs is recognized, but the proponents of socialism argue that the system should also focus on the potential capacities of ordinary people, particularly their ability to learn and adapt.\n\nProductivity growth in capitalism is typically around 1-2%, with the argument being that this is due to the incentives provided by capitalism. However, it is suggested that workers, given the opportunity, could come up with ideas for increased productivity that could match or even surpass this rate. The benefits of such an approach would extend far beyond productivity, proponents argue.\n\nThis new approach to economic planning and resource allocation is a significant departure from the traditional capitalist model. It represents a shift towards a more equitable and adaptable economic system, one that recognizes the potential of all members of society and prioritizes their well-being over the pursuit of profit.",
    " Title: FAA Clears Helicopter in Kobe Bryant Crash for Special Flight Through Foggy Conditions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic helicopter crash that took the lives of basketball legend Kobe Bryant, his daughter, and seven others, new details have emerged regarding the flight's clearance. According to The New York Times, the helicopter was given a special flight clearance to navigate through dense fog from Orange County toward the Los Angeles area, allowing it to enter Burbank airspace.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has confirmed that the special clearance would have permitted the pilot to fly around Burbank and Van Nuys but not from there onto Calabasas. A FAA official told The Times that a pilot is responsible for determining whether it is safe to fly in current and expected conditions, and for determining flight visibility.\n\nLos Angeles Police Sgt. Yvette Tuning, the LAPD's Air Support Division Watch commander when the crash occurred, stated that police helicopters do not typically fly under such conditions. She explained that while the weather has been favorable most of the winter, she knew that police helicopters were not going to operate in the fog that enveloped the Los Angeles basin.\n\nOfficials in Los Angeles have suggested that the dense fog may have played a role in the crash. Several experts have pointed to the poor flying conditions in the area, and fog is likely to be a key factor in the ongoing investigation, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office announced that three bodies were recovered from the scene, but the remains have not been identified. The Sikorsky S-76 helicopter went down in Calabasas, about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nAs the investigation continues, federal transportation safety investigators are examining the pilot's history, the chopper's maintenance records, and the records of its owner and operator, according to NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office has confirmed that there were nine people listed on the helicopter's manifest, and all are believed to be deceased.",
    " Title: Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings Passes Away at 68, Known for His Advocacy and Oversight of President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nMaryland Representative Elijah E. Cummings, a prominent figure in U.S. politics, passed away early Thursday at Johns Hopkins Hospital due to complications from longstanding health challenges, according to his congressional office. He was 68.\n\nBorn on January 18, 1951, Cummings, a sharecropper's son, rose through the ranks of Maryland politics to become the powerful chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform. In this role, he led multiple investigations of President Donald Trump's governmental dealings, including probes in 2019 relating to the president's family members serving in the White House.\n\nCummings' political career spanned decades, beginning with his tenure in the Maryland House of Delegates before winning his congressional seat in a special election in 1996 to replace former Rep. Kweisi Mfume. As chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cummings was instrumental in multiple investigations, using his fiery voice to highlight the struggles and needs of inner-city residents.\n\nNotably, Cummings' tenure as chairman coincided with President Trump's administration, during which he faced criticism from the president. In July 2019, Trump referred to Cummings' district as a \"rodent-infested mess\" where \"no human being would want to live.\" The comments came weeks after Trump drew bipartisan condemnation following his calls for Democratic congresswomen of color to get out of the U.S. \"right now,\" and go back to their \"broken and crime-infested countries.\"\n\nIn response, Cummings called for government officials to stop making \"hateful, incendiary comments\" that only serve to divide and distract the nation from its real problems, including mass shootings and white supremacy.\n\nThroughout his career, Cummings used his oratorical skills to advocate for the poor in his black-majority district, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore as well as more well-to-do suburbs. He was a firm believer in some much-debated approaches to help the poor and addicted, such as needle exchange programs as a way to reduce the spread of AIDS.\n\nCummings was an early supporter of Barack Obama's presidential bid in 2008. He chaired the Congressional Black Caucus from 2003 to 2004, employing a hard-charging, explore-every-option style to put the group in the national spotlight.\n\nCummings was born on a farm in South Carolina and moved to Baltimore as a young boy. Despite being told in grade school that he was too slow to learn and spoke poorly, Cummings proved the counselor wrong, becoming not only a lawyer but one of the most powerful orators in the Maryland House of Delegates. He rose to become House speaker pro tem, the first black delegate to hold the position.\n\nCummings is survived by his wife, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, and their two children, as well as five children from a previous marriage. His passing leaves a significant void in the political landscape, as he was a strong voice for the voiceless and a tireless advocate for justice and equality.",
    " Title: \"Employee Ownership and Broad-Based Asset Ownership: A New Strategy for Addressing Income Inequality in the United States\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of escalating income inequality in the United States, a movement is gaining momentum at the community level to address the issue by promoting broad-based ownership of assets. This shift, away from wealth concentration and extraction, is aimed at creating a more equitable distribution of wealth and fostering economic growth.\n\nThe Economic Confidence Index, as reported by Gallup, has plummeted by nearly 20 percent over the past 18 months, reflecting the American public's growing disillusionment with the economy. The American Dream, once a symbol of upward mobility, is increasingly out of reach for most Americans.\n\nOne solution to this problem lies in employee ownership, a model that has proven effective over several decades. Employee-owned businesses, such as Recology in San Francisco, pay higher wages, offer better retirement benefits, and exhibit increased productivity and profitability compared to traditionally owned companies. Recology, a waste collection and recycling firm with $800 million in revenues, is 100% owned by its 3,000 employees.\n\nEmployee ownership is just one of several models being embraced by local coalitions of civic, advocacy, city, and state leaders. Other models include social enterprises, municipally owned enterprises, and B Corporations, which are profit-making firms with a professed aim of social benefit.\n\nThe coming wave of company sales from aging baby boomer entrepreneurs presents a unique opportunity to promote employee ownership. Over the next decade, at least 7 million owners of privately held businesses will reach retirement age. If these businesses are sold to employees, they can represent new wealth-building opportunities for millions of Americans.\n\nCities like New York are already taking steps to advance broad-based ownership. New York has allocated $3.3 million over two years to develop worker cooperatives, and the city is home to the nation's largest worker cooperative, Cooperative Home Health Care Associates, which employs over 2,300 people and generates $60 million in revenues.\n\nBeyond municipal policy, another tool for advancing broad-based ownership is the nation's nearly 1,000 Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs), chartered to aid disadvantaged communities. These CDFIs can facilitate and finance business conversions to ESOPs or cooperatives, as demonstrated by the 2014 worker buyout of three rural Maine businesses by the Cooperative Fund of New England and Coastal Enterprises, Inc.\n\nH.R. 2096, the Promotion and Expansion of Employee Ownership Act, could further aid in the development of ESOPs by providing additional tax incentives and technical assistance for conversion. Sixty-eight percent of Americans support employee ownership, and it's no surprise why, given the model's benefits, such as greater job security, local retention, and wealth distribution.\n\nProven to be stable and sustainable models for economic growth, broad-based ownership models provide an important new strategy for reversing income inequality. As more and more cities and states develop cooperative economic models, financing of broad-based ownership is no longer on the fringe of economic debate; it's just good business.\n\nMarjorie Kelly, a Senior Fellow and Executive Vice-President of the Democracy Collaborative, is among those working towards this shift in broad-based ownership. The 50 by 50 initiative, with a goal of 50 million employee owners by 2050, is one example of the collaborative efforts underway to address income inequality and restore the American Dream.",
    " Title: US Faces Challenges in Responding to Egypt's Political Crisis Following President Morsi's Ouster\n\nArticle:\n\nThe removal of Egypt's President Mohammed Morsi by the country's military has placed the United States in a delicate position, as it grapples with how to respond to a military coup in a key Middle East partner and a major recipient of US military aid. The days ahead are likely to remain agitated and tense in Egypt, and the US will face criticism from Morsi's supporters, who will argue that the US acquiesced to the illegal removal of an elected leader who had just marked the first year of a four-year term.\n\nThe Egyptian military, in an attempt to deflect accusations of a coup, suspended the Morsi-era constitution and announced that the chief justice of Egypt's constitutional court, not a military leader, would fill the presidency until new presidential elections can be held. The new interim president is to be sworn in Thursday.\n\nThe military acted to end the country's chaotic political crisis and implement a \"roadmap to democracy\" that would have the support of Egypt's political factions and foster reconciliation, General Sissi said. The US, in an attempt to appear neutral among the dueling parties, had emphasized that \"we don't take sides\" and called on all factions to engage with each other and find a nonviolent political solution to their differences.\n\nHowever, as events in Cairo moved fast and Morsi's ouster looked likely, US officials began shifting their stance. US officials criticized Morsi over his failure to address Egyptians' concerns, particularly his defiant refusal to meet protesters' demands and vow to step down in a televised speech Tuesday.\n\nThousands of Egyptians celebrated publicly Wednesday night, but it was unclear what path Morsi's many supporters planned to take. Meanwhile, the US military was preparing for the worst in Egypt, dispatching part of a Marine crisis response team stationed in Spain to Sigonella, Italy, to shorten the team's distance from Egypt in case its intervention was needed. The United States also ordered the evacuation of its embassy in Cairo, news reports said.\n\nIn May, the US approved the annual $1.3 billion in US military aid to Egypt, despite qualms over progress in the country's democratization process, and it seems unlikely to suspend that aid even after a coup. The Egyptian military has close ties to the Pentagon, and the emphasis on civilian leaders and a \"roadmap\" to democracy appears likely to blunt any criticism in Washington.\n\nNow that Morsi is out, the US is likely to insist that it continues to take no sides and only supports \"the Egyptian people.\" However, the US was already suffering from a perception among Egyptians opposed to Morsi and the increasingly repressive actions of his Muslim Brotherhood party that it had \"tilted\" in Morsi's favor. It will take more forceful pronouncements from Washington in favor of a democratic transition to sway a public dubious of US support.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Announces Deportation Reprieve for Young Illegal Immigrants, Sparks Mixed Reactions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at addressing the contentious issue of immigration reform, the Obama administration has announced a new policy that will halt the deportation of young illegal immigrants who meet certain criteria and will begin granting work permits to them. The policy change, which could potentially affect up to 800,000 individuals, has been met with a mix of praise and skepticism, with some hailing it as a significant step forward, while others view it as a political maneuver to win over Latino voters.\n\nThe new policy, which is similar to the stalled DREAM Act, applies to individuals who were brought to the United States before they turned 16, are 30 or younger, have lived in the country for at least five years, have no criminal record, and have either attended or graduated from a U.S. high school or served in the military.\n\nThe policy change has been met with confusion and criticism, with some questioning the administration's motives and consistency. Some argue that the administration is attempting to preempt a nearly identical proposal by Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, which would also halt deportations and issue work permits but would not offer a pathway to citizenship. The left has been vocal in its disapproval of the omission of a pathway to citizenship in the Rubio plan, yet many are now supportive of the Obama administration's plan, despite the lack of a pathway to citizenship.\n\nThe administration's immigration record has been a subject of debate, with some praising the administration's efforts and others criticizing it for broken promises. In the past, the administration had pledged to use prosecutorial discretion to free from deportation proceedings individuals who had been in the country for a number of years, had U.S.-born children, or were otherwise rooted in the United States. However, these promises have not been fully realized.\n\nRuben Navarrette, a syndicated columnist, has expressed skepticism about the policy change, stating that while some DREAM'ers may benefit from the new policy, many probably will not. Navarrette argues that the idea behind the DREAM Act, which trades legal status for college attendance or military service, is still unpopular with most voters in the country, and the administration has no interest in antagonizing a wide portion of the electorate in an election year.\n\nNavarrette also points out that the administration's record on immigration has been most impressive to those who follow it least closely. In other words, the closer one follows the record, the less impressive it seems. Navarrette concludes by quoting former President Ronald Reagan, who once said, \"Trust, but verify.\" In light of the administration's record, he suggests that Latino voters, immigrant advocates, and the DREAM'ers themselves should approach this latest promise with a healthy dose of skepticism.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Weighs Treaty Option for Paris Climate Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Trump's top advisers prepare to finalize their policy on the Paris climate agreement, a new option has emerged: declaring the deal a treaty and sending it to the Senate for potential rejection. This treaty option could serve as a middle ground in the escalating debate between those who advocate for adhering to Mr. Obama's global warming agreement and the Paris agreement's detractors, who argue that Mr. Trump would be breaking a key campaign promise by not withdrawing from the pact.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump's principal advisers are set to meet to discuss a final set of recommendations for the president, with several deadlines approaching next month. At a preliminary meeting of top staffers on Tuesday, several memos and letters were circulated, outlining options, including the treaty proposal put forth by Christopher C. Horner and Marlo Lewis Jr., senior fellows at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n\nUnder their proposal, Mr. Trump could rescind Mr. Obama's decision that the Paris accord was an executive agreement, declare it a treaty, and send it to the Senate for ratification. Given the Republican control of the Senate, the agreement's opponents argue that senators would either shelve the deal or outright defeat it, thereby derailing the agreement.\n\nA briefing paper circulated among Republican senators this week stated that the deal should have been sent to Capitol Hill by Mr. Obama, but he \"knew that Congress would never approve such a flawed deal, so he refused to seek the Senate's advice and consent.\"\n\nSupporters of the Paris accord have their own memo drafted by lawyers in the State Department. That memo argues that by sending the agreement to the Senate, the president would be giving up important powers and leaving Mr. Trump and his successors open to congressional meddling.\n\nThe Paris agreement is the primary international vehicle for addressing climate change. Mr. Obama committed the U.S. to the deal in 2015 but never submitted it for ratification, stating that it was an extension of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, which the Senate ratified in 1992.\n\nThe State Department memo asserts that there are few risks to remaining part of the Paris deal, stating that the \"legal obligations are relatively few and are generally process-oriented [and] discretionary in their application or repeat existing obligations already contained in the Framework Convention.\"\n\nAs a decision nears, the positions among Mr. Trump's top advisers have become clear. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, on Tuesday, appeared to join the \"remainers,\" though he stated that the deal should be renegotiated. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is a remainer, as are perhaps Mr. Trump's closest advisers, son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump. The White House general counsel's office also appears to be leaning toward remain, sources familiar with the negotiations said.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt is pushing for withdrawal, and he is joined by U.N. Ambassador Nikki R. Haley, analysts said. Top presidential strategist Stephen K. Bannon is also a withdrawal advocate. Exxon Mobil Corp. has written a letter urging the administration to stick with the Paris agreement, and the National Mining Association said this week, after its leaders met with Mr. Pruitt, that it will push for withdrawal.\n\nThe next test for the Paris accord will be in the middle of May, when finance ministers of the Group of Seven major economies meet in Italy. The heads of state meet at the end of the month. The leaders are hoping for a communique reaffirming the Paris agreement, while opponents within the U.S. are hoping to prevent that, stating it would tie Mr. Trump's hands going forward.",
    " Title: Trump's Support Base Remains Steadfast Despite Controversies, Conditional for Others\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview, Gregory Kline, a 46-year-old Republican lawyer from Severna Park, Maryland, expressed his support for President Donald Trump, despite not voting for him in the 2016 election. Kline, who acknowledges that part of Trump's appeal comes from the anger towards the left, particularly the media, criticized the media's response to attacks by Muslim terrorists versus white supremacists.\n\nKline, who is not alone in his sentiments, believes that Trump's sometimes erratic behavior is overlooked due to a general apathy towards accountability. He cited the support Trump receives from his base, with 61% of current approvers in a recent Monmouth University poll stating they cannot imagine anything Trump could do to make them disapprove of him.\n\nHowever, for many others, support for Trump is conditional. Michael Dye, a 52-year-old engineer and the treasurer for the Republican Party in Annapolis, Maryland, expressed his disappointment in Trump's response to the neo-Nazi march at the University of Virginia, his alma mater. Dye, who voted for Trump reluctantly, felt that Trump's lack of explicit condemnation of the \"Jews will not replace us\" chant was problematic, even if it was only a portion of the crowd.\n\nThe article underscores the complexities of Trump's approval ratings, with a significant portion of his base remaining steadfast, while others' support is contingent on his actions and decisions. The poll numbers indicate a drop in support since Trump took office in January, suggesting a potential shift in public opinion.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Mobilize for Final Push in Battleground States as Election Day Nears\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final days leading up to the 2012 presidential election, both the Republican and Democratic parties are gearing up for a fierce battle in the battleground states, with each side accusing the other of voter fraud and suppression.\n\nRobert Bauer, the chief counsel for President Barack Obama's campaign, emphasized the importance of a smooth Election Day. \"The larger issue, in my view, is the scale of the effort that is required to have Election Day run smoothly,\" Bauer said. \"Any number of things can go wrong, not by anybody's fault or intention, but we are fully prepared, and so, we believe, are election officials around the country.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, both candidates presented themselves as agents of change while painting the other as an obstacle in a tight race that may hinge on the success of the campaigns' elaborate turnout operations.\n\nAt a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, President Obama scoffed at Mitt Romney's bid to claim the mantle of change, deriding him as a political quick-change artist who is repackaging the failed policies of previous Republican administrations. \"When you make this choice, part of what you're choosing is who do you trust,\" Mr. Obama said. \"After four years as president, you know me by now. You know I mean what I say and I say what I mean.\"\n\nRacing against the sun and the clock, both campaigns brimmed with confidence about their chances on Tuesday, though polls showed Mr. Obama holding a slender lead in several of the battleground states he needs to win the Electoral College. That advantage was evident in the itineraries of the two men on Sunday.\n\nWhile each covered familiar ground from New Hampshire to Ohio, Mr. Romney sought to open a new front with a rally in Pennsylvania. Tightening polls have given him hope that he can take the state from Mr. Obama, who won there by a double-digit margin in 2008. But the president's advisers dismissed the foray as a desperate move by a challenger running out of other paths to victory.\n\nAt the rally in Morrisville, Pennsylvania, Mr. Romney made a point of mentioning a high-profile supporter, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, whose lavish praise of Mr. Obama's leadership after Hurricane Sandy has raised Republican eyebrows.\n\nIn Hollywood, Florida, Mr. Obama was endorsed by Pitbull, a Cuban-American hip-hop artist, one of many celebrities lined up by the campaigns to help draw crowds. In Pennsylvania, the Marshall Tucker Band warmed up the audience for Mr. Romney, while Stevie Wonder played \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered\" for Mr. Obama at a rally in Cincinnati.\n\nHours earlier in New Hampshire, Mr. Obama spoke to 14,000 people beneath the gold dome of the State House in Concord on a bright, chilly day that recalled any number of days that he and other hopefuls had walked the streets in their quest for a victory in the nation's first presidential primaries.\n\nNearby was a reminder of how the state almost dashed Mr. Obama's dreams in 2008. On a line of paving stones in front of the New Hampshire State Library are chiseled the names of winners in the state's primary, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose victory there halted, for a time, Mr. Obama's surge after he won the Iowa caucus.\n\nOn this Sunday, however, Mr. Obama had the fortifying presence of former President Bill Clinton, who noted approvingly in his introductory speech that Mr. Obama wanted to accomplish many of the same things that Mr. Clinton had during his two terms in office.\n\n\"The test should be: What did the president do? What are the results? And compared to what?\" Mr. Clinton said. \"Compared to what could have happened, Barack Obama has done a good job.\"\n\nSavoring the moment, his voice not yet raw from too many speeches, Mr. Clinton gleefully accused Mr. Romney of shifting his position on the bailout of the automakers so many times that he could find work as \"chief contortionist in Cirque du Soleil.\"\n\nMoments earlier, in Des Moines, Mr. Romney told his supporters that the clock had nearly run out on the president's time in office, and he promised to usher in a new era of economic hope for families who are struggling across the country.\n\n\"Instead of building bridges, he's made the divide wider,\" Mr. Romney said. \"Let me tell you why it is he's fallen so short of what he promised: it's because he cared more about a liberal agenda than he did about repairing the economy.\"\n\nMr. Romney led the crowd in a call and response: \"I mean, do you think Obamacare created jobs? Did his war on coal, oil, and gas create jobs? Did Dodd-Frank regulations help banks make more loans? Does raising taxes put people to work?\"\n\n\"No,\" the crowd cried out in response to each question.\n\nIowa was also the scene of skirmishing over voting, as Republicans on Sunday night accused Democratic operatives of encouraging older voters to illegally fill out absentee ballots for their family members. A letter to the state's top election official from the chief counsel of the Republican National Committee said that a news report of \"the alleged conduct of Democratic and Obama operatives, if true, is highly disconcerting.\"\n\nWith the election being waged most intensely in fewer than a dozen states, the candidates seemed to be shadowboxing each other, with one arriving in a state just hours after the other left. After Iowa, Mr. Romney held rallies in Ohio and Virginia. He planned events in Florida, Virginia, Ohio, and New Hampshire on Monday.",
    " Title: Ceasefire in Gaza: One Killed, Tensions Remain High as Israel and Palestinians Clash at Border\n\nArticle:\n\nIsraeli troops clashed with Palestinians near the Gaza-Israel border on Friday, resulting in one fatality and 19 injuries, despite a two-day-old ceasefire between Hamas and Israel. The truce, which aims to halt cross-border attacks and airstrikes, was established after eight days of intense fighting, the bloodiest between Israel and Hamas in four years.\n\nIn a letter to the United Nations Security Council, Palestinian U.N. observer Riyad Mansour described the situation in Gaza as \"extremely fragile\" and accused Israel of violating the ceasefire and engaging in illegal actions that could jeopardize the fragile peace.\n\nHundreds of Palestinians approached the border fence in several locations in southern Gaza, testing Israel's commitment to the no-go zone established to prevent infiltrations into Israel. In one incident captured by Associated Press video, dozens of Palestinians, mostly young men, approached the fence, coming close to a group of Israeli soldiers.\n\nIsraeli soldiers reportedly warned the Palestinians to move back, and after they refused, troops fired warning shots in the air and later fired at the legs of the Palestinians. A Palestinian infiltrated into Israel during the unrest but was returned to Gaza, according to Israel's military.\n\nGaza health official Ashraf al-Kidra confirmed the death of a 20-year-old man and the injuries of 19 others near the border. Palestinian U.N. observer Mansour stated that Israeli forces fatally shot Anwar Abdulhadi Qudaih in the head and injured at least 19 other Palestinian civilians in a border area east of Khan Younis.\n\nDuring the incidents, Hamas security attempted to defuse the situation and keep the crowds away from the fence. Moussa Abu Marzouk, a top Hamas official at the ongoing negotiations in Cairo, said the violence would have no effect on the ceasefire.\n\nThe crowds were primarily made up of young men but also included farmers hoping to farm lands in the buffer zone. Speaking by phone from the buffer zone, 19-year-old Ali Abu Taimah said he and his father were checking three acres of family land that have been fallow for several years.\n\n``When we go to our land, we are telling the occupation (Israel) that we are not afraid at all,'' he said.\n\nIsrael's military stated that roughly 300 Palestinians approached the security fence at different points, attempted to damage it, and crossed into Israel. The Israeli military also reported that a Palestinian was arrested during the unrest.\n\nThe ceasefire allowed both Hamas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step back from the brink of a full-fledged war. Over eight days, Israel's aircraft carried out some 1,500 strikes on Hamas-linked targets, while Gaza fighters fired roughly the same number of rockets at Israel.\n\nThe fighting resulted in 166 Palestinian deaths, including scores of civilians, and six Israeli deaths. Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. envoy, stated that more than 1,230 Palestinians were injured, predominantly women and children.\n\nIn Cairo, Egypt is hosting separate talks with Israeli and Hamas envoys on the next phase of the ceasefire, focusing on a new border deal for blockaded Gaza. Hamas demands an end to border restrictions, while Israel insists Hamas halt weapons smuggling to Gaza.\n\nMansour also accused Israel of intensifying its use of \"excessive and lethal force\" against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in recent days and of arresting at least 230 Palestinian civilians since the Gaza fighting began, including several members of the Palestinian Legislative Council who were detained at dawn on Friday.\n\nThe Palestinian U.N. observer called on the Security Council and the international community \"to remain vigilant in their demands for a complete cessation of hostilities and for compliance by Israel.\"\n\nA poll on Friday showed that about half of Israelis think their government should have continued its Gaza offensive. The independent Maagar Mohot poll showed 49 percent of respondents felt Israel should have kept pursuing squads that fire rockets into Israel, 31 percent supported the decision to stop, and 20 percent had no opinion. Twenty-nine percent thought Israel should have sent ground troops into Gaza. The poll of 503 respondents had an error margin of 4.5 percentage points.\n\nThe same survey showed Netanyahu's Likud Party and electoral partner Israel Beiteinu losing some support, but his hard-line bloc was still favored to form the next government after January 22 elections.",
    " Title: Debt Ceiling Standoff Looms as Budget Agreement Passes Congress\n\nThe recent bipartisan budget agreement, passed by the House last week and expected to be approved by the Senate this week, has alleviated the threat of a government shutdown. However, the looming debt ceiling fight is now a pressing concern, with the potential for a U.S. government default on the horizon.\n\nIn a statement on Fox News Sunday, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) hinted at another debt ceiling standoff, stating, \"We don't want nothing out of this debt limit. We're going to decide what it is we can accomplish out of this debt limit fight.\"\n\nRyan's stance is consistent with his previous statements, as he has long advocated for using the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip for spending cuts. During the government shutdown, Ryan argued that the debt ceiling was the appropriate battleground for fiscal debates, citing historical precedents of presidents engaging in debt ceiling negotiations.\n\nWith Ryan's reputation as a fiscal conservative and his ambitions for higher office, it is unlikely he will back down from this position. This places him at odds with the White House, where Press Secretary Jay Carney reiterated on Monday that the president will not negotiate over the debt ceiling.\n\nThe standoff between Ryan and the White House could lead to another default scare early in the midterm election year, potentially in March, coinciding with the start of the 2014 primary season. This timing could put many Republicans under maximum grassroots pressure to vote against a clean debt ceiling bill.\n\nIf the two-year budget agreement marks a brief respite from the partisan tensions that have long plagued Washington, it may only serve as a temporary reprieve from the ongoing fiscal debates.",
    " Title: Protests on Immigration and Policing Disrupt Second Night of Democratic Debate in Detroit\n\nArticle:\n\nThe second night of the Democratic presidential primary debate in Detroit was disrupted twice by protesters, who aimed to highlight immigration and policing issues. The first interruption occurred during New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker's opening statement, with audience members chanting \"Fire Pantaleo.\"\n\nThe chant was a reference to Staten Island, N.Y. police officer Daniel Pantaleo, who was involved in the 2014 death of Eric Garner. Garner, who was African American, died after being placed in a chokehold by Pantaleo, who is white. Police had approached Garner, suspecting he was illegally selling cigarettes.\n\nThe video of the incident, which captured Garner saying \"I can't breathe,\" became another rallying point in the ongoing tensions between the African American community and law enforcement. It appears the protest burst was aimed at New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has been criticized for not pushing for Pantaleo's dismissal, particularly after the Justice Department declined to bring criminal charges against Pantaleo on July 16.\n\nDe Blasio does not legally have the power to fire Pantaleo, The New York Times reports. However, his handling of the issue has contributed to his low approval ratings from his constituents. Other city leaders say de Blasio\u2014who often talks about race issues through the lens of having a biracial son and who touted halting \"stop and frisk\" during his own opening statement\u2014needs to speak up.\n\nNew York City public advocate Jumaane Williams told The Times that the mayor needs to \"do something or do not mention Eric Garner's name ever again.\" Williams stated, \"You cannot be president, you cannot be the Democratic nominee if Daniel Pantaleo is still on the force.\"\n\nThe chants grew loudest not when de Blasio spoke but during Booker's time. The former Newark, N.J. mayor has pressed de Blasio on the issue, and his staff tweeted during the debate that they welcomed the interruption to draw attention to the controversy, writing, \"Good for you. That's how change is made.\"\n\nDe Blasio did later acknowledge the issue on Twitter, writing, \"While I believe that respecting the process is the best way to get justice for Eric Garner's family, I recognize and identify with the pain people across this country are feeling.\"\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro weighed in from the debate stage, saying Pantaleo should be immediately removed from the NYPD. \"Officer Pantaleo used a chokehold that was prohibited by NYPD,\" Castro said. \"He knew what he was doing, that he was killing Eric Garner, and yet he has not been brought to justice. That police officer should be off the street.\"\n\nA separate group of protesters later briefly disrupted the debate to protest former Vice President Joe Biden and the Obama administration's record on immigration. A group who identified themselves as the Cosecha Movement began chanting \"3 million deportations\" and unfurled a banner that read \"Stop all deportations on day one.\"\n\nThe group says it wants a halt to all immigrant detention and deportations on the first day of a new Democratic president's term in office. It's also pushing for reunification of families separated by deportation under the Trump administration and the immediate legalization of all estimated 11 million people who live in the country illegally.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Cosecha Movement had held a protest outside the Detroit theater and blocked traffic at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, which is an international border crossing between the U.S. and Canada.",
    " Title: Millennial Political Newcomer Stuns Democratic Establishment in New York Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nA political newcomer, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has caused a seismic shift in the US Democratic Party by defeating the incumbent congressman, Joe Crowley, in the Democratic primary for New York's 14th congressional district. The 28-year-old Ocasio-Cortez, a former Bernie Sanders volunteer from a Puerto Rican family, secured 57.5% of the vote, while Crowley, a 10-term Democrat and former party leader contender, had not faced a primary challenge in 14 years.\n\nOcasio-Cortez will now face Republican candidate Anthony Pappas in the November mid-terms. If she wins, she will become the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. The progressive candidate ran on a platform supporting universal healthcare, tuition-free college, and criminal justice reform.\n\nFollowing Ocasio-Cortez's win, Merriam-Webster tweeted that socialism was their top search item. The political novice, who identifies as a democratic socialist, had a significant grassroots following and raised more small-dollar donations than any other New York City congressional candidate.\n\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand, a top Democrat who has a political action committee designed to support women candidates, endorsed Crowley. Ocasio-Cortez responded to Gillibrand's endorsement on Twitter, stating that the New York senator \"did not even bother to talk to nor consider me before endorsing.\"\n\nThe upset victory by Ocasio-Cortez serves as a warning shot to the Democratic Party establishment. Crowley, who was seen as a potential future Speaker of the House, is now taking a forced exit from politics. In his concession speech, he paid tribute to Ocasio-Cortez with a rendition of Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run.\n\nThe liberal base's anger and energy during the Trump presidency have led to new bursts of activism, confrontation, and an anti-establishment fervor that could endanger seemingly safe Democratic politicians. The party is moving to the left, with growing support for universal healthcare and free college education.\n\nDuring her campaign, Ocasio-Cortez criticized Crowley for his ties to Wall Street and accused him of being out of touch with his increasingly diverse constituents. They thanked each other after the result, with Crowley saying he would support Ocasio-Cortez in the mid-terms.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is one of 130 women who have won primary elections for US House seats, 80% of whom are Democrats. There are still 341 women in the running in the House of Representatives, a record high, according to the latest data from the Center for Women and American Politics.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is a Bronx-born Latina, a community organizer, and educator from a working-class background. She made a viral campaign video in which she said, \"Women like me are not supposed to run for office.\" She has a degree in economics and international relations from Boston University, but after graduation, she worked as a waitress and bartender to supplement her mother's income as a house cleaner and bus driver.\n\nOcasio-Cortez decided to run for office after watching the election of Donald Trump as president. She described her congressional district in an interview with US news outlet Mic during her campaign, stating, \"Our median income is around $47,000 a year, we're about 70% people of color.\" She added, \"We've had the same representation for a generation.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez campaigned on universal healthcare, free university tuition, and an end to immigration raids. As the mid-term elections approach, her victory serves as a reminder of the power of grassroots activism and the changing political landscape of the Democratic Party.",
    " Title: House of Representatives Passes Continuing Resolution to Fund Government, Excluding Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final days leading up to the expiration date for America's \"temporary budget,\" the House of Representatives has passed a continuing resolution that will fund all parts of the government at sequestration levels through Dec. 15. However, the resolution does not include funding for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nThe move by the House is in line with the Republican position that if the health care law is not ready to be implemented in full, the American people should not be paying for it. The Republicans are not calling for a government shutdown, but rather an \"Obamacare shutdown.\"\n\nThe House has found a way to fund the government without funding Obamacare, following thousands of calls from constituents nationwide and a tumultuous August town hall recess. The question remains, however, as to why the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, and the Senate Democrats are so vehemently defending a law that has been a revolving door of procedural failures and harmful unintended consequences.\n\nTo date, there have been more than 20 delays, exemptions, and revisions to Obamacare, including a delay of the employer mandate for businesses. Sen. Max Baucus, Montana Democrat, one of the law's primary architects, predicted that implementation of the 2,000-plus page law would prove a \"train wreck.\"\n\nObamacare disproportionately burdens the most vulnerable among us. Young Americans will pay higher costs to subsidize the older and wealthier. According to Investor's Business Daily, four different industries have cut their workweeks below 30 hours since Obamacare was signed into law, harming low-income hourly-wage earners the most.\n\nPublic discontent for the law continues to grow. A recent FreedomWorks national poll found that an overwhelming 82 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents favor a continuing resolution that \"does not include funding for Obamacare.\" Only 17 percent of all voters think Obamacare will have a positive personal impact, a new low point since the law was passed in March 2010.\n\nSixty-two percent of all voters prefer a \"patient-centered\" health care system that allows for competition and choice. The people have spoken, and members of Congress are beholden to their constituents\u2014not the other way around.\n\nThen why would Mr. Reid refuse to compromise, and instead strip the defunding language from the continuing resolution and hold the government hostage? The answer remains to be seen as the Senate considers the House-passed resolution.",
    " Title: \"GOP Health Care Bill: A Race Against Time as Republicans Seek to Replace ObamaCare\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to replace the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare), Congressional Republicans are facing a critical juncture, with some drawing inspiration from the King of Rock and Roll, Elvis Presley, as they croon the tune of \"It's Now or Never.\" House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) has urged his fellow Republicans to act swiftly, stating, \"We can act now or we can keep fiddling around and squander this opportunity to repeal ObamaCare.\"\n\nThe Republican health care bill is currently under scrutiny, with some conservative lawmakers and interest groups criticizing the GOP legislation as \"ObamaCare-lite.\" Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky) has expressed his concerns, stating, \"We have to admit we are divided on replacement.\" House Freedom Caucus co-chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) has also voiced his reservations.\n\nThe passage of the Republican health care bill hinges on the numbers. The GOP can only lose 21 votes before the measure fails on a party-line vote. The Freedom Caucus, with its bylaw that compels its members to vote as a bloc if 80% of its members feel the same on a given issue, holds significant sway. If enough members of the Freedom Caucus balk at the bill, it could be incinerated on the floor.\n\nTo address these concerns, the Trump administration has deployed Budget Director and Freedom Caucus founder Mick Mulvaney and Vice President Mike Pence to liaise with congressional Republicans. Pence has reportedly told Freedom Caucus members that the bill is still open for negotiation, but after a lunch meeting with Senate Republicans, he suggested the bill might not be that agile.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus, like the Democratic Blue Dog coalition that was key to approving ObamaCare, could play a pivotal role in the GOP health care bill's passage. The question now is how lawmakers will contour the GOP health care plan to their liking and what amendments might the GOP brass permit. Is there flexibility? What happens if just enough Republicans balk at the bill?\n\nThe American Health Care Act (AHCA) is the first test of President Trump's legislative power, according to House Republican Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) after a White House confab. The margin to pass this bill could be tight, and Ryan and other AHCA supporters must earn the support of skeptics in their own party, not antagonize them.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has expressed confidence in securing the necessary votes, predicting, \"We will have 218 votes, I can guarantee you.\" Ryan only needs 216 to approve the AHCA. The bill must be passed by the end of the month, according to Ryan, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) aiming for early April. The bill could calcify if it sits out too long. In 2009 and 2010, congressional Democrats burned nearly 10 months approving ObamaCare.\n\nAs the King sings, \"It's now or never\" \u2013 if Republicans are to repeal and replace ObamaCare. \"Tomorrow will be too late.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Presidential Candidates' Divergent Views on Iran Nuclear Agreement and Iraq War Lessons\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing U.S. presidential race, the candidates' views on foreign policy, particularly the Iran nuclear agreement and the lessons learned from the Iraq and Afghan wars, are coming under scrutiny.\n\nRecently, Donald J. Trump, a candidate with minimal foreign policy experience, proposed seizing oil fields that fund extremist groups, a proposal that drew a sharp rebuke from the retiring Army chief of staff, Gen. Ray Odierno, who led American troops during the worst days of the Iraq war. Gen. Odierno cautioned Mr. Trump and other candidates about the need to ensure \"sustainable outcomes\" after American troops leave, a central lesson from the Iraq and Afghan wars.\n\nThe debate about short-term versus long-term results, and American strength or weakness, is also playing out in the debate over the nuclear agreement with Iran, signed a month ago in Vienna. All Republican candidates oppose the agreement, with Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin advocating for tearing up the accord on his first day in office. This stance, however, risks leaving the Iranians free to resume their nuclear program, which, by the Obama administration's own estimates, has brought them within two or three months of \"breakout,\" the production of one weapon's worth of highly enriched uranium.\n\nSome candidates, such as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, are more cautious, stating they would not immediately abrogate the agreement. Candidates are, however, largely silent on what they would replace the agreement with or how they would prevent Iran from resuming its nuclear program if the deal is abandoned.\n\nMarco Rubio, the Florida senator, has proposed reimposing the sanctions waived by President Obama and working with Congress to impose new crushing sanctions. Yet, even he has not addressed what good reimposing those sanctions would do if America's negotiating partners\u2014China, Russia, and three European powers\u2014refuse to go along.\n\nThe ongoing debate underscores the importance of foreign policy experience and the need for candidates to articulate clear, feasible, and sustainable solutions to complex global issues.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Impact of Local Newspaper Closures on Political Polarization\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the era of constant political news, the national media landscape has seen significant growth, with major outlets such as The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and CNN experiencing increased digital subscriptions and viewership. However, local newspapers have not fared as well, with a drastic decline in ad revenues, workforce, and circulation over the past decade.\n\nA new study by political scientists and communications scholars has found a direct correlation between the decline of local news and political polarization. The research, published in the journal Political Behavior, suggests that the loss of local newspapers contributes to increased political polarization, making governing more challenging at both the local and national levels.\n\nThe study, which focused on split-ticket voting as a measure of polarization, found that in areas where local newspapers have closed or merged, voters are more likely to vote for the same party for both presidential and senatorial elections. This shift in voting patterns is significant, with the difference in voting choices often being enough to decide close elections, as seen in the 2018 U.S. House races in Minnesota's 1st district, Utah's 4th district, and Illinois's 13th district.\n\nThe researchers examined 110 newspaper closures between 2009 and 2012, comparing split-ticket voting in the 2012 election in those counties to statistically similar counties that did not lose a newspaper. The majority of closed newspapers were weeklies, such as the Clarke Courier of Virginia or the Boston Phoenix, though the data also included some major metropolitan dailies like Denver's Rocky Mountain News.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the decline of local newspapers and the \"nationalization\" of political news are polarizing vote choice. Voters are more likely to vote for the same party for president and senator after a newspaper closes in their community, compared to voters in statistically similar areas where a newspaper did not close.\n\nThe researchers considered two explanations for their finding: either people switched to national news once their local newspaper closed or they lost the information they needed to vote in more local races. The study found no evidence of increased \"ballot roll-off,\" indicating that people did not feel less informed about local politics after the closure of their local newspaper. Instead, the partisan voting is likely due to switching to national news rather than feeling less informed about local politics.\n\nThe study also addressed the possibility that the correlation between local newspaper closures and political polarization might be due to the economic conditions in the areas where newspapers closed. However, the researchers found no correlation between split-ticket voting in 2012 in places that lost a newspaper shortly thereafter and areas with similar economic conditions but no newspaper closure.\n\nThe study's findings underscore the importance of local newspapers in maintaining a focus on community issues and promoting informed voting. The researchers suggest that if Americans can support local news with their dollars and attention, it could help to push back against the partisan polarization that has taken over American politics today.",
    " Title: Senate Intelligence Committee Report Confirms Al Qaeda Involvement in Benghazi Attack\n\nA bipartisan report by the Senate Intelligence Committee has concluded that individuals linked to Al Qaeda groups were involved in the 2012 Benghazi attack, challenging previous assertions that the terror network played no role in the incident. The report, released on Monday, comes nearly a year after then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's controversial statement, \"What difference, at this point, does it make?\"\n\nThe administration initially attributed the attack to a protest, but subsequent assessments have provided a more complex narrative. However, administration officials have consistently downplayed Al Qaeda's involvement, citing a New York Times report that supported their claims.\n\nThe report, while not implicating Al Qaeda's \"core\" leadership, does blame significant Al Qaeda branches, including Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). The report states, \"Individuals affiliated with terrorist groups, including AQIM, Ansar al-Sharia, AQAP, and the Mohammad Jamal Network, participated in the September 11, 2012, attacks.\"\n\nThe militant group Ansar al-Sharia, separately labeled as a terror group by the State Department last week, is alleged to have played a role in the Benghazi strike.\n\nThe Senate committee report emphasizes that the intelligence suggests the attack was not \"highly coordinated,\" but rather \"opportunistic\" - possibly set up in \"short order\" following protests in other regions over an anti-Islam film. The report, however, reiterates that there was no protest in Benghazi before the attack.\n\nThe report also delves into the security lapses at the U.S. mission in Benghazi before the attack. The committee determined the attack was \"preventable\" and the administration failed to respond to \"ample\" warnings that security was deteriorating before Sept. 11, 2012.\n\nThe report faults the State and Defense departments for their roles in the security failures. It also criticizes the Obama administration for its failure to \"bring the attackers to justice.\"\n\nThe report provides a detailed account of a possible failed ambush, where attackers attempted to lure the CIA into the hospital where Ambassador Chris Stevens' body was being held.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) stated, \"The committee worked on a bipartisan basis to investigate the various allegations that have come out since the terrorist attacks in Benghazi in September 2012 and to get to the truth about what happened leading up to, during, and after the attacks.\"\n\nSen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), the top Republican on the panel, also said the report provides \"needed and deserved answers.\"\n\n\"In spite of the deteriorating security situation in Benghazi and ample strategic warnings, the United States Government simply did not do enough to prevent these attacks and ensure the safety of those serving in Benghazi,\" Chambliss said.",
    " Title: Iowa Democratic Caucuses: Buttigieg and Sanders in Virtual Tie, Warren in Third Place\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the latest results released overnight, former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont are in a virtual tie in the Iowa Democratic caucuses, with Buttigieg holding a slight lead of 3 out of 1,097 votes. With 97 percent of precincts reporting, Buttigieg has 26.2 percent of state delegate equivalents, while Sanders has 26.1 percent.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts trails in third place with 18.2 percent, followed by former Vice President Joe Biden with 15.8 percent and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota with 12.2 percent. No other Democratic presidential candidates broke the double-digit level in state delegate equivalents in the caucuses, which were marred by technical problems.\n\nSanders leads the popular vote, getting 26.5 percent compared to Buttigieg's 25 percent. That translates into a difference of about 2,500 votes. Warren is also in third place in the popular vote in Iowa, getting more than 18,000 votes.\n\nButtigieg had held a narrow lead over Sanders in earlier tallies of state delegate equivalents. The chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, Troy Price, said in a call with state party officials Wednesday night that full results should be released by Thursday morning, according to CNN.

    " Title: New Poll Shows Tightening Race Between Trump and Biden, Trump Gaining Ground in Potential 2020 Matchup\n\nArticle:\n\nA new CNN/SSRS poll indicates a narrowing gap between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden in a potential general election matchup, with Biden leading Trump 49% to 44%. The poll also shows closer matchups between Trump and other leading Democratic contenders, including South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nCompared to polling taken in October, the Democratic margin in all head-to-heads has been reduced by at least 5 points. The polling data suggests that Trump is gaining ground, with his lead over the other leading Democrats increasing since October.\n\nIn the 15 closest states of the 2016 election, where the presidential contest was decided by 8 or fewer points, Trump is in a stronger position. None of the Democrats led in CNN's December poll, which follows other swing state polling suggesting that Trump could win the electoral college while losing the popular vote, as he did in 2016.\n\nThe shift in Trump's favor nationally coincides with an upward movement in his personal popularity. His net favorable rating (favorable - unfavorable) stood at -6 points among voters in CNN's latest poll. This is a significant improvement from the -12 points he had in the two prior CNN polls that asked the question.\n\nThe average poll also shows Trump at the high end in his popularity. According to the FiveThirtyEight aggregate, this week Trump hit his highest approval rating among voters (45%) since March 2017. The upward trajectory in Trump's popularity is likely, at least in part, due to the economy. While most people generally think the economy is good, a booming 76% said it was good in the CNN poll out this week, the highest percentage since 2001.\n\nThe impeachment of Trump does not seem to be making much of an impact on the polls. This could be because fewer voters say it's an extremely or very important issue to their vote than any other issue tested by CNN in November. Additionally, it could be because opposition to impeaching and removing Trump is higher than Trump's popularity ratings. This means more talk of impeachment may actually move Trump's approval rating up.\n\nAnother factor helping Trump is that presidential elections are not referendums. He will have a named Democratic opponent. None of the leading Democrats had a positive net favorability rating among voters in CNN's December poll. The drop in the Democrats' popularity could be because they are involved in a competitive primary, which is hurting their intra-party favorability ratings. None of the Democrats are anywhere near as popular among their own party's voters as Trump is with his. This could change once the primary ends, though.\n\nIndeed, it's not like Trump is in a great position. The two most likely Democratic nominees, Biden and Sanders, are ahead of him by 7 points and 4 points, respectively, in the average poll. Most incumbent presidents have been leading their potential opposition at this point before the election.",
    " Title: Trump's Approval Rating Remains Steady Amidst Controversy: A Look at the Current Political Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of President Donald Trump's controversial joint press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a recent poll has shown that Trump's approval rating has risen to 45 percent, marking his highest level in the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll since taking office. This resilience in Trump's approval rating has left Democrats puzzled, as they grapple with the implications for the 2018 midterm elections and the 2020 presidential race.\n\nThe polls, which included responses both before and after the Helsinki summit, suggest a more pronounced negative impact may not be immediately apparent. However, the share of Americans who strongly approve of Trump, at 29 percent, is significantly outweighed by the 44 percent who strongly disapprove. This disparity could potentially translate into greater intensity among Democratic voters, a factor that could be crucial given that Democratic-leaning voting blocs tend to turn out less reliably in midterm elections.\n\nDespite the Democrats' lead in the so-called generic ballot shrinking to 6 percentage points, there is continued faith among Democrats that they will make gains in November. Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, believes a takeover of both the House and Senate is a real possibility for the Democrats.\n\n\"The intensity is there. Democratic voters are paying a lot more attention, they are a lot more interested in participating,\" Devine said. He added that the party does not need to adopt a one-size-fits-all approach to framing the election, emphasizing the need for unique, district-specific strategies.\n\nThe polarizing nature of Trump's approach has led some to question whether he has alienated a significant swath of the voting public, potentially to the detriment of his party. Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist, believes that Trump's conduct during the news conference with Putin and the subsequent days has \"really locked in\" the 55 or 56 percent who disapprove of him, making it more difficult for a Republican candidate for Congress to win them over.\n\nThe reasons behind Trump's strong loyalty from his base remain a topic of debate. Robert Shrum, a Democratic strategist who has worked on several presidential campaigns, argues that economic factors are less relevant than emotional responses, stating, \"I just think there is a deep emotional investment in him by a shrinking Republican Party.\"\n\nDevine, on the other hand, attributes Trump's strong economy and his anti-media stance as contributing factors to his support. He also suggests that support for Trump is more complex than the headline figures from a poll might indicate, with voters holding mixed feelings about the president.\n\nFor the moment, the idea of a Trump collapse looks increasingly unrealistic, at least in the short term. This leaves both his supporters and opponents with much to consider as the political landscape continues to evolve.",
    " Title: Ex-IRS Commissioner's Wife Tied to Liberal Campaign Finance Reform Group Amid IRS Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing scrutiny surrounding the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scandal, a new development has emerged involving the former IRS commissioner, Douglas Shulman. Shulman, who led the agency during the period when it targeted conservative groups between 2010 and 2012, has been under fire following a report of his frequent visits to the White House during the Obama administration.\n\nIt has been revealed that Shulman's wife, Susan L. Anderson, is a senior program adviser for the Washington-based group Public Campaign. The group, which claims to be nonpartisan, is working with a broad range of organizations to reform campaign-finance rules.\n\nHowever, Public Campaign receives significant funding from liberal groups such as the Ford Foundation, Barbra Streisand's The Streisand Foundation, and Health Care for America NOW, a coalition of labor unions supporting ObamaCare that includes the AFL-CIO and the Service Employees International Union, according to the Public Campaign website.\n\nThe group's stance on campaign finance has also come under scrutiny. In 2011, Public Campaign produced a \"holiday card\" video that suggested the wealthiest Americans, specifically the top 1 percent, were trying to buy or influence elections by secretly donating to political groups.\n\nThe video, which depicted a person saying \"Sure, my kids might get asthma because Congress keeps doing dirty energy's bidding, but the Koch brothers need their third home,\" is a clear reference to David and Charles Koch, successful businessmen aligned with conservative and libertarian causes. The Koch brothers have nonprofit groups like the David H. Koch Charitable Foundation and support Tea Party-tied heavyweights like FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity.\n\nWhen the IRS scandal over the targeting of conservative groups broke, Public Campaign appeared to defend the tax agency. Nick Nyhart, the group's chief executive, suggested to ABC News that the misdeeds of a \"few bad apples\" within the agency will \"make it harder for those questions to be asked without claims of bias.\"\n\nAnderson, who has also been a supporter and apparent participant in the Occupy Wall Street movement, has tweeted messages such as \"DC, good morning! Come down to the (National) Mall and tell your 99 percent story.\"\n\nShulman and Anderson met as students at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Shulman was appointed commissioner by former President George W. Bush. He reportedly logged more than 100 visits to the White House under Obama, a claim he did not deny during congressional testimony last month on the IRS scandal. That number refers to the number of times Shulman was cleared to visit.",
    " Title: U.S. to Issue Guidance on Reducing Unnecessary COVID-19 Testing, Aims to Improve Turnaround Times\n\nThe United States is set to release new guidance aimed at reducing unnecessary COVID-19 testing and expediting test results, according to Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The guidance is intended to discourage individuals who have completed home quarantine from getting retested before returning to work or school, as such tests are currently \"clogging up the system.\"\n\nGiroir, speaking on a call with reporters, emphasized that retesting is generally unnecessary for individuals who have recovered from COVID-19, except for critically ill patients in hospitals or those with immune system deficiencies who may continue to test positive for longer periods.\n\nTurnaround times for COVID-19 tests remain an issue, with only 26 states currently taking three days or less to produce test results, while one state is taking more than five days. The new guidance is not a response to testing shortages, Giroir clarified, but rather a measure to ensure that tests are only conducted when necessary.\n\nThe U.S. government is working towards facilitating a transition from lab-based tests, which can have longer turnaround times, to point-of-care tests, which can provide results in minutes and can be conducted in a wider variety of locations. The U.S. government expects that 20 million point-of-care tests will be available per month by September.\n\nOn Wednesday, Becton Dickinson announced that the U.S. government had agreed to purchase 750,000 of its point-of-care tests. The new guidance on testing is expected to be released soon, providing further details on the specific measures aimed at reducing unnecessary testing and improving turnaround times for COVID-19 tests.",
    " Title: Biden Expresses Regret to Anita Hill Over 1991 Supreme Court Hearings, but Hill Calls for More Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to address a defining moment from his past, former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for president, contacted Anita Hill to express his regret for the way he handled her testimony during the 1991 Supreme Court hearings. However, Hill, who is now a law professor, was not \"satisfied\" with the conversation and did not consider it an apology.\n\nBiden, who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee during the hearings, contacted Hill earlier this month to express his \"regret for what she endured\" during the hearing. This conversation took place just before Biden launched his 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Hill stated, \"I cannot be satisfied by simply saying I'm sorry for what happened to you. I will be satisfied when I know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose.\"\n\nBiden has previously apologized for allowing an all-male and all-white panel of lawmakers to aggressively question Hill during the hearing, where she accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment.\n\nHill told the newspaper that she could not support Biden until he takes responsibility for his behavior. She emphasized, \"The focus on apology to me is one thing, but he needs to give an apology to the other women and to the American public because we know now how deeply disappointed Americans around the country were about what they saw.\"\n\nBiden publicly addressed his treatment of Hill last month at an event in New York City honoring students who helped fight sexual violence on college campuses. He acknowledged, \"She faced a committee that didn't fully understand what the hell this was all about. To this day, I regret I couldn't give her the kind of hearing she deserved.\"\n\nHill's comments come as Biden faces allegations from several women who have accused him of unwanted, inappropriate behavior. In response, Biden stated, \"Social norms are changing. I understand that, and I've heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful of personal space in the future.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Biden's 2020 campaign confirmed his outreach to Hill, stating, \"They had a private discussion where he shared with her directly his regret for what she endured and his admiration for everything she has done to change the culture around sexual harassment in this country.\"",
    " Title: Facebook's Study Suggests Limited Impact of News Feed Algorithm on Political Bias, Sparking Mixed Reactions Among Academics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent study published in the journal Science, Facebook has revealed that its News Feed algorithm, which determines what content appears on users' feeds, may have a limited impact on reinforcing political biases among its users. The study, which analyzed the sharing and engagement of news articles among Facebook's 1.3 billion users, has been met with mixed reactions from academics.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, about 30 percent of American adults get their news from Facebook. However, the editorial decisions behind the News Feed algorithm have been criticized for their lack of transparency. The study's results could potentially be used by Facebook to demonstrate that the algorithm is not negatively influencing national discourse.\n\nFacebook's researchers were given wide latitude to pursue their research interests and present their findings without interference. The study was reviewed before publication, with an anonymous panel of scholars unaffiliated with Facebook overseeing the process. Science, the journal where the study was published, does not disclose the identity of its reviewers and advises them to declare any potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThe study differed from a controversial one from last year, in which Facebook's scientists manipulated the number of positive and negative posts that some users saw to examine the effects on mood. This study did not involve any experimentation that altered users' experience of Facebook; instead, researchers analyzed how people use Facebook as it currently exists.\n\nFor the study, researchers first identified the political leanings of news articles by determining whether liberals or conservatives had shared them most. They found predictable partisan attitudes towards certain news sources, with Fox News stories being shared primarily by conservatives and Huffington Post articles being shared by liberals.\n\nResearchers then measured how often feeds of users, whose identifying details had been removed, displayed stories that contradicted their professed ideologies, and how often they clicked on those stories.\n\nSome academics have expressed concerns that Facebook could easily manipulate the News Feed to create a more insular echo chamber. David Lazer, a political scientist at Northeastern University who studies social networks, wrote in a commentary on the Facebook study also published in Science, \"A small effect today might become a large effect tomorrow. The deliberative sky is not yet falling, but the skies are not completely clear either.\"\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the News Feed algorithm may have a limited impact on reinforcing political biases among its users. However, the study's conclusions have sparked debate among academics, with some expressing concerns about the potential for Facebook to manipulate the News Feed in the future.",
    " Title: Gaetz, Gohmert, and Biggs Call for Mueller's Recusal Amid Uranium One Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the first indictments in the ongoing investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL) has introduced a resolution calling for the resignation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Gaetz, along with Reps. Louie Gohmert of Texas and Andy Biggs of Arizona, cite Mueller's involvement in the \"Uranium One\" controversy, during which he served as FBI Director.\n\nThe Uranium One scandal refers to a deal approved by the Obama administration that allowed a Russian company to purchase a controlling interest in Uranium One, a Canadian mining company. Gaetz, in a statement, argued that evidence has emerged that the FBI withheld information from Congress and the American people about Russian corruption of American uranium companies. He further stated that a confidential U.S. witness revealed that Russia had compromised an American uranium tracking firm through bribery and financial kickbacks.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Clinton did not have the ability to approve or veto the sale. Her involvement was as one of nine cabinet members of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Only the president can decide to block a sale for national security reasons, and none of the other eight members or President Obama voted against or blocked the sale.\n\nThe resolution comes as a faction on the right continues to question Mueller's impartiality, with some arguing that his involvement in the Uranium One deal compromises his ability to lead the Russia investigation impartially. While a recent report found that roughly 20 Republican Senators have expressed support for Mueller and his investigation, there is still a faction on the right that believes Mueller should resign.\n\nThe White House has stated that President Trump has \"no intention\" of firing Mueller, but Trump himself has certainly left the possibility open. During a New York Times interview in July, Trump responded to a question about Mueller's focus on the Trump family finances by saying, \"I would say yeah. I would say yes.\" This suggests that if Trump were to fire Mueller, he would have the support of some members in Congress.\n\nThe resolution introduced by Gaetz, Gohmert, and Biggs is a clear indication of the ongoing political divide surrounding the Russia investigation and the Uranium One controversy. It remains to be seen whether this resolution will gain traction in Congress and whether it will further complicate the ongoing investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.",
    " Title: The Decline of Community Organizations in America: A Threat to Democracy and Freedom\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the spirit of the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville, who observed the unique role of community organizations in the United States during his visit in the 1830s, it is crucial to examine the current state of these associations and their impact on American society.\n\nDe Tocqueville noted the prevalence of non-political community organizations in the U.S., which ranged from religious and educational to recreational and charitable. These groups played a significant role in fostering a sense of community and self-reliance, as Americans relied on each other rather than relying on the government.\n\nFast forward to the present day, and a concerning trend has emerged. According to political scientist Robert Putnam, Americans are increasingly isolating themselves, with a significant decline in membership in community organizations since the 1960s. This decline has been observed in various groups, including the Elks, the PTA, and Kiwanis, among others.\n\nPutnam's research reveals a startling decrease in social interactions, with a nearly 60% drop in the number of Americans attending club meetings, more than 40% drop in the number of family dinners, and more than 30% drop in the number of people having friends over. This fracturing of community organizations has led to a weakening of the social fabric, with a growing political polarization and a lack of meaningful relationships across ideological divides.\n\nThe decline of community organizations has far-reaching implications for American democracy and freedom. As de Tocqueville warned, an ever-growing government may not be able to effectively replace the \"innumerable multitude of small undertakings\" that American citizens execute every day. Moreover, the lack of cross-ideological relationships makes it difficult to share the ideals of freedom and to change hearts and minds.\n\nIn the face of this trend, it is essential for Americans to recommit to their communities. By joining social clubs, civic organizations, or other groups, and making an effort to build relationships with people who live near us, we can help to strengthen our communities and save the country. After all, as de Tocqueville observed, \"Americans of all ages, all conditions, all minds constantly unite.\" Let us remember the power of community and work together to build a stronger, more connected America.",
    " Title: Republican Leadership Vows to Avoid Gridlock and Infighting in New Congressional Term\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of their recent midterm election victories, the Republican leadership in Congress has signaled a shift towards unity and a more pragmatic approach to governance. According to Politico, incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that he will not support conservative calls to use the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip for spending cuts, a move that triggered the government shutdown last year.\n\nIn a statement, McConnell emphasized the need to avoid the fiscal fights that have eroded public confidence in Washington and characterized the GOP-controlled House in past years. \"Emboldened by sweeping midterm election victories,\" McConnell said, \"Republican leaders are vowing not to repeat the errors of past years.\"\n\nMcConnell has also made it clear that he will not allow a government shutdown to occur during his tenure. In his victory speech on Tuesday night, he extended an olive branch to President Barack Obama, stating that the GOP has a \"duty\" to work with the White House on issues they agree on.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner is also reportedly planning to be a \"responsible leader,\" and to maintain unity within the party to capitalize on its political dominance, according to Politico. The leadership may feel more justified in demanding loyalty from the conservative wing of the party, given that the victories from this election cycle were largely the result of the party's early backing of establishment candidates, some of whom represent moderate districts.\n\nOhio GOP Rep. Steve Stivers, a close ally of Boehner, told Politico that the election results have given the Republicans a \"working majority\" and that they will be pursuing a \"responsible Republican agenda.\" Stivers added that the party will not veer hard right, but will instead focus on issues that are \"straight down the fairway.\"\n\nMcConnell and Boehner have already outlined their legislative agenda, with their top priority being to help the struggling middle class. They plan to pass many of the bills that the House has already approved, a move that they believe will signal that the logjam in Washington has been broken and will establish a foundation of certainty and stability.\n\nThe leadership will also be aware that unity could be crucial to maintaining the Senate majority in 2016, when a number of senators from blue and purple states are up for re-election, according to Politico. The Republican leadership's focus on unity and pragmatism could mark a significant shift in the political landscape and may lead to a more productive and less contentious Congress in the coming years.",
    " Title: Republican Party Shifts Stance on Marijuana Laws: A Look at the 2016 Presidential Hopefuls' Views\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2016 presidential race heats up, a significant shift in the Republican Party's stance on marijuana laws is becoming increasingly evident. Traditionally, the GOP has been critical of marijuana and its medicinal value, but several key figures are advocating for a softening of federal marijuana laws, marking a dramatic departure from the party's recent contenders.\n\nSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky has been the most vocal on the issue, advocating for the federal government to leave marijuana regulation to the states. Texas Governor Rick Perry also supports state-level control of marijuana laws, citing drug courts in his state that he believes have contributed to Texas' movement towards decriminalization.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie, on the other hand, has pledged to end the \"failed war on drugs,\" a policy initiated by President Nixon, a Republican, in 1971.\n\nErik Altieri, a spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, noted this shift, stating, \"This is something that probably would have been unimaginable in 2008: that GOP front-runners for president would be talking in terms of being smart on crime rather than hard on crime.\"\n\nIn 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney vowed to fight marijuana legalization, even for medical use, and the 2008 nominee, Senator John McCain, labeled marijuana as a \"gateway drug.\" However, Mr. McCain signaled a change in attitude in September, stating, \"Maybe we should legalize\" marijuana.\n\nThe change in stance is not limited to the Republican Party. In a New Yorker interview this month, President Obama, who has acknowledged using marijuana in his youth, said marijuana may be less dangerous than alcohol.\n\nDespite federal laws classifying marijuana as a Schedule I substance, making it illegal to manufacture or distribute the drug, the Obama administration has stated it will allow states leeway as long as they do not see evidence of criminal gangs trafficking the drug or children gaining access.\n\nThis shift in marijuana policy is gaining traction in states that will be crucial in the 2016 elections, such as New Hampshire, which hosts the first-in-the-nation presidential primaries. In states that permit medical marijuana, it is commonly prescribed for chronic pain, nausea from cancer chemotherapy, glaucoma, and some other conditions.\n\nAn NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll released this week found that 55 percent of those surveyed would support efforts in their states similar to those in Colorado and Washington, where marijuana is legal for recreational use by adults over 21.\n\nAs the 2016 presidential race unfolds, the evolving views on marijuana laws among Republican candidates promise to be a significant factor in the political landscape.",

The meeting, which took place on the northern side of the Panmunjom truce village, was held between 15:00 and 17:00 local time (06:00 and 08:00 GMT), according to South Korean President Moon Jae-in's office.\n\nBoth leaders exchanged opinions on the successful holding of the North Korea-US summit, with South Korea's office stating that President Moon would announce the outcome of the talks on Sunday morning. In response, US President Donald Trump's administration confirmed that an advance team of White House and Department of State officials would leave for Singapore this weekend to prepare for a possible summit there.\n\nThe potential meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-un would focus on ways to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and reduce tensions. The US has expressed a desire for the complete and irreversible dismantling of North Korea's nuclear program and weapons, allowing international inspectors to monitor every step of the process before any sanctions are lifted. In contrast, North Korea views denuclearization as a more reciprocal agreement, with the expectation of comparable gestures from Washington, such as a reduction in the US military presence in South Korea and Japan.\n\nThe scheduled summit faced uncertainty when North Korea expressed displeasure over comments from senior US officials, who made comparisons with the case of Libya, where former leader Colonel Gaddafi gave up his nuclear program only to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later.\n\nThe leaders of both Koreas held a historic meeting at the border in April, marking the first time the Korean leaders had met to hold talks since 2007. At the meeting, Kim Jong-un expressed a desire to \"write a new chapter\" for the region's troubled history and to \"start a new history from now, at the historic starting point of an era of peace.\"\n\nFuture economic cooperation between the Koreas was also discussed, with Kim Jong-un admitting that the North's critical infrastructure was in need of improvement. Such projects are likely to have suffered under international and US sanctions, imposed on the North in response to its nuclear program and missile tests.",
    " Title: New Jersey Senator Cory Booker's Testimony Against Sessions: A Call for Civility and Respect in Political Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker testified against Sen. Jeff Sessions' nomination to be attorney general in Washington, on January 11, 2017. The exchange, captured by Joshua Roberts of Reuters, has sparked a debate on civility and respect in political discourse.\n\nThe incident has brought to light the term \"manterrupting,\" a phenomenon where male senators interrupt female senators during hearings. In two separate hearings, California Democrat Kamala Harris was interrupted. The exchange between Booker and Harris, in particular, has been a subject of discussion, with Booker's behavior being criticized for its intensity and tone.\n\nThe exchange, if it had involved a conservative male senator and a progressive female cabinet secretary, would likely have been met with strong criticism from the liberal side. However, Booker's outburst was met with applause from some, with him proudly tweeting out his rant, quoting himself as if he had just had \"a moment.\"\n\nThe incident has led to a broader discussion on identity politics, with many arguing that the Left's \"respect for women\" often stops when a female politician, pundit, or activist leans slightly to the right of moderate. The human capacity for rationalization and self-justification, it seems, is nearly infinite, and it was on display during the exchange.\n\nThe incident has also highlighted the hypocrisy that pervades political discourse, with many of the same Democrats who are critical of President Trump's words and actions once cheering similar comments from other politicians. The double standards and selective outrage have led many to question the sincerity of lamentations about \"norms,\" \"values,\" and \"civility.\"\n\nIn the end, the only way to restore a measure of civility and dignity to public debate is to treat people with respect, even when one is angry. As a retired federal judge once said, \"When you're troubled, even when you're angry, endeavor to speak with regret, not outrage.\" This thoughtful approach, it seems, is what is needed to cut through the noise and rebuild our body politic.\n\nDavid French, a senior writer for \u2588\u2588\u2588 and a senior fellow at the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Institute, and an attorney, has called for a more thoughtful and respectful approach to political discourse. In the aftermath of the exchange between Booker and Harris, it is clear that such an approach is needed more than ever.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Agree to Continue Trade Talks Amid Escalating Tariff War\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the imposition of tariffs on all remaining imports from China, marking an intensification in the ongoing trade war between the two economic powerhouses. The new tariffs, which could potentially affect about $300 billion worth of Chinese imports, are set to come on top of an increase in tariff rates to 25% from 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.\n\nIn a statement, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer confirmed that a final decision on the new duties has not been made. The escalation in tariffs follows a lack of progress in trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, as both sides continue to grapple with significant differences over key issues.\n\nDespite the escalation, Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He have agreed to press on with further talks, avoiding a complete breakdown in negotiations. In a series of tweets, Trump expressed optimism, stating that the U.S. and China had held \"candid and constructive conversations\" and that the talks were \"constructive.\"\n\nThe crux of the disagreement lies in China's proposal to delete prior commitments regarding changes to Chinese laws and policies on issues such as intellectual property protection and forced technology transfers. These changes were a significant part of the draft trade agreement, and their deletion has been a major stumbling block in the negotiations.\n\nThe new tariffs, if implemented, would impact more than 5,700 categories of products, including internet modems, routers, circuit boards, furniture, and lighting products. Seaborne cargoes shipped from China before midnight on Friday will not be subject to the new tax as long as they arrive in the United States prior to June 1.\n\nThe higher tariffs could potentially reduce U.S. gross domestic product by 0.3% and China's by 0.8% in 2020, according to consultancy Oxford Economics. The trade war's impact on U.S. businesses and consumers is a matter of concern, with American farmers and manufacturers expressing apprehension about the prolonged dispute.\n\nIn response to the U.S. tariff hike, China's Commerce Ministry has stated that it will take countermeasures but has not elaborated on the details. China responded to Trump's tariffs last year with levies on a range of U.S. goods, including soybeans and pork.\n\nIn light of the ongoing trade tensions, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has been tasked with creating a plan to support American farmers, who have already received up to $12 billion in government aid to help offset their China-related losses.\n\nThe trade war between the U.S. and China continues to unfold, with both sides expressing a willingness to engage in further talks. The outcome of these negotiations will have far-reaching implications for the global economy.",
    " Title: Potential Vice Presidential Pick: Michael Bloomberg Emerges as a Contender for Mitt Romney's Running Mate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing speculation surrounding Mitt Romney's choice for a vice presidential running mate, a surprising name has emerged: Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City.\n\nRumors suggest that Romney is looking for a candidate who can attract voters on the fence, someone with a successful track record and a moderate social stance that would not immediately alienate independents. Bloomberg, known for his union-fighting and gay-couple-supportive policies, could be that candidate.\n\nFour years ago, Sen. John McCain selected Sarah Palin, a game-changer who turned out to be more divisive than unifying. Bloomberg, on the other hand, would be a curveball, someone who could get people talking and thinking, not just talking.\n\nBloomberg is viewed as a real Republican, an old-school Republican, who would focus on reducing deficits by increasing revenue and making tough decisions on spending cuts. He is also known for his compassionate leadership and traditional Republican views, a stark contrast to the current GOP incarnation of the anti-tax, Bible-thumping conservative.\n\nOne of the key points in Bloomberg's favor is his stance on taxes. He has been open about the need to raise taxes as part of the deficit reduction equation, a position that could appeal to voters who are looking for honest, non-partisan assessments.\n\nIn a Wall Street Journal op-ed in March, Bloomberg wrote, \"Republicans who emphasize economic freedom would have a lot more credibility if they'd stop promising a free lunch.\" This kind of honest assessment is what voters on the fence are looking for, according to LZ Granderson, a CNN commentator.\n\nDespite Bloomberg's support for Romney, he has not endorsed the former Massachusetts governor due to their differences in social politics.

Hernandez, who had fled a threat of violence in Honduras with her sons, ages 6 and 2, was among eight people selected to present themselves to U.S. border officials.\n\nHernandez, her sons Jonathan, 2, and Omar, 6, braved a month-long journey to reach the port of entry at San Ysidro, only to be told by officials that they had reached capacity and were \"temporarily unable to bring additional persons traveling without appropriate entry documentation into the port of entry for processing.\"\n\nDozens of migrants vowed to camp outside the center, waiting for \"every last one\" to be admitted into the United States. When customs officials began processing cases of \"undocumented arrivals\" on Monday, the migrants looked among themselves for who should step forward.\n\nHernandez, who had traveled 3,000 miles to reach this place, was chosen. The group agreed that Hernandez and another mother, along with their children, and a teenager traveling alone would go through the asylum process.\n\nHernandez's plan had always been to claim asylum, given the danger to her life and her children in Honduras. However, she knew it held no guarantees. \"I don't know what I'm going to do,\" she had said earlier. \"I can't go back to my country.\"\n\nThe journey to the U.S.-Mexico border was not easy for Hernandez and her family. They had scrounged for food, braved the rain, and faced the chill to make it to Tijuana. Hernandez's fellow migrant, Tesla Rich, had left her 9-month-old daughter Valentina with someone at the crossing.\n\nOn Monday, Hernandez and Rich, with their children, waited in line for hours, huddled together to keep warm. They ordered pizzas for the kids from a Domino's franchise, and Rich nursed Valentina while Hernandez made coffee for her sons.\n\nThe group faced challenges, including long wait times, cold weather, and the loss of a coffee cup that soaked their blankets. However, they remained hopeful, determined to seek a better life in the United States.\n\nAs of now, Hernandez and her family have entered the processing center, taking a step closer to their asylum claim. The outcome of their case remains uncertain, but they are hopeful for a brighter future.",
    " Title: State Attorneys General Join Forces in Antitrust Probes of Google and Facebook, Adding Pressure on Federal Regulators\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan group of attorneys general from 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have announced a joint investigation into Google's advertising business, marking a significant escalation in antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech. This move follows a smaller, overlapping group of attorneys general, led by New York's Letitia James, who are investigating Facebook's business practices.\n\nThe group investigating Google, which includes all states except California and Alabama, emphasized their independence from federal regulators, who are already questioning the company. Google previously disclosed that federal regulators are also investigating the company.\n\nDC Attorney General Karl Racine, a Democrat, said Monday, \"The state attorneys general, they are an independent bunch. And they can be quite tenacious. So I'm very confident that this bipartisan group is going to be led by the facts and not be swayed by any conclusion that may fall short, if you will, if it's inconsistent with our facts, on the federal side.\"\n\nRacine's comments, and the mobilization of such a large group of attorneys general, could indicate a level of dissatisfaction among top state legal officials regarding federal action against Big Tech.\n\nRecent federal regulatory action against Facebook and Google has had minimal impact on their core businesses or stock prices. For instance, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fined Google $170 million for allegedly violating a law protecting children online, an amount that represented less than half of a single day's revenue for its parent company based on its second-quarter 2019 earnings.\n\nThe FTC's $5 billion settlement with Facebook over its use of user data also resolved all claims against Facebook and its executives involving its previous agreement with the agency.\n\nFor those waiting to see if the U.S. government will deal a more significant blow to Big Tech, the state AG investigations may be a welcome development. States have played a noteworthy role in past cases, gaining significant concessions from tobacco companies and pressuring Microsoft in a landmark antitrust case. In that case, attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia joined the Justice Department in alleging Microsoft suppressed competition in the software market.\n\nHowever, half a dozen antitrust experts interviewed for this article said state investigations can add heat to the federal probes, but ultimately, their resources pale in comparison to those of the FTC and DOJ. \"The big picture here is that states can serve as a backstop if the federal government decides not to go after these companies,\" Rutgers Law professor Michael Carrier said. \"You're putting 30 generally small offices together and then they have to coordinate,\" said Harry First, a professor at the New York University School of Law. \"It's good, but it's not quite the same as the extent of the staffs on the federal level.\"\n\nConsidering both Google and Facebook are large global companies, \"it's a heavy lift,\" First said. The state attorneys general's investigations will likely intensify the heat on Google and Facebook, but the outcome remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Mark Zuckerberg Outlines Future Remote Work Plans for Facebook, With Salary Adjustments Based on Location\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a videoconference with employees on Thursday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined the company's plans for remote work in the future, stating that he expects about half of Facebook's employees to work from home permanently within the next five to ten years. However, there is a caveat for those hoping to maintain their high Silicon Valley salaries while living in a less expensive area.\n\nZuckerberg revealed that Facebook will aggressively ramp up the hiring of remote workers, though not all employees will be allowed to work from home permanently at the start. For those who choose to work in areas with lower costs of living, they should expect to be paid less.\n\n\"That means if you live in a location where the cost of living is dramatically lower, or the cost of labor is lower, then salaries do tend to be somewhat lower in those places,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nCurrently, Facebook pays its employees based on location, but Zuckerberg stated that employees working remotely must notify Facebook if they move to a new area before January 1, 2021. At that point, the company will adjust the salary to the new location, taking taxes into account. Zuckerberg warned that there will be \"severe ramifications\" for those who are not honest about their location.\n\nThis may impact the plans of some workers who were hoping to stretch their salaries further in cheaper areas. A recent survey of San Francisco Bay Area tech workers found that two-thirds would consider moving away from the pricey area if they could work remotely. \"It makes no sense paying Bay Area rent if we can earn our salary living elsewhere,\" one startup employee told Bloomberg News.\n\nAs of 2018, the median employee compensation at Facebook was over $240,000 a year. The median home price in Menlo Park, California, where Facebook's headquarters is located, is $2.4 million, according to Zillow, while the median home price in the wider Bay Area was $928,000 last year.\n\nZuckerberg also shared that, in a company survey, of the people who said they would want to work remotely full-time, about 45% were \"pretty confident\" that they would move to another place if they had that opportunity, with an additional 30% saying they \"might\" move. About 60% of that total said they'd prefer to move to a smaller city or town.\n\nUltimately, Zuckerberg said the changes will help Facebook become more diverse in its workforce. \"When you limit hiring to people who either live in a small number of big cities or are willing to move there, that cuts out a lot of people who live in different communities, different backgrounds, or may have different perspectives,\" he said. \"Certainly being able to recruit more broadly, especially across the U.S. and Canada to start, is going to open up a lot of new talent that previously wouldn't have considered moving to a big city.\"\n\nCurrently, about 95% of Facebook's employees are working from home due to coronavirus stay-at-home orders. The company has previously said workers will be able to work from home at least through the end of the year.",
    " Title: A Closer Look at the U.S. Election Interference Allegations: A Matter of Voter Education or Cybersecurity?\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week, President Obama announced sanctions against Russia in response to alleged data theft and disclosure activities that were intended to interfere with the U.S. election process. Hillary Clinton described these activities, which revealed purloined emails that were detrimental to her during her unsuccessful presidential campaign, as an \"attack against our country\" and \"our electoral system\" that undermined \"the integrity of our democracy.\"\n\nHowever, these overheated descriptions may misleadingly equate information that guides voters' choices with nullification of those choices. A calmer, less partisan perspective suggests that what Clinton and Obama view as interference with the election process might more accurately be described as voter education, which strengthens democracy by helping its participants make better-informed choices.\n\nNews reports frequently describe the leaking of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, as \"election hacking.\" John McCain, the GOP's 2008 presidential nominee, seems to agree with that characterization. In a CNN interview last month, the Arizona senator, a harsh critic of Donald Trump who denounced him, endorsed him, and then withdrew his endorsement, complained that by leaking information helpful to the Republican nominee, \"the Russians\u2026have been able to interfere with our electoral process.\" He warned that \"if they are able to harm the electoral process, then they destroy democracy, which is based on free and fair elections.\"\n\nThis take seems pretty hysterical in light of what actually happened. True election hacking, aimed at perpetrating voting fraud, obviously would be a threat to the democratic process. But there is no evidence of such interference, and it's not even clear that the DNC and Podesta emails had an impact on the election results\u2014or why it would be so terrible if they did.\n\nThe New York Times reports that hackers gained access to the emails through standard phishing techniques, tricking Podesta and at least one DNC employee into revealing their passwords by pretending to be from Google. The Times notes that \"every major publication, including The Times, published multiple stories citing the D.N.C. and Podesta emails posted by WikiLeaks, becoming a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence.\"\n\nThose news organizations did that because much of the information in the emails\u2014including DNC officials' disdain for Clinton rival Bernie Sanders, excerpts from her secret Wall Street speeches, and observations about her weaknesses as a candidate\u2014concerned matters of legitimate public interest. It was information that voters might rationally want to consider before deciding which candidate to support.\n\nValuable journalism is often based on information that was obtained or divulged illegally by people with axes to grind. It is hard to see how this case is different in principle. Is it the nationality of the informants that matters? If the emails that embarrassed Clinton had been swiped by Americans, would she still be talking about a democracy-threatening attack on our electoral process?\n\nLast fall, the Times \"obtained\" parts of Donald Trump's 1995 tax return and shared them with the public. If that information had come from a foreign source, would publishing it have undermined democracy?\n\nSuppose German hackers had managed to obtain complete copies of Trump's recent tax returns\u2014a subject of intense journalistic interest\u2014and shared them with news outlets, either directly or through an intermediary like Wikileaks. Would Clinton have perceived the resulting expos\u00e9s as undermining the electoral process or assisting it?\n\nCybersecurity is a serious concern, especially when it comes to systems that control important functions such as vote counting, banking, and the distribution of electricity. Helping politicians conceal facts that might alienate voters probably does not belong in the same category. Judging from the account in the Times, both the FBI and the DNC were remarkably lax in their initial responses to the intrusions that produced a bounty of newsworthy emails. Politicians with things to hide might want to be more careful about the security of the systems they use to discuss sensitive matters. But we should not confuse their challenge with a threat to democracy.",
    " Title: China and U.S. Express Confidence in Reaching Trade Deal, but Skepticism Prevails Amidst Tight Negotiating Window\n\nArticle:\n\nChina and the United States have expressed confidence in reaching a trade deal, despite President Donald Trump's warning of potential tariffs if negotiations fail. The Chinese Commerce Ministry, in a statement on Wednesday, expressed optimism about the implementation of issues already agreed upon, following a temporary truce in the trade war between the two nations.\n\nThe ministry stated that both sides would actively promote negotiations within 90 days, following the agreement reached by Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at a meeting in Argentina on Saturday. The ministry described the latest bilateral talks as \"very successful.\"\n\nTrump, via Twitter, hinted at the possibility of an extension of the ceasefire but warned of potential tariffs if the talks did not yield fruitful results. He stated that negotiations with China would end 90 days from the date of their dinner with President Xi, unless extended.\n\nThe White House has stated that China has committed to start buying more American products and lifting tariff and non-tariff barriers immediately, while beginning talks on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfers and intellectual property protection.\n\nHowever, the threat of further escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies has cast a shadow over financial markets and the global economy for much of the year. Investors initially welcomed the ceasefire, but skepticism about the ability to reach a substantive deal within the short negotiating period agreed has led to a downturn in global financial markets.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry has referred specific questions to the Commerce Ministry, which is due to hold its weekly news briefing on Thursday in Beijing.\n\nOfficials from the U.S. and a number of other major economies have often criticized China for its slow approach to negotiations and not following through on commitments. China has been relatively quiet about the Trump-Xi agreement, with some differences between U.S. and Chinese accounts of what the deal entails.\n\nAnalysts suggest that officials now face the difficult task of fleshing out a deal that is acceptable to China but also involves significant enough concessions not to be torpedoed by the China hawks in the Trump administration. There is a possibility that no agreement can be reached within 90 days, with the higher tariff rate coming into force only a few months later than originally planned.\n\nA Chinese official told Reuters that officials were \"waiting for the leaders to return\" before publicizing details. President Xi and his most senior officials are due back in China on Thursday, having visited Panama and Portugal since leaving Argentina.\n\nThe Global Times tabloid, which is run by the Chinese Communist Party's main newspaper, suggested that myriad statements from the Trump administration about the deal were designed to highlight or even exaggerate facets of the deal that benefited the United States. The tabloid stated that reaching an agreement within three months is a spur to not only China, but also the U.S. If the two sides fail to reach a deal, all the White House promises will be invalid.\n\nIn conclusion, while both China and the U.S. have expressed confidence in reaching a trade deal, skepticism remains about the ability to reach a substantive agreement within the tight negotiating window agreed upon by the two nations. The potential for further escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies continues to cast a shadow over financial markets and the global economy.",
    " Title: Harvard Honors Colin Kaepernick, Dave Chappelle, and Other African American Luminaries with W.E.B.

    " Title: The Misinterpretation of Social Mobility in America: A Closer Look at Achievement and Aspiration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent discussions surrounding social mobility in America, a crucial distinction has been overlooked: the difference between opportunity and realization. While it is true that the United States has seen a decline in upward mobility for those born into lower socioeconomic levels, it is essential to recognize that this does not necessarily equate to a lack of opportunity, but rather, a disparity between opportunity and actual achievement.\n\nThe focus on \"barriers\" created by society often overshadows the internal values and aspirations that drive individuals to pursue certain paths. For instance, the fact that sons of high school dropouts are less likely to become doctors or scientists than the sons of Ph.D.s does not automatically imply that American society is inherently unfair. Instead, it may simply reflect the differing interests and aspirations of various demographic groups.\n\nMoreover, the notion that equal representation of every demographic group in every field is a sign of fairness is flawed. Life has never been fair, and it is unrealistic to expect it to be so in the United States or anywhere else. The idea that an absence of evidence for discrimination is merely proof of its covert nature is a dangerous and misguided assumption.\n\nA case in point is the under-representation of women in computer engineering. Instead of attributing this disparity to \"barriers\" created by society, it is essential to consider the unique agendas and interests of women, who may not be as drawn to computer engineering as other demographic groups. Forcing women into engineering schools or launching propaganda campaigns to change their interests would be counterproductive and disregard their individual aspirations.\n\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that some celebrated statistical studies of social mobility exclude Asian Americans, a group that has achieved remarkable success in various fields, including technology and academia. This success challenges the notion that upward mobility is a rare occurrence in America.\n\nIn conclusion, it is crucial to approach discussions of social mobility with a nuanced understanding of opportunity, achievement, and individual aspirations. By recognizing the complexities of human behavior and the role of personal choices, we can better understand the factors that contribute to social mobility and work towards creating a more equitable society that respects and nurtures the unique talents and aspirations of all its citizens.",
    " Title: Conservative Commentator Ann Coulter Criticizes Sen. Marco Rubio's Immigration Reform Proposals, Labels Plan as \"Amnesty\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent column for Human Events, conservative commentator Ann Coulter has joined a growing chorus of Republican critics of Sen. Marco Rubio's immigration reform proposals. Coulter argues that Rubio's efforts are aimed at creating \"more Democratic voters.\"\n\nCoulter's criticism follows similar sentiments expressed by Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, who called Rubio's attempts to forge a bipartisan overhaul bill that grants citizenship to illegal immigrants \"naive.\" Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also weighed in this week, writing that some in Congress are seeking \"quick fixes\" to the problem.\n\nIn her column, Coulter notes that Rubio's supporters claim that his proposals are not amnesty, but rather a pathway to citizenship. \"They seem to think they can bully Republicans the way the Democrats do, by controlling the language,\" she wrote. \"Rubio\u2019s bill is nothing but amnesty. It isn\u2019t even \u2018amnesty thinly disguised as border enforcement.\u2019 This is a wolf in wolf\u2019s clothing.\"\n\nCoulter continued, \"Despite all the blather about how Rubio demands \u2018Enforcement First,\u2019 the very first thing his proposal does is make illegal aliens legal.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Rubio defended his efforts in a conversation with Rush Limbaugh, stating that his bipartisan effort is designed to avoid the problems that plagued the 1986 immigration bill that granted amnesty to three million illegal immigrants but failed to provide more border security and tougher enforcement mechanisms.\n\n\"Well-intentioned, but counterproductive because, A, they granted a blanket amnesty to 3 million people at the time, and B, they didn\u2019t do any of the enforcement mechanisms,\" he said of the 1986 law. \"And so our point is, if we\u2019re going to deal with this, let\u2019s deal with it once and for all and in a way that this never, ever happens again.\"\n\nThat includes beefed up border security, workplace enforcement, and a visa tracking system, he said.\n\nHowever, Coulter wrote, \"Step One of Marco Rubio\u2019s plan is: Grant illegal aliens the right to live and work in America legally. (Rubio\u2019s first move in poker: Fold).\"\n\nThe debate over immigration reform continues to be a contentious issue within the Republican Party, with some members advocating for a more hardline approach and others, like Rubio, seeking a more comprehensive solution. The future of the proposed legislation remains uncertain, as both sides continue to negotiate and debate the best course of action.",
    " Title: Analysis: Ten Contradictions in Donald Trump's Foreign Policy Speech Suggest a Strategy of Having \"Cake and Eating It\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his first major foreign policy address, former President Donald Trump presented a speech that, while echoing familiar tones, has sparked a heated political debate due to its content's scrutiny. Madeleine Albright, a former Secretary of State representing the Hillary Clinton campaign, criticized the speech for containing \"simplistic slogans, contradictions, and misstatements.\" Trump's supporters, however, argue that he effectively highlighted the inconsistencies of the Democratic establishment's approach under Obama and Clinton.\n\nHere are ten passages that suggest Trump may be engaging in a common political tactic: having his cake and eating it.\n\n1. Trump stated that some groups \"will never be anything but our enemies,\" following his criticism of Obama for negotiating with Iran. However, he later claimed, \"The world must know we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies.\"\n\n2. Trump lambasted Obama for neglecting overseas partners, promising, \"America is going to be a reliable friend and ally again.\" Yet, he issues warnings about paying for NATO membership that might sound like blackmail to some. \"The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense \u2013 and, if not, the US must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves.\"\n\n3. Trump was ambiguous about America's role in promoting democracy, claiming, \"We are getting out of the nation-building business,\" but then adding, \"I will work with our allies to reinvigorate western values and institutions.\"\n\n4. Trump argued for promoting \"western civilization and its accomplishments\" to inspire positive reforms worldwide, but he has also offended much of the Muslim world by threatening to ban their citizens from entering the US.\n\n5. Criticisms of Obama's \"humiliations\" at the hands of foreign governments do not stand up to much scrutiny. Trump claimed that Obama was snubbed during state visits to Cuba and Saudi Arabia because he was not greeted at the airport by a senior leader. However, the Queen's decision to send a less prestigious official to meet Obama at London's Stansted airport was not mentioned.\n\n6. Trump's criticism of Obama's failed attempt to secure the 2016 Summer Games for Chicago does not hold up to scrutiny. He argued that the president should not have flown all the way to the IOC meeting in Copenhagen if he did not already know they were going to award the games to the US, but what would have been the point of flying all that way to lobby for something that had already been secured?\n\n7. Trump's call for unpredictability in foreign policy is contradicted by his call for a more transparent and principled approach. \"We have to be unpredictable and we have to be unpredictable starting now,\" he argued, but by the end of the speech, he argued for the virtues of a more transparent and principled approach.\n\n8. Trump claimed, \"There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism,\" an assertion already open to dispute, but went on to add, \"For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more.\" If \"scores\" means at least 40, then by this logic, Trump is claiming the existence of around 1,000 more people than anyone else has.\n\n9. The speech's abiding slogan, \"America First,\" could have done with more fact-checking. Putting America first sounds like an extension of Trump's hallmark promise to make America great again, but it also harks back to the America First Committee of the 1940s, a group set up to prevent the US from joining the second world war, only to be disbanded three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\n10. The speech's biggest contradiction may be the tension between its isolationism and interventionism. At once, Trump urges a pragmatic and realist approach to the exercise of US power, unconstrained by the niceties of political correctness, and yet blasts Obama for having \"no vision, no purpose, no direction, no strategy.\"\n\nIt is perhaps unfair to dwell too closely on textual analysis of a speech clearly written by a number of people. However, the speech's inconsistencies and contradictions are worth noting as they provide insight into Trump's foreign policy stance and the challenges that may arise in implementing it.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Advocates for Comprehensive Immigration Reform, Distancing Herself from Republican Contenders\n\nIn a significant move, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has outlined her immigration policy during a speech in Las Vegas on Tuesday, positioning herself as a strong advocate for immigration reform. This stance places her to the left of President Barack Obama and sets her apart from potential Republican presidential candidates.\n\nClinton's proposals include a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants residing in the United States. As President, she pledged to take broader executive action on deferring deportations for those with strong community ties, such as through family and work. Additionally, she promised to improve conditions for immigrant detainees, aiming to make them more humane.\n\nIn contrast to Clinton's comprehensive approach, several potential Republican candidates appear to be advocating for more limited reforms. For instance, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who was once an advocate for sensible reform, now seems to be pushing for a provisional status for the undocumented, a lengthy and challenging path to a temporary work permit. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who has been moderate on the issue in the past, is reportedly wobbly on citizenship, with his stance on the matter unclear.\n\nSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin, meanwhile, have expressed more conservative views. Paul's agenda appears to be focused on border security and ending the 14th Amendment guarantee of citizenship by birth. Walker, on the other hand, has called for all unauthorized immigrants to leave the country and has also expressed a desire to limit legal immigration.\n\nClinton's full-throated public commitment to expansive immigration action is a recent development, and it remains to be seen whether she will maintain this stance throughout her campaign. However, her clear and unequivocal support for immigration reform is a departure from her previous, more cautious approach, as demonstrated by her response to questions from young immigrant advocates last fall, where she suggested electing more Democrats as a solution.",
    " Title: Trump Files Lawsuit Against Deutsche Bank and Capital One to Prevent Congressional Financial Records Release\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant legal move, U.S. President Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit against Deutsche Bank and Capital One in an attempt to prevent the banks from complying with subpoenas issued by Democrat-led congressional committees for information on his financial records. The lawsuit, which was filed in New York on Monday, aims to block the banks from complying with the subpoenas, which are part of an investigation into the Trump family's financial dealings.\n\nThe lawsuit, which includes Trump's three eldest children and the Trump Organization, argues that there are no legitimate grounds for investigating the president's business affairs. The filing alleges that the subpoenas \"have no legitimate or lawful purpose\" and were issued \"to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the president and his family.\"\n\nDeutsche Bank, one of the Trump Organization's major lenders, and a number of other financial institutions were issued subpoenas earlier this month by the House Intelligence and Financial Services Committees. The committees are reportedly seeking documents and materials relating to the bank's longstanding relationship with Trump and his family.\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, described the subpoenas as part of an investigation \"into allegations of potential foreign influence on the US political process.\" In a joint statement, Schiff and fellow Democrat Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee, described the lawsuit as \"meritless.\"\n\n\"[It shows] the depths to which President Trump will go to obstruct Congress's constitutional oversight authority,\" they said. \"He will find that Congress will not be deterred from carrying out its constitutional responsibilities.\"\n\nIn 2017, Deutsche Bank rejected requests by Democrats in the House of Representatives to provide details of the president's finances, citing privacy laws. That year it was also reported that special counsel Robert Mueller, who led the investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia, had ordered Deutsche Bank to provide records of Trump's accounts.",
    " Title: Controversy Surrounds Free Summer Meal Program for Children Across the U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nEvery summer, more than 3 million children across the United States receive free meals at over 30,000 sites, including schools, recreation centers, and migrant worker camps. This program, funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, provides a valuable resource for families who are struggling, but it has also become a subject of debate among critics.\n\nAt the \"Summer Fun Cafe\" in northern California, and similar locations, meals are offered to children, with at least half of the children in the area qualifying for free lunches during the school year. However, during the summer, anyone aged 18 and under can partake in these free meals.\n\n\"There's no income requirement, no enrollment, no paperwork,\" said Monique Stovall, nutrition director for the San Juan Unified School District outside Sacramento. \"All children in the community in that age range can come eat with us for free.\"\n\nSigns around the district headquarters advertise the fact that there is no eligibility requirement, and invite all children to take advantage. This has led to concerns among critics about the potential for taxpayers to unintentionally fund meals for children who may not be in need.\n\nJon Coupal, with the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, questions, \"If someone is coming from a family that makes a quarter-of-a-million dollars a year, and they're not checking eligibility when they're coming in the door, I think most people would wonder, 'Am I paying for this?'\"\n\nFor low-income families, a free lunch means more money can be allocated towards other meals or necessities. For those who can afford to feed their children, it offers a convenient option.\n\n\"Normally, we wouldn't qualify for a free lunch, but we're close and it's convenient, and my kids like it\u2014that's important,\" said mom Julie Marks, who brought her two young boys.\n\nIn many cases, charity and nonprofit groups help sponsor free meal sites in their community. According to program supporters, the summer lunch program is easier to administer when the location qualifies, as opposed to the user.\n\n\"We don't have to ask your income, because the overall purpose of the program is to provide a healthy meal to children,\" Stovall said.\n\nOrganizers argue that after a summer of nourishing meals, these children will do better when school resumes in the fall. Monitors are present to ensure that the lunch is consumed on-site, and that adults do not exploit the program.",
    " Title: Republican Senators Propose Replacing Columbus Day with Juneteenth as Federal Holiday\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to acknowledge and celebrate the nation's historical milestones, Republican senators Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.) have introduced an amendment that proposes replacing Columbus Day with Juneteenth as a federal holiday. The proposal, which follows a bipartisan Senate bill introduced last week by Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas), aims to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday while offsetting the associated costs.\n\nThe amendment, if passed, would mark a significant shift in the federal recognition of historical events. Juneteenth, commemorating the day in 1865 when slavery definitively ended in the U.S., is currently celebrated as a holiday in 47 states. The holiday has gained increased attention amid the nationwide protests that followed George Floyd's death in police custody.\n\nThe proposal comes amid the ongoing debate surrounding the removal and vandalization of statues of Christopher Columbus, an Italian Renaissance-era explorer often credited with being the first European to discover the Americas. Critics have called for Columbus Day to be eliminated or renamed as Indigenous Peoples' Day, citing Columbus's subjugation and mistreatment of the New World's native population.\n\nSenator Lankford stated, \"Throughout our history, we have strived to become a more perfect union, and Juneteenth was a huge step in attaining that goal.\" He further added, \"We should celebrate these strides on the federal level while remaining cognizant of the impact the existing 10 federal holidays have on federal services and local businesses.\"\n\nSenator Johnson echoed Lankford's sentiments, stating, \"We support celebrating emancipation with a federal holiday, but believe we should eliminate a current holiday in exchange.\" He specified that Columbus Day was chosen as the holiday to be replaced due to its light celebration and minimal disruption to Americans' schedules.\n\nThe proposal is not without controversy, as Senator Cornyn told The Hill that eliminating Columbus Day in favor of Juneteenth is \"problematic\" and \"dilutes the message we're trying to send, which is one of being respectful and honoring and remembering our history.\"\n\nThe amendment's passage and the eventual establishment of Juneteenth as a federal holiday would mark a significant step in recognizing and celebrating the end of slavery in the United States. The debate surrounding the replacement of Columbus Day with Juneteenth, however, continues to spark discussions about historical recognition, racial equality, and the impact of federal holidays on American society.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Efforts Yield Approval of Coronavirus Relief Bill as Trump Tweets Support\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of events marked by uncertainty and last-minute negotiations, the House of Representatives passed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act on Saturday, following a tweet of approval from President Donald Trump. The bill, which aims to provide relief to individuals and businesses affected by the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, was the result of intense, round-the-clock negotiations between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe day began with a sense of confusion, as key officials from both parties contradicted each other on the status of the deal. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, in a letter to her fellow Democrats after 10 p.m. on Friday, acknowledged the intense negotiations required to meet the deadline for the bill's passage. She thanked her colleagues for their patience amid the frenetic back-and-forth with the administration.\n\nPelosi had initially announced a deal around 6 p.m., but House Republicans, including the No. 2 House Democrat, Steny Hoyer, disputed this, stating that talks were still ongoing. Key Republicans expressed concerns about a tax credit for paid family sick leave, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy confirming that Republicans sought more flexibility for small business owners.\n\nAdding to the confusion, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in an unexpected move, announced on Fox Business that he had reached an agreement with Pelosi. This announcement came after a meeting with Trump that delayed Mnuchin's appearance on the network.\n\nTrump eventually tweeted his support for the bill hours later, providing long-awaited clarity to hundreds of members and aides who had been in limbo for 48 hours. In his tweet, Trump expressed his support for H.R. 6201 and directed the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that would provide flexibility to small businesses. He encouraged all Republicans and Democrats to vote yes.\n\nOne of the other major obstacles during the negotiations was Trump's personal demand for a payroll tax cut in this package. This idea has little support on Capitol Hill, and Democrats have already stated that it would be debated as part of future coronavirus crisis-related legislation.\n\nMcCarthy, who met with Trump and Mnuchin multiple times in the last 24 hours, confirmed that Trump had sought the last-minute addition. He also indicated that Republicans would push for it in the next tranche of economic relief, which could be presented later this month or in April.\n\n\"I believe this will not be the only one,\" McCarthy said, alluding to future aid packages related to the outbreak. \"This is something that the president wants, we would have liked to have that as well. I think that would have taken a little more time.\"",
    " Title: GOP Faces Internal Disagreement on Healthcare Reform as ObamaCare Repeal-Only Bill Faces Uncertain Future\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a turn of events, Republican lawmakers are grappling with competing ideas for the future of healthcare reform following the collapse of the current ObamaCare replacement effort. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) acknowledged Monday night that the Senate's current approach would fail after two more senators announced opposition to the current healthcare draft.\n\nWithout the necessary votes, McConnell stated that the Senate will take up a repeal-only bill that Congress passed in 2015. \"Regretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful,\" McConnell said in a statement.\n\nThe repeal-only approach is backed by conservatives, who argue that Congress should just pass again what it already approved in 2015. President Trump joined the conservatives, tweeting Monday night, \"Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!\"\n\nHowever, the 2015 repeal-only bill does not appear to have the votes to pass, and other GOP lawmakers called Monday for working with Democrats or passing an alternative GOP bill. \"The Congress must now return to regular order, hold hearings, receive input from members of both parties, and heed the recommendations of our nation's governors so that we can produce a bill that finally provides Americans with access to quality and affordable health care,\" Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in a statement.\n\nSome Republicans have raised the idea of a bipartisan bill to stabilize ObamaCare markets, which could include funding for key payments to insurers known as cost-sharing reductions and possibly funding to bring down premiums for high-cost enrollees, known as \"reinsurance.\" However, conservative members, including Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), have objected to the idea of a stabilization bill as simply throwing more money at the healthcare law.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) put forward a third approach on Monday night, touting a bill he recently proposed with Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) to give states a chunk of money and let them decide whether to keep much of ObamaCare or try something new. That approach has been attacked from both the left and right.\n\nThe internal disagreement among Republicans on the future of healthcare reform is a setback for the party, which has long criticized ObamaCare and promised to repeal and replace it. The ongoing debate highlights the challenges of crafting a healthcare policy that can garner the support of a diverse Republican caucus, as well as the potential for bipartisan cooperation on healthcare issues.",
    " Title: President Trump Makes Surprise Visit to Afghanistan on Thanksgiving, Holds Secret Peace Talks with Taliban\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, President Donald Trump made a surprise visit to Afghanistan on Thanksgiving morning to express his gratitude to the troops for their service and to serve a traditional turkey dinner. The visit, however, required stringent security measures to maintain secrecy and prevent the news from leaking out.\n\n\"There's nowhere I'd rather spend Thanksgiving than with the toughest, fiercest warriors,\" Trump told the troops on the ground. \"I'm here to say Happy Thanksgiving and thank you very much. As president of the United States, I have no higher honor than serving as commander in chief.\"\n\nThe journey began on Wednesday, with Trump departing from Mar-a-Lago undercover. The specifics of his departure are largely unknown, but it is known that he flew out of an undisclosed airport in Florida on a small, undisclosed plane in the evening.\n\nOn the flight bound for Joint Base Andrews, in Maryland, only one Fox News journalist served as the pool reporter. The plane was sparsely equipped, with only four blue leather chairs and a portable toilet brought for the occasion. Phones were confiscated from all onboard, including senior White House officials, and Trump remained in the cockpit for takeoff.\n\nUpon landing at Joint Base Andrews later Wednesday evening, Trump switched to Air Force One, which was hidden in a hangar. The plane took off from JBA with all interior lights off and the windows drawn. The plane landed in Afghanistan on a pitch-black runway, with the pool only allowed to take pictures of Trump's arrival from a nearby van.\n\nAccompanying Trump were White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere, and Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.). Grisham stated that only a tight circle of White House officials knew about the trip, and the White House even scheduled tweets to be sent out from the president's account during the Internet blackout that he faced.\n\n\"It's a dangerous area, and he (the President) wants to support the troops,\" Grisham said. \"He and Mrs. Trump recognize that there are a lot of people who are away from their families during the holidays, and we thought it would be a nice surprise.\"\n\nThe visit came as a surprise to the troops, the public, and the media, catching some outlets off guard. Newsweek had to overhaul an article that it had earlier posted, reporting that the president would spend the day tweeting and playing golf.\n\nAfter serving and eventually sitting down for a Thanksgiving dinner, which included turkey, mashed potatoes, cornbread, baked ham, mac and cheese, cornish hen, and candied yams, Trump took as many pictures as time allowed with the troops. He then met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. Due to security concerns, the White House notified Ghani only \"a few hours ago,\" according to the White House.\n\nTrump then finished his trip by addressing a few hundred cheering troops in the hangar on the airfield, bringing Ghani on the stage to also express his appreciation to the American troops. Trump told them that everyone was working hard to bring them back home.\n\n\"We will continue to work tirelessly for the day when all of you can go home to your families... and that day is coming very soon,\" he said. The president also stated that peace talks with the Taliban have resumed, but later tweeted that the talks are \"dead\" after cancelling a secret Camp David summit.",
    " Title: Terrorist Incident in London: Car Ramming Attack on Westminster Bridge and Parliament\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, a car plowed through pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and crashed into a fence surrounding the Houses of Parliament in London on Tuesday afternoon. The incident, confirmed as a terrorist attack, has left several casualties and sent shockwaves through the city.\n\nKirsten Hurrell, a 70-year-old newsstand owner opposite Big Ben, was the first to witness the aftermath. She described seeing a car swerve across a bicycle lane and into the Parliament fence, with a body lying on the ground. \"At first I thought it was an accident,\" she said, \"but then I was told the car had already mowed down quite a number of people on Westminster Bridge.\"\n\nRobert Vaudry, a 52-year-old fund manager from Stratford-upon-Avon, was in the vicinity when the incident occurred. He had emerged from the Westminster subway station around 2:40 p.m. for a meeting with a lawmaker when he was confronted by armed policemen. \"I came out of the Tube and there were two armed policemen,\" he said in an interview. \"One grabbed my arm, pushed me to the left and said, 'Get out of here.'\"\n\nRadoslaw Sikorski, a former foreign minister of Poland, was in a taxi on Westminster Bridge when the pedestrians were hit by the car. He did not see the impact but heard it, describing the sound as a car hitting a sheet of metal. He saw five people lying on the ground, one of whom was unconscious and bleeding heavily from his head.\n\nAndrew Bone, the executive director of the Responsible Jewellery Council, was on a bus heading toward Victoria Station when it was stopped at the edge of Parliament Square. Initially thinking an action movie was being filmed, he soon realized the gravity of the situation as the bus was evacuated and he saw the vehicle that had crashed into a railing.\n\nThe incident marks the first large-scale terrorist attack in Britain since July 7, 2005, when bomb attacks on subway trains and a bus killed more than 50 people. Political violence is relatively rare in Britain, where gun ownership is stringently restricted.\n\nThis attack is consistent with the recent pattern of attacks in which a vehicle was used to kill people, citing assaults in France, Germany, and Israel. Jeremy Shapiro, a former State Department official now at the European Council on Foreign Relations, commented on this trend, stating, \"We've seen a gradual movement away from terrorist attacks on the West to attacks on softer and softer targets with more improvised weapons.\"\n\nThe incident has left the city in a state of shock, with many recalling past incidents such as the assassination of Airey Neave, a Conservative Party member, in 1979, when his car was blown up near the Parliament building. The city remains on high alert as investigations continue.",
    " Title: Trump Withdraws John Ratcliffe as U.S. Spy Chief Nominee, Considering Alternatives Amidst Resume Concerns and Lack of Experience\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday withdrew his choice of John Ratcliffe to be U.S. spy chief after questions arose about the congressman's lack of experience and possible exaggerations in his resume, marking the latest upheaval over a top national security post.\n\nTrump announced the move five days after he surprised many in Washington by making the conservative Republican lawmaker from Texas his selection to replace Daniel Coats as director of national intelligence, a post that oversees the 17 U.S. civilian and military intelligence agencies including the CIA.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the situation, Trump is considering Republican Representatives Michael McCaul and Devin Nunes for the job. McCaul is a former chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee and Nunes is a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nTrump told reporters at the White House he has \"a list of three people\" he will consider for the job this weekend. The Republican president blamed unflattering news coverage for Ratcliffe's decision to bow out and instead remain in the House. Ratcliffe, 53, faced a potentially difficult Senate confirmation process.\n\nThe vacancy comes as the U.S. intelligence community grapples with an array of challenges, including the threat of foreign interference in next year's U.S. elections, the impact of a rising China, escalating tensions with Iran, North Korea's nuclear program, and the desire to end years of conflict in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria.\n\nTrump announced last Sunday that Coats, who had clashed with him over assessments involving Russia, Iran, and North Korea, will step down on Aug. 15.\n\nRatcliffe, a Trump loyalist and the most junior member of the House Intelligence Committee, had been tapped, but not formally nominated, to replace Coats.\n\n\"Rather than going through months of slander and libel, I explained to John how miserable it would be for him and his family to deal with these people,\" Trump said on Twitter.\n\nThe change in leadership at the top of the U.S. intelligence community comes after a half-year of turmoil atop the Pentagon. The Senate on July 23 confirmed Army Secretary Mark Esper as defense secretary, ending the longest period that the Pentagon had been without a permanent top official, a stint that began after James Mattis resigned in December over policy differences with Trump.\n\nTrump's previous pick for defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, withdrew in June after reports of domestic violence in his family.\n\nThe post of director of national intelligence was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.\n\nRatcliffe, confirming he had withdrawn from consideration, said he thought the confirmation process would become a partisan battle between Republicans and Democrats.\n\n\"I do not wish for a national security and intelligence debate surrounding my confirmation, however untrue, to become a purely political and partisan issue,\" Ratcliffe said.\n\nRatcliffe gained attention by defending Trump and criticizing former Special Counsel Robert Mueller during a July hearing on Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nAlthough Ratcliffe had touted his counter-terrorism experience as a federal prosecutor in Texas, media outlets including Reuters reported on concerns that he may have exaggerated his achievements in the post.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and some former senior U.S. intelligence officers had said Ratcliffe lacked the expertise and experience to replace Coats. Some voiced concern that he would warp U.S. intelligence to support Trump's views. Ratcliffe served for six months on the intelligence panel.\n\nTrump said he might name the No. 2 intelligence official, Sue Gordon, as acting director of national intelligence. That is required when there is a vacancy in the top job. Such a move would likely be reassuring to many U.S. intelligence experts because of her deep experience.\n\nHowever, some Trump allies, according to the source familiar with the matter, were floating the possibility of instead naming CIA Director Gina Haspel as acting director until a permanent director is confirmed by the Senate.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said while he was \"heartened\" that the office of the director of national intelligence has an experienced team in place during the transition, \"there is no substitute for having a Senate-confirmed director in place\" leading it.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, a critic of Ratcliffe for the job, said in a statement, \"The next Director of National Intelligence must be someone who is nonpartisan, sees the world objectively, and speaks truth to power.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump talks to reporters as he departs for travel to Bedminster, New Jersey from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., August 2, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nRatcliffe joined a growing list of Trump's choices for senior jobs who have had to withdraw, leading to questions about the rigorousness of White House background checks.\n\nAsked whether Ratcliffe's history was inadequately reviewed before he was picked, Trump defended the White House process. While Trump regularly attacks the media, he told reporters, \"You're part of the vetting process.... We save a lot of money that way.\"",
    " Title: Major US Retailers Implement New Gun Sales Restrictions Following Florida School Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 lives were lost, two major U.S. retailers, Dick's Sporting Goods and Walmart, have announced new restrictions on gun sales.\n\nDick's Sporting Goods, with over 600 stores nationwide, has decided to discontinue the sale of assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines, and will no longer sell firearms to anyone under the age of 21. The company had previously stopped selling such weapons at its main shops after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting but 35 shops run by a subsidiary called Field & Stream had continued to do so.\n\nWalmart, the largest seller of guns in the U.S., has also made changes, raising the minimum age for anyone buying guns or ammunition to 21 years and removing items from its website that resemble assault-style rifles. The retailer stopped selling high-powered rifles in its shops in 2015, citing low demand.\n\nIn a statement, Walmart said, \"We take seriously our obligation to be a responsible seller of firearms.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has urged a bipartisan group of lawmakers to come up with a comprehensive solution to the gun control issue, following a meeting on the matter. Republican leaders in Congress have rejected raising the minimum legal age to buy rifles from 18 to 21, but Trump said he \"would give pretty serious thought to it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a teacher in the state of Georgia was arrested after barricading himself in a classroom and firing a handgun. No one was injured.\n\nIn announcing its policy change, Dick's Sporting Goods said, \"We have heard you. The nation has heard you.\" The company expressed its support for the Second Amendment, but also acknowledged that \"gun violence is an epidemic that's taking the lives of too many people.\"\n\nDick's CEO Edward Stack told CNN he expected a backlash from some customers, saying \"the hunt business is an important part of the business, no doubt about it.\" The Parkland shooting suspect, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, bought a gun at Dick's, but not the weapon he is alleged to have used in the attack, according to Mr. Stack.\n\nAt Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, students returned to classes on Wednesday, greeted by a line of police officers, school staff, and community members bearing flowers. Many reporters were also present, shouting questions to the teenagers about their feelings.\n\nLyliah Skinner, a 16-year-old student, told the BBC before leaving home, \"We're not going to really be learning much today - it's all about healing.\" She also expressed her nervousness, \"because I'm scared it's going to happen again.\" Lyliah listed people she knew who would not be returning, including Joaquin Oliver, who sat just in front of her in a class they shared.\n\nDavid Hogg, a senior student and now leading activist, also felt trepidation. \"It was really hard to think about\" what occurred two weeks ago, he said. \"Imagine getting in a plane crash and having to get back on the same plane again and again and being expected to learn and act like nothing's wrong,\" he told NBC News.\n\nThe handling of the shooting by authorities has sparked criticism after it emerged that the FBI and local police had failed to follow up on multiple tips about the shooter, and that an armed deputy at the school had stayed outside the school building while the attack took place.\n\nThe school's Building 12, the site of the shootings, will remain closed and cordoned off indefinitely. Members of Florida's State House and Senate will soon begin reviewing proposed bills related to firearms, which need their approval and also that of Governor Rick Scott. Among other restrictions, they would raise the legal age to buy rifles from 18 to 21 and give police more control to seize weapons from mentally ill people. A controversial $67m voluntary program to arm school staff, including teachers, would ensure they were trained by law enforcement and allowed to carry concealed weapons on campus, according to the New York Times.",
    " Title: Power Cuts Plague Middle Eastern Countries, Affecting Daily Life and Infrastructure\n\nArticle:\n\nCairo, Egypt - A power cut during a hysterectomy operation last month in an Egyptian hospital left doctors scrambling for alternatives, using cellphones to continue the procedure. The incident is a stark reminder of the regular power cuts that plague hospitals, shops, and homes across the Middle East, where conflict and severe economic strife have left millions in the dark.\n\nDr. Nader Mohsen Al-labede, the surgeon who performed the operation, described the patient as thinking her life was ending when the operating room went dark. The patient was awake but numbed under spinal anesthesia. The doctors managed to calm her down, and the operation continued for the next hour and a half with the help of a handful of cellphones.\n\nEgypt has been grappling with power cuts for years, with blackouts sending pangs of frustration surging through the country. The outages worsened this summer, stemming from a range of factors, including a shortage of gas, poor maintenance of power plants, and the state's failure to pay debts to foreign oil companies. Egypt's leadership has blamed militants for attacking electricity pylons, contributing to the difficulties.\n\nOn Thursday, a massive power outage stopped parts of Cairo's subway, took TV stations off the air, and ground much of the country to a halt for several hours. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi addressed the nation on Saturday, acknowledging the challenges and asking for patience. He said the outage was largely due to crumbling infrastructure that needs billions of dollars and time to fix.\n\nIn neighboring Libya, power outages have been a constant issue, with challenges resounding in the capital Tripoli. Rival militias have fought for control of the city's international airport since mid-July, affecting many aspects of life, including power supply. In the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, power cuts have been common during the summers since the 2011 revolution against dictator Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nThe Gaza Strip has also struggled with power cuts, with power sources meeting no more than 70% of the population's needs. The Gaza Strip's only power plant was hit by Israeli shelling, which also damaged transformers and electrical wires, hindering flows of power coming from Israel.\n\nIn Iraq, power cuts have been a long-standing issue, with many people relying on generators, but the poor cannot afford them. In Lebanon, power cuts are so routine that apps for Apple and Android devices were created to let users track them. An ongoing strike by electrical company workers threatens to make matters worse as limited state funds and increased demand from an influx of more than 1 million Syrian refugees have led to a rise in power rationing across the country.\n\nIn war-torn Syria, power cuts have hit Damascus, while some parts of Aleppo had no power at all at the end of June. Other districts had less than one hour a day, according to the United Nations. The problem contributes to worsening health conditions.\n\nPower cuts have become a part of daily life in the Middle East, affecting everything from healthcare to communication. Governments and international organizations are working to address the issue, but it will take time and significant investment to fix the crumbling infrastructure and reduce power outages.",
    " Title: New Zealand Implements Immediate Ban on Assault Rifles Following Deadly Mosque Shootings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings, New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced a ban on all assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, and military-style semi-automatic rifles. The ban, which went into effect immediately, will be followed by legislation next month.\n\nIn a live television announcement, Ardern urged citizens to make arrangements to turn in weapons banned under the new laws. She emphasized that the ban is a response to the nation's deadliest massacre in history, stating, \"The guns used in this attack had the power to shoot continuously. The times for the easy availability of these weapons must end.\"\n\nArdern added, \"We just want the guns back... It's about all of us. It's in the national interest, and it's about safety.\" She noted that gun ownership is \"a privilege and not a right\" in New Zealand.\n\nThe Prime Minister stated that an amnesty will be put in place for weapons to be handed in by citizens. The New Zealand cabinet will also implement a buyback plan for banned weapons, with \"tightly regulated\" exemptions for some owners such as hunters and farmers.\n\nIn the days following the attacks, the New Zealand government immediately began asking all owners of assault weapons or now-banned attachments to report them to the government in the next two days before turning them in.\n\nSince the attacks, Ardern has led a nation trying to grieve and work through the news of the killings, which, in total, rival the annual number of murders in New Zealand. On Tuesday, Ardern had told New Zealand's Parliament that tough gun laws were coming. She also said she would deny the man responsible for the nation's worst terror attack in modern history the one thing he likely craved: fame.\n\n\"He is a terrorist, he is a criminal, he is an extremist, but he will, when I speak, be nameless, and to others I implore you: Speak the names of those who were lost rather than the name of the man who took them,\" Ardern said.\n\nNew Zealand has fewer restrictions on rifles or shotguns than many countries. Handguns are more tightly controlled. About 1.5 million firearms are owned \u2013 legally and illegally \u2013 by civilians in New Zealand, according to police data tracked by GunPolicy.org, a website run in conjunction with the University of Sydney. This equates to about 30 firearms per 100 people. In the United States, the rate is approximately 120 firearms per 100 people, according to the site.\n\nAll gun owners in New Zealand must have a license, which they can get from age 16 (age 18 for semi-automatic weapons), but the weapon itself does not need to be registered with authorities, according to the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners, a New Zealand lobby group. Ardern said the suspect in Friday's attacks had a license and owned five guns. The majority of firearm owners in New Zealand are farmers or hunters.\n\nAccording to GunPolicy.org, New Zealand is among a handful of countries where police officers are routinely unarmed when they are on patrol. Officers in Britain, Ireland, Norway, and Iceland also carry firearms only in special circumstances.\n\nThe death toll in the attack at the Al Noor and Linwood mosques rose to 50 people Saturday; victims range in age from 2 to over 60. Services for the victims were held at churches across the country Sunday, and people laid flowers at memorial sites. A group of bikers performed the haka \u2013 a traditional ceremonial dance of New Zealand's Maori people \u2013 at the memorial in Christchurch.\n\nThirty-nine people remain in the hospital, and 11 were in intensive care in critical condition.",
    " Title: Call for Proscription of Order of Nine Angles as Terrorist Organisation\n\nArticle:\n\nA prominent anti-racism campaign group, Hope Not Hate, has called for the British government to outlaw the neo-Nazi Satanist group, the Order of Nine Angles (ONA), as a terrorist organisation. The call comes in the wake of the group's annual State of Hate report.\n\nThe Home Office stated that the list of proscribed terrorist groups is kept \"under review.\" Last week, two British extreme right-wing organisations were added to the list. One of these, Sonnenkrieg Division, was influenced by the ONA's Nazi-Satanist ideology.\n\nIn the past year, four teenagers linked to the ideology have been jailed in the UK for terror offences. One of them was convicted of preparing for a terror attack, which included attempts to alter himself in line with instructions set out in ONA texts.\n\nIn court, prosecutors described the organisation as \"self-consciously, explicitly malevolent\" and the \"most prominent and recognisable link between Satanism and the extreme right.\"\n\nHope Not Hate's report suggests that the occult organisation, thought to have been founded in the 1970s, has become increasingly prominent online. The report notes that the ONA's terminology and trappings have been adopted into the lexicon of the wider terroristic far-right.\n\nThe anti-racist campaign group argues that the group's \"sick ideas have drawn in young extremists in the UK and elsewhere, and have helped nourish a dangerous culture of unprecedented depravity amongst the extreme right, which has none of the moral constraints that previous generations of far-right activists had.\"\n\nYvette Cooper MP, chair of the home affairs select committee, urged the home secretary to immediately refer the ONA to the government's proscription review group. \"The combination of Nazi-Satanism, extreme violence, and sexual abuse makes it particularly troubling,\" she said. \"Action needs to be taken to prevent them grooming and radicalising other people.\"\n\nA Home Office spokesperson stated that action is being taken to \"root out and dismantle the groups that promote extreme right-wing views and we are giving police the tools and resources they need to tackle this threat.\" The spokesperson added, \"We keep the list of proscribed organisations under review.\"\n\nCounter-terrorism police have previously spoken about the increasing amount of work relating to \"niche ideologies\" such as violent Satanism.",
    " Title: Biden's Shift in Political Landscape: A Look at the Democratic Party's Shift and Biden's Career\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant political shift, former Vice President Joe Biden addressed union workers at the Teamsters Local 249 hall in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on April 29, 2019. This event underscores the evolution of the Democratic Party, with Biden, at that time the most recent candidate to file for the Democratic presidential nomination, being labeled as a moderate.\n\nThis labeling of Biden as a moderate highlights two key aspects: the rapid leftward shift of the Democratic Party and the progressive slant of the national media. A Democratic politician, in today's context, is considered a moderate if they advocate for the preservation of private health insurance, restrict third-trimester abortions, and maintain a key role for deportation in immigration policy. These positions were once compatible with liberal Democrats' creed, as held by Biden during his tenure as vice president, less than three years ago.\n\nIn the progressive media, Biden is facing criticism not just for his policies, but also for his relative silence on President Donald Trump. Critics argue that his indictment of Trump has not been expanded into a broader indictment of America for electing him.\n\nAs the primary elections approach, there is a possibility that Biden may shift his positions further left to appeal to the progressive base. He has already denounced the legal system as a \"white man's law,\" a statement that has raised questions about his views on the presumption of innocence. Clarity on this matter is sought from Biden.\n\nIt is crucial to note that Biden, throughout his career, has been a strong, albeit not wholly consistent, supporter of left-wing causes, including higher taxes, hate-crimes laws, and liberal judicial activism. Conservatives should not be deceived into perceiving him as a moderate, and neither should actual moderates. This shift in the political landscape underscores the importance of understanding the evolving dynamics within the Democratic Party and the role of social media in shaping public perception.",

Dianne Foley, mother of American journalist James Foley, who was beheaded by ISIS in 2014, commended the administration for prioritizing the return of American hostages.\n\n\"It's the beginning of a bit of justice,\" she said. \"For too many years, innocent Americans who are kidnapped or taken hostage around the world have been a very low priority. And so, I commend this administration for doing that.\"\n\nHowever, Dianne Foley also highlighted the ongoing issue of hundreds of innocent Americans still detained or taken hostage worldwide. \"So, I would ask that our intelligence and our amazing people help us to find Americans before tragic things happen -- that happened to our kids,\" she told host Steve Doocy.\n\nCarl and Marsha Mueller, the parents of Kayla Mueller, who was kidnapped in 2013 while serving as an aid worker, have conducted their own private investigation outside of the government.

    " Title: Pennsylvania Congressman's Personal Actions Contradict Anti-Abortion Stance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, a Pennsylvania congressman, Rep. Tim Murphy, has found himself in the center of a controversy that contradicts his long-standing anti-abortion stance. According to a report published by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Tuesday, Murphy, a vocal pro-life advocate, asked his girlfriend to terminate a pregnancy this year.\n\nThe report states that Shannon Edwards, a Pittsburgh woman half Murphy's age with whom he recently admitted to having an extramarital affair, texted Murphy in January about a possible pregnancy that turned out to be a false alarm. Edwards, in a text message, accused Murphy of hypocrisy, referring to a post from Murphy's professional Facebook account that criticized America for allowing abortions past 20 weeks of gestation.\n\n\"You have zero issue posting your pro-life stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week when we thought that was one of the options,\" she said, referring to Murphy's pro-life messages.\n\nIn response, Murphy admitted to not writing the messages himself, stating, \"I've never written them. Staff does them. I read them and winced. I told staff don't write any more. I will.\"\n\nThis revelation raises questions about Murphy's sincerity in his pro-life stance. As a congressman, Murphy has advocated for the U.S. government to define life as beginning at conception, a position that would outlaw some forms of birth control and force every woman to birth any conceived fetus against her will. The man who implied that his girlfriend abort a fetus he (hypothetically) helped conceive is trying to keep every other woman from accessing the same right.\n\nMoreover, Murphy is a current sponsor of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill that would ban abortion care provided after 20 weeks' gestation, defying the protections enshrined by Roe v. Wade. The House is set to vote on the bill on Tuesday.\n\nMurphy is not the first anti-abortion legislator to exhibit a different set of ethics in his personal life compared to the lives of the millions of U.S. women whose lives his votes affect. Anti-abortion Rep. Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee, who is still in office, supported his wife's two abortions and was recorded telling a 24-year-old woman with whom he was having an affair that she had to have an abortion \"to get this solved and get it over with so we can get on with our lives.\" DesJarlais, unsurprisingly, is also a sponsor of the 20-week abortion ban.\n\nThis revelation serves as a stark reminder of the importance of personal integrity and the need for politicians to uphold the values they advocate for in their public lives.",
    " Title: Ted Cruz Apologizes to New Yorkers in South Carolina Campaign Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nTIGERVILLE, S.C. \u2013 In a surprising turn of events during his stump speech in South Carolina, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas took aim at New York values, a remark that had previously sparked controversy among New York residents and officials.\n\nDuring a nearly full auditorium at North Greenville University, Cruz, seemingly eager to address the issue, asked, \"Now I\u2019m curious, do the people of South Carolina know what New York values are?\"\n\nIn an attempt to quell the backlash from his earlier comments, Cruz issued apologies in various forums, including remarks to reporters, on Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show, in a news release, and on Twitter.\n\nBy the end of the day, Cruz had introduced the topic to voters, stating, \"So today, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City all demanded I apologize.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I apologize to the millions of New Yorkers who\u2019ve been abandoned for years by liberal politicians.\"\n\nCruz also addressed specific political issues in New York, such as the ban on fracking, pro-life and pro-marriage advocates, and the exodus of small businesses due to high taxes and regulations.\n\nIn conclusion, Cruz said, \"I hope that was the apology they were looking for.\"\n\nJim Clinton, a 55-year-old resident of Greer, S.C., commented, \"He basically apologized to the rest of New York.\"",
    " Title: Trump Announces $12 Billion Aid Package for Farmers Amidst Ongoing Trade Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Tuesday, President Donald Trump reiterated his support for tariffs, stating that they are \"the greatest\" and that the United States will either negotiate fair trade deals or impose tariffs. The President's tweets come as the agricultural industry, which has been significantly impacted by the administration's trade policies, is set to receive $12 billion in emergency aid to cope with the fallout.\n\nAccording to reports by Politico and The Washington Post, the aid package is expected to be announced this week and will provide direct financial assistance to farmers, a purchase and distribution program for surplus agricultural products, and a trade promotion program. The aid package is reportedly being funded through a Depression-era program that allows the government to borrow up to $30 billion from the Treasury without congressional approval.\n\nThe agricultural industry has been one of the hardest hit sectors under President Trump's protectionist trade agenda. Foreign countries, including China, Mexico, and Canada, have retaliated with tens of billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on American soybeans, dairy, pork, apples, potatoes, and other US products. The impact of these tariffs has led to a drop in prices for agricultural products like soybeans to a 10-year low.\n\nRep. Mike Conaway (R-TX), who chairs the House Agricultural Committee, expressed confidence last week that the administration would act to help farmers \"persevere\" through this period. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has also been working on tools to mitigate the impact of the tariffs.\n\nHowever, President Trump has shown no signs of backing down from his tariff agenda. He has already threatened to tax foreign car imports ahead of trade talks with the European Union this week and has been tweeting a positive outlook on the tariffs' impact on the American economy.\n\nWhile many farmers are Republicans and Trump supporters, some are growing increasingly nervous about the long-term impact of the trade war. Roger Mehre, a Wisconsin dairy farmer, told a news outlet earlier in July that farmers in his circles are getting increasingly nervous about the trade war. \"We need them, and they need us. Both sides are going to lose,\" Mehre said.\n\nThe aid package is a step towards mitigating the financial disaster faced by farmers, but it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to alleviate the industry's concerns. Republican lawmakers from agriculture-heavy states, such as Sens. Ben Sasse (R-NE) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), have warned the administration about the potential political fallout of the trade war.\n\n\"This is dumb,\" Sasse said in a statement in May. \"Europe, Canada, and Mexico are not China, and you don't treat allies the same way you treat opponents. We've been down this road before\u2014blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression.\"\n\nThe aid package is expected to be formally announced this week.",
    " Title: Russian Pilot Rescued After Downing of Warplane by Turkey; Tensions Remain High\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a developing story, one of the two crew members of the Russian warplane shot down by Turkey on Tuesday has been rescued, according to Russian officials. The rescue operation, which took place over a 12-hour period ending in the early hours of Wednesday, was carried out by a Syrian commando unit.\n\nThe incident has escalated international tensions, with the shooting down of the Russian Su-24 fighter jet by Turkish F-16s occurring after Turkey claimed the Russian plane was in Turkish airspace. Turkey maintains that it issued 10 warnings to the Russian warplane before taking action, while Russia asserts that the jet was flying over Syria at the time.\n\nInitial reports indicated that both crew members had ejected from the jet and parachuted to the ground, but one was found dead Tuesday by a Syrian rebel group. The surviving crew member was rescued in the operation, although one of the helicopters involved in the search was reportedly shot down by rebel fighters and destroyed on the ground.\n\nRussia's defense minister stated that one of the helicopter crewmen was killed, but the rest were evacuated safely. The incident has resulted in a series of angry exchanges between the two countries, with both sides calling for military restraint while continuing to trade harsh rhetoric.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu stated Wednesday that Russia could not justify its attacks on ethnic Turks in Syria under the pretext of fighting the Islamic State, and reiterated President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's stance that Turkey will continue to defend its airspace. However, Davutoglu also stated that targeting Russia is \"out of the question.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described the shooting of the plane as a \"planned provocation\" that is prompting Moscow to \"reconsider relations with Ankara.\" On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the shooting a \"stab in the back.\"\n\nRussia has deployed an advanced anti-aircraft system to its base in Syria, with the missiles appearing to be aimed at Turkish planes or planes from other coalition members, such as the U.S. or France. Moscow may also be considering nonmilitary forms of retaliation against Turkey, with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev stating Wednesday that \"important joint projects could be canceled and Turkish firms could lose Russian market share.\"\n\nThe two countries' economies are closely linked by energy purchases, tourism, and other business activity. The incident has raised concerns about the potential for further escalation and the impact on regional stability.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Senate Group Nears Deal to End Government Shutdown and Raise Debt Ceiling\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, a bipartisan group of senators, led by Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), is reportedly 70% to 80% close to a deal that could end the ongoing government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling. The deal, which is still under negotiation, would also address the looming deadline for the debt limit and provide a framework for a long-term budget agreement.\n\nThe senators have been working on a plan that includes a longer extension of the debt limit and government funding, a two-year delay on the 2.3% tax on medical devices, and greater flexibility for federal agencies to deal with sequestration. The plan also includes verification measures to prevent fraud in the health care insurance system.\n\nSen. Manchin, in an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on Monday, expressed optimism about the progress being made. \"We're making progress. We're going to continue to meet throughout the day. And the conversations have been very constructive,\" he said. Sen. Collins, who has been actively involved in the negotiations, told reporters on Monday that \"we're not going to release any details until we have an agreement. I hope we will have an agreement. We're making progress toward an agreement, but we're not there yet.\"\n\nHowever, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) rejected the plan on Saturday, stating that it \"is not going to go anyplace at this stage.\" Reid, who has been a key player in the negotiations, expressed support for the plan's objectives but criticized the lack of agreement with the Democrats on other issues.\n\nThe Senate voted on a separate procedural measure to extend the debt limit with no strings attached on Saturday, but the measure fell short of the 60 votes needed to proceed. The partial shutdown of government services has been in effect since October 1.\n\nA key sticking point in the negotiations is the issue of sequestration, with Democrats and the White House resisting any agreement that would allow for another round of spending cuts as scheduled in mid-January. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) is pushing back against this demand, citing the need to address the spending limits.\n\nRepublican Sen. Bob Corker (Tennessee), who has been working closely with Manchin and Collins, expressed optimism about the prospects of a deal being reached on Monday. \"I know Mitch and Harry are talking, and I think we're about to get to a place to move something hopefully off the Senate floor that's widely bipartisan,\" he told CNN.\n\nThe Senate reconvenes at 2 p.m. ET on Monday, with the House meeting at noon. The Treasury Department has warned that the government will be unable to pay its bills unless the debt limit is increased by Thursday. The negotiations are a critical step in resolving the ongoing political impasse and restoring normal government operations.",
    " Title: FBI Interview of Hillary Clinton Concludes, Trump Calls for Criminal Charges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) concluded its interview with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Saturday, following an investigation into her use of a private email server for official correspondence. The interview, which took place at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., marked the final steps in the case.\n\nClinton's campaign stated that the meeting lasted approximately three-and-a-half hours. In a statement, campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said, \"Hillary Clinton is pleased to have had the opportunity to assist the Department of Justice in bringing this review to a conclusion.\" Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, would have no further comment about the interview, the campaign added.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus commented on the interview, stating, \"Hillary Clinton has just taken the unprecedented step of becoming the first major party presidential candidate to be interviewed by the FBI as part of a criminal investigation surrounding her reckless conduct.\" He further questioned whether this was the kind of leadership the American people want in the White House.\n\nThe email issue has been a significant point of contention in the campaign, with Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, repeatedly stating that the probe undermines Clinton's fitness for office. Trump has called his opponent \"Crooked Hillary\" and questioned her trustworthiness in the White House.\n\nClinton has argued that she is more trustworthy than Trump on handling the issues that matter to most Americans: foreign policy, national security, and running the economy. However, the email investigation has lingered throughout her campaign, and Trump has asserted that Clinton will receive leniency from a Democratic administration.\n\nThe email scandal intensified earlier this week when Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, initiated an impromptu meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on her airplane in Phoenix. The meeting raised concerns about special treatment, as Lynch, a President Obama appointee, decides whether to bring charges in the case.\n\nLynch has stated that she will accept whatever recommendations she receives from the agency's career prosecutors and lawyers. Clinton has said using a private server was a mistake but that other secretaries of state had also used a personal email address. The matter was referred for investigation last July by the inspectors general for the State Department and intelligence community following the discovery of emails that they said contained classified information.\n\nAgents have already interviewed top Clinton aides, including her former State Department chief of staff Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin, a longtime aide who is currently the vice chairwoman of Clinton's campaign. The staffer who set up the server, Bryan Pagliano, was granted limited immunity from prosecution by the Justice Department last fall in exchange for his cooperation. The FBI, as a matter of course, seeks to interview individuals central to an investigation before concluding its work.\n\nThe emails were routed through a server located in the basement of Clinton's New York home during her tenure as the nation's top diplomat from 2009 to 2013. Dozens of the emails sent or received by Clinton through her private server were later determined to contain classified material. Clinton has repeatedly said that none of the emails were marked classified at the time they were sent or received. As part of the probe, she has turned over the hard drive from her email server to the FBI.",
    " Title: Satellite Evidence Confirms Destruction of Ancient St. Elijah Monastery in Iraq by Islamic State\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a grim confirmation, satellite images have revealed that the oldest Christian monastery in Iraq, St. Elijah's, has been destroyed by the extremist group Islamic State (IS). The monastery, which stood for 1,400 years on a hill near Mosul, is believed to have been demolished in late 2014, shortly after IS seized the city.\n\nThe images, obtained by the Associated Press, suggest that the ancient site was reduced to rubble, a stark reminder of the group's brutal campaign against religious and cultural heritage in Iraq and neighboring Syria. Father Paul Thabit Habib, a Catholic priest from Mosul, described the destruction as an attempt to \"expel us from Iraq, eliminating and finishing our existence in this land.\"\n\nIS has been notorious for its persecution of Christians, seizing their property, forcing conversions, and imposing a special tax. The group has also demolished numerous monasteries, churches, and pre-Islamic sites, including Nimrud, Hatra, and Nineveh in Iraq, and Palmyra in Syria.\n\nSt. Elijah's Monastery, or Deir Mar Elia, is believed to have been constructed by Assyrian monks in the late 6th Century. It was later claimed by a Chaldean Catholic order. In 1743, its monks were given an ultimatum by Persian forces to convert to Islam. Many were massacred, with as many as 150 monks reportedly killed.\n\nThe destruction of the monastery would have gone unnoticed had it not been for the satellite images. Due to the security risks in IS-controlled areas, journalists and archaeologists are unable to access these regions. Moreover, IS did not release any footage showing the demolition of this particular ancient site on its propaganda outlets.\n\nSince taking control of the area in 2014, IS has destroyed more than 100 churches and monasteries in Mosul and surrounding Christian villages, such as Bashiqa and Qaraqosh. The militants, who believe that Islam is the only valid religion, have targeted minorities and destroyed their places of worship, forcing those who remain to choose between conversion and execution.\n\nFr. Thabit described St. Elijah's as a \"spiritual place for Christians to visit and to have religious ceremonies.\" He added that the monastery was a significant part of Iraq's Christian history, attracting visitors from Mosul, both Christians and Muslims.\n\nIn the 1970s, the monastery served as a base for the Iraqi Republican Guard. In 2003, one of its walls was damaged by the impact of a T-72 tank turret during the US-led invasion of Iraq. The US Army later used the monastery as a base, but a chaplain recognized its historical significance, leading to the monastery being cleared.\n\nStephen Wood of Allsource Analysis told AP that the satellite images published on Wednesday suggest the monastery was destroyed between August and September 2014, two to three months after IS captured Mosul and ordered Christians who had not already fled to leave. The images show that the stone walls have been \"pulverized,\" according to Mr. Wood.\n\nA security source in Nineveh province separately confirmed to the BBC on Wednesday that IS militants had blown up the monastery, completely destroying it. The loss of St. Elijah's Monastery is a significant blow to Iraq's rich Christian heritage, underscoring the devastating impact of IS's campaign of destruction and intolerance.",
    " Title: Trump-Media Relationship: A Love-Hate Saga Continues into Fourth Year\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON -- The relationship between President Donald Trump and the mainstream media has been a rollercoaster ride of criticism and counter-criticism since the inception of his presidency. The two entities have been engaged in a verbal sparring match, with the President often labeling the media as the \"enemy of the American people,\" while the media retaliates with their own rebuttals.\n\nAt the heart of this ongoing feud is the President's disdain for what he perceives as biased and negative coverage. A Media Research Center study indicates that 89 percent of the Trump coverage by major media networks is negative. Corey Lewandowski, former Trump campaign manager, believes this treatment is intentional, stating, \"They want to highlight what they perceive to be failures... This is exactly what they did during the campaign.\"\n\nHowever, the media maintains their stance, with White House Correspondents' Association President Jeff Mason asserting, \"We are not fake news, we are not failing news organizations, and we are not the enemy of the American people.\"\n\nThe President's first press conference, a testy affair, set the tone for this relationship. He sparred with several journalists, declaring, \"The public does not believe you people anymore!\"\n\nDespite the ongoing tension, there are those who believe the President has a soft spot for the media, albeit a complex one. Paul Farhi, media reporter for The Washington Post, suggests, \"I think Trump makes a very big show of disliking us, disrespecting us, and disparaging us, but I think in fact, secretly, or maybe not so secretly, really likes us.\"\n\nTrump's approach to the media is multifaceted, using handwritten notes to either praise or criticize them. Regardless of the message, Farhi notes, \"Trump is a very sophisticated media animal... He knows how to utilize the media to get his message out.\"\n\nAs the President's fourth year in office approaches, the question remains whether this daily soap opera drama will continue. Jake Sherman with Politico believes the answer is yes, stating, \"Donald Trump is 70 years old... He's not going to change... He is who he is, and you're not going to change that at this point in the game.\"\n\nOne potential development in this escalating fight is the President's proposed changes to libel and slander laws to make it easier to sue reporters and media outlets over their stories. This could mark the next level in a battle with no foreseeable end.",
    " Title: Congressional Democrats Criticize Obama Administration Over NSA Surveillance Programs\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, the Obama administration faced a backlash from congressional Democrats on Friday following revelations that the National Security Agency (NSA) broke privacy rules and overstepped its authority thousands of times since 2008. The details were reported late Thursday in The Washington Post, based on an audit and other secret documents provided by NSA leaker Edward Snowden.\n\nThe report has challenged claims by President Obama just last week that the NSA was not abusing its authority, and complicated his effort to reassure Americans and Congress that with a little more oversight and transparency, the surveillance programs are nothing to be worried about.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called the latest reports \"extremely disturbing.\" Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said, \"Reports that the NSA repeatedly overstepped its legal boundaries, broke privacy regulations and attempted to shield required disclosure of violations are outrageous, inappropriate and must be addressed.\"\n\nSenior lawmakers said they had been unaware of the audit until they read the news on Friday. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he planned to hold another hearing in the wake of the report.\n\n\"The American people rely on the intelligence community to provide forthright and complete information so that Congress and the courts can properly conduct oversight,\" Leahy said in a statement. \"I remain concerned that we are still not getting straightforward answers from the NSA.\"\n\nObama has repeatedly said that Congress was thoroughly briefed on the programs revealed by Snowden in June. The two programs that were described vacuum up vast amounts of metadata -- such as telephone numbers called and called from, the time and duration of calls -- from most Americans' phone records, and scoop up global Internet usage data.\n\nProposed legislation to dismantle the programs was narrowly defeated last month in the House, and at least 19 other pending bills are aimed at restraining NSA's powers or changing how the agency is regulated, according to a count kept by the ACLU.\n\nA week ago, Obama sought to soothe concerns by promising to consider reforms to NSA surveillance. \"It's not enough for me to have confidence in these programs,\" he said at a White House news conference. \"The American people have to have confidence in them as well.\"\n\nHe announced changes such as convening an outside advisory panel to review U.S. surveillance powers, although it is unclear how that would differ from the existing U.S. Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, mandated by Congress to monitor surveillance and constitutional concerns.\n\nObama also said the NSA would hire a privacy officer -- though the NSA already has a compliance office. None of those measures would seem likely to stop the kind of inadvertent collection of information that was described in the NSA audit.\n\nMost of the infractions revealed late Thursday involve unauthorized surveillance of Americans or foreign intelligence targets in the United States, both of which are restricted by law and executive order, according to the May 3, 2012 audit, and other top-secret documents.\n\nThe May audit counted 2,776 incidents in the preceding 12 months of unauthorized collection, storage, access to or distribution of legally protected communications. Most were reported to be unintended, and many involved failures to take sufficient care or violations of standard operating procedure. They ranged from significant violations of law to typographical errors that resulted in unintended interceptions of U.S. emails and telephone calls.\n\nThe most serious incidents included a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 Americans and green-card holders.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, backed up the administration on its claims, releasing a lengthy statement on Friday afternoon claiming that most the compliance problems at the NSA happen when the agency inadvertently collects records on a non-American who enters the U.S., a point when the NSA is supposed to follow different procedures.\n\n\"The majority of these 'compliance incidents' are, therefore, unintentional and do not involve any inappropriate surveillance of Americans,\" she said. \"As I have said previously, the committee has never identified an instance in which the NSA has intentionally abused its authority to conduct surveillance for inappropriate purposes.\"\n\nLate Friday, the White House issued a statement saying, \"the majority of the compliance incidents are unintentional. The documents demonstrate that the NSA is monitoring, detecting, addressing and reporting compliance incidents.\"\n\nIt directed questions to the National Security Council, and NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden directed questions to the NSA. NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said the number of incidents in the first quarter of 2012 was higher than normal, and that the number has ranged from 372 to 1,162 in the past three years, due to factors such as \"implementation of new procedures or guidance with respect to our authorities that prompt a spike that requires 'fine tuning,' changes to the technology or software in the targeted environment for which we had no prior knowledge, unforeseen shortcomings in our systems, new or expanded access, and 'roaming' by foreign targets into the U.S., some of which NSA can not anticipate in advance but each instance of which is reported as an incident.\"\n\n\"When NSA makes a mistake in carrying out its foreign intelligence mission, the agency reports the issue internally and to federal overseers -- and aggressively gets to the bottom of it,\" Vines said.",
    " Title: Obama Urges Congress to Revive Economic Stimulus Measures Amid Growing Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK ( CNNMoney ) -- In response to economic headwinds from Europe and a series of concerning labor market reports, President Obama has called on Congress to reconsider a set of legislative proposals aimed at stimulating the economy. The initiatives, initially proposed in September, include investments in infrastructure, tax breaks for small businesses, and funding for teachers, firefighters, and other public sector workers.\n\nCongressional Republicans declined to pass the measures last year, and the Obama administration had previously moved on to other debates. However, the current economic climate has sparked concern that the economy may be slowing, and further fiscal stimulus may be necessary to maintain growth rates.\n\nEurope's debt crisis and the resulting economic malaise are adding to worries, as American exports may potentially slow due to the situation. President Obama emphasized the need for action, stating, \"Right now, people in this town should be focused on doing everything we can to keep our recovery going and keeping our country strong -- and that requires some action on the part of Congress.\"\n\nHowever, the partisan Congress, known more for its gridlock than its legislative abilities, is unlikely to heed Obama's call. Lawmakers will recess in July and already face deadlines on student loan and highway funding bills. Upon their return from recess, they will face the so-called fiscal cliff.\n\nThe fiscal cliff includes the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, middle-class protection from the Alternative Minimum Tax, and more than 50 \"temporary\" tax breaks for individuals and businesses that are set to run out. It also includes nearly $1 trillion in across-the-board spending cuts across many areas of the federal budget. These spending cuts would significantly impact defense and non-defense spending.\n\nA number of stimulus measures, such as the payroll tax cut and extended unemployment benefits, will also be ending. Congress must act before the end of the year to address these issues.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, speaking to members of Congress on Thursday, urged swift action to resolve the issue, stating that going over the cliff would \"pose a significant threat to the recovery.\" He added that uncertainty over the issue's resolution, largely in Congress's hands, could \"undermine business and household confidence.\"\n\nDespite the pleas from Bernanke and Obama, lawmakers are unlikely to move quickly on legislation that would provide further stimulus or certainty to markets. Republicans are generally opposed to additional spending, and election year politics is unlikely to allow for compromise. Every House seat, one-third of the Senate, and the presidency are up for grabs in November.\n\nObama, acknowledging that his plea for action may fall on deaf ears, suggested that Congress will be held accountable. \"If Congress decides despite all that that they are not going to do anything about this simply because it's an election year, then they should explain to the American people why,\" he said.",
    " Title: \"A Year After Parkland: Shift in Gun Policy and the Evolution of the Second Amendment Debate\"\n\nArticle:\n\nOne year after the tragic shooting in Parkland, Florida, the landscape of gun policy in the United States has undergone significant changes. The once-unyielding stance on gun rights, famously encapsulated by Charlton Heston's declaration, \"From my cold, dead hands,\" has softened in the face of a series of mass shootings.\n\nSince the Parkland tragedy, nine states have implemented \"red flag\" laws, allowing temporary seizure of weapons for a variety of reasons, including domestic battery and social media threats. Last year, authorities carried out at least 1,700 such seizures. This shift has been observed in states with Republican governors as well.\n\nAccording to Adam Winkler, author of \"Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America,\" the number of Americans living in states leaning towards more gun control has risen to 140 million from about 112 million.\n\nRobert Spitzer, author of \"The Politics of Gun Control,\" notes a change in public perception, stating, \"We don't have tens of thousands of people being rousted in the middle of the night by the police [to take their guns].\" He adds, \"That rhetoric gets dulling and not very effective after a while.\"\n\nPresident Trump, who has appointed two gun-rights-friendly Supreme Court justices, will soon test their views in a gun rights case originating from New York City this spring. However, the powerful appeals from Florida shooting survivors have led to what former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, a mass shooting survivor herself, calls a \"tectonic shift\" in U.S. gun policy.\n\nThis shift comes amidst the NRA's struggles with financing and its involvement in the investigation of Russian meddling in U.S. political affairs. The youth movement launched in the wake of the Parkland shooting has played a significant role in this change, challenging the status quo and prompting a reevaluation of the Second Amendment in light of public safety concerns.",
    " Title: Republican Party Shifts Stance on Immigration: A Step Toward Reality or a Political Gamble?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift from its 2012 stance, the Republican Party has issued a new statement of principles on immigration that advocates for a path to legal residence and work permits for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. This change in policy, while a step forward in addressing the concerns of the Hispanic community, also presents a risky move within the party due to potential backlash from conservative factions.\n\nThe new policy, which contrasts with Mitt Romney's 2012 vow to veto the Dream Act, acknowledges the plight of these individuals, stating, \"It is time to provide an opportunity for legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children through no fault of their own, those who know no other place as home.\"\n\nThe 2012 party platform had been critical of any form of amnesty and had promised steps to enforce self-deportation. However, the new policy, while not offering a special path to citizenship, does allow for these individuals to live legally and without fear if they meet certain requirements, such as paying back taxes, passing background checks, and learning English.\n\nThe policy also addresses the issue of eventual citizenship, stating that while a special path to citizenship is rejected, there is no outright denial of eventual citizenship. This stance contrasts with President Barack Obama's desire to create a new avenue for the undocumented to be naturalized.\n\nHowever, the policy has drawn criticism for its stance on E-Verify, a system that requires the federal government to confirm the employment eligibility of every new hire in America. This system, endorsed in the new statement, has been criticized for its potential to infringe on the rights of native-born Americans and for its susceptibility to errors, leading to delays in hiring and applicant frustration.\n\nThe Republican Party's shift in policy represents a significant change, but it also poses a challenge for the party leadership in managing the expectations of conservative factions and maintaining the support of the Hispanic community. The need to appease tea party members is evident in the policy's tough demands, such as securing the borders and implementing E-Verify.\n\nThe question remains whether this policy shift will be enough to attract the Hispanic vote and whether it will appease conservative factions within the party. Only time will tell if this halfway measure toward reality will prove to be a successful compromise or a political gamble.",
    " Title: European Union and United States Impose Tough Economic Sanctions on Russia, Escalating Pressure on Putin Amid Ukraine Conflict\n\nArticle:\n\nThe European Union (EU) has adopted a series of tough new economic sanctions against Russia in response to the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine. The measures, coordinated with the United States, include an arms embargo and a ban on the sale of dual-use and sensitive technologies, such as advanced energy technology equipment relevant for deep sea and Arctic drilling.\n\nUnder the financial sanctions, Russian state-owned banks will be prohibited from selling bonds or equities with a maturity of over 90 days in European capital markets. Additionally, eight individuals close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and three entities have been added to the list of people and companies subject to EU-wide asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe new sanctions come as Ukrainian forces reportedly made significant gains near the site where Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed on July 17. According to reports, Ukrainian forces are attempting to split the territory held by pro-Russian rebels into two parts between the major cities of Donetsk and Luhansk, and to cut off supply lines from Russia to the rebels.\n\nIgor Girkin, a Russian citizen who is the top defense official in the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, stated on Monday that more than 100 wounded separatist fighters had been evacuated to Russia. Meanwhile, the self-proclaimed Prime Minister of the separatist republic, Alexander Borodai, left the rebel-held territory for Moscow on Monday, sparking speculation that the rebels may be fleeing the city.\n\nThe EU measures were decided at a meeting of ambassadors from the bloc's 28 member countries. The new sanctions will take immediate effect and will be codified in legal language and published on Thursday. The names of the individuals and entities to be added to the travel ban and assets freeze list will be known on Wednesday.\n\nThe Western nations are demanding that Russia halt the alleged supply of arms to Ukrainian separatists and other actions that destabilize the situation in eastern Ukraine. The EU measures are intended to be under constant review and can be adjusted in light of new developments.\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande stated that the Western leaders \"regretted\" that Russia has not effectively pressured the separatists to negotiate nor taken expected concrete measures to assure control of the Russian-Ukrainian border. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated that any sanctions imposed by the U.S. and European countries on Russia would not be effective.\n\nThe new sanctions are not expected to fully cut off Russian economic sectors from the West, with U.S. officials holding in reserve the option of imposing more severe sanctions if Russia launches a full-on military incursion in Ukraine or takes a similarly provocative step.",

    " Title: The Future of Obamacare: A Look at the Implications of the Failed \"Repeal and Replace\" Effort\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Senate's attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has failed, leaving the future of the healthcare law uncertain. Here's what the collapse of the \"repeal and replace\" effort could mean for you.\n\nWhile Republicans have argued that Obamacare is collapsing under its own weight, independent analyses paint a different picture. The focus of the debate primarily revolves around the health insurance marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act for individuals who do not receive coverage through an employer or government programs like Medicare or Medicaid. Approximately 7% of the country buys coverage on the individual market.\n\nIf the law remains unchanged, the marketplaces will remain stable in most parts of the country, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Moreover, participating insurers are on track to have their best year in the marketplaces since they began in 2014, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nHowever, some major players, such as Anthem, have announced they will no longer offer coverage in many places next year due to uncertainty about federal policy. Yet, Centene, another insurer, is expanding its coverage areas. Centene CEO Michael Neidorff stated Tuesday that the company's marketplace business \"continues to be particularly strong.\"\n\nDespite this, those buying coverage on the exchanges are likely to have fewer options next year. There are more than 24,000 people currently buying insurance on the exchanges who live in counties that might not have a participating insurance provider, according to preliminary insurance filings. Final decisions won't be made until fall.\n\n\"The individual insurance market has been stabilizing, but it needs continued support and can be undermined,\" tweeted Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, on Friday. \"Congress could play a big role in shoring them up and improving affordability.\"\n\nPremiums remain out of reach for some people, particularly those who do not qualify for federal subsidies. Additionally, the cheapest plans come with high deductibles that can make it difficult to access coverage.\n\nThe pool of people using the exchanges has been sicker and older than anticipated, leading to higher premiums and fewer insurance companies willing to participate. One reason there aren't more younger, healthier people buying insurance on the exchange is due to one of the ACA's most popular provisions: the requirement that insurers let young adults stay on their parents' plans until age 26. The Obama administration also allowed people to keep their pre-ACA plans longer than originally anticipated, keeping some healthier people from moving to the marketplace. Insurers also complain that the ACA's penalties for not having coverage are too lenient, and that it's too easy for people to enroll only when they anticipate needing care.\n\nDo Republicans share some of the blame for existing problems? In 2014, Congressional Republicans limited the funding in one part of the ACA that helped offset extreme losses by insurers as the marketplaces were being started. Republicans also took the Obama administration to court to block payments to insurance companies for subsidies that reduce deductibles and co-payments for lower-income customers.\n\nThe administration has kept insurance companies guessing about whether it will continue to reimburse them for the cost-sharing subsidies. The administration has also eased enforcement of the requirement that most people have insurance. These acts are the main drivers of the premium increases sought by insurers for next year, according to the consulting firm Oliver Wyman. The uncertain future of the cost-sharing subsidies is the main factor Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish cited Wednesday when telling investors the company may pull out of more state exchanges unless Washington takes steps to stabilize the market.\n\nIf Democrats and Republicans want to improve the marketplaces, what could they do? Besides ending the dispute over the cost-sharing subsidies, lawmakers could also continue one of the other industry supports, which was only supposed to be temporary. That program essentially subsidizes the cost of the sickest customers, reducing premiums. Experts have proposed many other changes, including expanding premium subsidies, giving insurers incentives to sell plans in counties that would otherwise lack coverage, and making families eligible for premium subsidies if plans offered by an employer aren't affordable. Some of those changes would be easier to pass than others, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned Friday morning that Republicans will not pass a \"bailout\" for insurance companies.\n\nMost of the gains in insurance coverage since the ACA was passed have come through the law's expansion of Medicaid eligibility, even though 19 states have chosen not to expand the program. However, more states are expected to do so. If the law isn't changed, 80% of the population could live in states that expanded Medicaid by 2026, according to the CBO.\n\nStates that haven't expanded may be more likely to if they can get permission from the Trump administration to not follow some Medicaid rules. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price has told governors he's eager to approve alternative Medicaid models. However, advocates for the poor could challenge any actions they think go beyond what's allowed without changing the law.",
    " Title: Republican Losses in Virginia and New Jersey Elections Signal Potential Trouble for GOP in 2018 Midterms\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - The Democratic victories in Virginia and New Jersey have indicated a significant loss of ground for the Republican Party in suburban areas, where President Donald Trump's unpopularity could lead to heavy losses in next year's congressional races.\n\nThe results from Tuesday, particularly in Virginia, suggest that Trump's strategy of catering to a loyal but limited base has not enabled him to broaden support for his presidency or his party.\n\nDemocrats were elated, believing that control of the U.S. House of Representatives, currently controlled by the Republicans, and perhaps even the Senate, might be up for grabs in next year's elections.\n\nSome Republicans shared this view after their party's candidates did poorly among independent, college-educated, women, and minority voters in suburban areas.\n\n\"Unless we get our act together, we are going to lose heavily,\" said Republican Senator John McCain on Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats would need to pick up 24 seats next year to retake control of the House. Should that happen, Trump's policy agenda would be effectively dead, and the administration would come under greater scrutiny.\n\nThe win by Democrat Phil Murphy in New Jersey's governor's race came as no surprise due to the unpopularity of outgoing Republican Governor Chris Christie. However, Ralph Northam's 9-point victory over Republican Ed Gillespie for governor in swing-state Virginia was larger than expected.\n\nTrump quickly tried to distance himself from Gillespie's poor showing, saying on Twitter that the Republican candidate \"worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for.\"\n\nStill, Trump's leadership record appeared to motivate Democrats to vote in record numbers in Virginia, with exit polls showing that many came out simply to express their displeasure with the president.\n\n\"Trump is turning off more voters than he's bringing in,\" said Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist in Washington. \"His base is strong, but it isn't growing.\"\n\nDuring his first year in office, Trump has consistently played to a base of passionate supporters, many of them older white men who live in rural areas declining in population, and has shown little inclination to reach out to the majority of voters who disapprove of him.\n\nWhit Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Virginia, said the party was on a risky track. \"Republicans have traded fast-growing upscale suburban counties for slow-growing or declining rural areas. That is not a formula for long-term success.\"\n\nThere may also be signs of slippage in Trump's political base.\n\nIn Virginia, Gillespie campaigned hard on immigration and crime - two hot issues with the president's supporters - but did worse than expected in some rural and suburban areas that Trump easily won last year.\n\nIn rural Dickenson County, considered to be the heart of Trump country in Virginia, Gillespie's margin over Northam was almost 7 percentage points less than Trump's margin of victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton last year.\n\nTrump won the city of Virginia Beach in 2016 by 3 points, but Gillespie lost to Northam there by 5, a swing of eight points.\n\nMore critically, Gillespie was blown out by Northam in northern Virginia's populous suburbs, where Trump also struggled in the presidential race.\n\n\"The suburbs came out in full force,\" said Matt Mackowiak, a Republican strategist. \"They appear to be very motivated to try and deliver a message to Trump.\"\n\nIn growing Loudoun County, outside of Washington, Democrat Barack Obama barely edged out Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race. On Tuesday, Northam buried Gillespie there by almost 20 points.\n\n\"I'm worried,\" said Ari Fleischer, a former White House spokesman for Republican President George W. Bush, to Fox News on Wednesday. \"Democrats came out in huge numbers yesterday in the races, and if they have that kind of enthusiasm going into 2018, it's going to be very tough sailing for Republicans.\"\n\nGillespie, a longtime Washington insider and lobbyist, tried to keep his distance from Trump personally even as he adopted some of his more combative campaign rhetoric.\n\nIt was a strategy that failed, and Mackowiak said the result reflected Trump's historically low approval rating. \"I don't think the White House was worried about that before, but now I think they have to be.\"\n\nThe five-day Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll has Trump hovering around 35 percent approval nationally, with close to 60 percent of respondents disapproving of his performance in office.\n\nA person familiar with Trump's political operation dismissed the election results on Tuesday as having anything to do with the president, noting that both New Jersey and Virginia were won by Clinton in 2016.\n\nAndrew Surabian, an adviser to the pro-Trump political group Great America Alliance, said Gillespie lost because he was exactly the kind of establishment Republican that Trump voters have rejected.\n\n\"Ed Gillespie's campaign went down in flames because he failed to fully embrace the president or his agenda,\" Surabian said, \"and without a coherent message and an authentic messenger, Republican candidates will not be successful moving forward.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Legal Challenge Against Michigan's Vote-by-Mail Plan: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate over vote-by-mail in the United States has taken a new turn with President Donald Trump's criticism of Michigan's plan to send absentee ballot applications to all of its 7.7 million registered voters. The legality of this move, however, remains unclear.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump tweeted that Michigan's plan was illegal and without authorization, stating that he would withhold funding to the state if it chose to proceed with this path. The tweet read, \"I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!\"\n\nHowever, it is probably unlikely that the president can withhold federal funding to assist with Michigan's elections this year, as the New York Times noted in its own fact check, which suggests that the funding has likely already been distributed to the states.\n\nThe Trump campaign, however, has a solid legal case against the state sending unsolicited vote-by-mail applications to voters. The key issue is the term \"unsolicited.\" The Times notes that a Trump campaign official cited a 2008 Michigan case in which a judge stated that local clerks could not send absentee ballot applications to a limited universe of voters.\n\nThe 2018 amendment to Michigan's constitution, known as Proposition 3, allows absentee voting for any reason but does not address the issue raised by the 2008 case. The amendment does not authorize state authorities to send unsolicited applications, nor does it state that state authorities should be able to make voting by mail more available than required.\n\nIn the 2008 case, Fleming v. Macomb, the Michigan Court of Appeals held unanimously that while private entities\u2014including political parties\u2014may send unsolicited absentee ballot applications to their members, the state itself cannot. The Times' \"fact check\" claims that the 2008 case is no longer applicable because it involved sending applications to \"a limited universe of voters.\" However, this was not the basis for the court's decision.\n\nTherefore, President Trump's claim that Michigan's effort \"was done illegally and without authorization\" appears to be well-rooted in precedent and the text of the Michigan election statute. As for funding, that is another issue. Trump could potentially withhold other, future funding to the state, though this could prove more politically damaging than the risk of voter fraud itself.\n\nJoel B.

    " Title: Critics Slam Obama Administration's Deportation Policy as Ineffective in Reducing Deportations\n\nArticle:\n\nImmigrant advocacy groups have criticized the Obama administration's efforts to reduce the deportations of law-abiding undocumented immigrants, claiming that the policy has had minimal impact. The administration's review found that fewer than 2% of the over 400,000 pending deportation cases have been halted, with thousands more cases expected to be closed.\n\nOn Monday, a coalition of immigrant advocates condemned the administration's policy, stating that the paltry results so far expose a reluctance among immigration agents to enforce the new policy. Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice Education Fund, expressed disappointment, stating, \"We were quite hopeful that the new policies would usher in a new era of humane enforcement. A year later, we are sad to declare that the implementation of this policy is failing.\"\n\nIn 2011, the Obama administration announced a shift in focus to the deportation of convicted criminals, national security threats, and visa fraudsters. The administration issued memorandums granting its agents \"prosecutorial discretion\" to extend leniency to DREAM Act-eligible individuals and those with clean records. Options included deferred deportation, which could last for up to 12 months, and the authorization of people to work in the U.S. legally.\n\nHowever, critics argue that the administration's immigration policies have drawn criticism from all sides. Republicans claim the administration is trying to circumvent immigration laws to grant amnesty and blocked the Senate's passage of the DREAM Act bill in 2010. On the other hand, immigrant advocates and Latino leaders have criticized Obama for increasing the pace of deportations beyond that of the Bush administration. The Obama administration's tougher enforcement has led to the deportation of a record 1.1 million people in the last three years.\n\nLast week, ICE Director John Morton told NPR's Weekend Edition Saturday that the targeting of serious criminal offenders is driving the deportation numbers. He stated that roughly 216,000 criminals were removed last year. However, immigrant advocates argue that the stepped-up enforcement continues to target people who are supposed to be protected under the new policy.\n\nCritics claim that ICE is not effectively applying its newfound discretion, in part by declining to offer the full range of options called for in the new policy even though people in a majority of cases meet the standards. Crystal Williams, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, stated on the call that most people are being offered administrative closure without the option to obtain work: \"It's putting your file on a shelf. That's it. No other possibilities are being offered, like the settlement of cases, adjustment of status.\"\n\nAs a result, critics predict that the new policy will clear no more than 5% of the cases. The administration has yet to respond to these criticisms.",
    " Title: House Democrats Vow to Investigate Allegations of Trump-Cohen Collusion in Moscow Project\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Two House Democratic committee chairmen have vowed to investigate allegations that President Donald Trump personally directed his former attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about a potential real-estate development in Moscow.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, tweeted, \"We know that the President has engaged in a long pattern of obstruction. Directing a subordinate to lie to Congress is a federal crime. The @ HouseJudiciary Committee\u2019s job is to get to the bottom of it, and we will do that work.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, also vowed to \"do what\u2019s necessary to find out if it\u2019s true.\" He tweeted, \"The allegation that the President of the United States may have suborned perjury before our committee in an effort to curtail the investigation and cover up his business dealings with Russia is among the most serious to date.\"\n\nThe report, published by BuzzFeed News, claims Trump directed Cohen to mislead Congress about when negotiations to launch a condo project in Russia's capital ended, as well as the extent of Trump's involvement in the deal. The project ultimately fell apart.\n\nTrump did not comment directly on the claim, but retweeted a Fox News story that mentioned Cohen has been convicted of perjury and fraud, and is reportedly under investigation over other matters.\n\n\"Lying to reduce his jail time!\" Trump tweeted. \"Watch father-in-law!\"\n\nTrump attorney Rudy Giuliani called Cohen \"a convicted criminal and a liar,\" according to a statement. \"Any suggestion \u2013 from any source \u2013 that the President counseled Michael Cohen to lie is categorically false.\"\n\nBuzzFeed, which cited two unnamed law enforcement officials for its report, further claimed that the office of special counsel Robert Mueller investigating Trump's Russia ties has additional evidence about the alleged deception backed up by \"interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents.\"\n\nCohen previously testified he falsely told Congress that Trump\u2019s attempt to get the Moscow project off the ground concluded in January 2016 when he actually continued to pursue the project through June 2016. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress on this matter.\n\nHe is now cooperating with Mueller's probe and agreed to appear before the House Oversight Committee on Feb. 7 before he begins a three-year prison term in March for crimes that include arranging for payments during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to silence women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump.\n\nBuzzFeed's story, if true, is significant because Trump consistently denied on the campaign trail having had any financial links to Russia. In fact, since 2016, Trump has publicly repeated more than two dozen times that he has \"nothing to do with Russia.\"\n\n\"There was no talking to Russia. There was no phone calls. I didn\u2019t make phone calls to Russia. I didn\u2019t receive phone calls. I didn\u2019t have meetings. I didn\u2019t have texts. I didn\u2019t have anything,\" he said aboard Air Force One in September.\n\nThe White House and the special counsel's office at the Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDemocratic leaders reacted with anger and concern but also caution, pledging to investigate and establish the accuracy of the BuzzFeed report.\n\nAt least one lawmaker called for Trump's impeachment if the report's accuracy is proved.\n\n\"If the @Buzzfeed story is true, President Trump must resign or be impeached,\" said Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), a member of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nLanny Davis, Cohen\u2019s legal and communications adviser, issued the following statement after the BuzzFeed report.\n\n\"Out of respect for Mr. Mueller\u2019s and the Office of Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, Mr. Cohen declined to respond to the questions asked by the reporters and so do I,\" Davis told the media outlet.\n\nGiuliani shot down the report Thursday night, saying in a statement, according to a tweet from Washington Post reporter Philip Rucker: \"If you believe Cohen, I can get you a great deal on the Brooklyn Bridge.\"",

The announcement, made in an op-ed published in his Wisconsin hometown's Walworth County Gazette Xtra, marks a shift in Ryan's stance, who had resisted endorsing Trump for months.\n\nRyan's statement, delivered without the theatrics typically associated with Trump's campaign, emphasized the importance of choosing a vision for America, rather than just two individuals. He wrote, \"House Republicans are helping shape that Republican vision by offering a bold policy agenda, by offering a better way ahead.\"\n\nRyan's endorsement comes after months of evading questions about Trump from journalists, with the speaker often attempting to steer the conversation towards other topics, such as the opioid crisis. In an interview with the Associated Press, Ryan expressed hope that the constant clarification is now over.\n\nRyan's criticisms of Trump's policy ideas and tone have been well-documented. He told the AP, \"I've felt very motivated to speak out about some of the things he had said, like the Muslim ban.\" However, he added, \"My hope is that I won't have to speak out in the future on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\nTrump, in response, told The New York Times he was \"pleased\" with Ryan's endorsement and described their relationship as good. He also acknowledged that Ryan's endorsement was delayed due to the expectation that Trump's situation would go to the convention.\n\nRyan's op-ed, while acknowledging his concerns and the need for time, primarily focused on a hypothetical Republican president's policy agenda, rather than Trump specifically. This suggests that Trump may not entirely fit the description of the Republican vision that Ryan has been advocating.\n\nIn a statement to the AP, Ryan said, \"My hope is that I won't have to speak out in the future on a case-by-case basis.\" This declaration signifies a move towards party unity and a desire for the Republican Party to move forward with a unified front.",
    " Title: Pentagon Policy Chief John Rood Resigns Amid Impeachment Inquiry Fallout\n\nArticle:\n\nJohn Rood, the undersecretary of defense for policy, will step down from his position at the end of this month, the Pentagon announced on Wednesday, confirming earlier reporting. Rood, who joined the administration in 2018, was involved in approving $250 million in security assistance for Ukraine, aid that was temporarily withheld by the White House last summer.\n\nAdministration officials told Bloomberg that senior national-security officials had lost confidence in Rood's ability to execute President Donald Trump's agenda. Sources told Foreign Policy that he was asked to resign after Trump lost confidence in him following a string of departures of senior Pentagon policymakers.\n\nIn a tweet on Wednesday morning following reports of Rood's resignation, the president wished Rood well and thanked him for his service. Rood's resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by NBC, reveals that Trump requested his resignation.\n\nSecretary of Defense Mark Esper thanked Rood in a separate statement. Speaking to reporters at the Pentagon on Wednesday, Jonathan Hoffman, a Defense Department spokesman, declined to say whether Rood's resignation came at the direction of the White House but did say that the \"president can make a decision to go in a different direction.\"\n\nWhile the specific reason for Rood's resignation is still unclear, multiple reports have noted his connection to the security aid to Ukraine that became the focus of impeachment proceedings. In his role at the Pentagon, which involved building partnerships and encouraging defense cooperation with US allies and partners, Rood certified to Congress that Ukraine was eligible to receive $250 million in security assistance. That aid was temporarily withheld at the White House's direction last summer.\n\nIn May, before the president decided to withhold the aid, Rood said in a letter to lawmakers that he \"certified that the Government of Ukraine has taken substantial actions to make defense institutional reforms for the purposes of decreasing corruption, increasing accountability, and sustaining improvements of combat capability enabled by U.S. assistance.\" The letter, which was leaked in September, undermined the administration's argument.\n\nRood expressed concern about withholding aid to Ukraine in an email to Esper following Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that set in motion Trump's impeachment. In the email, recently reviewed by CNN, Rood wrote that \"placing a hold on security assistance at this time would jeopardize this unique window of opportunity and undermine our defense priorities with a key partner in the strategic competition with Russia.\" Ukrainian forces are fighting Russian-backed separatists in the country's eastern region.\n\nTrump was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress and acquitted by the Senate earlier this month. Since his impeachment, Trump has taken steps to remove some officials from their posts. The specific reason for Rood's resignation remains unclear, and the White House has not yet commented on the matter.",
    " Title: Marco Rubio's Surprising Third-Place Finish in Iowa and His Strong Showing in New Hampshire\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Iowa caucuses, the momentum for Florida Senator Marco Rubio was palpable in New Hampshire. On the night following the caucuses, Rubio stood before more than 700 enthusiastic supporters at Exeter's town hall, a crowd that nearly filled the venue to capacity.\n\nRubio delivered his familiar stump speech, a speech he has been consistently presenting for months. However, on this night, the audience responded with raucous applause to every word. They cheered as he recounted his family's immigrant, working-class roots, emphasizing that his parents, who were a bartender and a maid, would drive him through the affluent Las Vegas suburbs and tell him, \"If you want to be financially successful and live in a house like that, you live in the one country in the world where it does not matter that your dad is a bartender and your mother's a maid. You can do that, too.\"\n\nRubio is positioning himself as a candidate uniquely qualified to unite Republican voters and reach out to lower-income and minority communities that have historically delivered Democratic votes. \"If I'm our nominee, we will win, and the Democrats know this,\" Rubio told another packed venue in Laconia on Wednesday. \"They do not want to run against me. There is a reason why the Democrats, and in particular Hillary Clinton, attack me five times for every time they want to attack someone else. They know that if I'm our nominee, they lose.\"\n\nRepublicans are not particularly fond of comparisons to Barack Obama these days, but there is a resemblance between Obama's and Rubio's candidacies. Both centered their pitch around a powerful personal narrative that taps into the American dream and the appeal of a telegenic first-term lawmaker and his young family.\n\nHowever, this similarity has also become a point of criticism for other Republicans, who argue that Rubio is too inexperienced. These critiques have been particularly pointed from the three governors Rubio is trying to outmaneuver in the \"establishment lane\" \u2013 John Kasich, Jeb Bush, and Chris Christie.\n\nBush, in the final push of his New Hampshire campaign, drew a not-so-subtle parallel between Obama and Rubio, his one-time ally. Bush referred to Rubio and Texas Senator Ted Cruz as \"two people that are back-benchers, that have never done anything of consequence in their lives. They're gifted beyond belief. They can give a great speech. But I think it's time for us to recognize that maybe what we need is someone who can lead.\"\n\nChristie has begun referring to Rubio as \"the boy in the bubble,\" mocking both Rubio's youth and his propensity to deliver the same speech at event after event.\n\nPerhaps mindful of Christie's critique, Rubio's campaign made a point to hold several brief press availabilities during Wednesday's town hall swing.\n\nThe four-way tussle among Rubio, Kasich, Christie, and Bush is intense because the stakes are high. Republican power-brokers, often referred to as the \"establishment,\" have made it clear they are worried about either a Donald Trump or a Ted Cruz nomination.\n\nAll four campaigns are banking on elected officials and high-powered donors to rally around whichever campaign emerges on top in New Hampshire. A repeat strong showing from Rubio would all but anoint him as that establishment bet.\n\nRubio, aware of the anti-Washington and anti-establishment sentiment this year, is quick to point out the irony. \"I can tell you that when it comes to the establishment, which is, people who have been involved in politics for a long time, they did not want me to run for president,\" he told reporters. \"And they did not want me to run for Senate five years ago.\"\n\nHowever, in a Trump- and Cruz-dominated primary, party power-brokers are desperate for someone to rally around.

Unlike conventional loans, ISAs involve investors providing funds to the college, which then offers a partially or fully free education to students. Upon graduation, students pay the college a percentage of their future income for a specified period.\n\nBeth Akers, co-author of the book \"Game of Loans,\" explains, \"It's a way for the school to say to students, 'You're only going to pay us if we help you succeed.'\"\n\nAndrew Hoyler, a professional pilot and ISA recipient from Purdue University, is one such student. He will pay Purdue 8% of his income for 104 months. Hoyler shared in a recent interview, \"After that 104-month term ends, if I still owe money, it's forgiven, forgotten, I don't owe another penny.\" He added, \"Now, if I find myself in a six-figure job tomorrow, there's a chance that I'll pay back far more than I took out.\"\n\nThe terms for ISAs vary based on the student's major. For a $10,000 ISA, English majors must pay 4.58% of their income for 116 months, while math majors, who are more likely to secure higher-paying jobs, pay just 3.96% for 96 months.\n\nAkers notes, \"It conveys information to the student about how lucrative a different major's going to be.\" She continues, \"Some think that's unfair, but really that's just a way (investors) can recapture the money that they've put up.\"\n\nHoyler agrees, stating, \"ISA recipients learn not only what a career may pay, but how stable it may be, what the future is like.\"\n\nAkers proposes, \"We should invest in students the same way that we invest in startups. Share equity.\" The key difference is that the college acts as the middleman, selecting the students, while investors do not have a direct relationship with the students.\n\nPurdue ISA recipient Paul Larora shared, \"We don't know who the investor is, but I'd love to give him a hug or buy him a beer!\"\n\nAkers explains, \"The institutions are saying, 'If I'm operating as the middleman, I can make sure that no one's taking advantage of my students.'\"\n\nDespite the potential benefits of ISAs, some politicians advocate for government intervention in student loans. In 2010, President Barack Obama signed a student debt relief bill, claiming it would \"cut out private middlemen,\" meaning banks. However, costs to taxpayers increased rather than decreased.\n\nSome politicians continue to blame banks for student loan debt, as evidenced by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who, during a hearing, asked JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, \"What are you guys doing to help us with this student loan debt?\" Dimon responded, \"We stopped doing all student lending,\" pointing out that \"the government took over student lending in 2010.\"\n\nRather than forcing banks out of the loan business, Akers argues, we should remove the government from it. Banks are in the business of assessing loan risk, and if private lenders made loans, they'd care about being paid back. They'd tell students which majors might lead to higher-paying careers and warn them that studying certain subjects may make it tough to get out of debt.\n\nThe market would make better judgments and prevent students from starting their adult lives under a burden they may never escape. The Brookings Institution found that 28% of students do not even know they have a loan.\n\nCritics of ISAs label them as \"predatory\" because investors hope for profit. They argue that ISAs make students \"indentured servants.\" However, as Larora points out, \"If you don't have a job, you're not paying anything! Where's the servitude in that?\"\n\nAkers is the author of \"No They Can't! Why Government Fails -- But Individuals Succeed.\"",
    " Title: Dual Responses: Rand Paul and Marco Rubio Deliver Tea Party and Official GOP Responses to State of the Union Address\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a unique turn of events, the Republican Party is facing a split response to President Obama's State of the Union address, with two high-profile senators delivering separate speeches: Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. While Rubio is delivering the GOP's official response, Paul is delivering a response sponsored by the Tea Party Express.\n\nJenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the national Tea Party Patriots, stated that both Paul and Rubio are elected officials who are fighting for tea party values of fiscal responsibility and constitutionally limited government. However, the Republican Party leadership's choice of Rubio, a son of Cuban immigrants, to deliver the official response has marked him as the establishment's chosen spokesman, potentially acceptable as the 2016 presidential nominee if he decides to run.\n\nRubio's spokesman, Alex Conant, said having high-profile responses is a good thing for the GOP. \"We're glad Sen. Paul is doing his speech tonight. As far as we're concerned, the more Republicans that are responding to the president, the better,\" Conant said.\n\nPaul, who unofficially launched his 2016 nomination bid with a visit to Israel last month, elected to give what he calls his own \"tea party\" response to the president. He doesn't explicitly deny that his move is an intentional clash with Rubio. Paul views his speech as an \"extra response\" rather than a competitive one.\n\nHowever, Paul doesn't explicitly say his speech isn't intended to draw contrasts with Rubio on a variety of hot issues, from immigration to foreign aid. Paul, in a bid to further bond himself to the anti-spending movement, emphasized that none of the things he ran on as part of the tea party have been fixed, and the debt crisis is still a looming concern.\n\nRubio's popularity within the Republican Party, his boyish good looks, and his ability to captivate audiences, along with his Republican Hispanic identity, have earned him the title of the new face of the GOP by some in the press and in official GOP circles. However, Paul has rejected this title, stating that no one gets to choose who is the face of the party.\n\nTea Party Patriots' co-founder Marc Meckler, now president of Citizens for Self-governance, argued that it's hard to legitimately call Rubio 'establishment' when he beat down the establishment to take out Charlie Christ. Rubio's voting record in the Senate and his stands generally comport with tea party values, Meckler added.\n\nHowever, Meckler also recounted his observations of a growing rift between Rubio and the tea party, with some tea party groups in Florida expressing skepticism and a sense of distance from Rubio due to his perceived inaccessibility. This rift, if true, could potentially impact Rubio's standing within the tea party movement and, by extension, his political aspirations.",
    " Title: Ukraine-Russia Tensions Escalate as Ceasefire Violations Continue and Humanitarian Aid Delivered\n\nArticle:\n\nUkraine and Russia faced a fresh round of conflict on Saturday, as Ukrainian forces repelled pro-Russian rebels at Donetsk airport and Moscow sent a second convoy of aid into the country, highlighting the fragility of the ceasefire agreement between the two nations.\n\nThe latest fighting in eastern Ukraine erupted about a week after the ceasefire agreement was reached, with a volley of rockets striking residential buildings near the airport, although no casualties were reported. Ukrainian military leaders successfully fended off the separatist attack at the airport.\n\nTensions escalated further as Russia sent a second convoy of trucks into Ukraine without its consent, delivering humanitarian aid to the eastern Ukrainian city of Lugansk. The convoy, consisting of about 245 trucks, was reported to be carrying nearly 2,000 tons of supplies, including cereals, sugar, medicines, and warm clothes.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, who annexed most of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March, has consistently denied that Russian troops have entered eastern Ukraine. However, he defends the Russian-speaking minority's right to defend themselves.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, in a speech at a conference of Ukrainian and European officials in Kiev, asserted that despite the truce, his country remains in a state of war, with Russia being the key aggressor.\n\nThe delivery of the second convoy of humanitarian aid from Russia, following the first one in August, marks a shift in the mood in the Kiev government. Ukrainian officials' silence on the second convoy indicates a willingness to accept aid, despite their previous objections. However, Ukrainian officials have expressed concerns about the lack of International Red Cross oversight during the aid deliveries.\n\nIn his speech, Yatsenyuk also highlighted the impact of the ongoing conflict on government-proposed reforms, stating that if the war is stopped and Russia is contained, Ukraine will have the opportunity to attract international investors.\n\nThe ongoing conflict and ceasefire violations have hindered the implementation of reforms aimed at benefiting the entire country, according to Yatsenyuk. The situation underscores the complex and volatile nature of the relationship between Ukraine and Russia, and the challenges both countries face in finding a lasting solution to the ongoing conflict.",
    " Title: CBS News Reporter Faces Internal Criticism for Aggressive Pursuit of Benghazi Story\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, CBS News correspondent Sharyl Attkisson, known for her relentless pursuit of the Fast & Furious scandal, is now facing criticism from her own network. The reason? Her aggressive coverage of the Benghazi story.\n\nAccording to a report by Politico, Attkisson's investigative work on Benghazi has been met with frustration from CBS News executives, who view her as wading dangerously close to advocacy on the issue. Attkisson has reportedly faced difficulties getting her stories aired, leading to feelings of marginalization and underutilization.\n\nThis internal conflict is a significant context for the current situation, as Attkisson is reportedly in talks to leave CBS ahead of her contract, as POLITICO reported in April. The report also mentions \"internal conflicts,\" though it seems to dismiss them. However, these conflicts are indeed real, with Attkisson still considering an exit, according to sources.\n\nThe situation raises questions about the media's role in investigative journalism and the pursuit of truth, particularly in high-profile, politically charged stories like Benghazi. Some, like Ed Morrissey and Allahpundit, argue that Attkisson's work is being marginalized because it challenges the mainstream narrative and risks lending credence to Republican accusations.\n\nIn the midst of today's House Oversight Committee hearing, Attkisson's Twitter feed went silent, leading to speculation about her absence. Some believe this silence is a result of the network's disapproval of her coverage.\n\nThe media's handling of the Benghazi story has been a topic of discussion, with some suggesting that the story is being dismissed as a right-wing obsession or a political food fight. The Washington Post and Kasie Hunt, a NBC News correspondent, have tweeted about the hearing, with the former implying that only out-of-touch old white guys and conservative-leaning individuals care about the story, and the latter questioning the relevance of the story in light of Hillary Clinton's potential 2016 presidential bid.\n\nThe media's role in shaping public perception and the challenges faced by journalists like Attkisson in pursuing the truth are issues that warrant further discussion. The silence from Attkisson today, and the network's apparent disapproval of her work, are reminders of the challenges faced by journalists in the pursuit of truth and the importance of a free and independent press.",
    " Title: Controversial Gun Registration Renewal Law in Washington D.C. Sparks Legal Challenge and Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the nation's capital, a contentious gun control measure is stirring debate and legal action. The District of Columbia Police Department has proposed a new law that requires all legal firearm owners to personally renew their registration certificates at police headquarters. This renewal process, which starts on January 1, 2022, will involve fingerprinting, photographing, providing proof of address, paying a fee, and confirming the individual's eligibility to possess the firearm.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Department filed proposed rules last week, and citizens have until December 15 to comment on the regulations. George Lyon, a plaintiff in the original Heller case, expressed his concerns, stating, \"I don't see that they need a re-registration system at all. But if they do, this whole thing ought really to be done online, automated, and without adding more fees.\"\n\nThe renewal process was initially intended to be done online and by mail, starting in 2012, but the police did not retain any of the fingerprints or photos taken until March 2013. City Council Chairman Phil Mendelson defended the renewals, stating, \"The reason for renewals is to make sure people don't become disqualified to own a firearm.\"\n\nHowever, critics argue that the police could easily run gun owners' names and social security numbers through the FBI's background-check system at any point. Stephen P. Halbrook, the lead attorney for Heller II, described the registration-renewal requirement as \"onerous and completely unnecessary and is a trap for the unwary.\" He added, \"Fail to re-register for whatever reason, and you're committing a crime \u2014 possession of an unregistered firearm. This is plain harassment for the exercise of a constitutional right.\"\n\nThe registration-renewal requirement is already being challenged in court through Heller v. District of Columbia, commonly known as \"Heller II.\" The case takes on the entire registration law that was enacted in 2009 after the Supreme Court overturned the District's 30-year-old handgun ban in the original Heller decision.\n\nCritics argue that the law is a violation of the Founding Fathers' intent that the Second Amendment would prevent government tyranny. They contend that once the government knows about every single gun owned by each citizen, an armed populace is no longer a deterrent.\n\nEmily Miller, senior editor of opinion for The \u2588\u2588\u2588 and author of \"Emily Gets Her Gun\" (Regnery, 2013), has also expressed her opposition to the law. The estimated 30,000 firearms registered to private citizens in D.C. is remarkably low for a city of 600,000, as most law-abiding people choose not to go through the 11 steps necessary to register. Furthermore, criminals are not showing up at police headquarters to offer up their fingerprints or take a written test before buying guns.\n\nThe renewal process is expected to be a complex and time-consuming endeavor, potentially causing delays and inconvenience for law-abiding gun owners. The police propose scheduling everyone in three-month windows based on the individual's birthday, with eight windows starting on January 1 and going through 2015. They plan to set up an online system to make an appointment, but the acceptance of credit cards for the $13-per-gun fee has not been finalized.\n\nThe renewal process is a significant change from the original Heller decision, which overturned the District's 30-year-old handgun ban. The renewal requirement has sparked controversy and legal challenges, with both sides filing motions for summary judgment this month and next. The outcome of the case will likely have significant implications for gun rights in Washington D.C. and potentially beyond.",
    " Title: Roy Moore Threatens Legal Action Against Washington Post Over Sexual Misconduct Allegations\n\nThe Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has announced his intention to sue The Washington Post over a report alleging sexual misconduct with teenagers, including a 14-year-old, when he was in his 30s.\n\nDuring a campaign speech in Huntsville, Alabama, on Sunday night, Moore stated, \"The Washington Post published another attack on my character and reputation because they are desperate to stop my political campaign. These attacks said I was with a minor child and are false and untrue \u2014 for which they will be sued.\"\n\nHistorically, public figures have threatened legal action against news organizations but have not followed through. In 2017, President Donald Trump threatened to sue The New York Times after it published accounts of two women who claimed Trump touched them inappropriately. Trump's lawyers never filed a lawsuit. Similarly, disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein initially threatened to sue the Times after it first reported allegations of sexual misconduct against him, but that suit never materialized.\n\nThe Washington Post report, published on Thursday, was based on interviews with more than 30 people. In addition to the allegations that Moore had sexual contact with the then 14-year-old when he was aged 32, three other women also told The Post that Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18.\n\nThe woman who was 14 years old at the time claimed Moore took her to his house, undressed down to his underwear, and undressed her down to her bra and underwear and touched her and moved her hand to touch his underwear, which could have been sexual offenses due to her age, but the statutes of limitations in effect during that time have passed.\n\nNone of the other three women told The Post that Moore sexually harassed, or assaulted them, or forced them into a relationship. Alabama's legal age of consent is 16.\n\nMoore has denied the allegations since they were published. He called the claims \"completely false\" on Friday when appearing on Sean Hannity's syndicated radio show. Speaking at a Veterans Day event at the Mid-Alabama Republican Club in Birmingham on Saturday, Moore called the allegations \"fake news\" and \"yet another attack on my character and reputation in a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign for the United States Senate.\"\n\nHe added that the alleged incidents happened nearly 40 years ago and called them \"very hurtful to me personally \u2014 I have the highest regard for the protection of young children.\" Moore also stated that he has never provided alcohol to a minor and has \"not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone.\"\n\nMoore added that there were ongoing \"investigations\" looking into the motivations behind the Post article, and promised \"revelations\" about the story to come in the next few days, though he did not provide further specifics.\n\nA number of Republicans have withdrawn their endorsements of Moore following the Washington Post article, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which severed a joint fundraising agreement that benefits Moore's campaign. This story has been updated to reflect The Post's decision to not comment.",
    " Title: NBC News Alters Approach to Climate Change Discussion on \"Meet the Press\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift, NBC News has announced that it will no longer treat climate change as a two-sided issue, with host Chuck Todd of \"Meet the Press\" stating during Sunday's episode that the show will no longer provide a platform for climate change deniers. Todd's decision was met with both praise and criticism, as the debate over climate change continues to be a contentious topic.\n\nDuring the hour-long panel discussion, Todd stated, \"We're not going to debate climate change, the existence of it. The earth is getting hotter, and human activity is a major cause. Period.\" He further added, \"We're not going to give time to climate deniers. The science is settled even if political opinion is not.\"\n\nSkeptics of the most alarmist climate change scenarios argue that the term \"denier\" is misleading, as it implies parallels to those who deny historical events such as the Holocaust or the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. They contend that while it is accepted that burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, there is a wide range of scientific opinion on matters such as the extent to which human activities affect gas levels, the likelihood of various consequences, the impact of other factors on the climate, and the quality and extent of past historical data on climate.\n\nTodd's panel on Sunday included non-scientists offering their opinions, such as California Governor Jerry Brown, Representative Carlos Curbelo, and potential Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg. Curbelo commented, \"We need to stop covering the debate and start covering the story so that people see that this is real, and so that politicians take a more pragmatic approach and find solutions that are actually achievable.\"\n\nPoliticians such as Senator Bernie Sanders praised the one-sided discussion, with Sanders taking to Twitter to congratulate Chuck Todd and \"Meet the Press\" for holding a serious discussion about climate change. Sanders asked, \"Will this be a breakthrough moment for mainstream TV?\"\n\nThe distinction between \"weather\" and \"climate\" was emphasized by climatologists, with Todd himself making this distinction in a previous conversation with a conservative skeptic. Scientists are typically reluctant to attribute specific weather events to man-made climate change. The debate over climate change continues to be a topic of discussion and research among scientists and policymakers worldwide.",

LaPierre's message emphasized that these measures are not about protecting children or reducing crime, but rather about restricting gun rights.\n\nLaPierre alleged that last week's White House meeting, billed as an \"open discussion\" about school safety, was a misrepresentation. He claimed that the administration did not listen to gun owners' concerns or consider practical solutions for school safety. Instead, LaPierre accused the Obama administration, Vice President Joe Biden, and their gun control allies in Congress of attempting to blame, vilify, bully, and restrict gun owners' Second Amendment rights.\n\nThe NRA executive vice president warned that the administration is pushing forward with legislation that could ban certain guns, register ammunition purchases, and require gun owners to register their firearms with the government. LaPierre urged NRA members to renew or upgrade their membership as soon as possible, emphasizing the importance of their support in the upcoming fight for gun rights.\n\nLaPierre also addressed the media's portrayal of gun owners, stating that he and other NRA members have been slandered and threatened. He vowed to challenge these attacks and defend the right to self-defense and the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. LaPierre emphasized the strength of the NRA organization comes from its members and their commitment to the membership. He called for support from gun owners today.",
    " Title: Clinton and Trump Address Gun Control and Criminal Justice Reform in Campaign Rally\n\nIn a recent campaign event, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton addressed gun control and criminal justice reform, two key issues that have been central to her primary campaign. Clinton's rival, Republican nominee Donald Trump, also touched upon the former Secretary of State's policies and their potential impact on women's safety.\n\nDuring a rally on Friday, Mr. Trump criticized Mrs. Clinton's policies, stating that they could put women in particular danger. He suggested that in rough or dangerous communities, women might not be able to defend themselves if stricter gun control measures were implemented.\n\nMrs. Clinton, on the other hand, reaffirmed her commitment to both gun control and the overhaul of the criminal justice system during a rally on Saturday. She has been vocal about these issues, often campaigning alongside the mothers of individuals who have lost their lives due to police encounters or gun violence.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has utilized these stories in evocative television ads, featuring the mothers of Eric Garner, Jordan Davis, Sandra Bland, and others, as well as Erica Smegielski, the daughter of the school principal killed in the Sandy Hook massacre in Connecticut.\n\nHowever, as the focus shifts from the primary to the general election, gun control seems to have become less of a driving force in Clinton's campaign. A New York Times/CBS News poll in January found that 57 percent of respondents wanted stricter laws governing gun sales, and 88 percent favored background checks for all purchases.\n\nIn her Saturday speech, Clinton vowed to end the \"school to prison pipeline\" that disproportionately affects black men. She emphasized, \"Something is wrong when so many Americans have reason to believe that our country doesn't consider their children as precious and worthy of protection as other children because of the color of their skins.\"\n\nClinton also restated her promise to \"end the era of mass incarceration\" and to \"rebuild the bonds of trust between law enforcement and communities.\" These issues could resonate with voters in California, particularly in cities like Los Angeles and Oakland, ahead of the state's June 7 primary.\n\nBoth candidates are now vying for the support of white voters in the Rust Belt, and their stances on gun control and criminal justice reform could play a significant role in the upcoming election.",
    " Title: The Rise of a Religious Left: A New Era in American Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the emergence of a religious left, spearheaded by candidates like Pete Buttigieg, is gaining traction among progressive voters. This shift, as some see it, is a response to the conservative Christian right's influence in American politics.\n\nFor many voters who gathered to celebrate a record 'rainbow wave' of LGBT political candidates, the sight of a same-sex couple running for president as a team was a powerful and unprecedented moment. This is particularly significant for individuals like Buttigieg, who have experienced discrimination based on their sexual orientation.\n\nButtigieg's candidacy is not just about his policy proposals; it is also about his identity and the experiences that come with it. As a gay man, he represents a segment of the population that has historically been marginalized and understands the struggles of the powerless and the alienated.\n\nThe candidate's approach to faith and politics is resonating with a growing number of Americans who believe in a more inclusive Christianity. This Christian left, as some are calling it, is challenging the traditionalist Christian right's stranglehold on religious values in politics.\n\nProgressive religious leaders are coalescing in support of issues such as immigrant rights, universal health care, LGBTQ rights, and racial justice. Buttigieg, along with candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, is a symbol of this rising movement.\n\nCritics argue that the focus on sexuality has resulted in a disproportionate fixation on homosexuality in religious and political discourse. However, proponents of the religious left argue that a fair reading of the Gospels reveals a far greater emphasis on issues such as generosity towards the poor, welcoming to the stranger, and treating people with dignity.\n\nThe debate surrounding Buttigieg's faith and its role in his political platform is a complex one. While some see it as a valuable perspective, others view it as a potential distraction from the core issues at hand. As the primary season unfolds, the role of faith in American politics and its impact on the electorate will continue to be a topic of discussion.\n\nIn the midst of this debate, the investigation into President Trump's dealings with Ukraine remains a significant issue. While the evidence of a quid pro quo may be circumstantial, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation. Whether this evidence is enough to lead to impeachment and removal remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Guam Residents Carry On Amid North Korea Tensions: Business as Usual on the Pacific Island\n\nArticle:\n\nGUAM \u2014 Despite the escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea, life on the Pacific island appears to be carrying on as usual. On Saturday, the customer rush was on at Guam's Home Depot, with residents stocking up on essentials such as batteries, flashlights, and bottled water. However, the purchases were not as a result of the recent geopolitical developments, but rather for everyday use.\n\nIn a statement that contrasts with the international spotlight on Guam, Guam Governor Eddie Calvo received assurances from President Trump and White House Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly on Saturday morning. Calvo, in a subsequent video message, expressed comfort in knowing that the U.S. administration is watching out for the island.\n\nAmid the concerns on social media, Guam residents remained calm, with some engaging in activities such as fishing, football practice, and visiting beaches and malls. The island's leaders may have been alarmed, but the residents themselves seemed unfazed.\n\nAndrew Guilliot, the loss prevention manager at Home Depot, noted that while there was a slight increase in the purchase of bottled water, batteries, and portable fans, the demand was not extraordinary. He added that the typical items one would see during typhoon preparation, such as water, generators, batteries, tarps, and plastic, were not seeing any significant spikes in sales.\n\nIn interviews, some residents expressed concerns about the situation, but most seemed to view it as just another speed bump in their lives. David Lessard, a resident of Ordot, was considering stocking up on canned goods and bottled water, but he viewed the threats as North Korea trying to save face.\n\nRoger Hostetler, a retired Navy civil service worker, was concerned about the unstable leaders of North Korea and the United States, but he had faith in the THAAD anti-missile system and the combined Japan-U.S. military forces. He, however, expressed hope that China and Russia would not get involved on the other side.\n\nFor many Guam residents, the explosive threats are just more of the same. Vicente Bautista, a resident of Dededo, recalled similar threats in 1977 when he was an Army infantryman stationed near the Demilitarized Zone. He believes that North Korea wants to show off, but does not have the technology to back up the threats.\n\nMike Soderquist, a resident of Dededo who lived in South Korea for about four years, viewed the rhetoric as typical North Korea bluster. He was out shopping on Saturday, going about his regular activities.\n\nIn a simple statement issued on Friday, the Guam Chamber of Commerce declared, \"It is business as usual on Guam.\" For now, it seems, life on the Pacific island is carrying on as usual, despite the looming threats from North Korea.",
    " Title: Rand Paul's Healthcare Stance: Principle or Political Expediency?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political arena, it is often challenging to discern whether a politician's actions are driven by principles or political expediency. This conundrum is particularly relevant when discussing Senator Rand Paul, a prominent figure in the Republican Party who has been vocal about his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nPaul, who has been dubbed the GOP's would-be Man for All Seasons, has consistently voted against any compromise that does not call for full repeal of Obamacare. In response to the recent health-care reform debacle, Paul expressed his disappointment, stating, \"Look, this is what we ran on for four elections. Republicans ran four times and won every time on repeal Obamacare, and now they're going to vote to keep it. Disappointing.\"\n\nWhile many of Paul's arguments and complaints are persuasive on their merits, there have been instances that raise questions about the motivations behind his stance. For example, it is worth noting that more than one in five Kentuckians, Paul's home state, are on Medicaid. This coincidence, coupled with Paul's history of adhering to strict libertarian principles, has led some to question whether his opposition to the bill is driven by principles or political expediency.\n\nPaul's political career was shaped by his father, Ron Paul, a longtime Texas congressman and presidential candidate. Known as \"Dr. No\" in the House, Ron Paul was notorious for voting against most bills on the grounds that they were not constitutional or libertarian enough. Similarly, Rand Paul has opposed various trade deals and health-care reforms, not on protectionist grounds but in service to his higher libertarian conscience.\n\nHowever, Paul's actions during the health-care reform process have been inconsistent. Every time the proceedings moved in his direction, he seemed to move one step back. For instance, when Senator Ted Cruz offered an amendment to open up the market for more flexible and affordable plans, Paul expressed opposition, citing concerns about the Obamacare mandates. Yet, a provision for exempting associations from Obamacare mandates was already in the bill.\n\nPaul has also been criticized for his approach to earmarks during his father's political career. Ron Paul was known for cramming pork for his district into must-pass spending bills like an overstuffed burrito, only to vote against them in the name of purity.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is difficult to definitively determine whether Rand Paul's actions are driven by principles or political expediency, his inconsistencies during the health-care reform process have raised questions about his motivations. As the health-care debate continues, it will be interesting to see how Paul's stance evolves and whether he will remain a consistent \"no\" vote on any compromise that does not call for full repeal of Obamacare.",
    " Title: U.S. Defense Secretary Defends Border Wall Funding Diversion Amidst Bipartisan Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nMUNICH, Germany (AP) \u2014 U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper defended his decision to divert billions of dollars in funding for Navy and Air Force aircraft and other military programs to help pay for President Donald Trump's promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border during a press conference on the sidelines of an international security conference in Munich on Friday.\n\nEsper faced questions about the diversion of funds, which has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, including Rep. Mac Thornberry, a Republican from Texas, who called the move contrary to the constitutional authority of Congress.\n\n\"Border security is national security,\" Esper said. \"And national security is our mission.\"\n\nHe added, \"The action we took is legal under the law, and so it should be no surprise, and I'll just leave it at that for now.\"\n\nThe Pentagon announced on Thursday that Esper approved shifting $3.8 billion in funds that Congress had previously authorized for F-35 fighter aircraft and other military programs. The money is being diverted to help the Department of Homeland Security build portions of the border wall. The Pentagon indicated that more such actions could be coming to provide additional funding for Trump's signature campaign promise.\n\nThe action drew sharp rebukes from Democrats as well as Republicans. Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement, \"Today's reprogramming request confirms once again that the President is obsessed with fulfilling a campaign promise at the expense of our national security.\"\n\nLast year, despite congressional opposition, Trump faced no consequences when making similar transfers by cancelling or postponing dozens of military construction projects to free up $3.6 billion.\n\nIn reaction to Thursday's Pentagon announcement, Thornberry, the top Republican on the committee and a supporter of wall construction, said that while the administration's constitutional role is to recommend how tax dollars are spent, final choices are made by Congress.\n\n\"Once those choices have been made, the Department of Defense can not change them in pursuit of their own priorities without the approval of Congress,\" he said. \"Attempts to do so undermine the principle of civilian control of the military and are in violation of the separation of powers within the Constitution.

This is particularly evident in the current political climate, with the Trump presidency and the Democratic Party's recent unveiling of their \"Better Deal\" agenda.\n\nThe Trump presidency, with its unconventional approach and departure from traditional Republican policies, has been hailed by some as a disruption that shattered the calcified agenda of the GOP. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, has been grappling with a need for disruption of its own, as the New Deal paradigm has largely defined the party for the better part of a century.\n\nThe Democrats' search for a policy vision often leads them back to the New Deal. Harry Truman's Fair Deal and LBJ's Great Society were both continuations of the New Deal. After the 9/11 attacks, New York senator Charles Schumer wrote in the Washington Post that the attacks proved that \"the era of a shrinking federal government has come to a close.\" This new challenge necessitated a \"new New Deal.\"\n\nEven the New Deal's biggest competitor, John F. Kennedy nostalgia, has always been about aesthetics and atmospherics. Kennedy's own policy agenda never broke with the New Deal paradigm. Barack Obama, who had a Kennedy-esque cult of personality, was nonetheless expected by liberals to be a new FDR. When Obama rolled out his sweeping policy vision, a \"New Foundation,\" it was a New Deal rehash.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, 78, is a child of the New Deal. Her father, Thomas D'Alesandro Jr., a passionate New Dealer in Congress, named one of his sons Franklin D. Roosevelt D'Alesandro. The New Deal remains Pelosi's North Star, which may be why she accidentally referred to their new program as \"the New Deal.\"\n\nNow, the Democrats have their \"Better Deal\" agenda, yet another New Deal retread. The Democrats even admit it. Pelosi insisted that the Better Deal is not \"a course correction.\" It is \"a presentation correction.\" Schumer says it was chosen in part for \"its relation to both the New Deal and a better deal than Trump.\"\n\nIt's remarkable how Democrats call GOP ideas tired and outdated yet keep returning to a well that was dug four years after the invention of sliced bread. At the rollout of a Better Deal, Pelosi said it is \"founded on strong values that we share. Strong values fueled by fresh ideas.\"\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, anchor Chris Wallace asked House Democratic Caucus chairman Joe Crowley to \"give me one fresh idea that Democrats are offering voters for November.\" The FDR coalition is a relic. The coalition the Democrats want is shot through with divisions. The Better Deal gives Democratic pols something to talk about that won't rile one faction or another.\n\nCrowley's confident response: A new infrastructure plan! But one that, unlike Trump's plan, the feds would pick up more of the tab for. Can't you smell the freshness?\n\nIronically, the New Deal was never a coherent program. It was a mixed and entirely ad hoc, dirigiste response to an economic crisis. \"To look upon these programs as the result of a unified plan,\" wrote Raymond Moley, FDR's right-hand man during much of the New Deal, \"was to believe that the accumulation of stuffed snakes, baseball pictures, school flags, old tennis shoes, carpenter's tools, geometry books, and chemistry sets in a boy's bedroom could have been put there by an interior decorator.\"\n\nThere are many reasons the Democrats remain a cargo cult to the New Deal, but the most important one for this moment is that the approach unifies not Democratic voters but Democratic politicians. The FDR coalition is a relic. The coalition the Democrats want is shot through with divisions. The Better Deal gives Democratic pols something to talk about that won't rile one faction or another.\n\nThat may be good enough to win the 2018 midterm elections, as all they really need is some boilerplate to rely on as they ride an anti-Trump wave. But the time will come when it won't be enough. The disruption is coming. They can help shape it, or they await a destroyer not of their own choosing.",
    " Title: Congress and President Trump Negotiate Budget Deal, Potential Changes to Legal Immigration Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Congress now appears to be on the verge of reaching a budget deal to maintain government operations without using the status of hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants, often referred to as \"Dreamers,\" as bargaining chips. However, it is also expected that President Trump may reconsider his threat of deportation for these individuals only if Congress considers the first significant cuts to legal immigration since the 1920s.\n\nThe proposed changes by the President stem from a nativist, zero-sum perspective that what is beneficial for immigrants is detrimental to America. This view contradicts not only the best of American tradition and principles but also evidence suggesting its negative impact on the country.\n\nThe programs under scrutiny by Mr. Trump are designed to make legal immigration more diverse and humane. One such program is the lottery system, which offers visa opportunities to individuals from countries underrepresented as sources of American immigrants. The other is family-based immigration, which grants visas to the close relatives of citizens and legal residents.\n\nPresident Trump, who has frequently portrayed immigrants as terrorists and criminals, has recently focused his fear-mongering on the diversity visa program. Last month, his Department of Homeland Security released a report alleging that those entering the country via the lottery were more likely to be involved in terrorist attacks. However, a study by the Cato Institute found that lottery visa holders were responsible for only eight of the 3,037 Americans murdered by foreign-born terrorists since 1975.\n\nImmigrants selected through the lottery are not chosen \"without any regard for skill, merit or the safety of our people,\" as Mr. Trump stated in his State of the Union address. In reality, they must possess at least a high school education or two years of experience in skilled work. They also undergo criminal, national security, and medical checks. The 50,000 recipients of the visas are not guaranteed permanent residence, but rather a chance to proceed through the rest of the immigration process.\n\nThe ongoing negotiations between Congress and the President will likely shape the future of these and other immigration policies, with implications for the diversity and composition of the American immigrant population.",
    " Title: House Democrats Ponder Participation in Benghazi Select Committee, Leaning Toward Non-Participation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a closed-door meeting on Wednesday, House Democrats debated the structure of a proposed special investigative committee on the Benghazi attacks, with some members considering boycotting the investigation altogether. Following the meeting, Democratic leaders declined to disclose their future plans.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., stated, \"One day at a time.\"\n\nSome rank-and-file Democrats argue that participating in the select committee would improperly legitimize what they view as a political effort. Others, however, argue that by not participating, they will not be able to influence the direction and narrative of the investigation. Sources told Fox News that, based on Wednesday's meeting, it appears Democrats are leaning toward not participating.\n\nGOP leaders outlined the particulars of the select committee on Tuesday evening, setting the stage for a comprehensive probe into various aspects, including U.S. response efforts and internal communications following the attack.\n\n\"It's not going to be a sideshow, it is not going to be a circus,\" said House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nIn a move that has caused contention among Democrats, GOP leaders proposed a committee consisting of seven Republicans and five Democrats. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her deputy, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., objected in a letter to Boehner, calling for the panel to be evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. They also called for Democrats to have a \"real and equal voice\" in issuing subpoenas, questioning witnesses, and other areas.\n\nPelosi and Hoyer did not threaten to boycott the committee, as some rank-and-file Democrats have. GOP leaders argue that the select committee is crucial, particularly in light of revelations that the Obama administration withheld relevant emails for months before their release as part of a lawsuit last week.\n\nThe select committee's priorities include determining the response to the Sep. 11, 2012 attack, including rescue efforts for U.S. personnel. Four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, died in the assault on the U.S. compound. The committee will have subpoena power and may order depositions to be given under oath. A final report is required, though some of it may be classified. The next step will be for the House to vote on the committee, and for members to be chosen. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., has already been selected to chair the committee.",
    " Title: Trump Administration to Reshape Title X Family Planning Program, Potentially Impacting Abortion Services\n\nThe Trump administration is poised to redefine the terms of Title X, a federally funded family planning program that has long been a target of conservative critics. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is set to issue new guidelines for Title X grants, potentially reshaping the program to align with the administration's anti-abortion stance.\n\nTeresa Manning, the deputy assistant secretary of the office of population affairs at HHS, who is a prominent anti-abortion advocate and a former lobbyist for the National Right to Life Committee, is expected to play a significant role in these changes.\n\n\"This is the administration's first attempt to really kind of redefine what they want the family planning program to look like,\" said Audrey Sandusky, communications director for the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA), which represents Title X grant recipients. \"We anticipate some attempt to undercut the program.\"\n\nSupporters of Title X are concerned that the administration may exclude clinics that also provide abortions, restrict services, limit access to certain types of birth control, or reduce funding for the program. On the other hand, anti-abortion advocates are hopeful that the administration will reinstate Reagan-era regulations that prohibited Title X providers from offering abortion referrals and counseling, and from encouraging, promoting, or advocating for abortion as a method of family planning.\n\nSteve Aden, chief legal officer and general counsel at Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion advocacy group, expressed support for this move, stating, \"The best thing for health care and for women is that they receive [family planning services] in a setting that\u2019s devoid of the possibility of Planned Parenthood pushing quote unquote options, when what they\u2019re doing is referring them to the abortion facility.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's intentions will become clear when HHS issues a funding opportunity announcement for Title X grants. The conditions are expected to differ significantly from those set by the Obama administration.\n\nIn 2017, Congress appropriated $286 million for Title X grants, with Planned Parenthood and its affiliates receiving approximately $60 million annually through the program. The potential changes to Title X could have a significant impact on women, particularly those living in underserved communities, according to Kinsey Hasstedt, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute.\n\n\"Any attempt to undermine this program or the providers or women\u2019s access to affordable care would be a huge setback and would definitely impact these women in these communities and represents a really unacceptable disruption of the program,\" Hasstedt said.",
    " Title: FBI Director James Comey and CIA Head Mike Pompeo Criticize WikiLeaks, Sparking Debate on Transparency and Journalism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee, FBI Director James Comey discussed the bureau's ongoing investigation into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. During the hearing, Comey made critical remarks about WikiLeaks, distinguishing it from legitimate news sources.\n\nComey stated, \"It crosses a line when it moves from being about educating a public to pushing out information...just to damage the United States.\" He further added, \"There's nothing that even smells journalist about some of this content.\" Comey also mentioned that the focus of investigations would usually fall on leakers during legitimate investigations.\n\nThese comments echo those made by CIA head Mike Pompeo just a couple of weeks prior, in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Pompeo declared, \"We can no longer allow [Julian] Assange and his colleagues the latitude to use free speech values against us.\" He continued, \"To give them the space to crush us with misappropriated secrets is a perversion of what our great Constitution stands for. It ends now.\"\n\nIt is important to note that no official should be in the position of defining journalism, implicitly sanctioning government action against whistleblowers and other leakers. However, the irony is palpable when the head of the FBI, an agency with a history of illegal and ineffective subterfuge, criticizes what constitutes legitimate media and what does not.\n\nFor instance, during a four-year period, the FBI authorized criminal activity by confidential informants over 22,000 times. The situation becomes even more disconcerting when the FBI director serves a president who has been vocal in his criticism of the press, calling for the \"loosening\" of libel laws regarding public figures and elected officials, and generally declaring war on the press.\n\nThe ongoing tension between Comey and President Donald Trump over the latter's refusal to recommend charges against Hillary Clinton adds an additional layer of complexity to the situation.\n\nWhile it may be unrealistic to expect U.S. officials to embrace WikiLeaks and other sources that reveal government secrets, there is no denying that WikiLeaks has forced transparency in ways that have greatly benefited the public.",
    " Title: Ross Perot, Billionaire Businessman and Independent Presidential Candidate, Dies at 89\n\n American businessman and former independent presidential candidate Ross Perot has passed away at the age of 89, following a five-month battle with leukemia, according to family spokesman James Fuller.\n\n Perot, who made his fortune by selling a controlling interest in the data processing business he founded to General Motors for $2.5 billion, was one of the most colorful political figures of the 1990s. His Texas twang, populist platform, and frequent television appearances brought him wide recognition.\n\n In the 1992 presidential election, Perot garnered nearly 19% of the vote, finishing third behind Bill Clinton and incumbent President George H.W. Bush. His 1992 campaign remains one of the most successful third-party bids in American history.\n\n Perot's impact on the election has been a subject of debate, with some, including former President Bush, believing he played a significant role in his defeat. However, election experts and scholarly research have challenged that theory, with The New York Times finding Perot's effect on the outcome of the election \"appears to have been minimal.\"\n\n In 1995, Perot created the Reform Party, and the following year, he received 8% of the vote in the presidential election as the party's candidate.\n\n After his second and final bid for the presidency, Perot served as president and CEO of Perot Systems Corporation, which he founded in 1988. He was the head of the company until 2000, when he passed the title on to his son, Ross Perot Jr. Nine years later, Dell Incorporated bought Perot Systems for $3.9 billion, resulting in a net gain of about $400 million for the Perot family.\n\n Aside from his business and political careers, Perot also received national attention for his efforts during the Vietnam War to create better conditions for US prisoners of war. He traveled to Laos, where he met with ambassadors from Russia and North Vietnam, and was awarded the Medal for Distinguished Public Service by the Department of Defense in 1974 for his efforts. In 1979, when two EDS employees were taken hostage during a revolution in Iran, he organized and paid for a successful private mission called Operation Hotfoot to rescue the men and bring them home.\n\n \"In business and in life, Ross was a man of integrity and action. A true American patriot and a man of rare vision, principle, and deep compassion, he touched the lives of countless people through his unwavering support of the military and veterans and through his charitable endeavors,\" Fuller said in a statement. \"Ross Perot will be deeply missed by all who loved him. He lived a long and honorable life.\"\n\n Henry Ray Perot, who later legally changed his name to Henry Ross, was born on June 27, 1930, in Texarkana, Texas, where his father ran a cotton mill. By the time he was 7 years old, Perot was an accomplished horseman and a budding businessman. His father was training him to make a profit by buying and selling bridles.\n\n Perot graduated from the Naval Academy in 1953 and spent four years at sea. After the Navy, Perot worked as a salesman at IBM before starting his own corporation, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), in 1962 with a $1,000 loan from his wife, Margot. The company grew quickly, and when the company went public in 1968, Fortune magazine put Perot on its cover, calling him the \"fastest, richest Texan.\"\n\n He later sold a controlling interest in EDS to General Motors, becoming a billionaire and GM's single largest stockholder and a director. He netted approximately $750 million in 1986 when he resigned from the General Motors board of directors as part of a buyout agreement and sold his GM shares.\n\n Although he had never held public office, by the early 1990s, Perot, sensing an opportunity for an outsider campaign with an anti-Washington message, was openly talking about a presidential run. Speaking to CNN's Larry King in 1992, he said that if he were to launch a campaign, he would run as an independent and \"get both parties' heads straight.\"\n\n \"I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family, (but) this situation got so bad that I decided I better get into it,\" he later said during a presidential debate. At one point during the summer of 1992, Perot dropped out, stating he could not win and that staying in the race would only create problems for the electoral process. His withdrawal came shortly after he stumbled during a speech at the NAACP, where his comments on unemployment were interpreted as patronizing and insensitive.\n\n \"Few people in this country have been able to live the American Dream to the extent that I have,\" Perot said when he re-entered, adding, \"Neither political party has effectively addressed the issues that concern the American people.\"",
    " Title: The Nuclear Option and the State of Partisanship in American Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly contentious week in the Senate, Republican Sen. John McCain and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin expressed their dismay over the potential use of the \"nuclear option\" to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. The GOP is expected to change the rules of the Senate to eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations, allowing Gorsuch to be confirmed with a simple majority of votes.\n\nSenate Republicans will move to a vote on Gorsuch's nomination on Thursday, with Senate Democrats expected to filibuster to block that vote. The Republicans' response to the filibuster is likely to be the elimination of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations, a move that has sparked criticism from both parties.\n\nBrian Balogh, co-host of the BackStory With the American History Guys podcast and a professor of history at the University of Virginia, described the Republican use of the nuclear option as exceptional but not unprecedented in American history. Balogh's research focuses on the evolution of American political parties and movements.\n\nSarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, author of Stalemate: Causes and Consequences of Legislative Gridlock, and an expert on the Senate, agreed that the move is part of a long-term parliamentary arms race between the two parties. Binder explained that the gradual ratcheting up of partisanship has been underway since the 1980s in the Senate, and this is surely part of the natural outgrowth of that rising partisan tension.\n\nThe use of the nuclear option will make bipartisan cooperation in the future even harder, according to both Balogh and Binder. The removal of the institutional incentives to compromise or to move towards a more consensual position across party lines will likely lead to a more scorched-earth policy, with both parties digging in their heels and refusing to compromise.\n\nBalogh and Binder both agreed that the American public will have to decide that they care more about effective governance than their party allegiances. The public will have to reward moderation and compromise over extreme partisanship if they want to see a return to more consensual politics.\n\nDespite the current state of partisanship, lawmakers can still find mutually beneficial compromises, as demonstrated by the Senate immigration deal in 2013. Real legislative gains are made by enlarging the pie, giving each party its preferred outcome. The key to overcoming partisan gridlock is for lawmakers to close the doors and find an issue on which both parties can win.",
    " Title: Analysis: Democratic Presidential Debate Highlights Harris, Buttigieg as Standouts, Challenges for Biden and Sanders\n\nAritcle:\n\nThe second night of the 2020 Democratic presidential debates took place on Thursday, with ten candidates taking the stage. The consensus among pundits and viewers was that Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg were the winners, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Vice President Joe Biden were considered the losers.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, who had a strong performance in the previous debate, struggled to offer unique proposals and came across as stern, yelling, and short on details. His Medicare-for-all plan and free college plan were criticized, with Mayor Buttigieg arguing that college should not be subsidized for billionaires' children. Sanders' performance wore thin as the debate went on, and he was unable to explain how his Medicare-for-all plan would work on a national level.\n\nJoe Biden, on the other hand, started the debate capably, defending Obamacare and rattling off his plans on education. However, as the debate went on, he ran into trouble, particularly on the issue of race, where Sen. Kamala Harris went after him for his positions on civil rights and criminal justice. Harris was the clear standout on the stage, demonstrating her toughness and prosecutorial experience.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris' first big moment of the debate was when she said, \"America does not want to witness a food fight.\" Her second was when she heaped an entire tray of spaghetti in former Vice President Joe Biden's face. Harris was well-prepared, clear, and measured in her answers, and her willingness to take on Biden signaled that she was the alpha on the stage.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg also impressed with his self-criticism and thoughtful approach to issues. When asked about the ongoing lack of minority representation on South Bend's police force, Buttigieg confessed, \"I couldn't get it done.\" He went on to talk about the pain of his community, his own anguish over the situation, what he has managed to accomplish, and what he plans next.\n\nThe debate should teach the Democratic presidential candidates a valuable lesson: be yourself and show Americans what you stand for. The debate was a chance for the candidates to show their leadership skills, policy acumen, and authenticity, regardless of gender, color, or sexual orientation. The debate was a reminder that voters are attracted to candidates who are genuine and have a clear plan.\n\nOne night won't sink the Joe Biden campaign, but his performance was lackluster, and he seemed unfocused, distracted, and out of touch. When asked what his first priority as president would be, Biden answered that it would be defeating Donald Trump. This response was criticized as a lackluster answer, and it was pointed out that \"build upon what we've done\" is a more reassuring and appealing message than completely scrapping the entire existing system of private health insurance.\n\nIn conclusion, the second night of the Democratic presidential debates was a chance for the candidates to show their leadership skills, policy acumen, and authenticity. Sen. Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg were the standouts of the night, while Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden struggled to impress. The debate was a reminder that voters are attracted to candidates who are genuine, have a clear plan, and are willing to take responsibility for their actions.",
    " Title: Boeing Ends 2019 with First-Ever Negative Commercial Airplane Orders, Amidst 737 Max Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant setback, Boeing, the aerospace giant, reported a negative commercial airplane order count for the first time in decades at the end of 2019, according to CNBC. The company lost orders for 87 airplanes, with more cancellations than new orders.\n\nThe high rate of cancellations is a clear indication that the ongoing crisis surrounding the 737 Max, the airplane involved in two fatal crashes that claimed 346 lives, is continuing to impact Boeing's financial performance. The order book for the troubled jet shrank by 183 planes, though much of this was due to the bankruptcy of low-cost overseas airlines like India's Jet Airways and Vietnam's VietJet. However, the ongoing problems in getting the 737 Max certified led to insufficient demand to offset the losses.\n\nThere was a 90 percent drop in orders for 737 models during the year, according to CNN. Boeing barely had any firm orders for the Max after the grounding in mid-March, but other models also suffered a 29 percent drop in new orders.\n\nMeanwhile, American Airlines has extended its cancellations for the 737 Max until June 4th, after previously targeting April 7th. The carrier has repeatedly pushed back the date as Boeing continues to grapple with regulatory approval for the 737 Max.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding of all Boeing 737 Max jets after two deadly crashes in October 2018 and March 2019. Both crashes have been linked to a piece of software known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) that Boeing had installed on the 737 Max.\n\nRecently, Boeing has been embroiled in a fresh controversy involving internal messages in which employees discussed the problems with the 737 Max in ways the company characterized as \"completely unacceptable.\" In the chats and emails released by congressional investigators, employees mocked regulators, expressed concerns about flying the 737 Max themselves, and described interactions with FAA officials as cover-ups.\n\nThe messages reveal Boeing's attempts to reduce the amount of simulator training required by the FAA to certify pilots for the 737 Max. Last week, the company announced it would recommend simulator training for pilots of its 737 Max jets after previously stating that such training was unnecessary.\n\nBoeing had initially sold the 737 Max to carriers on the promise they wouldn't have to pay for pilot training on simulators, a costly expense for airlines. Instead, pilots who were certified to fly on the 737 Next Generation planes took a short course on an iPad to fly the Max, according to The New York Times.",
    " Title: Economic Recovery Slows Down Amidst Rising COVID-19 Cases and Job Losses\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent analysis of employment data from platforms like ZipRecruiter and Homebase reveals a slowdown in job postings and small business openings, signaling a potential setback in the economic recovery. In June, job postings on ZipRecruiter decreased after a significant rise in May, while small business employment and openings, as per Homebase data, worsened over the past week.\n\nThe decline in small business activity, which had shown a nearly 40 percent improvement in May, fell to 6 percent across all of June. This trend is particularly evident in states experiencing infection surges, such as Texas, where layoffs and business closings have been observed even before the reimposition of some economic activity restrictions.\n\nFoot traffic to retailers and other businesses has also decreased in large cities across southern states, including Houston, Orlando, and Jacksonville, where infections have spiked. This observation is based on an analysis of Safegraph.com data by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\n\nFurthermore, data from 40 million households compiled by the financial firm Commerce Signals shows that after weeks of improvement, credit and debit card spending declined at the end of May across most states.\n\nEconomists have expressed concern about this development, as it marks a departure from the optimistic \"rocket ship\" recovery that President Trump had predicted in June. Federal Reserve officials have publicly warned that the recovery's success is highly dependent on public health, with Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell stating that a full recovery is unlikely until people feel safe to resume a broad range of activities.\n\nThe next few months of recovery could be rocky even if the current infection surge abates. Job losses remain at levels higher than in any previous recession, and an increasing number of workers report permanent layoffs rather than temporary furloughs. Moreover, a significant share of small businesses have yet to reopen, even as states lift restrictions on their operations, suggesting some of them may be closed permanently. By many measures, business activity and employment remain down by a quarter or more from pre-crisis levels.",
    " Title: Trump Declares Hillary Clinton as \"Real Enemy\" in Exclusive Interview Ahead of Indiana Primary Victory\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Tuesday evening, presumptive Republican nominee for President, Donald Trump, declared that the \"real enemy\" lies ahead in the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. The interview took place before the polls closed in Indiana, as Trump was wrapping up his victory in the GOP nomination for the presidency.\n\nTrump's interview aimed to unify the Republican Party and to set his sights squarely on Clinton, stating that she is the \"real enemy.\" He asserted that four more years of the Obama administration, under a potential Clinton presidency, would be detrimental to the country.\n\n\"The real enemy is Hillary Clinton and four more years of essentially Obama,\" Trump said. \"The country can not take it. Our country is not going to be able to survive four more years of incompetence and bad decision-making.\"\n\nTrump criticized Clinton's positions in favor of trade deals like NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership, her opposition to securing the U.S. border with Mexico, and her stance on a strong American military. He claimed that Clinton's economic policies, particularly her role in the signing of NAFTA, have weakened the U.S. economy and cost the country jobs.\n\nRegarding his vice presidential pick, Trump stated that he would be selecting a political figure, rather than a businessperson, to help navigate the political landscape and get things done in Congress. He expressed that he would like to finalize the nomination process before making a decision on a running mate.\n\nTrump also attributed the high Republican primary turnout and low Democrat turnout as a sign of his strength in the general election. He stated that the high turnout was a result of his campaign and that he would be beating Clinton in popular votes if he had only faced one, non-serious competitor during the primaries.\n\nThe interview comes as Trump is expected to win big in Indiana but before his last remaining serious rival, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), officially drops out, thereby handing the nomination to Trump.",
    " Title: GOP Senator Bob Corker Criticizes President Trump's Border Wall Funding Demand as a \"Made-Up Fight\"\n\nIn a recent interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Senator Bob Corker (R-TN) criticized President Trump's insistence on securing funding for a border wall, calling it a \"made-up fight.\"\n\n\"This is a made-up fight so the president can look like he's fighting, but even if he wins, our borders are going to be insecure,\" Mr. Corker said.\n\nThe senator, who has been a frequent critic of the president, argued that the White House is proposing the wrong solution, suggesting that the focus should be on more sophisticated technology.\n\n\"It's not unlike going to the Pentagon and saying, 'Look, we need to buy fighters, and we have stealth fighters, and they're supersonic technology and they have precision guided missiles, but no, let's use the Wright brothers,'\" said Mr. Corker.\n\nHe added, \"And so it's not just about the money, it's what we're spending it on.\"\n\nThe current standoff between Mr. Trump and Democratic leaders over the border wall funding has led to a partial shutdown of the federal government.\n\n\"We could secure our borders. We could solve this problem. This is a made-up fight,\" Mr. Corker said.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted Sunday that technology is fine but that the wall is essential, stating that \"it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!\"\n\nThe ongoing debate between the two parties has left the government partially shut down, with no clear resolution in sight.

    " Title: House Oversight Committee Schedules Vote to Consider Contempt Charges Against Attorney General Eric Holder\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has announced a vote for next week to consider holding Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress over the controversial Fast and Furious gun-tracking operation. The vote is scheduled for June 20.\n\nThe committee's decision follows a 64-page memo released by Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) in early May, outlining the case for holding the attorney general in contempt. Issa's argument is based on Holder's failure to respond to an October 2011 subpoena for internal Justice Department documents on the operation.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Issa accused Holder of having \"failed to meet his legal obligations\" and of \"obstructing the investigation.\" He added that the Justice Department can still stop the process of contempt by delivering key documents.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner also issued a statement, saying the department is \"out of excuses.\"\n\nThe Justice Department maintains that it has cooperated with the investigation and provided thousands of documents. Holder has testified before the committee at least eight times about Fast and Furious, most recently on Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nIn a statement, Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler called the scheduled vote \"unfortunate and unwarranted.\" She said there had been \"ongoing discussions\" with committee staff about a \"mutually acceptable resolution\" to their information requests.\n\nThe White House Press Secretary Jay Carney on Monday also noted that Justice has provided 7,600 pages of documents to date and provided testimony during \"hours and hours\" of congressional hearings. He suggested the vote next week is political.\n\nAt Thursday's hearing, Issa grilled Holder in a particularly heated exchange where he accused the attorney general of failing to answer questions about the investigation.\n\nThe Fast and Furious program oversaw sales of nearly 2,000 firearms to suspected Mexican drug cartels in an attempt to trace gun trafficking. However, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) recovered only 567 of the guns. Most controversially, many of the guns were found at violent crime scenes, including at the shooting of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.\n\nThe Republican leadership initially hedged on fully supporting Issa's case due to concerns that charging the attorney general in contempt in an election year could backfire. At the same time, they tried to allay concerns from conservatives -- particularly freshmen -- who called for Holder's resignation.\n\nSix House Republican freshmen wrote to the leadership on May 18 to push for a contempt of Congress resolution against Holder. Hours later, House Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy issued a letter to Holder demanding that he fully cooperate with the Oversight Committee investigation.\n\nThey also warned that \"if necessary, the House will act to fulfill our constitutional obligations in the coming weeks.\"\n\nSen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Monday that the latest announcement is \"straightforward and necessary.\"\n\n\"Contempt is the only tool Congress has to enforce a subpoena,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Issa's Democratic counterpart on the House oversight committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), called the committee's action \"unfortunate.\"\n\n\"I am guardedly optimistic that a path forward exists that will serve the legitimate interests of the Committee in conducting rigorous oversight, protect the legitimate interests of the Department in its ongoing investigations and prosecutions, and avoid the needless politicization of this very serious issue,\" he said in a statement.\n\nHolder would join only one other attorney general, Janet Reno in 1998, to be held in contempt by the Oversight Committee. The last time the House voted to find an executive branch official in contempt was in 2008 over the U.S. attorney firings controversy. It passed a resolution against White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten and former White House counsel Harriet Miers for failing to provide internal documents. Miers also refused to comply with a subpoena to appear at a hearing. The House Judiciary Committee also found White House adviser Karl Rove in contempt later that year over the same issue.",
    " Title: Age Differences in Attention to COVID-19 News Remain Consistent Over Time\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by Pew Research Center's Election News Pathways project reveals that while a vast majority of U.S. adults (92%) are closely following news about the COVID-19 pandemic, significant differences in attention to the news emerge by age, particularly between the youngest and oldest Americans.\n\nThe study, which is part of the Election News Pathways project, found that more than two-thirds of adults ages 65 or older (69%) are following news of the pandemic very closely. Conversely, about four-in-ten Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 (42%) are paying as much attention to COVID-19 news. Those adults ages 30 to 49 and ages 50 to 64 fall in between.\n\nThe differences persist over time. Even as the public's attention to news about the coronavirus outbreak grew from the first half to the second half of March, that growth did not occur equally across all age groups. Attention among the youngest cohort remained behind others.\n\nThe study was conducted in two parts, with the first survey administered from March 10-16, 2020, among 8,914 U.S. adults, and the second survey from March 19-24 among 11,537 adults. In that short period of time, when reported U.S. COVID-19 cases and fatalities quickly mounted and efforts by government and public health experts to respond to the outbreak intensified, overall attention to news about the outbreak remained extremely high, with the share following it very closely rising from 51% to 57% over this period.\n\nSome age groups intensified their attention, while others did not. The portion of those ages 30 to 49 and ages 50 to 64 following the news very closely grew about 10 percentage points. On the other hand, the portion of those ages 18-29 and 65 and older following coronavirus news very closely remained largely unchanged.\n\nFrom mid to late March, the percentage following COVID-19 news very closely grew among middle-aged groups, while youngest adults remained least engaged. The share of those ages 30 to 49 who said they were following coronavirus coverage very closely rose 10 percentage points, from 44% to 54%. Among people ages 50 to 64, the percentage following news about the pandemic very closely rose by nine points \u2013 up from 54% to 63%.\n\nAttention among those ages 65 and older did not change much between the two time periods, but this may largely be due to their very high level of interest from the outset. Even during the first survey, fully two-thirds said they were following news very closely, something that could reflect both the news consumption habits of senior citizens as well as warnings that they were among those most vulnerable to the new virus. In the March 16-24 survey, that number remained largely unchanged at 69%.\n\nHowever, the increasingly sobering news of the pandemic had little impact on the group paying the least attention, those 18 to 29 years of age. Four-in-ten said they were following news about the virus very closely in the first survey, a figure that remained almost the same later in March (42%).\n\nIn conclusion, the youngest adults, those ages 18 to 29, are the least likely to say they are following news about the coronavirus very closely, while the oldest adults ages 65 and older are the most likely to do so. This level of engagement remained consistent from mid to late March. These measures and more can be explored further in the Election News Pathways data tool, where all of the data associated with this project is available for public use.",
    " Title: House Budget Committee Advances GOP's ObamaCare Repeal and Replacement Plan, Facing Opposition from Conservative Members\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Budget Committee has approved the Republican's ObamaCare repeal and replacement plan in a 19-17 vote on Thursday, with three Republican representatives voting against the bill. The three dissenting members, Reps. Dave Brat (Va.), Mark Sanford (S.C.), and Gary Palmer (Ala.), are all members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which has criticized the bill for retaining some ObamaCare provisions and insurance mandates.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) stated that the Budget panel's action brings Republicans \"another step closer toward keeping our promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare.\" He emphasized that the repeal and replace process will be a step-by-step approach, and the bill is on track and on schedule as intended.\n\nThe bill will now move to the House Rules Committee, where leadership may make amendments to address concerns from both conservative and moderate members. The Rules Committee will serve as the final stop before the bill reaches the floor.\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) has announced he will offer an amendment to leadership on Friday, but has not disclosed its content.\n\nIn her opening remarks, Budget Chairwoman Diane Black (R-Tenn.) encouraged conservative members to stay engaged in the discussions and work towards improving the proposal. She stated, \"To my Republican colleagues who have doubts today, I encourage you: Don't cut off discussion. Stay in this effort and help us enhance this proposal by advancing it out of committee and pushing for further conservative reforms.\"\n\nThe committee also approved four non-binding recommendations from Republicans, including a work requirement for able-bodied adults enrolled in Medicaid and a plan to gear the refundable tax credits towards low-income individuals. The current GOP plan provides tax credits based on age, not income, for individuals making up to $75,000.\n\nSome Republicans have expressed concerns that the tax credits are too generous for higher-income individuals and do not provide enough assistance for older, low-income individuals. Two Democrats also supported the recommendation to adjust the tax credits to better assist lower-income individuals.\n\nThe work requirement, as well as the option to accept Medicaid funding through block grants, is generally supported by both conservatives and moderates. The White House has stated it is working with leadership on a manager's amendment to the bill, but has not provided details.\n\nHouse Republican leaders face a narrow margin for error once the healthcare bill reaches the floor, as at least 15 Republicans have stated they will vote against the bill or are leaning against it, according to CNBC's Whip List. Twenty-two defections would be enough to defeat the bill on the floor.\n\nIn the Senate, some Republicans are privately expressing hope that the House bill may fail, given the challenges they could face in passing the measure. A Republican senator, who requested anonymity to speak freely about the bill, stated, \"Right now this is disintegrating in the Senate, with everyone off on their own about what they don't like about the bill.\"",
    " Title: Sanders' Rising Funds and Controversial Foreign Policy Stance in Democratic Primary Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Democratic primary race, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has reportedly raised a significant amount in fundraising, putting him in a strong financial position. According to recent reports, Sanders pulled in about $34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, bringing his total to nearly $100 million. This places him far ahead of his competitors in terms of fundraising.\n\nHistorically, candidates who lead in fundraising at this stage in a primary, especially when an incumbent is not running, have a strong chance of winning the nomination. In 14 out of 14 primaries where a leader in fundraising was not an incumbent, they went on to win the nomination. Even when a candidate is trailing in the national polls, the leader has won 3 out of 5 times, including candidates like Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992 and Republican Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nHowever, former Vice President Joe Biden has a significant lead in endorsements from members of Congress and governors. Endorsement leaders at this stage in a primary have a strong track record of winning, having gone on to win the nomination 10 out of 14 times. When a candidate leads in both fundraising and endorsements, they have won 7 out of 9 nominations.\n\nSanders is reportedly using this financial advantage to draw clear contrasts with his fellow Democratic candidates, particularly on foreign policy issues. Sanders has studied Biden's long voting record and is beginning to highlight their differences, such as Biden's support for the Iraq War and Sanders' opposition. The question remains whether Sanders will use these contrasts in television ads in states like Iowa and New Hampshire as the voting nears.\n\nSome caution that Sanders may face challenges in taking down Biden on the Iraq War issue, as he was unable to do so in the 2016 primary against Hillary Clinton. The issue may be less potent than it once was, and former Navy intelligence officer and former South Bend, Ind. mayor Pete Buttigieg, who was too young to vote on the Iraq War, may present a stronger challenge on national security issues.\n\nOthers argue that Sanders is in a strong position to use the escalating hostilities in the Middle East as an opportunity to highlight his alternative foreign policy. Sanders has a long record as an anti-war activist, and in 2016, he gained traction by contrasting his vote against the Iraq War with Clinton's vote in favor. In the current race, Sanders has staked out a radical foreign policy that includes ending the forever wars, using aid money as leverage to push Israel to negotiate with the Palestinians, and making climate change a cornerstone of American foreign policy.\n\nThe difficulty for Sanders is that if he raises the salience of foreign policy, he will have to argue against not only Trump but also former President Barack Obama. The safer course for Sanders would be to stick to domestic policy, where his popular policies distinguish him enough to carry him to victory. However, Trump's recklessness may make that safer path impossible, as the United States is already in a de facto war with Iran. If that war becomes a large-scale conflict, Sanders may have no choice but to run as the only true anti-war candidate.\n\nIn the end, the Democratic primary race remains a complex and dynamic contest, with Sanders' strong fundraising and controversial foreign policy stance adding another layer of intrigue. As voting nears, it will be interesting to see how Sanders' campaign strategy evolves and how his competitors respond.",
    " Title: U.S. Senate Leaders Disagree on Witness Testimony in Impeachment Trial of President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - U.S. senators are at odds over the format of the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer expressing differing views on witness testimony.\n\nMcConnell, in an interview with \"Fox & Friends,\" stated that the Senate has not ruled out hearing from witnesses, but has not agreed to a Democratic request for a commitment to call witnesses before the trial begins. He cited the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton as a model, where senators decided on witnesses after the trial had commenced.\n\n\"We haven't ruled out witnesses,\" McConnell said. \"We've said, 'Let's handle this case just like we did with President Clinton.' Fair is fair.\"\n\nIn the 1999 trial, senators went through opening arguments, had a written question period, and decided on witnesses later. Limited testimony by video was allowed. Allowing witness testimony, particularly from current and former administration officials, could prolong the trial and potentially introduce new damaging evidence for Trump, who was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives last week.\n\nSchumer, on the other hand, insisted that the trial must include witnesses and the release of relevant Trump administration documents. He warned that a trial without documents and witnesses could be perceived as a \"sham trial\" or a \"show trial\" by the American people.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine a trial not having documents and witnesses,\" Schumer said at a press conference in New York. \"If it doesn't have documents and witnesses, it's going to seem - to most of the American people - that it is a sham trial, a show trial.\"\n\nThe House voted along party lines to impeach Trump on two charges over his pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and Biden's son. Trump was charged with abuse of power and obstructing Congress' investigation. He has maintained his innocence.\n\nTrump, on Monday, accused Democrats of delaying tactics and urged for a quick conclusion to the impeachment process. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate, a move to pressure Senate Republicans to reach an accord with Schumer on trial rules. McConnell said the Senate could not take any action until it receives the articles.\n\nSchumer has requested to have four witnesses subpoenaed for the trial. The White House blocked all four, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, from testifying during impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives in December.",
    " Title: Rep. Ayanna Pressley Calls for Impeachment Inquiry into Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh Amidst New Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could potentially escalate the ongoing debate, Representative Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., one of the four freshman congresswomen known collectively as the \"Squad,\" has announced plans to introduce a resolution on Tuesday calling for an impeachment inquiry into Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh. This decision comes in the wake of a New York Times report that included a new allegation of sexual misconduct from Kavanaugh's college days, although the alleged victim later stated that the incident did not occur.\n\nIn a statement, Pressley expressed her belief in Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, two women who came forward during Kavanaugh's confirmation process. \"I believe Christine Blasey Ford. I believe Deborah Ramirez. It is our responsibility to collectively affirm the dignity and humanity of survivors,\" Pressley stated.\n\nThe proposed resolution, as suggested by Pressley's tweets, would initiate an inquiry into whether the House of Representatives should impeach Brett Kavanaugh, and would task the House Judiciary Committee with conducting depositions and taking affidavits, if necessary.\n\nHowever, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has not explicitly voiced support for impeaching Kavanaugh. In a radio interview on Monday, Nadler stated, \"We have our hands full with impeaching the president right now.\"\n\nAs the news unfolded, Republican leaders criticized the renewed attacks on Kavanaugh, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stating, \"This is not normal political behavior.\"\n\nThe original New York Times piece, adapted from a forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate, Max Stier, witnessed Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends allegedly pushed Kavanaugh's penis into the hand of a female student. By late Sunday, the paper had revised its story to include the fact that several friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the reported sexual assault in question.\n\nSeveral Democratic presidential candidates, including Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas; and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, have called for Kavanaugh's impeachment after the initial Times report. Despite the editors' note and revision to the story, these candidates have not retracted their calls for impeachment.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris continued to push for an investigation on Monday, even circulating an impeachment petition on her Twitter account. The ongoing developments in this story are expected to generate further discussion and potential action in the coming days.",
    " Title: NSA Taps into Google and Yahoo Data Links, Allegedly bypassing Domestic Oversight\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a report published by The Washington Post on Wednesday, it was revealed that the National Security Agency (NSA) has allegedly tapped directly into the communications links used by Google and Yahoo to move large amounts of email and other user information among overseas data centers. The report, based on secret NSA documents leaked by former contractor Edward Snowden, suggests that the agency has exploited major U.S. companies' data to a greater extent than previously known.\n\nThe operation, code-named MUSCULAR, reportedly intercepts data outside the United States, thereby avoiding oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The interception is said to occur at a cable or switch that relays the traffic through an unnamed telecommunications provider.\n\nGoogle's chief legal officer, David Drummond, expressed outrage over the alleged actions, stating, \"We are outraged at the lengths to which the government seems to have gone to intercept data from our private fiber networks, and it underscores the need for urgent reform.\" Google has recently stepped up its efforts to encrypt internal traffic, but was reportedly unaware of the program.\n\nSimilarly, Yahoo has strict controls in place to protect the security of its data centers, and it has not given access to its data centers to the NSA or any other government agency, according to a Yahoo spokeswoman. Yahoo plans to begin encrypting users' email as it moves to the company, but has not yet announced plans to keep email encrypted as it moves within Yahoo.\n\nThe NSA, in a statement, denied the allegations, stating that the suggestion that the agency relies on a presidential order to skirt domestic restrictions imposed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and other laws is not true. The agency also denied collecting vast quantities of U.S. persons' data from this type of collection.\n\nThe report is likely to add to the growing tensions between the U.S. intelligence establishment and tech companies, which have been struggling to assure customers overseas that they need not fear U.S. spying. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy has announced his intention to ask for an administration briefing on the program, citing potential privacy concerns for millions of U.S. residents.",
    " Title: Tea Party Conservatives and Healthcare Reform: A Long-Term Effort to Defund and Repeal Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Tea Party conservatives have found allies in their efforts to defund and potentially repeal the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as Obamacare. These conservatives have threatened to shut down the government if their demands are not met regarding spending issues related to the healthcare law.\n\nRepresentative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, founder of the House Tea Party Caucus, expressed support for the defunding campaign, stating, \"This is exactly what the public wants\" on the eve of the potential government shutdown. However, not all advocacy groups are fully on board with the defunding campaign. For instance, the Koch-financed Americans for Prosperity, which spent $5.5 million on health care television advertisements over the past three months, is more focused on sowing public doubts about the law.\n\nDespite this, all groups share a common goal: to undermine a measure that Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican and leader of the defunding effort, has likened to a horror movie. Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, stated, \"We view this as a long-term effort.\" He also mentioned that his group expected to spend \"tens of millions\" of dollars on a \"multifront effort\" that includes working to prevent states from expanding Medicaid under the law. The group's objective is not to defund the law but to see it repealed.\n\n\"We want to see this law repealed,\" Mr. Phillips declared.\n\nThe crowd at the Hilton Anatole, just north of downtown Dallas, was enthusiastic during a town hall meeting in August, the second stop on a nine-city \"Defund Obamacare Town Hall Tour.\" The event featured two prominent figures of the Tea Party movement: Senator Cruz and Jim DeMint, a former South Carolina senator who now runs the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\"You're here because now is the single best time we have to defund Obamacare,\" declared Senator Cruz, who later delivered a 21-hour monologue against the law on the Senate floor in September. \"This is a fight we can win.\"\n\nAlthough Senator Cruz is new to the Senate, the tactic of defunding legislation is not. For years, Congress has used the Hyde Amendment to ban the use of certain federal funds for abortions, except in cases of incest and rape, by attaching the amendment to spending bills. After the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, former Republican congressman Todd Tiahrt proposed defunding parts of the law. He discussed the idea with Speaker John Boehner's staff while the Supreme Court, which upheld the central provision, was considering the law's constitutionality.",
    " Title: Judge Dismisses Defamation Lawsuit Against Former British Spy Christopher Steele in US\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant ruling, a judge in Washington D.C. has dismissed a defamation lawsuit against former British spy Christopher Steele, who compiled a dossier alleging links between Donald Trump and the Kremlin. The lawsuit was filed by three Russian oligarchs who claimed they were defamed by Steele's writings that they attempted to influence the 2016 US election.\n\nJudge Anthony Epstein ruled in favor of Steele, stating that he has a right to his opinion. The Russian billionaires, Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and German Khan, had argued that Steele was not entitled to free speech protections under the First Amendment, as he is not a U.S. citizen. However, Judge Epstein disagreed, stating that advocacy on issues of public interest furthers the purposes of the First Amendment, regardless of the speaker's citizenship or residency.\n\nThe judge also cited Washington D.C.'s anti-SLAPP law, which prevents parties from filing lawsuits to tamp down on opposing political views. Christy Hull Eikhoff, Steele's American lawyer, said the court had shown support for the First Amendment and the \"profound national principle\" that debate should be \"uninhibited, robust, and wide open.\"\n\nThis victory for Steele comes after he argued through his lawyers that the owners of Alfa Bank, referred to as \"Alpha\" in the dossier, were trying to intimidate him into silence. The court in Washington D.C. ruled that Steele should have the same guarantees of free speech as American citizens, specifically the protection given by legislation designed to stop lawsuits being used by rich individuals to stop public debate.\n\nThe Alfa Bank owners accused Steele of acting maliciously or recklessly when he wrote a headline about \"cooperation\" between \"Alpha\" and the Kremlin in the US presidential election. However, the judgment states that this headline represents Steele's opinion based on what his sources were telling him about the Alfa oligarchs' long relationship with Vladimir Putin, including the claim that they sent him \"large amounts of illicit cash\" when he was deputy mayor of St. Petersburg.\n\nThe court's judgment notes that the dossier \"does not present any direct evidence that Alfa interfered in the election.\" The FBI has been investigating whether a computer server in Trump Tower was communicating with one belonging to Alfa Bank during the campaign. It is not known what, if anything, the FBI found.\n\nLawyers for the Russian billionaires told the BBC in a statement they would probably appeal the decision. The three billionaires have previously brought a defamation case against Fusion GPS, the Washington D.C.-based research company that hired Steele. The dossier, containing salacious allegations against President Donald Trump, was first published by BuzzFeed in January 2017.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly dismissed the Steele dossier on Twitter as \"fake\" and \"fraudulent.\" He has also called Steele a \"lowlife\" and claimed that the document was financed by his 2016 presidential rival, Hillary Clinton.",
    " Title: CNN's Debate Moderation Sparks Controversy Over Sanders-Warren Allegation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent Democratic debate hosted by CNN has sparked controversy among supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over perceived bias in the moderation of the event. The debate, which took place on Tuesday, provided another instance where Sanders' supporters believe the mainstream media may have subtly undermined their candidate.\n\nThe controversy stems from an unproven allegation that Sanders, during a 2018 meeting with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), privately stated that a woman could not win the presidency. The allegation surfaced over the weekend, with media outlets citing unnamed sources, likely members of the Warren campaign, as the source. Sanders has vehemently denied making such a statement, and was asked about it again on the debate stage.\n\nDuring the exchange, when Sanders reiterated that the story was not true, CNN's Abby Phillip asked, \"You're saying that you never told Senator Warren that a woman could not win the election?\" Phillip then turned to Warren and asked, \"Senator Warren, what did you think when Sen. Sanders said a woman could not win the election?\"\n\nIt is noteworthy that Phillip did not actually ask Warren whether Sanders had made the comment\u2014she merely presumed that he had, even though he had just denied it. Moments later, CNN.com ran with the headline, \"Sanders denies saying a woman can't be president.\" This framing of the subject makes it sound as if Sanders is denying an objective reality, even though there is no evidence he said it, and Warren's recollection of the statement was not specifically probed by the moderator.\n\nThe debate provided an opportunity for CNN to shed light on the rare dispute between Sanders and Warren, but instead, they chose to avoid the issue, a move that implicitly took Warren's side. Many of Sanders' most fervent online supporters found this approach telling.",
    " Title: Intelligence Community's Refusal to Brief Congress on Russian Election Interference Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington D.C. - A heated exchange took place on Capitol Hill Wednesday night as the House Intelligence Committee's planned briefing on Russian interference in the U.S. election was abruptly canceled due to the intelligence community's alleged \"intransigence.\"\n\nRep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), a member of the committee, expressed his frustration to Fox News' \"The Kelly File,\" stating, \"Somebody has the time to leak it to The Washington Post and The New York Times, but they don't have the time to come to Congress.\" He further added, \"It's their job to come. They don't have any choice. They have to come in, especially when they have created this.\"\n\nInitially, Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) had requested a closed, classified briefing from the FBI, CIA, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and National Security Agency. However, according to Fox News, CIA Director John Brennan declined to provide a briefer, citing the full review requested by President Obama. The other agencies did not respond to the committee's request, which is unusual given the panel is the most-senior committee with jurisdiction.\n\nNunes issued a statement expressing his concern, stating, \"It is unacceptable that the Intelligence Community directors would not fulfill the House Intelligence Committee's request to be briefed tomorrow on the cyber-attacks that occurred during the presidential campaign.\" He added, \"The Committee is deeply concerned that intransigence in sharing intelligence with Congress can enable the manipulation of intelligence for political purposes.\"\n\nKing highlighted the irony in the lack of cooperation, stating, \"The consensus was that there was an attempt by the Russians to put a cloud over the election, to create disunity. Well, that's what's happening right now, but it's the intelligence community that's doing it.\"\n\nKing also noted that lawmakers have not received any assessment from the CIA that Russia interfered to help Trump win the presidency over Hillary Clinton, allegations first reported by The Washington Post Friday.\n\nIn a late Wednesday statement, the intelligence community defended its position, noting that senior administration officials regularly provide \"extensive, detailed classified and unclassified briefings to members and staff from both parties on Capitol Hill.\" The statement added that they are focusing on the review ordered by President Obama on foreign efforts to influence U.S. elections.\n\nHowever, the statement also noted that once the review is complete in the coming weeks, the Intelligence Community stands ready to brief Congress and make the findings available to the public, consistent with protecting intelligence sources and methods.\n\nKing, referring to recent press reports, said, \"It's almost as if people in the intelligence community are carrying out a disinformation campaign against the president-elect of the United States.\" He added, \"It's absolutely disgraceful, and if they're not doing it, then it must be someone in the House or the Senate who's leaking false information, and there should be a full investigation of this.\"\n\nFurther details about the \"full review\" ordered by President Obama are still emerging. Fox News has learned that the review is being led by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and is a multi-agency effort. Investigators plan to take existing intelligence and reconstruct what happened, with a focus on whether there is new intelligence that substantiates analysis that the interference was designed to ensure a Trump victory, or whether a review of the existing intelligence with \"fresh eyes\" leads to new conclusions.",

We have very good intelligence on Russia. So then I had talked to some of my former colleagues, and I knew that they were trying to also help get information to the Hill.\"\n\nPriebus, in response to these comments, expressed his surprise and skepticism, stating, \"It's almost so cavalier and unbelievable that I just wonder whether this person knows what the heck she's talking about.\" He further added, \"It's just an incredible statement, you know, and how, what it means and what she meant by that, and whether that has anything to do with the issues in regard to surveillance of Trump transition team members is something that we need to figure out this morning and throughout the day.\"\n\nWhen asked about a personal reaction to the statement, Priebus questioned Farkas' understanding of the situation, stating, \"It's so much in your face that it makes you wonder what she means.\"\n\nRegarding the potential interest of Director Comey in Farkas' statement, Priebus responded, \"I hope that the intelligence committees and agencies are interested in all of these things.\" He also emphasized the White House's desire for a thorough investigation, stating, \"We want this thing done thoroughly, and I will tell you that because we have got nothing to hide.\"\n\nRadio hosts Sean Hannity and Mark Levin both mentioned the story Wednesday afternoon, and the original clip from MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' is available online. The transcript of the Priebus interview, courtesy of the Hugh Hewitt Show, provides further insight into the White House's response to Farkas' allegations.",
    " Title: Reflecting on Martin Luther King Jr.'s Dream: A Call for the End of Race in America\n\nArticle:\n\nFifty years after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s iconic \"I Have a Dream\" speech, the nation is still grappling with race relations. Despite the progress made, the issue remains a significant part of American discourse.\n\nRacism, a persistent and pervasive issue, has been a part of human history for millennia. In the United States, a country that boasts of being the most advanced, successful, and powerful nation in history, the struggle to move past skin color continues.\n\nThe author argues that focusing on skin color is a shallow, hollow, and soulless way to view human beings. It is a senseless preoccupation, and any logical, decent person should not give it a second thought.\n\nIn the context of race relations, the author shares personal experiences, including his parents' immigration to the United States and his own political career in Louisiana. He notes that voters are more interested in a candidate's beliefs, values, and plans than their skin color.\n\nThe author acknowledges that while racism still exists, significant progress has been made in the half-century since Dr. King's speech. However, he also points out that the country has taken a step backward by emphasizing separateness rather than unity. The author suggests a return to the concept of the melting pot, where individuals from diverse backgrounds blend into a unified whole.\n\nThe author concludes by emphasizing the importance of treating people as individuals, regardless of their skin color, ethnicity, or heritage. He calls for an end to the focus on race in America, advocating for a society that values unity and individuality over separateness and hyphenated identities. The author's ultimate goal is a society where people are judged based on their character, not their skin color.",

Warren, a prominent figure among the progressive wing of the Democratic party, made the endorsement in an interview on MSNBC and in an endorsement article published by the Boston Globe on Thursday.\n\nDuring the MSNBC interview, Warren was asked by Rachel Maddow if she would accept a running mate position if offered by Clinton. Warren responded affirmatively, expressing her readiness to support Clinton's campaign and ensure her victory over Donald Trump.\n\nIn the Boston Globe article, Warren praised Clinton as a \"fighter\" who would keep Trump from reaching the White House. She also commended Clinton's primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, for running a powerful and impactful campaign that brought millions of people into the democratic process. Warren acknowledged the importance of Sanders' campaign, stating that it had \"thrust issues... near and dear to [her] heart... into the spotlight.\"\n\nWarren's endorsement follows President Barack Obama's formal endorsement of Clinton's candidacy and Vice-President Joe Biden's apparent endorsement, as indicated in a speech on Thursday. Warren's progressive stance and her popularity among the left could potentially help entice disaffected left-leaning voters who have been excited by Sanders but have been ambivalent about Clinton.\n\nIn a speech earlier on Thursday, Warren criticized Trump as a \"businessman who inherited a fortune and kept it rolling along by cheating people.\" She described Trump as a \"loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud who... serves no one but himself,\" and labeled his attacks on Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge presiding over the Trump University suit, as \"exactly what you would expect from somebody who is a thin-skinned racist bully.\"\n\nWarren's recent speeches have been characterized by a searing criticism of Trump, positioning her for a prominent and pugilistic role in the presidential election, whether she is on the ticket or not. As a constitutional law professor at Harvard, Warren's potential vice-presidential candidacy could offer a strong progressive voice and a sharp contrast to Trump's campaign.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Ruling on Arizona Immigration Law: A Potential Boon for Mitt Romney's Presidential Campaign?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Supreme Court's ruling on the Arizona immigration law, political strategists suggest that the decision could potentially benefit Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. The ruling, they argue, provides Romney an opportunity to highlight the Obama administration's perceived mishandling of illegal immigration.\n\nAnalysts suggest that Arizona's ongoing struggle to enforce its own immigration law could help reinforce the narrative that the federal government needs to step in with a more effective approach, an approach that Romney, who recently outlined his immigration plan, claims to offer.\n\nBrad Blakeman, former deputy assistant to President George W. Bush and a public policy professor at Georgetown University, stated, \"Romney should come out and say the president created a constitutional crisis on immigration.\" He further added, \"The Supreme Court basically said that federal law trumps state law, but the fact of the matter is federal law is not being enforced.\"\n\nBlakeman suggested that Romney should use the ruling to emphasize the need for a \"fair, just, and equitable comprehensive policy.\" He believes the ruling will help Romney's campaign, stating, \"I think it\u2019s going to help him. But Romney has got to tell the American people that this president created a constitutional crisis when he should\u2019ve been leading to avoid one with both houses of Congress.\"\n\nPresident Obama, on the other hand, argues that Republicans have persistently blocked reforms to the immigration system. In a recent address to Latino officials in Florida, the president stated, \"politics\" got in the way of passing the DREAM Act. Obama has since instituted a similar policy administratively.\n\nOther political strategists suggest that the ruling will give Romney an opportunity to appeal to his supporters but that it is unlikely to be a key issue in the general election. Don Fowler, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, stated, \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get him any net advantage. The electoral impact of this is going to be relatively minor.\"\n\nBen Golnik, a Republican strategist based in Minnesota, stated, \"It gives him an opportunity to clearly spell out his views on immigration and what kind of reforms he sees necessary.\" He further added, \"It\u2019ll be an issue for those who have immigration at the top of their list, but the reality is it\u2019s mostly about the economy.\"\n\nIn a statement issued after Monday's ruling, Romney appeared to follow the strategists' advice. He stated, \"President Obama has failed to provide any leadership on immigration. This represents yet another broken promise by this President.\" He further added, \"I believe that each state has the duty \u2014 and the right \u2014 to secure our borders and preserve the rule of law, particularly when the federal government has failed to meet its responsibilities.\"\n\nObama, in response, stated that the decision \"makes unmistakably\" clear that Congress must act on comprehensive immigration reform. He also expressed concern about the practical impact of the remaining provision of the Arizona law that requires local law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of anyone they suspect may be in the country illegally.\n\nMonday's decision upheld one provision of Arizona's law\u2014requiring law enforcement to check immigration status during routine stops for those they suspect may be in the country illegally. However, the ruling struck down three other provisions, one of which allowed Arizona's law enforcement to arrest those they think might be guilty of a deportable offense.\n\nOther analysts contacted by FoxNews.com, including former South Carolina GOP chairman Van Hipp, Jr., suggested that Romney should now focus on the national security aspects of securing the border. Hipp stated, \"Romney needs to remind American people why he supports securing our southern border.\" He further added, \"His campaign has to keep his message focused on national security. He has early on, but now more than ever, it brings immigration to the forefront so it\u2019s incumbent upon Romney to get out in front of thing and not allow it to be buried in the weeds.\"",
    " Title: Shifting Landscape of Gay Marriage Support in the United States: A Look at the Republican Party\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the US Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments in two landmark gay marriage cases this week, the political landscape on this contentious social issue is rapidly evolving. Recent headlines reflect this shift: \"Support for Gay Marriage is Soaring\" (Washington Post), \"Why Republicans Are Saying 'I Do' to Gay Marriage\" (Time), \"The Normalization of Gay Marriage\" (The Atlantic), \"Millennial Support For Gay Marriage Hits All-Time High\" (Huffington Post).\n\nThe changing tide of public opinion, as depicted in these stories, poses particular challenges for the Republican Party.\n\nIn response to the issue, Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, who recently declared his support for same-sex marriage due to his son's homosexuality, has faced a mixed response from fellow Republicans. While they have expressed personal support for him, they have also disagreed with his stance.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who is up for re-election this year and is considered a strong contender for the 2016 presidential race, has grappled with the issue of so-called \"conversion therapy,\" a controversial practice aimed at changing homosexual individuals into heterosexuals.\n\n\"I'm of two minds just on this stuff in general,\" Gov. Christie said at a news conference last week. \"No. 1, I think there should be lots of deference given to parents on raising their children.\" He further expressed skepticism towards bills that restrict parents' ability to make decisions regarding their children's care, but acknowledged that exceptions could be made.\n\nOhio Governor John Kasich initially expressed support for civil unions, but later retracted his statement through a spokesperson.\n\nSen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia attempted to sidestep the issue with a humorous remark that drew laughter: \"I'm not gay, so I'm not going to marry one.\"\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, has leaned on his libertarian/states' rights ideology. \"I don't want the government promoting something I don't believe in, but I also don't mind if the government tries to be neutral on the issue,\" he told Fox News Sunday, which would imply that the Defense of Marriage Act (one of the Supreme Court cases) would no longer apply.\n\nKen Mehlman, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and head of the 2004 Bush re-election campaign who came out as gay in 2010, has gathered signatures from 131 prominent Republicans to file a friend-of-the-court brief in the other case before the Supreme Court, challenging California's Proposition 8, a 2008 ballot measure that defines marriage as a legal union of one man and one woman.\n\nWhen asked on Fox News Sunday if he could imagine the next Republican nominee for the White House supporting gay marriage, political strategist Karl Rove responded affirmatively. Margaret Hoover, a former George W. Bush White House aide and leading Republican Party operative, agrees.\n\n\"At the rate this issue is changing within the party, I think it's not out of the question,\" Hoover told Time.\n\nAccording to polls, the issue is changing more rapidly with the public than with the GOP. The latest Washington Post/ABC poll shows that 58% of Americans support allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry, compared to 32% in 2003 and 47% in 2010. Meanwhile, support among \"millennials\" (those born after 1980) has soared to 70% from 51% when President Obama took office in 2009. The Post/ABC poll also finds that 81% of adults under 30 support same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Republican Party is well aware of this shift, having lost this segment of the electorate in the 2012 presidential election, when the party platform advocated a marriage amendment to the Constitution and defended the Boy Scouts of America's ban on gay scouts and troop leaders.\n\nToday, the party's efforts to rebrand itself assume a softer tone regarding gay rights as part of an overall effort to appear (if not become) more inclusive. At the Conservative Political Action Conference last weekend, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, another potential 2016 presidential candidate, criticized his party for appearing \"anti-everything,\" including \"anti-gay.\"\n\nRepublican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus took a similar stance in comments to reporters this past week.\n\n\"I think Senator Portman made some pretty big inroads last week,\" Mr. Priebus said. \"I think it's about being decent. I think it's about dignity and respect, that nobody deserves to have their dignity diminished, or people don't deserve to be disrespected. I think that there isn't anyone in this room \u2013 Republican, Democrat, in the middle \u2013 that doesn't think that Rob Portman, for example, is a good, conservative Republican. He is. And we know that.\"",
    " Title: Fact-Checking President Trump's Claim on Fauci's Views on China Travel Ban\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News Business, President Trump asserted that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, disagreed with his decision to restrict travel from China and later agreed that the move saved hundreds of thousands of lives. However, this claim contradicts the statements made by both Trump and Fauci in the past.\n\nDuring the April 13 coronavirus task force press briefing, Trump stated that he and Fauci were \"on the same page\" from the beginning. At the same press briefing, Fauci discussed the responsiveness of the Trump administration to the recommendations made by the task force, including the travel restrictions with China.\n\nIn the early stages of the pandemic, Fauci reportedly did not consider a China travel ban, according to interviews with White House aides and Fauci himself in the New York Times. However, by January 30, leading public health officials in the federal government were recommending travel restrictions with China to President Trump. Aides also told the Wall Street Journal that Fauci, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar convinced the initially-skeptical Trump to make the decision.\n\nFauci supported the travel restrictions publicly as well. At the task force press briefing on the day the restrictions were announced, Fauci said that the restrictions were implemented to \"mitigate, as best as we possibly can, this risk.\" On February 3, the day after the restrictions took effect, Fauci stated on CNBC that the travel restrictions would \"dampen down\" coronavirus cases in the United States.\n\nFauci also repeated the value of the travel restrictions during the February 29 coronavirus task force press briefing, stating that without the travel restrictions, the United States would have had \"many, many more cases\" to deal with. It is important to note that the travel restrictions did not prevent all travel from China; they merely restricted it.\n\nFurthermore, Fauci consistently agreed with the travel decision. On March 15, he stated that the president's decision to restrict travel from China had an effect on the spread of the virus in the United States, comparing it to Italy's situation. On March 22, Fauci said the United States was \"not necessarily on the same trajectory\" for coronavirus cases as Italy, citing Italy's decision not to \"shut out as well the input of infections that originated in China\" early on as a possible reason for the country's high number of cases.\n\nBased on all available information, Trump's claim that Fauci criticized the president's decision to restrict travel with China is not accurate. In fact, Fauci was an early advocate for such restrictions in internal government coronavirus discussions.",
    " Title: Grand Jury Impaneled in Mueller Investigation: A Routine Procedure or Sign of Intensifying Inquiry?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that special counsel Robert Mueller has impaneled a grand jury in Washington, D.C. This development, according to the Journal, signals a growing intensity in Mueller's investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nHowever, as a seasoned Justice Department reporter, I can attest that the convening of a grand jury is a common practice for prosecutors. Grand juries are routinely used to question witnesses and gather evidence. The surprise would have been if Mueller had not utilized this tool in his investigation.\n\nIn fact, as the Journal article notes, a grand jury was already in place, across the river in Alexandria, that the FBI was using in this case before Mueller was appointed. The association of \"grand jury\" with \"indictment\" in the public mind may lead to the assumption that the former FBI director could be preparing to indict the president and his inner circle. However, it's important to note that neither Mueller nor we, the public, have any way of knowing whether the evidence gathered will ultimately lead to indictments.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that the grand jury's existence is a sign that investigators continue to aggressively gather evidence in the case. USA Today adds that the move gives Mueller, a former FBI director, enormous power to subpoena documents and compel witnesses to testify under oath.\n\nTy Cobb, the president's lawyer, told the Post that he was unaware of the development but welcomed it if it could accelerate the resolution of Mueller's work. This is significant, as grand jury proceedings are meant to be secret.\n\nHowever, the leak of this information, like many other aspects of this White House, has sparked an orgy of media speculation. It's worth noting that this is not the first time the Washington Post has published sensitive information, having previously published the transcripts of President Trump's January calls to the leaders of Mexico and Australia, following earlier leaks of those conversations.\n\nWhile the grand jury could potentially pose a serious threat to the White House, its existence at this stage primarily fuels media speculation. The grand jury's role and the evidence it gathers will likely become more significant as the investigation progresses. For now, we can only wait and see.",
    " Title: Journalist Ian Millhiser Challenges The Weekly Standard's Fact-Checking Decision on Brett Kavanaugh and Roe v. Wade\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, Ian Millhiser, justice editor at ThinkProgress, has expressed his discontent with The Weekly Standard, a right-leaning magazine, for labeling one of his articles as \"false.\" The article in question, titled \"Brett Kavanaugh said he would kill Roe v. Wade last week and almost no one noticed,\" is under scrutiny for its headline's alleged misleading nature.\n\nThinkProgress, a left-leaning news site, has previously voiced concerns about Facebook granting fact-checking powers to an explicitly conservative media outlet, a privilege shared by only four other organizations: the Associated Press, Factcheck.org, Politifact, and Snopes.com. Articles tagged as false could potentially lose \"80 percent of future traffic,\" according to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, making the stakes high for media organizations. Millhiser notes that at its peak, Facebook provided as much as 40 percent of ThinkProgress's traffic, and while the social media giant has altered its algorithm, it still accounts for between 10 to 15 percent of the site's readers.\n\nThe crux of the issue lies in the headline's claim that Kavanaugh stated he would overturn Roe v. Wade. Millhiser's article presents a more nuanced argument, as he summarizes it in a follow-up post:\n\nKavanaugh, during his confirmation hearing, cited the \"Glucksberg test\" \u2013 a reference to Washington v. Glucksberg, a 1997 Supreme Court decision that established the Constitution does not protect a right to physician-assisted suicide. Under the Glucksberg test, courts should determine which rights are protected by the Constitution by asking which rights are \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.\" Kavanaugh also stated in 2017 that \"even a first-year law student could tell you that the Glucksberg's approach to unenumerated rights was not consistent with the approach of the abortion cases such as Roe vs. Wade in 1973, as well as the 1992 decision reaffirming Roe, known as Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\"\n\nMillhiser's article also cites law professors Jim Oleske and Jamal Greene, who reached similar conclusions regarding Kavanaugh's embrace of the Glucksberg test.\n\nThe question remains: Does this information imply that Kavanaugh would be inclined to overturn Roe v. Wade? A reasonable person might infer that this is so. The article concludes with this statement: \"Judge Kavanaugh appears to be telegraphing his belief that Roe, Obergefell, and the Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas, which provides that the government can not prosecute consenting adults for having sex, were not correctly decided.\"\n\nIf the headline had said that Kavanaugh \"appeared to be telegraphing,\" or \"hinted at,\" or even \"heavily suggested\" he would overturn Roe v. Wade, that would be one thing. But \"said\" is a strong word. It makes it sound like Kavanaugh directly stated his intention to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nIn his follow-up, Millhiser concludes that this all hinges on the definition of the verb \"said.\" He turns to the dictionary, which does indeed list \"indicate, show, and communicate\" as possible definitions for the word. However, \"said\" is generally used as a synonym for indicate, show, and communicate when the subject of the sentence is a thing that cannot use words. A look in your eyes can \"say\" a great deal, but not literally \u2013 a \"look\" does not use words. People, on the other hand, do use words, so when writers describe a person as having said something, it's implied that they did so with their mouths.\n\nThis may seem like nitpicking, but we're in the midst of an intense news cycle revolving around the question of whether Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. A headline that straightforwardly claims he admitted he would do so is manipulating readers' expectations, and thus the claim should have been hedged in the headline \u2013 even just a little bit \u2013 as it was in the article. If the claim is The Weekly Standard was wrong to say this headline is false, then I rate this claim: Mostly false.",
    " Title: NRA Warns of Intensified Threat to Second Amendment Rights at Annual Meeting\n\nArticle:\n\nAt the National Rifle Association's (NRA) annual meeting in Houston on Saturday, leaders of the gun rights organization issued a stern warning to its members, stating that President Barack Obama and gun control advocates are determined to restrict their rights.\n\nIn a series of impassioned speeches, NRA leaders predicted that liberal forces would exploit future shooting tragedies to push for stricter gun control measures beyond what has been debated since the December shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n\nJim Porter, who is set to become the group's president on Monday, asserted, \"Revenge is what is motivating the president's unremitting challenge to gun owners today. Obama is meeting and plotting with the who's who of the gun ban movement.\"\n\nWayne LaPierre, the NRA's chief executive, described the Senate's recent vote to block background check legislation as \"but one skirmish in what can only be defined as one long war against our Constitutional rights.\" He emphasized that the group is \"in the midst of a once in a generation fight for everything we care about.\"\n\nLaPierre also announced that the NRA has grown to a record 5 million members in the wake of the post-Newtown battle. He declared, \"So we don't care if it is round one, round two or round 15, the NRA will go the distance. We will never give up or sacrifice our constitutional freedom. Not one single inch!\"\n\nChris Cox, the group's chief lobbyist, quoted an old Margaret Thatcher line, stating, \"We are stronger right now than at any time in our 142-year history, but the fact is we have to be stronger because right now our freedom is under attack like never before.\"\n\nLaPierre concluded his speech by stating, \"We will never surrender our guns. Never. By the time we're finished, the NRA must and will be 10 million strong.\" The NRA leaders' warnings serve as a call to action for its members, emphasizing the importance of maintaining their Second Amendment rights in the face of perceived threats.",
    " Title: Federal Lawmakers Propose Enhanced Security Standards for U.S. Electric Grid Following California Substation Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to a significant incident of domestic terrorism involving the U.S. power grid, lawmakers are pushing for the imposition of federal standards to protect the country's electric grid from potential attacks. The call for action comes after a report detailing a sniper assault on a California electrical substation last year, which has raised concerns about the grid's vulnerability to terrorism.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has announced plans, along with her fellow senators, to request the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish minimum security standards for critical substations. The FERC, which oversees the electric grid's reliability, would be responsible for setting these standards.\n\nThe attack on Pacific Gas & Electric\u2019s Metcalf transmission substation in April 2013 involved the severing of AT&T fiber-optic lines to disrupt phone and 911 service, and gunfire into a PG&E substation, causing outages. The incident, which had not been widely publicized until a report by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, involved intruders lifting manhole covers, cutting fiber-optic cables, and firing over 100 rounds into substation equipment, disabling 17 of 20 large transformers, causing approximately $16 million in damage. No arrests have been made in the case.\n\nDuring an oversight hearing in December, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) described the incident as an \"unprecedented and sophisticated attack on an electric grid substation with military-style weapons.\" He added that communications were disrupted, and the attack inflicted substantial damage.\n\nCongress is currently discussing a proposal that would grant the FERC the power to write and impose interim rules on grid defenses. The utility industry would still have the ability to influence any permanent requirements, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nRep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) stated, \"The last thing I want to do is regulate any industry,\" but added that utilities must take steps to protect the grid for the sake of national security. Under current law, the commission has to accept or reject proposals written by an industry-dominated group, but cannot alter them, according to the report.\n\nSome utility industry executives told The Wall Street Journal that it would be challenging to create rules for improving security that would be effective in both urban and rural areas. Lisa Barton, executive vice president of transmission for American Electric Power, noted, \"One size fits all may not get you true resiliency.\" She added that increasing protections could be costly, but emphasized that it might be worth the investment.",
    " Title: White House Summons Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for Meeting Amidst Russia Investigation Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has added fuel to the ongoing political drama, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was summoned to the White House for a meeting with President Donald Trump on Thursday. The meeting comes amidst recent calls from some of Trump's supporters for Rosenstein's ouster over his role in the expanding Russia investigation.\n\nRosenstein, who is Attorney General Jeff Sessions' deputy and was appointed by Trump, was spotted leaving the West Wing on Thursday afternoon. However, a White House official downplayed the meeting's significance, stating, \"Rod Rosenstein met with the president at the White House regarding routine department business.\"\n\nThe meeting, though, seemed to have been arranged quickly. Rosenstein had been scheduled to introduce Sessions during an afternoon event at the Justice Department. But the emcee of that event announced that Rosenstein had been \"called away on another matter.\"\n\nJustice Department officials said Rosenstein was at the White House for about an hour. He was accompanied by FBI officials and discussed document production to Congress, they said. Rosenstein also met with White House Counsel Don McGahn.\n\nThe meeting takes place at a sensitive time for Rosenstein. Trump, outraged over the FBI's raid of personal lawyer Michael Cohen's office this week, has been publicly venting his frustration with Rosenstein, Sessions, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nTrump's attack on Rosenstein is in reference to how the deputy attorney general signed a FISA surveillance warrant for former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The president has repeatedly decried the DOJ and FBI's efforts to obtain that surveillance warrant.\n\nTrump has long been public about his frustration with how Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation, setting in motion the series of events that led Rosenstein to appoint Mueller as special counsel.\n\nSome Trump supporters have been urging him to get rid of Rosenstein. Former federal prosecutor Joseph diGenova told Fox News' \"Hannity\" on Wednesday, \"Rod Rosenstein is so incompetent, compromised, and conflicted that he can no longer serve as the deputy attorney general.\"\n\nHowever, despite this pressure, Trump on Thursday tweeted that he agrees with his legal team in cooperating with Mueller's probe. \"I have agreed with the historically cooperative, disciplined approach that we have engaged in with Robert Mueller (Unlike the Clintons!),\" the president tweeted Thursday.\n\nOther supporters, including former adviser Stephen Bannon, have publicly encouraged Trump to stop cooperating with Mueller's requests. \"The president wasn't fully briefed by his lawyers on the implications of not invoking executive privilege,\" Bannon told The Washington Post. \"It was a strategic mistake to turn over everything without due process, and executive privilege should be exerted immediately and retroactively.\"\n\nEarlier Thursday, Trump denied seeking to shut down Mueller's Russia probe, saying he would have fired the special counsel months ago if he'd wanted him gone. \"If I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December, as reported by the Failing New York Times, I would have fired him,\" the president tweeted. \"Just more Fake News from a biased newspaper!\"",
    " Title: Experts and Political Divide: Balancing Public Health and Protests Amidst COVID-19 Resurgence\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the nation grapples with a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in several states, a heated debate has emerged between political factions regarding the reopening of the economy and the potential risks associated with ongoing protests.\n\nAccording to recent reports, new hotspots have emerged in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. While some of this spike in cases can be attributed to increased testing, the positive test rate is also on the rise, up from less than 8% at the end of May to nearly 14% currently. Concerns are mounting as these areas, which have recently reopened businesses and public spaces, are seeing a surge in COVID-19 cases.\n\nThe ongoing nationwide protests sparked by the death of George Floyd and issues of police violence and systemic racism have also raised concerns about potential superspreading events. However, experts caution that it is too early to definitively determine whether the protests are contributing to the spread of the virus. Outdoor exposure, unlike indoor exposure, is less risky, and it may be that arrests and detainment in police vans or jail cells are the primary sources of infection, rather than the protests themselves.\n\nThe debate surrounding the protests and their impact on the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a contentious discussion. Some argue that the protests, if they lead to a significant increase in infections and deaths, would call into question the endorsement of these events by public health experts. On the other hand, proponents of the protests argue that the demonstrators are well aware of the risks and are taking necessary precautions.\n\nIn an effort to minimize risk, many experts and public health officials have adopted a harm-reduction approach, offering recommendations for safe protesting and providing protective gear on-site. This approach reflects the longstanding goal of public health experts to maximize the health of the population across all aspects of life.\n\nAs Jeff Shaman, an infectious disease modeler at Columbia University, noted, the initial lockdown period was intended to avoid the worst possible scenario, but the U.S. did not use that time to prepare for managing the pandemic effectively. The weeks that have passed since reopening have been squandered, and the nation is now grappling with both a resurgence in COVID-19 cases and the economic fallout of the lockdown.\n\nIn conclusion, the ongoing debate between political factions and the balancing act between public health and protests is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. The nation must strive to protect public health while also addressing pressing social and political concerns.",
    " Title: House Immigration Reform Gains Momentum as Bipartisan Group Nears Bill Release and Speaker Boehner Meets with Congressional Hispanic Caucus\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House of Representatives is set to take a significant step forward in the immigration reform debate this week, as a bipartisan group of lawmakers nears the release of a bill and Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) is scheduled to meet with the all-Democratic Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\nThe bipartisan group, which has been working for four years without producing any legislation, is on the verge of unveiling a bill that focuses on enforcement measures. The House Judiciary Committee will hold its first immigration markup on Tuesday on this enforcement-centered bill, a move that Democrats have expressed disapproval of.\n\nSpeaker Boehner and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), head of the CHC immigration task force, are aiming to collaborate and finalize a comprehensive immigration reform deal this week. \"He's the speaker of the House, the leader of the House and of the Republican Conference,\" Gutierrez said in an interview on Monday. \"He wants to get comprehensive immigration reform; we want to get comprehensive immigration reform passed. We should form a pact. Let's cement it this Wednesday.\"\n\nThe dual-track approach, with the Senate considering the bipartisan Gang of Eight bill and the House working on its own legislation, could signal a renewed momentum in the House's immigration reform efforts, which have lagged behind the Senate's progress so far. The Senate may vote on the Gang of Eight bill before the July 4th recess.\n\nThe House group, now composed of three Republicans and four Democrats, appears poised to release its bill as early as Wednesday, although a later release in the week or early next week is also possible. Negotiators are still meeting to finalize the language and make any necessary adjustments.\n\nThe Democratic members of the group will update all House Democrats at a caucus meeting on Tuesday and will hold smaller briefings with different members throughout the week, including meetings with the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus on Tuesday, and New Democrats and the Congressional Progressive Caucus on Wednesday.\n\n\"Democratic members are seeking input from their caucus on the bipartisan agreement the working group is drafting into legislative language,\" a Democratic aide said. \"It's their hope that once all the i's are dotted and the t's are crossed, they will be able to introduce the measure with support from both sides of the aisle.\"\n\nThe focus this week will be on the meeting between Boehner and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, marking the first time a Republican House speaker has met with the group. This meeting is expected to provide insight into the direction of the House's immigration reform efforts and the potential for bipartisan cooperation.",
    " Title: White House Warns of Potential $200 Billion Consumer Spending Drop in 2013 Due to Failed Middle-Class Tax Cut Extension\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a strategic move timed for the peak shopping season, the White House has issued a warning to Republican lawmakers, stating that consumer spending could decrease by approximately $200 billion in 2013 if Congress fails to extend tax cuts for the middle class by the end of next month. The warning was accompanied by a report from the National Economic Council and the Council of Economic Advisers, which analyzed the impact on retailers if taxes increase for families earning less than $250,000 per year as of January 1, 2013.\n\nThe report, released on Cyber Monday, the busiest online shopping day of the year, suggests that allowing middle-class tax rates to rise and failing to address the Alternative Minimum Tax could result in a 1.7 percentage point decrease in the growth of consumer spending in 2013. This potential decrease in spending is nearly four times the amount spent during the \"Black Friday\" weekend in 2011.\n\nThe White House emphasized the need for bipartisan cooperation to renew middle-class tax cuts, stating, \"The president believes Democrats and Republicans should come together to renew middle-class tax cuts so families and businesses have more certainty at this critical time for our economy.\"\n\nThe administration's move appears to be a calculated effort to build support for President Obama's position in negotiations with Congress to avoid the so-called \"fiscal cliff,\" a combination of tax increases and automatic spending cuts set to take effect in January. The president is urging lawmakers to first approve an extension of tax cuts for the middle class and to address tax rates for wealthier families later, which could result in an automatic tax increase for households earning more than $250,000 on January 1.\n\nIn a statement, the office of White House press secretary Jay Carney said, \"While the president is committed to working with Congress to reach compromises on areas of disagreement, there is no reason to delay acting where everyone agrees: extending tax cuts for the middle-class.\" Carney added, \"There is no reason to hold the middle-class hostage while we debate tax cuts for the highest income earners.\"\n\nLawmakers from both parties have expressed optimism about reaching a deal with the White House before the end of the year. Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona stated on CNN, \"I think it's likely that there will be a solution \u2014 not a final solution by any means, and not a big solution \u2014 but will get us through the end of the year into next year with a plan for trying to deal with these issues long-term over the course of the next Congress.\" Kyl added, \"That will require compromise.\"",
    " Title: The Debate Over Enemy Combatant Status for Domestic Terror Suspects: A Look at the Case of Mr. Tsarnaev and the Legal Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing, the question of whether the U.S. government can hold citizens arrested on domestic soil as enemy combatants has resurfaced. While some, like Senator Lindsey Graham, believe it to be lawful, others disagree. The Constitution's permissibility in such cases remains unclear, as neither Congress nor the Supreme Court has definitively addressed the issue.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling on the indefinite military detention of Yaser Esam Hamdi, an American citizen captured on the Afghanistan battlefield, during the Bush administration, offers some insight. However, the court never resolved the case of Jose Padilla, another American held as an enemy combatant for several years following his arrest in Chicago. The Bush administration transferred Mr. Padilla back to the civilian court system before the Supreme Court took up the case, with two federal appeals courts disagreeing on the legality of indefinite detention without trial.\n\nIn the Hamdi ruling, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that there is no bar to the U.S. holding one of its own citizens as an enemy combatant. However, she also limited the decision to Mr. Hamdi's \"narrow circumstances\" and stated that indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not authorized.\n\nSenator Graham advocates for holding Mr. Tsarnaev as a military detainee to question him without a lawyer, citing the potential for lengthy interrogations without the interruption of a lawyer. The Obama administration has stated it would use a public-safety exception to the Miranda rule, but Graham argues this would only provide a few days before a lawyer intervened.\n\nGraham also emphasizes that any interrogation as an enemy combatant would not involve inflicting suffering to make Mr. Tsarnaev talk, and that any information obtained would not be admissible as courtroom evidence. He contends that the Federal Bureau of Investigation might not be as effective as intelligence officials in persuading Mr. Tsarnaev to provide information, even with a defense lawyer present, due to the potential for leverage in a plea bargain.\n\nHowever, Graham's stance faces opposition, with some arguing that the FBI would be equally or more effective in obtaining information. Ultimately, Mr. Tsarnaev must be transferred back to the civilian criminal justice system for prosecution, as the statute authorizing military commissions does not apply to U.S. citizens. The debate over the legality and effectiveness of holding domestic terror suspects as enemy combatants continues to be a contentious issue in the U.S. legal system.",
    " Title: Biden Rallies in Detroit Ahead of Michigan Primary, Aims to Unite America\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final days before Michigan's presidential primary, former Vice President Joe Biden made a stop in Detroit on Monday, rallying supporters, volunteers, and campaign donors. Addressing a crowd of approximately 1,000 people at Renaissance High School, Biden emphasized the importance of Michigan in the upcoming November election, stating, \"Michigan, I\u2019m counting on you in a big way.\"\n\nBiden, who has garnered significant support from the African American community, was joined by U.S. Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey at the rally. The choice to bring his former rivals to a city where 82% of residents are African American was a clear nod to his strong backing in this demographic, particularly in South Carolina on February 29, where a landslide victory helped rejuvenate his campaign and secure 10 of the 14 states voting on Super Tuesday.\n\nNot all attendees were supporters, however. About a dozen protesters carrying Green New Deal signs disrupted the rally, chanting, \"Joe has to go.\" They were peacefully escorted out of the gymnasium.\n\nLt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, who is supporting Biden, received some boos from the crowd when he took a swipe at Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign.\n\nBiden emphasized the significance of the election, stating, \"This election isn\u2019t about a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party, it\u2019s a battle for the soul of America.\" He reminded the crowd of the $2.5 billion investment the Obama administration made to help restore the Great Lakes and highlighted his experience and track record as key factors in his campaign.\n\nBefore the rally, Biden attended a $1,000-per-person fundraiser at the Detroit Athletic Club, hosted by some of Michigan's most prominent political figures.\n\nBiden's rally at Renaissance High School was the largest event of the day, featuring a lively crowd, a marching band, and signs bearing slogans such as \"Joementum\" and \"Michiganders love Biden!\" Despite his late entry into the state and minimal ground organization, polls released on Monday showed Biden with a significant lead over his competitors. However, Sanders was in a similar position in 2016, down by 26 points to Hillary Clinton before the primary and ultimately securing a narrow victory.\n\nIn Grand Rapids, Biden spoke at the Cherry Health Heart of the City Community Health Center to a small audience of media and Cherry Health officials. He discussed the expansion of community health centers under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, and expressed his intention to build on this progress in the White House. Biden also noted the challenges of implementing Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan, stating, \"His Medicare for All push would be a long and expensive slog, if we can get it done at all.\"\n\nBiden is scheduled to travel to Columbus, Ohio, on Tuesday, while his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, will wrap up the campaign in Michigan with visits to Lansing and Flint on Tuesday.",
    " Title: The Media's Opportunity to Regain Trust: A Look at the Election of Donald Trump and the State of the News Industry\n\nArticle:\n\nThe election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States has presented the media with a unique opportunity to regain the trust of the American public, a demographic that has shown a significant lack of faith in the news industry. According to a Gallup poll from last September, only 14% of Americans have \"a great deal\" of trust in the media to report the news fully, accurately, and fairly. Combining this with the 18% who have \"a fair amount\" of trust, only a third of the country's trust lies with the media.\n\nGiven the often negative and petty coverage of President Trump during the campaign, it is no surprise that much of this distrust comes from his 63 million voters. The media's chance to re-gain these disenchanted readers and viewers lies in treating Donald Trump the same way they treated Barack Obama when he became president in 2008. Remember the special commemorative issues, the broadcast network specials, and the tributes that marked the historic election of the first black president?\n\nInstead of celebrating another historic occasion \u2013 the election of the first truly outsider president \u2013 news organizations have gone out of their way to continue being mean and petty. For example, a week after Trump's election, the New York Times led a chorus of news outlets that reported the Trump transition team was in chaos, after Vice President Mike Pence took the reins from Governor Chris Christie. However, the transition went smoothly, and Trump appointed a Cabinet of competent men and women.\n\nMeanwhile, there is chaos at the New York Times, where layoffs have begun, and management is moving sections of the staff from the New York Times Building, as the newspaper plans to rent out another eight stories of the building to outsiders, as it seeks to offset the loss of ad revenue.\n\nThe misreporting of the transition team's chaos was only the first of many lost opportunities to reach out to disenchanted readers and viewers. Major media outlets are based on the liberal fringes of a conservative nation \u2013 Washington, New York, and Los Angeles \u2013 and are staffed by people who either never lived in the nation's interior or who fled because they did not like the place where they grew up.\n\nLast summer, the Columbia Journalism Review published a column urging reporters to abandon even the pretense of objectivity to stop Trump. David Mindich, in a July 15 column, wrote, \"The declining audience for traditional news is well documented and creates twin pressures... Second, networks can not replicate the influence that Murrow, Cronkite, and others had\u2014on Election Day (November 8), we will be eager for signs to see if today's journalists pushing back against Trump actually stop him.\"\n\nOf the newspapers that endorsed in the election, 243 went for Hillary Clinton, and 20 went for Trump. If newspapers had any influence, it would have been a 50-state shutout for her. Instead, it was a 30-state sweep for him.\n\nRather than give wise counsel to the profession on restoring its integrity, Columbia Journalism Review editor Kyle Pope urged the news media to double down on the stupid. Pope published an open letter to the president on January 17 to protest Trump's plan to treat the media as poorly in his presidency as the media treated him in the election.\n\nPope should have told reporters to knock off the anti-Trump tweets, to stop looking for trouble where there is none, and to start playing the game straight. For until news organizations do, they will be laying off workers and trying to rent out more office space to make ends meet. Don Surber, a retired newsman who lives in Poca, West Virginia, and is the author of \"Trump the Press,\" which covered the 2016 Republican nomination process, offers this advice. In February, he will publish its sequel, \"Trump the Establishment,\" which covers the general election.",
    " Title: White House Hosts Social Media Summit: Trump Accuses Tech Firms of Suppressing Conservative Voices\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump welcomed a group of prominent conservative social media personalities to the White House on Thursday, accusing big tech firms of suppressing conservative voices and vowing to look for regulations and legislation to protect free speech.\n\nTrump, who has long claimed that online platforms employ tactics to silence conservative voices, said he would summon major social media firms to the White House for talks in coming weeks. He did not provide details on the measures being discussed.\n\n\"We're not going to be silenced,\" Trump said, complaining about fluctuations in the number of his Twitter followers. \"Big tech must not censor the voices.\"\n\nThe event, dubbed the \"Social Media Summit,\" brought together dozens of pro-Trump online personalities, who discussed what they say is censorship on social media platforms. The gathering included several members of Trump's cabinet and his White House team, as well as his son Donald Trump Jr.\n\nIn freewheeling remarks, Trump talked about the power of social media and railed against the traditional media standing at the back of the room. \"We hardly do press releases anymore,\" Trump said. \"If I put it out on social media, it's like an explosion.\"\n\nTrump acknowledged criticism about the online behavior of some conservative users of social media. \"Some of you guys are out there - but even you should have a voice,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump more than once has threatened retaliatory action related to free speech. In March, he signed an executive order requiring U.S. colleges and universities to maintain \"free speech\" on campus if they want to continue receiving federal research funds. Last September, he suggested that the license of television network NBC could be challenged over its news reporting.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, a Democrat, criticized the event, saying, \"Instead of focusing on combating Russian social media misinformation, punishing anti-competitive practices, or protecting Americans' data and privacy, the president has invited trolls, conspiracy theorists, anti-Semites, and the whole comments section to the White House.\"\n\nFacebook Inc (FB.O), Twitter Inc, and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google declined to comment on Trump's announcement that he would bring them to the White House for a meeting. The Internet Association, a trade group representing major tech firms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, said, \"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect.\"\n\nRepublicans in Congress have held numerous hearings on the issue of alleged conservative bias on social media outlets. Republican Senator Josh Hawley, who is working on proposed legislation on the issue, took the stage briefly on Thursday to air his complaints. \"They've gotten rich off of their special privileges from government. They want to keep those, they shouldn't discriminate. They shouldn't censor,\" Hawley said.\n\nA Senate panel chaired by Republican Ted Cruz is set to hold a hearing titled \"Google and Censorship through Search Engines\" featuring Google's vice president of public policy, Karan Bhatia.",
    " Title: Pope Francis' Visit to North America: A Divisive Figure Amidst a Polarized America\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Pope Francis embarks on his first visit to the United States this month, the pontiff's approval ratings have seen a significant decline, according to Gallup, from 76% in 2014 to 59% currently. The Pope's message of compassion, care for the planet, and rejection of opulent living has elicited a range of emotions, from love and admiration to scorn and fear.\n\nOne extreme example of this polarization can be seen in an article with the headline, \"Why so Many People Think Pope Francis is the Antichrist.\" This headline appeared on Charisma News, and a quick Google search for \"pope antichrist\" yielded a multitude of hits, including claims that the Pope's visit was foretold by a Jesuit priest and that he is \"demonically inspired.\"\n\nWhile such claims may seem absurd, they highlight the deep-seated divisions that Pope Francis' message has stirred up in American society. The Pope's call to care for the poor and his criticism of unfettered capitalism have left many conservatives cold, particularly those who view him as a Marxist seeking to \"spread the wealth.\"\n\nR. Albert Mohler Jr., the president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, expressed concern over the Pope's words, stating that they are dangerous and could potentially split Roman Catholicism on the issue of poverty. Mohler also expressed displeasure with the fact that the Pope will address a joint session of Congress, viewing the Vatican as a diplomatic fiction and the Pope's visit as an attempt to exert influence over American politics.\n\nOn the other hand, the Pope's progressive supporters view him as a champion of their causes, such as climate change, immigration, and social justice. However, they are also frustrated by the Church's stance on issues like same-sex marriage, women priests, divorce, birth control, and abortion.\n\nThe Rev. Thomas Bohlin, vicar of Opus Dei, suggested that the Pope is not seeking to change Church doctrine but rather to shift the emphasis and the way people view religion. He believes that Francis wants to move away from left and right categories and instead encourage people to think deeply about their roles and responsibilities.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio echoed this sentiment, stating that the Pope is not concerned with popularity but rather with telling the truth. De Blasio also noted that the Pope's message resonates with people of all backgrounds, demonstrating the wide-ranging appeal of the Pope's message.\n\nIn conclusion, Pope Francis' visit to North America has sparked a range of reactions, from admiration to fear and everything in between. His refusal to be easily categorized and his emphasis on personal responsibility and care for the poor have made him a divisive figure in a polarized America. However, his message of truth and compassion has also resonated with many, transcending religious and political boundaries.",
    " Title: Pennsylvania Manhunt Concludes as Eric Frein Surrenders to Police\n\nArticle:\n\nAfter a 48-day manhunt in northeast Pennsylvania, the suspected cop killer Eric Frein, 31, was apprehended late Thursday at an abandoned Poconos airplane hangar. Frein, who had eluded capture in the thick, cave-strewn Pocono Mountain woods, was spotted by a team of US marshals assisting in the manhunt.\n\nThe self-styled survivalist and fantasy soldier, who was believed to be ready to go down fighting, instead surrendered quietly. He was clean-shaven and \"healthier than expected,\" police noted. A cut on his nose wasn't caused by police, they say. There were conflicting reports about whether Frein was armed at the moment of arrest.\n\nThe capture happened at the Birchwood Pocono Air Park in Tannersville, Pa., about 30 miles from Blooming Grove, where the shootings occurred. Frein was transported to the Pike County Correctional Facility from the barracks early this morning. He is scheduled to appear in court at 9 a.m. this morning.\n\nTroopers used the handcuffs of the slain officer, Cpl. Bryon Dickson, to manacle Frein. Police also used Mr. Dickson's cruiser to transport Frein to a cell at the Blooming Grove barracks, the same police safehouse he attacked near midnight on Sept. 12 before slipping away into the deep woods.\n\nThe fact that Frein was captured alive to stand trial highlighted the best of American justice, a local newspaper columnist noted. \"The news was a stinging rebuke to bar stool and Internet 'experts' who insisted the accused cop killer was long gone as state police, FBI, and ATF agents combed the woods of Monroe and Pike counties for 48 days,\" writes Scranton, Pa., Times-Tribune columnist Chris Kelly.\n\nProsecutors say they'll seek the death penalty amid a litany of murder and bomb-making charges. But even after finding parts of his diary, combing his Internet history, and plumbing his past, Frein's motives remain elusive, answerable perhaps only at his upcoming trial.\n\nSo far, police have only described Frein's alleged sniper attack as \"pure evil,\" partly for his cold-blooded remembrance of the shootings in a diary found by searchers. \"Got a shot around 11 p.m. and took it,\" Frein wrote, according to police.\n\nFrein had been a standout on his high school rifle team. His father, an Army officer, had said Frein \"doesn't miss.\" He had been jailed for 109 days in the mid-2000s for larceny stemming from a war-reenactment festival in New York. It's not known whether that incarceration forged what police have said is a deep-seated hatred of law enforcement.\n\nHe played organized war games using rifles that shoot rubber bullets. He dressed in a Serbian Army uniform and smoked Serbian cigarettes. His work history is patchy, and it was at his bedroom in his parents' house in Canadensis, Pa., where police found two pipe bombs he had constructed.\n\n\"I don't think that he is actually that well-versed in survival,\" Tom Brown, Jr., founder of the Tracker School in New Jersey, told the Monitor recently. \"He's going to make a mistake.\"\n\nPolice believe Frein had planned the attack and escape for years. They found hints that he'd searched the Internet for information about how to elude police. And for 48 days, he managed to do just that, partly because of extreme caution on the part of searchers.\n\n\"A tracker is torn between looking at tracks on the ground and worrying about someone dropping them at 300 yards or 500 yards,\" Mr. Brown said.\n\nIndeed, as Frein managed to stay just ahead of the manhunt, some civilian tracking experts noted that police manhunt methods had fallen short, and officials acknowledged that the combination of thick geography and concerns about another sniper attack on searchers had slowed the manhunt down.\n\nMeanwhile, the surrounding hill communities in part worried about Frein's ability to wreak more havoc even as residents griped about area lockdowns and school closings. The manhunt atmosphere created a sort of police state \"that raised important questions about law enforcement's authority to curtail the rights of innocent citizens,\" Mr. Kelly, the Scranton columnist, writes.\n\nThe shooting and manhunt also came in a year of anti-police protests in New York City and Ferguson, Mo., over cases where unarmed black men were killed by white police officers. Police fraternal organizations have been warning in recent years of an uptick in ambush assaults on law enforcement and courts.\n\nIn some cases, \"police are not making friends of [the people],\" so you have to expect that this sort of activity is going to occur and more people are going to disappear in the woods who have more [wilderness] training,\" says Shane Hobel, the founder of the Mountain Scout Survival School in New York's Hudson Valley.\n\nFrein had become a ghostly presence as he hovered at the periphery of daily life in the quiet Pennsylvania township where he grew up. When police had sighted him, he flickered away in the thicket. Mr. Hobel, the tracker, wondered if Frein perhaps really was \"on a beach somewhere.\" Police, however, say they never gave a thought to shutting down the manhunt, which was costing more than $1 million a week.\n\nAfter Frein's capture, local officials also made sure to tell everyone that Halloween was no longer canceled.",
    " Title: President Trump Refuses to Address Police Violence Against Black Americans, Defends Confederate Flag\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In an interview with CBS's Catherine Herridge on Tuesday, President Donald Trump refused to answer a question about police violence against Black people, instead pointing out that white people are also victims of police violence.\n\nWhen asked why Black Americans are still dying at the hands of law enforcement, Trump responded, \"And so are white people, so are white people.\" He continued, \"What a terrible question to ask. So are white people, more white people by the way, more white people.\"\n\nAccording to a Washington Post database tracking fatal police shootings in the United States, white people make up roughly half of the people shot and killed annually by police. However, the Census Bureau estimates that roughly 76 percent of the country is white while only 13 percent is Black. The Washington Post database shows that the rate at which Black people are shot and killed by law enforcement is twice as high as that of white people.\n\nDuring the interview, Trump also defended the Confederate flag, stating, \"It's freedom of speech.\" When asked if he would be comfortable with his supporters displaying the Confederate flag at political events, Trump replied, \"I'm comfortable with freedom of speech.\"\n\n\"I know people that like the Confederate flag and they're not thinking about slavery. I look at NASCAR, you go to NASCAR, you had those flags all over the place, they stopped it. I just think it's freedom of speech \u2014 whether it's Confederate flags, or Black Lives Matter, or anything else you want to talk about \u2014 it's freedom of speech,\" Trump said.\n\nNASCAR announced in June it would ban Confederate flags from its events after Darrell \"Bubba\" Wallace Jr., the only black driver in the racing association's top series, called for change in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd.\n\nTrump has been criticized for his insistence on protecting monuments that honor Confederate leaders who fought to protect slavery and uphold white supremacy. Trump went as far as to threaten to veto Congress's annual defense authorization bill if it contained language to rename U.S. military bases honoring Confederate commanders, such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Benning in Georgia, and Fort Hood in Texas.\n\nTrump signed an executive order at the end of June to protect federal monuments after statues memorializing the Confederacy and some of the nation's Founding Fathers were vandalized.",
    " Title: Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin Challenges Election Results, Alleges Voter Fraud in Gubernatorial Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin has expressed concerns over potential voter fraud in the state's gubernatorial election, as he trails his Democratic challenger, Attorney General Andy Beshear, by approximately 5,000 votes. Bevin's remarks came during a press conference on Wednesday, where he requested a recanvass of the results.\n\n\"There's more than a little bit of history of vote fraud in our state,\" Bevin told reporters, referring to Tuesday's election. He alleged \"thousands of absentee ballots that were illegally counted,\" \"voters incorrectly turned away,\" and malfunctioning voting machines, according to Politico.\n\nThe governor's claims come as he faces off against Beshear, who has claimed victory and dismissed Bevin's charges. The election night saw a strong performance by Republican candidates in Kentucky, with GOP candidates winning races for state attorney general, secretary of state, auditor, agriculture commissioner, and treasurer.\n\nThe nearly clean sweep by Republican candidates for Kentucky's top jobs followed President Trump's Monday night rally in support of the candidates, seemingly contradicting the mainstream-media narrative that the gubernatorial vote was a gauge of Trump's popularity rather than Bevin's.\n\nBevin stated, \"We're in the process of getting affidavits and other information that will help us to get a better understanding of what did or did not happen,\" according to the Associated Press. Kentucky's secretary of state, Alison Lundergan Grimes, has scheduled the recanvass for next Thursday.\n\nKentucky law does not mandate a recount, so if Bevin decides to pursue one, he would need a court's approval. Despite Bevin's refusal to concede, some prominent Kentucky Republicans, such as state Rep. Jason Nemes and Republican strategist Scott Jennings, have begun referring to Beshear as Kentucky's next governor.\n\nPresident Trump, in a Twitter message Wednesday, focused on his role in the Kentucky elections, stating, \"Our big Kentucky Rally on Monday night had a massive impact on all of the races. The increase in Governors race was at least 15 points, and maybe 20!\"\n\nTurnout in Kentucky was up by nearly 50 percent over the state's 2015 governor's race, increasing from 974,000 voters to more than 1.4 million. The number of voters Tuesday equaled turnout in Kentucky's 2014 race for U.S. Senate, rare for an election in an odd-numbered year.",
    " Title: North Carolina Joins 11 Other States in Requiring Voter ID, Sparking Controversy Over Voter Access\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy, North Carolina lawmakers have passed a measure requiring residents to present photo identification to vote, joining a handful of other states that have approved the controversial proposal. The Republican-dominated House approved the measure late Thursday night, with the state's Senate passing it a day earlier.\n\nThe new law, which aims to prevent voter fraud, will bring North Carolina in line with the majority of other states that already require voter ID. According to Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger, the measure \"restores confidence in our election process and ensures voters are who they say they are.\"\n\nHowever, critics argue that the law disproportionately affects poor, minority, and disabled voters. The American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina stated that the law \"attacks democracy at its core\" by making it harder for eligible voters to cast their ballots. The group also pointed out that provisions in the measure, such as eliminating same-day voter registration, shortening early voting, and eliminating state-mandated voter registration drives, will negatively impact young, elderly, and disabled voters.\n\nProponents of the bill argue that having a valid, government-issued photo identification is a reasonable, modern-day necessity to prevent voter fraud. A poll this year showed that more than 72% of North Carolina residents support requiring voters to show photo ID before casting their ballot, according to Berger.\n\nThe passage of the law comes after the Supreme Court's decision last month to halt the enforcement requirements of the Voting Rights Act. The high court's ruling essentially allows states to make adjustments to voting laws without \"preclearance\" from the federal government. This change could potentially make it easier for states to implement voter ID laws, as requests by Texas and Mississippi for clearance in their voter ID laws were pending with the federal government when the high court struck down Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder expressed displeasure with the change in the Voting Rights Act, stating that it \"served as a potent tool for addressing inequities in our election systems.\" Holder has directed the Justice Department to ask a Texas federal court to subject the state to a condition similar to preclearance rights, citing evidence of racial discrimination in the state. He also noted that the Justice Department will continue to monitor jurisdictions nationwide for changes that may hamper voting rights.\n\nStates that may wish to implement their voter ID laws may still face legal action under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, another part of the law that works to prevent discrimination. This could potentially lead to further legal battles over the implementation of voter ID laws in various states.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Clears Bridgegate Officials of Federal Charges, Raising Questions on Public Corruption and Political Favors\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court has ruled that the actions of officials involved in the Bridgegate scandal, realigning toll lanes for political purposes, do not constitute a federal crime under current law. The officials did not obtain any money or property, but instead used their governmental authority for corrupt and fraudulent reasons to make life difficult for the political opponents' constituents.\n\nThe ruling is a continuation of the Court's history of permitting public officials to engage in allegedly corrupt acts. In a similar case involving the former governor of Virginia, the Court vacated his conviction for giving out access to meetings in exchange for political donations. The Court accepted that such acts are part of the ordinary, if untoward, functioning of government.\n\nThe Court's decision in the Bridgegate case concludes that the defendants' conduct is not currently prohibited by federal criminal law. However, it remains unclear whether Congress could pass a law criminalizing such behavior. The Court has expressed significant constitutional concerns with the federal government's attempt to prosecute a government official for taking a bribe, viewing it as ordinary government conduct.\n\nThe decision comes at a time of heightened public concern over government corruption, particularly during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recent events have raised questions about the politicization of government responses, with allegations of federal officials using their positions to influence state responses based on political affiliation. The president's comments about withholding support from uncooperative governors and the Department of Justice's refusal to prosecute the president's former national security adviser for lying to the federal government and working for a foreign government are among the controversies that have arisen.\n\nThe ruling in the Bridgegate case underscores the ongoing debate about the role of money in politics and the potential for corruption in government. The Supreme Court's conservative justices have previously invalidated statutes designed to combat public corruption, citing the constitutional enshrinement of money in politics. The Citizens United and McCutcheon cases, which struck down limits on corporate campaign expenditures and aggregate limits on campaign contributions, respectively, are examples of this trend.\n\nThe full implications of the Bridgegate decision remain to be seen, but it raises questions about the limits of federal power to prosecute public corruption and the role of money in politics. As the pandemic continues to challenge the nation, the politicization of government responses and the potential for corruption remain significant concerns for many Americans.",
    " Title: Unlikely Alliances: Democrats and Tea Party Unite to Challenge McConnell in 2014 Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, the 2014 primary race for the Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky could see an unusual alliance between Democrats and Tea Party activists. Big Democratic donors, local liberal activists, and a left-leaning super PAC in Kentucky are reportedly planning to support a right-wing candidate should one challenge McConnell in a primary.\n\nThe strategy, according to sources, is to soften McConnell's position in a general election, where Democrats still hold a voter registration advantage in Kentucky. Alternatively, the goal is to see Kentucky GOP primary voters nominate a weak candidate, similar to Todd Akin or Richard Mourdock, who may not be able to win the general election.\n\nKeith Rouda, a field organizer with the liberal group MoveOn and the Democratic super PAC, Progress Kentucky, stated, \"We are doing a lot of reaching out to some of the tea party folks across the state. What we\u2019re finding \u2014 at least in this stage of the race \u2014 we\u2019re finding that our interests align. It\u2019s unusual.\"\n\nProgress Kentucky has begun circulating petitions urging Republicans to run for the Senate seat, and Democratic donors active in Kentucky and national politics are reportedly willing to bankroll a Tea Party candidate. At this point, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Kentucky Democratic Party are not involved in these unorthodox efforts, officials said.\n\nSarah Durand, president of the Louisville Tea Party, confirmed that Democratic donors and activists have expressed their willingness to spend seven figures in a GOP primary to help a candidate challenging McConnell. Durand noted the challenge for Tea Party groups is to recruit a candidate who wouldn't hand the seat to the Democrats, even though Tea Party leaders across the state are not satisfied with McConnell's three-decade tenure in Washington.\n\n\"I guess the fear would be ending up in the Dick Lugar situation where you oust the incumbent and end up with a Democrat,\" Durand said. \"But I really think if Sen. McConnell can\u2019t garner some enthusiasm within the Tea Party, which is going to be very difficult at this point, then he\u2019s going to have a really tough road ahead in this election cycle.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, McConnell and his campaign staff are reportedly taking proactive measures to prevent a primary challenge. McConnell's staff has attended more than 100 Tea Party meetings in the state over the past two years, and the leader himself has stumped at three Tea Party rallies, including one with Sen. Rand Paul in the state capital of Frankfort last August.\n\nMcConnell has also held face-to-face meetings with several Tea Party activists, including Durand and her fellow activists for coffee right before the November election; her group is one that is skeptical of recruiting a primary challenger against McConnell. McConnell has also been quick to bring under his wing the two biggest forces in Tea Party politics in the state: Paul and freshman Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who was initially seen as a possible primary threat to the GOP leader.",
    " Title: Global Warming Skepticism on the Rise: A Look at the Shifting Tides in Climate Change Perception\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the narrative surrounding global warming appears to be shifting, with a growing number of individuals and entities expressing skepticism towards the widely accepted climate change theory. This shift is evident in various sectors, including politics, entertainment, and academia.\n\nPresident Obama's recent address to world leaders, where he emphasized the need to address climate extremes, seems to have met with a lukewarm response. The President's call for carbon sacrifices to combat climate change has been met with skepticism, particularly from leaders who recognize the importance of affordable energy sources in achieving prosperity.\n\nThis skepticism is not confined to the political sphere. In the world of entertainment, the mention of global warming in movies and television shows has significantly decreased. According to historian Benjamin Schmidt of Northeastern University, the use of the phrase \"climate change\" in scripts has diminished, with such mentions now often appearing as jokes or in animated shows.\n\nMoreover, several European nations have been identified as fair-weather global warmists, with attempts to impose a binding worldwide treaty collapsing in Copenhagen five years ago.\n\nThe skepticism towards global warming is also reflected in the scientific community. Last week, New Scientist magazine, a reputable scientific publication, claimed that the growth in Antarctic sea ice is a result of global warming. This assertion, however, contradicts the general understanding that global warming leads to melting ice caps.\n\nDespite these developments, it is important to note that the proponents of global warming remain steadfast in their beliefs. They continue to advocate for action to combat climate change, albeit with less fervor than in previous years.\n\nAs the world's diplomats gather to discuss climate change, it is crucial to approach the issue with an open mind, considering all perspectives. The resilience of Earth, as demonstrated by its survival of various natural disasters, suggests that it may be more robust than some predictions suggest.\n\nIn conclusion, the shifting tides in global warming perception are a testament to the dynamic nature of public opinion and the ongoing debate surrounding this complex issue. As more information becomes available, it is essential for all parties involved to engage in constructive dialogue to ensure a sustainable future for all.",
    " Title: Congress Urged to Limit Executive Authority in Cuba Policy Amidst Controversial Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and criticism, President Obama's decision to normalize relations with Cuba has been met with resistance from Congress, who are urging to limit the executive's authority in the matter. The deal, which includes the release of American hostage Alan Gross and the exchange of three Cuban spies, has been criticized for its perceived moral and legal equivalency, as well as its potential to incentivize rogue regimes to kidnap Americans worldwide.\n\nThe deal, which has been on Obama's agenda for some time, has been met with skepticism and opposition from lawmakers who argue that the president lacks the authority to lift the embargo, allow trade, or grant Cuba access to capital markets. The Helms-Burton Act of 1996 grants Congress the power to override any executive action to lift the embargo.\n\nIn order to lift the embargo, the Cuban government would have to grant a number of rights to its citizens, such as freedom of association, speech, and political activity, which President Obama reportedly failed to secure in his recent conversation with Cuban dictator Raul Castro.\n\nCongress is also considering using policy riders in the upcoming DHS appropriations debate in February and the Fiscal Year 2016 appropriations process to deny the president funds for setting up relations. Senators have also threatened to place a hold on any ambassador nominated to serve in Cuba unless the Cuban government is no longer a threat to the United States and has decided to grant freedom to its people.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has already stated his intention to do so. The deal has been criticized for failing to advance freedom in Cuba and for throwing a lifeline to the island's dictators, whose main source of funding, Venezuela, is currently in a precarious position due to plunging oil prices.\n\nCritics argue that the deal fails to address the human rights abuses and state terrorism that have been perpetrated by the Cuban government for decades. The deal has also been criticized for its perceived moral equivalency, as the three Cuban spies released in exchange for Gross were convicted of actions that led to the death of an American in the 1990s.\n\nCongress is urging action to limit the damage of the deal, with some lawmakers arguing that President Obama's approach to Cuba has been feckless and misguided. Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has described Obama as the worst negotiator since Carter. The deal has been met with criticism for its perceived lack of concessions from the Cuban government and its potential to incentivize rogue regimes to kidnap Americans worldwide.",
    " Title: Trump Calls for Unified Fight Against Extremism in Historic Speech to Muslim Leaders in Riyadh\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic speech on Sunday, President Donald Trump called on Muslim leaders from across the Middle East and North Africa to take the lead in the fight against extremism, emphasizing the need for religious tolerance and the eradication of extremist ideology within their own societies.\n\nAddressing a gathering of 50 leaders from Muslim countries at the Arab Islamic American Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Trump vowed that the U.S. would be a strong partner in the fight against terrorism but that Muslim nations would have to take the lead in rooting out extremism, even from within mosques and religious schools.\n\n\"There can be no coexistence with this violence. There can be no tolerating it. No accepting it. No excusing it and no ignoring it,\" Trump said. \"They don't worship God. They worship death.\"\n\nTrump's speech marked a dramatic break with the anti-terror and foreign policy of the Obama administration, which many Muslim countries saw as emboldening Iran through the Iran nuclear deal. The speech also provided a political win for Trump at home, as the focus shifted from accusations and investigations of collusion with Russia.\n\nHowever, Trump did not use the phrase \"radical Islamic terrorism,\" a phrase he harshly criticized President Obama for not using. During the campaign, Trump's rhetoric often risked offending Muslims, but he made clear the source of the extremism, referring to \"Islamists\" and \"Islamic terror.\"\n\nTrump stressed that the U.S. was not at war with Islam, stating, \"I stand before you as a representative of the American people to deliver a message of friendship and hope and love.\" He also emphasized that the U.S. was not there to lecture or dictate, but to offer partnership based on shared interests and values.\n\nThe strategy outlined by Trump included denying territory or safe havens for extremists and cutting off financial streams to groups associated with terrorism. He stressed that more than military action, a message of religious tolerance and anti-violence had to come from political and religious leaders in the Muslim world.\n\nTrump and Saudi King Salman agreed to establish the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center as a hub for efforts to counter terrorist fundraising. The speech, which touched on sensitive topics for Muslims, appeared to be well-received, with early endorsement from Saudi King Salman.\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich compared Trump's speech to President Reagan's famous Westminster address to the British Parliament that set the stage for the defeat of the Soviet Union. \"You have the president of the United States surrounded by the largest alliance we've ever seen in the Muslim world, talking and articulating about a practical and realistic idealism they are going to move forward together to create a better world,\" Gingrich said on Fox News.",
    " Title: Major Cities Worldwide on High Alert Amidst Terror Threats: New York, Brussels, Paris, and Beyond\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of chilling terror threats, major cities across the globe, including New York and Brussels, have heightened their security measures. New York City, boasting the world's strongest and most agile first responders, conducted an extensive active-shooter drill, with a focus on the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Meanwhile, Brussels extended its highest alert level into Monday, citing an \"imminent threat\" to the capital.\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio commended the city's first responders after a three-hour training exercise that involved a multitude of federal and local agencies. \"They're ready to protect us,\" de Blasio said.\n\nIn Brussels, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel extended the highest alert level due to a perceived \"real threat.\" The city was in a virtual lockdown, with schools, commuter rails, cultural and sports venues closed. The city experienced a scare on Sunday when a major railway station was evacuated for a suspicious package, but no explosives were found. Later, streets were sealed off in the city's tourist district due to security concerns.\n\nBelgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon acknowledged the heightened tension, stating, \"There is a real threat, and we will make every effort day and night to face it.\" Jambon also revealed that several suspects linked to the Nov. 13 Paris attacks were being sought in Belgium, with the face of the manhunt belonging to suspected terrorist Salah Abdeslam.\n\nIn Brussels, Abdeslam's brother made a plea on Belgian TV for Salah to surrender. \"I prefer to see my brother in a jail rather than in a graveyard,\" Mohamed Abdeslam told Belgian public broadcaster RTBF. Abdeslam expressed doubt that Salah participated in the attacks, stating his brother may have changed his mind and declined to participate in the massacre.\n\nParis remained jittery, with the sound of an explosion at the central Gare du Nord train station causing evacuation but ultimately revealing only a bird electrocuted on the rails. French police also released a photo of a man they believe was one of three terrorists who died outside the national stadium during the Nov. 13 attacks, seeking the public's help in identifying him.\n\nFrench authorities have decided to continue the detention of a man who had housed some of the attackers, following the death of suspected attack mastermind Abdelhamid Abaaoud in a firefight with police.\n\nRome and Milan were also on alert after the foreign ministry warned that St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City and some sites in Milan might be potential terror targets.\n\nIn Los Angeles, a Southwest Airlines flight from Indianapolis arrived an hour late after making an unscheduled landing in Kansas City due to \"suspicious\" behavior. The airline reported that all passengers aboard Flight 5929 exited the plane, and bomb-sniffing dogs searched it but found nothing.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Police Chief Cathy Lanier advised residents to consider taking action, including shooting, if they find themselves in the midst of a terror attack. \"Your options are run, hide, or fight,\" Lanier told CBS News' Sixty Minutes. \"If you're in a position to try and take the gunman down, to take the gunman out, it's the best option for saving lives before police can get there.\"\n\nNo imminent, credible threat was reported for Washington or New York, but security was tight across both cities. U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., discussing New York City, told CNN that reliable intelligence can be difficult to gather. \"We do not know what we do not know,\" Nunes said. \"They've gotten very good at hiding from intelligence services across the world.\"",
    " Title: Senate Acquits President Trump in Bipartisan Vote, Dashing Democrats' Hopes for Conviction\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bipartisan vote, the U.S. Senate acquitted President Donald Trump on both articles of impeachment on Wednesday, dashing hopes of Democrats who had hoped for a conviction before the 2020 election. The decision came after a two-week trial that saw heated debates and emotional appeals from both sides.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) announced her decision to acquit the president on Monday, joining a growing number of Republicans who had already declared their support for Trump. Murkowski criticized the president's behavior but also accused the House of bungling the case against him, stating that he could not receive a fair trial in the Senate. She expressed a preference for censure instead of impeachment.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), considered the most likely Democrat to side with Trump, has yet to announce his decision. However, he also expressed support for censure, stating that the president's dealings with Ukraine were not \"perfect,\" as Trump has insisted. Manchin believes a bipartisan majority would back censure, but impeachment will fail due to the lack of the necessary 67 votes.\n\nHouse Democrats made a last-ditch appeal to senators on Monday, urging them to convict Trump on both articles of impeachment as the only way to constrain him. Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the lead impeachment prosecutor, accused Trump of lacking character, breaking every boundary of decency, and betraying the country by subverting national security to his political whims.\n\nTrump's lawyers argued that the only fair outcome was acquittal, as the impeachment process had been tainted from the start. They presented a video montage of Democrats vowing impeachment in January 2017, even before Trump was inaugurated. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone urged senators to leave judgment of Trump to voters, who began casting their ballots in the Iowa caucuses on Monday.\n\nWith closing arguments over, senators have two days to ponder their votes before Wednesday's final action. The House impeached Trump on December 18 on two articles: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The first article accuses Trump of abuse of power stemming from a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump requested a corruption probe into political rival Joe Biden and Democrats' activities in 2016, while withholding financial aid to Ukraine. The second article accuses Trump of obstruction of Congress for claiming immunity from the House's probe and blocking witnesses and documents Democrats sought.\n\nNo Republicans voted for the articles in the House, marking the first time an impeachment of a president happened on a purely partisan basis. Trump's allies argue that he had the authority to request a probe into possible corruption, citing Hunter Biden's role on the board of a Ukrainian energy company and his receipt of about $50,000 a month from Burisma, despite lacking expertise in the industry. Democrats argue that Trump abused his position and that there is no basis to question the Bidens' behavior.\n\nDuring the House impeachment inquiry, Democrats picked the witnesses to be called and blocked the president's team from calling its own witnesses or cross-examining the Democrats' choices. No witnesses testified that they heard Trump condition aid on Ukraine investigating the Bidens, but several said they believed it to be the case based on circumstantial evidence. Democrats said those in the know, such as former National Security Adviser John R. Bolton and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, rebuffed attempts to get them to appear. Bolton has since said he would testify to the Senate and has written a book that reportedly says he was asked by the president to help facilitate a meeting between Ukrainian officials and Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who was allegedly part of the pressure campaign to start corruption investigations in Ukraine focused on the Bidens.\n\nSenators will have all day Tuesday to make remarks on the chamber floor about the impeachment proceedings, and will cast their final vote on whether to acquit Trump the following afternoon. Meanwhile, Trump will deliver the State of the Union address on Tuesday night with the pending acquittal vote less than 24 hours away. Democrats have pivoted away from arguments over documents and witnesses and said the country's national security and fairness of the 2020 presidential election is at stake should Trump be left in office.",
    " Title: Midterm Elections Shift Focus: Foreign Policy and ISIS Dominate as Election Day Nears\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2014 midterm elections approach, the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) has significantly altered the political landscape, pushing national security and terrorism to the forefront of the campaign trail. The focus on foreign policy issues has overshadowed the partisan sparring over ObamaCare and multiple scandals that have plagued the Obama administration.\n\nWith just nine weeks remaining before voters decide the makeup of the next Congress, ISIS, Ukraine, Gaza, and Boko Haram have replaced the IRS, Benghazi, NSA data-gathering, and the VA as the primary concerns for candidates and voters alike.\n\nFour years ago, Fox News polled voters on their top issues at the ballot box, with the economy leading, and Iraq at the bottom. However, recent polling shows that voters now prioritize a tougher approach to foreign policy as ISIS militants wreak havoc in northern Iraq and Syria, posing a threat to western interests.\n\nCandidates are responding to this shift in public sentiment. Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), who is facing a Republican challenge from former GOP chairman Ed Gillespie in November, urged the Obama administration to present a \"clear strategy\" for \"eliminating\" the Islamic State threat.\n\nThe sudden focus on foreign policy presents challenges for both parties. Republicans, who have been pulled in an isolationist direction by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and budget-minded Tea Party groups, are adjusting their tone. Even Paul, while advocating for Obama to make his case for military action to Congress, acknowledged that ISIS has \"absolutely\" declared war on America.\n\nFor Democrats, the focus on the Middle East allows candidates to momentarily step away from the defensive on ObamaCare and administration controversies such as Benghazi and IRS targeting. However, the increased emphasis on terror threats means there is less room for Democratic candidates to tout modest domestic gains like job creation or the rebound of the stock market.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), who is in a race against former GOP Sen. Scott Brown, distanced herself from the president's comments on Wednesday when he said the goal is to make the terror group \"manageable.\" Shaheen tweeted, \"Do not believe ISIL is'manageable,' agree these terrorists must be chased to the 'gates of hell.'\"\n\nLara Brown, associate professor of political management with George Washington University, suggested that the economy, and the \"languishing recovery,\" will remain a top issue in the fall. However, she also noted that voter perceptions of Obama's leadership abroad could impact the election, particularly for moderate Democrats who need the president to take a strong stand to maintain voter support.\n\nA new GWU poll underscores the president's vulnerability on foreign affairs, with 58% disapproving of his handling of foreign affairs and 54% viewing him as \"not tough enough\" on security issues. The same poll showed a dramatic shift in attitudes toward America's role in the world, with the share of Americans who believe the U.S. does \"too little\" to address world problems nearly doubling since November 2013.\n\nAs Democrats attempt to toughen their tone, Republicans are doing the same, criticizing the president for a foreign policy strategy they deem ineffective. Brown, Shaheen's opponent, accused the Obama administration of emboldening America's enemies with an \"incoherent foreign policy.\"\n\nBrown released a scathing web video this week, juxtaposing Biden's 2012 claims about Obama's \"strength\" with ominous footage of Islamic militants and the president's recent gaffe where he said \"we do not have a strategy\" yet to address ISIS in Syria. The ad concludes with the text \"Obama Biden - a foreign policy failure.\"",
    " Title: Analysis of Key Senate Races: Democrats Face Uphill Battle in Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the midterm elections approach, political analyst John Waage of \u2588\u2588\u2588 News has been scrutinizing the poll numbers to examine the crucial Senate races that are up for grabs. The Democrats, who have been predicted to experience a so-called \"blue wave\" that would give them control of the House and Senate, may be facing an uphill battle.\n\nTo seize control of the Senate, Democrats need to win two seats. However, they are defending six states where they are facing tough competition from the Republicans. The Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation battle may have left a mark on the polls, as some surveys indicate a voter backlash against the Democrats' handling of the Kavanaugh hearings.\n\nIn North Dakota, incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D) is trailing her Republican challenger, Kevin Cramer (R), by double digits. In Missouri, Josh Hawley (R) is giving incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) a tough fight. In Montana, Sen. Jon Tester (D) is nearly neck and neck with Matt Rosendale (R). In West Virginia, incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin (D), who voted for Kavanaugh, is holding onto the lead.\n\nRepublicans are defending seats in Arizona and Tennessee, where Sen. Jeff Flake and Sen. Bob Corker are retiring. In Tennessee, Marsha Blackburn (R) now has a 14-point edge against Phil Bredesen (D) in the latest New York Times poll, despite pop singer Taylor Swift's endorsement of Bredesen. In Arizona, Martha McSally (R) is tied with or slightly ahead of Kyrsten Sinema (D). In Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz (R) has increased his margin over Beto O'Rourke (D). However, Democrats have poured millions of dollars into the Texas race, and O'Rourke has a significant campaign war chest.\n\nDemocrats are also targeting the Republican-held seat in Nevada, where Jacky Rosen (D) is facing incumbent Sen. Dean Heller (R). Heller currently has a slight lead in recent polls.\n\nAccording to Waage, based on the current polls, Republicans would gain two Senate seats if the election were held today. The possibility of a House takeover is more likely for the Democrats, but it all comes down to voter turnout. Waage believes that even if Democrats win control of the House, it will be by a narrow margin. \"Both bases are mobilized,\" he says. \"Republicans weren't before the Kavanaugh hearings, but they are now.\"",
    " Title: Senate Clears Path for Immigration Bill, but House Outcome Remains Uncertain\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant step towards potential immigration reform, the U.S. Senate cleared a key hurdle on Tuesday, paving the way for a comprehensive immigration bill to be debated. The bipartisan measure, which offers a 13-year path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, received strong support from both parties, with a vote of 82-15.\n\nThe bill, which addresses a highly charged issue with significant political implications for both parties, aims to fulfill a long-standing promise to Hispanic Americans, a key voting bloc, to address the limbo of the 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, who has made immigration reform a priority of his second term, urged Congress to pass the bill at a White House event earlier in the day. He emphasized that the bill would increase spending on border security, require undocumented immigrants to undergo background checks, learn English, pay taxes, and a penalty before they could begin the 13-year path to citizenship.\n\nHowever, one GOP opponent, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, predicted that the Republican-controlled House would reject the bill in its current form due to the pathway to citizenship. Cruz, who is a member of the Republican Party, argued that the bill is designed to fail in the House.\n\nThe bill, which was hammered out this spring by a bipartisan group of senators known as the \"Gang of Eight,\" has faced opposition from some congressional conservatives who view it as a form of amnesty for those who entered the country illegally. In addition, concerns about the bill's effectiveness in securing the nation's porous borders may make it difficult for conservatives to support it, especially those up for re-election next year.\n\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber's No. 2 Republican, who voted for opening debate, questioned the wisdom of granting permanent legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants without any guarantee of securing the border.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, a member of the bipartisan \"Gang of Eight\" and a possible GOP presidential contender in 2016, has made it clear that border security requirements must be toughened if he and other GOP skeptics will support the bill. He is pushing an amendment that would make Congress, not the executive branch, responsible for deciding if security metrics at the border have been met before other aspects of the reform bill, including the pathway to citizenship, are triggered.\n\nThe vote on the Rubio amendment will be closely watched as floor action unfolds over the next three weeks. Other planned amendments will involve stepped-up security checks of people entering the country, temporary visas for high- and low-skilled workers, and other technical provisions.\n\nIn a rare display of unity, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, union leaders, and other interest groups have come out in support of the Senate plan. Advocates for comprehensive reform won the first major legislative victory last month when the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13-5 to approve the \"Gang of Eight\" plan. Democratic leaders hope to have a Senate vote on final passage by the end of June.\n\nA bipartisan group has been working on a separate immigration plan in the House, but the effort suffered a setback last week when a key member dropped out of the negotiations. Previous efforts to pass immigration reform fell short last decade even though it was said to be a priority of President George W. Bush. Now, Obama has made the issue a major priority of his second term.",
    " Title: Trump Selects Montana Representative Ryan Zinke as Interior Secretary Nominee\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - President-elect Donald Trump has chosen first-term Republican U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, a former Navy SEAL commander, as his nominee for the position of Interior Secretary, a senior transition official announced on Tuesday.\n\nU.S. Representative Ryan Zinke (R-MT) is set to head the Interior Department, which employs more than 70,000 people across the United States and oversees more than 20 percent of federal land, including national parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite.\n\nZinke's selection was unexpected, as some Republican officials had hoped he would challenge Democratic U.S. Senator Jon Tester of Montana in the 2018 elections. Initially, Trump had considered nominating U.S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state for the position.\n\nZinke, 55, is a proponent of keeping public lands under federal ownership, a stance that puts him at odds with some in his Republican Party who favor privatization or state control. It remains unclear where Zinke stands on increasing drilling and mining on federal lands, a promise made by Trump during his presidential campaign.\n\nTrump's official energy platform calls for opening \"onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands, eliminating the moratorium on coal leasing, and opening shale energy deposits.\"\n\nRumors circulated last week that McMorris Rodgers had been picked for the post, but a source close to the congresswoman stated on Tuesday that she had never been offered the job.\n\nZinke, an early Trump supporter, has voted for legislation that weakens environmental safeguards on public land. However, unlike other candidates who were on the shortlist for the interior secretary job, Zinke opposes the transfer of public lands to the states, a position that aligns with Trump's.\n\nTrump has stated that he does not believe public land should be turned over to the states and should be protected. In July, Zinke resigned as a delegate to the Republican nominating convention because the party platform called for transferring public lands to the states.\n\nPublic land comprises more than 30 percent of Montana, according to the Montana Wilderness Association. The League of Conservation Voters, which ranks lawmakers on their environmental record, gave Zinke an extremely low lifetime score of 3 percent. The Wilderness Society, a leading conservation group, expressed concern over Zinke's support for logging, drilling, and mining on public lands.\n\nThe Interior Department also oversees the Bureau of Indian Affairs and handles tribal policy. Under the Obama administration, the department played a significant role in efforts to curb the effects of climate change by limiting fossil fuel development in some areas.",
    " Title: Harvey Weinstein Indicted on Rape Charges in New York\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has been indicted by a Manhattan grand jury on charges of first- and third-degree rape in one case and a first-degree sex act in a second case. The charges, announced on May 30, mark the first criminal charges against Weinstein in connection with the numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault that have been levied against him since October of last year.\n\nWeinstein surrendered to authorities in New York on May 25 and was arraigned shortly thereafter. Bond was set at $10 million or $1 million cash, which he paid with a cashier's check. Weinstein was also required to relinquish his passport and wear a GPS monitoring system. He is only permitted to travel between New York and Connecticut.\n\nIn a press conference on Friday, Weinstein's lawyer, Ben Brafman, reiterated Weinstein's contention that he did not engage in nonconsensual sexual activities. Weinstein is expected to enter a plea of not guilty.\n\nThe indictment comes two days after reports that federal prosecutors had begun a sex crimes investigation into Weinstein, and that a state grand jury had convened to hear evidence in sexual assault allegations against the former Hollywood mogul.\n\nThe NYPD does not release the names of sex crime victims. However, Lucia Evans, now a marketing consultant, confirmed to the New Yorker's Ronan Farrow that she is pressing charges against Weinstein. Evans alleges that in 2004, when she was an aspiring actress, Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him at the Miramax office in Tribeca\u2014just blocks from the NYPD precinct where Weinstein turned himself in on Friday.\n\nActress Paz de la Huerta told Vanity Fair that Weinstein raped her in 2010 at a Manhattan hotel, but she told Farrow that her allegations are not part of the charges expected to be filed against Weinstein, though she will testify if asked.\n\nThe case has raised questions about Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance's handling of previous allegations against Weinstein. In 2015, Vance declined to prosecute Weinstein in connection with a sexual assault allegation, and later received a campaign donation from Weinstein's lawyer. Vance will be faced with the decision of whether to prosecute, under public pressure from critics of his previous decision, and from the #MeToo movement more generally.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday after the indictment, Vance said, \"This indictment brings the defendant another step closer to accountability for the crimes of violence with which he is now charged.\"\n\nThe arrest and indictment are only the beginning of a long legal process. Weinstein's connection to Vance could play a role in the future of this case, as the producer has hired another lawyer who was a donor to Vance's campaign, and who represented two high-profile rape defendants whom Vance declined to prosecute. Whether Weinstein will get a fair trial, or a trial at all, remains to be seen. But if he does, it will be momentous, as the first in a wave of powerful men accused last year finally faces his day in court.\n\nThis isn't the first time Weinstein has been investigated by the NYPD. In 2015, model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez reported to police that Weinstein had grabbed her breasts and tried to reach up her skirt during a meeting at his Tribeca office. Despite a recording in which Weinstein appeared to admit to the incident\u2014saying, \"I won't do it again\"\u2014Vance's office decided not to press charges.\n\nThe issue of donations matters not just for the previous Weinstein case but for the current one. Weinstein has hired high-powered defense attorney Ben Brafman to represent him this time around. Brafman's firm has donated about $4,600 to Vance in the past, the Times reports. And Vance has declined to prosecute two high-profile Brafman clients accused of rape in the past: lawyer Sanford A. Rubenstein in 2015 and French politician Dominique Strauss-Kahn in 2011.\n\nNow, of course, critics are watching Vance for any sign of favoritism toward Weinstein. And the rise of the #MeToo movement means public opinion around the case may look different than it did for, say, Strauss-Kahn.\n\nWe don't yet know how all these conflicting forces will come into play at a trial, if the case goes that route. What we do know is that the man whose name has become inextricably linked with #MeToo has been arrested and will likely soon be charged. Whatever happens next, the whole country will be watching.",
    " Title: Fed Chairman Warns of Economic Recession if Congress Fails to Avert Budget Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a grim assessment of the U.S. economy, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned Tuesday that a looming budget crisis could lead to a recession and the loss of 1.25 million jobs in 2013 if Congress fails to reach an agreement to avoid the fiscal cliff.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Bernanke outlined the potential consequences of the automatic tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect at the end of the year. He noted the Congressional Budget Office's warning that a recession would occur, and job growth would be significantly reduced.\n\nThe Fed is prepared to take further action to support the economy if unemployment remains high, but Bernanke did not specify the steps the Fed might take or whether any action was imminent. He emphasized that the Fed's role is limited, and Congress holds the key to resolving the budget impasse.\n\nBernanke's testimony came as the economy is growing modestly but has weakened. Manufacturing has slowed, consumer spending is down, and job growth has slumped to an average of 75,000 jobs per month in the second quarter of 2012 from 226,000 jobs per month in the first quarter. The unemployment rate remains at 8.2 percent.\n\nThe economy, after growing at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the second half of 2011, slowed to roughly 2 percent from January through March and likely weakened further in the April-June period. Bernanke urged Congress to resolve the budget impasse well before the year ends to reduce uncertainty and boost household and business confidence.\n\nThe potential job losses from the fiscal cliff could reach as many as 2 million, according to a report by the Aerospace Industries Association. A separate report Tuesday highlighted the budget crises many states are facing due to shrinking federal revenue.\n\nRepublicans in Congress are demanding deeper spending cuts, while extending income tax cuts for all. Democrats want to extend the tax cuts for middle- and lower-class Americans but let them expire for those in the highest-income brackets.\n\nBernanke stopped short of telling Congress what steps to take, challenging them to think broadly. He also warned that the economy's challenges go beyond the budget impasse, and lawmakers must produce a long-term plan to shrink federal budget deficits to avoid a potential financial crisis marked by rising interest rates.\n\nStocks rose sharply despite Bernanke's grim assessment, with the Dow Jones industrial average climbing more than 90 points. The Fed chairman also addressed Europe's debt crisis, stating that the Fed has been working with U.S. banks to ensure they are prepared for a potential crisis.\n\nSen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) implored Bernanke to take action now, stating, \"Given the political realities of this year's election, I believe the Fed is the only game in town. I would urge you, now more than ever, to take whatever actions are warranted.\"\n\nEven if the Fed announces another round of bond purchases, some economists question how much it might help, as mortgage rates and other key borrowing rates are already at record lows. The economy was already sputtering when the Fed's policymaking committee last met in June, and the Fed decided to extend a program that shifts its bond portfolio to try to lower long-term interest rates. The Fed also reiterated its plan to keep its key short-term interest rate near zero until at least late 2014.",
    " Title: New York Times Allegation Against Kavanaugh: A Closer Look at the Details and Corroboration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, a new allegation of sexual misconduct has surfaced against U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, as reported in a New York Times essay by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. The allegation, which is detailed in their forthcoming book, involves an incident from Kavanaugh's freshman year at Yale University that allegedly echoes the claims made by Christine Blasey Ford, another of Kavanaugh's classmates.\n\nThe essay states that a classmate, Max Stier, saw Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends allegedly pushed Kavanaugh's penis into the hand of a female student. However, the logistics of the allegation are unclear, as it is not specified whether Kavanaugh was allegedly walking around naked or if his friends physically maneuvered him in such a way.\n\nThe authors provide little information about the corroboration of the story, stating only that Stier notified senators and the FBI about the account, but the FBI did not investigate, and Stier has declined to discuss it publicly. The authors claim to have corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Stier.\n\nIt is worth noting that the female student involved in the alleged incident has reportedly denied any memory of the event, a fact that was omitted from the New York Times story. This omission has been criticized as a case of journalistic malpractice.\n\nThe new allegation is intended to lend credence to the on-the-record allegation made by Kavanaugh's Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez in 2018. Ramirez's allegation was that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party while they were both college freshmen. The authors of the essay downplay Ramirez's own doubts about the incident, focusing instead on details that are meant to portray Kavanaugh as a privileged individual who might engage in such behavior.\n\nHowever, the details provided do not corroborate Ramirez's allegation. The essay does not provide any first-hand witnesses to the alleged incident, and the supposed corroborating source for Ramirez's claim, classmate Kenneth Appold, was not present when the alleged incident occurred. Appold has also reportedly recanted his account.\n\nIn conclusion, the new allegation against Kavanaugh, as detailed in the New York Times essay, is unclear in its details and lacks corroboration. The omission of key information, such as the alleged victim's lack of memory of the event, raises questions about the credibility of the story. The book, which is not yet released, may provide more details, but the current essay does not offer a strong case against Kavanaugh.",
    " Title: Government Shutdown Halts Key Economic Reports, Leaves Policymakers in the Dark\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing government shutdown has resulted in a significant halt in the production of key economic reports by key agencies, leaving policymakers in the dark regarding crucial budget information, spending, and the economy. The shutdown has caused the cancellation of three major reports, including the Labor Department's September jobs report, the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) monthly budget reviews, and the Treasury Department's final deficit report for fiscal year 2013.\n\nThe CBO announced that its Monthly Budget Review will not be published during the shutdown's duration, while the shutdown has also delayed another CBO report that was supposed to outline tax and spending options for reducing the deficit. Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, lamented, \"The irony of this whole thing is we just shut down our means to have those budget options to avoid the shutdown.\"\n\nThe shutdown's impact on the economy and politics remains uncertain, with some analysts predicting it could save money due to halted programs and fewer employees to pay, while others argue that it takes money to shut down and start up operations. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former CBO director and president of the American Action Forum, noted that the cost of a shutdown is \"not a lot of money\" in relation to the federal budget.\n\nAs the shutdown enters its second week, the lack of information has left policymakers with little understanding of the economy's real-time status. The problem for federal agencies is that the number crunchers have been furloughed as part of the 800,000 federal employees whose jobs were deemed non-essential to protecting life or property. At the CBO, only about 10 percent of agency employees are on the job, dealing with bills actively under consideration in Congress.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-TX) argued that the lack of information benefits the White House by hiding bad budget numbers. However, Holtz-Eakin stated that the lack of data isn't catastrophic but does hurt. He noted that the calculations of damage to the economy are probably overblown, and the shutdown's impact on the economy is relatively minor at this stage.\n\nEven amid the shutdown, some numbers are still coming in, such as the Treasury Department's Daily Treasury Statement showing the status of the federal debt. The administration has also released reports arguing that approaching the debt limit could cause a severe recession. Private analysts are filling the gap with their own calculations and data, with organizations like the Alliance for American Manufacturing and the Center for American Progress issuing reports on job creation and economic impact.\n\nAs the shutdown continues, the fear is that it could extend into the middle of October, potentially damaging the department's ability to collect data for this month's report. The longer the shutdown continues, the more reports are likely to be delayed, leaving policymakers in the dark about the economy's current state.",
    " Title: Trump Nominates Heather Nauert, Former Fox News Anchor, as United Nations Ambassador\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced his intention to nominate Heather Nauert, the current State Department spokeswoman and a former Fox News host, as the United States' next ambassador to the United Nations. If confirmed by the Senate, Nauert will replace Nikki Haley, who is set to step down from her post at the end of the year.\n\nNauert, who joined the State Department in April 2017, has been a prominent figure in the Trump administration, having worked at ABC and Fox News prior to her tenure at the State Department. She has not traveled extensively with her first boss, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and was not particularly close to him. However, with Mike Pompeo now leading the State Department, Nauer has been more active on diplomatic trips.\n\nNauert's nomination comes amidst some controversy, with critics pointing to a tourist-like Instagram post from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during a trip focused on the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. There have also been other missteps, such as when Nauert cited D-Day \u2013 the Allied invasion of Normandy against the Nazis \u2013 as an example of America's strong relationship with Germany.\n\nDespite these criticisms, Nauert has been a staunch defender of President Trump at the podium, a fact that Trump himself has acknowledged. \"She's excellent, she's been with us a long time, she's been a supporter for a long time,\" Trump said of Nauert in November.\n\nThe State Department previously held daily briefings, but this has been scaled back to two a week, at most. Nauert, who is 48 years old, has been balancing her job in Washington, D.C. with her family in New York. Before joining the Trump administration, she had no government or foreign policy experience, though she did work on some overseas assignments for ABC, including in Baghdad.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Nauert will take over from Nikki Haley, who has been a vocal and influential figure in the United Nations during her tenure. The confirmation process for Nauert's nomination is expected to begin in the coming weeks.",
    " Title: \" Addressing the Migrant Caravan Crisis: A Call for Action and Reform\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent times, thousands of migrants from countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and other Central and South American nations have embarked on a journey towards the United States, collectively known as a \"caravan.\" This mass migration, often referred to as a \"caravan\" to avoid the more direct term \"invading horde,\" has become a pressing issue that requires immediate attention and long-term solutions.\n\nThe article suggests several strategies to address this issue, focusing on economic incentives and foreign policy adjustments.\n\nFirstly, the article proposes leveraging the economic dependence of Mexico on the United States. By imposing taxes on remittances sent by Mexican nationals living and working in the U.S. legally or illegally, or even stopping these remittances altogether, the U.S. could send a strong message and potentially deter future caravans.\n\nSecondly, the article emphasizes the need for stricter enforcement of immigration laws, particularly in relation to employers hiring illegal immigrants. The proposal is for significant fines for companies that hire undocumented workers, which could make employment opportunities scarce and reduce the incentive for illegal immigration.\n\nThirdly, the article suggests coupling these employment measures with work requirements for welfare recipients, especially during periods of full employment. This would make it more challenging for illegal immigrants to sustain themselves in the U.S.\n\nThe article also calls for a reevaluation of U.S. foreign aid policies, suggesting that aid should be tied to reform efforts in recipient countries. This approach could encourage positive change and potentially discourage mass migration.\n\nLastly, the article highlights the upcoming Brazilian elections and the potential impact of the election of candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who is running on an anti-corruption platform. The article suggests that the U.S. should support leaders like Bolsonaro who are willing to fight corruption and promote reform within their countries.\n\nIn conclusion, the article argues that by implementing a combination of economic disincentives, stricter immigration enforcement, and foreign policy adjustments, the U.S. can deter future caravans and ultimately create a win-win situation for all parties involved, except for political mega-donors and the Democratic Party who may have invested in voter registration efforts for potential amnesty grants.",
    " Title: Senate Races Ahead with Amnesty Bill Amidst Transparency Concerns and Unread Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move reminiscent of the Obamacare debate, the Senate is facing criticism for its approach to the Gang of Eight's 1,200-page amnesty legislation. The bill, which has been merged with the Corker-Hoeven amendment, is set for a vote tomorrow at 5:30 pm. However, the vote is not solely on the amendment but on a procedural motion by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to cut off debate on the combined bill, which no senator has had the opportunity to fully read.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, one of the bill's original sponsors, has expressed his opposition to the rushed process, stating, \"I hope that he, and all members who believe in open process, will vote against Majority Leader Reid's motion to silence debate on a bill no one has read.\" Rubio further challenged the bill's sponsors, urging them to commit to extensive, open debate if they are confident in their proposal.\n\nThe amnesty bill, according to Rubio and other critics, lacks sufficient provisions for border security, a concern shared by many Americans. The bill's proponents are being accused of \"Pelosi-ing\" the amnesty bill, a reference to then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's famous statement that the Affordable Care Act had to be passed to understand what was in it.\n\nFormer Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, in an article for Breitbart, has also weighed in on the issue, criticizing the Gang of Eight for their approach to the legislation. The bill, she argues, is similar to the unpopular and unaffordable Obamacare, and is not supported by informed Americans.\n\nThe debate over the amnesty bill continues, with the Senate facing criticism for its handling of the legislation and calls for transparency and open debate. The vote tomorrow promises to be a significant moment in the ongoing immigration debate.",
    " Title: President Trump Endorses Grassley's Immigration Bill, Urges Support for Four Pillars of Immigration Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, President Donald Trump has expressed his support for Senator Chuck Grassley's immigration legislation, as the debate over immigration reform continues to unfold in the Senate. The President has urged the Senate to back Grassley's bill and oppose any legislation that does not align with the four pillars of the White House's Immigration Reform and Border Security Framework.\n\nThe Grassley bill, also known as the \"Secure and Succeed Act,\" is based on the White House's framework and aims to provide a lasting solution for DACA recipients, end chain migration, cancel the visa lottery, and secure the border through wall construction and closing legal loopholes. The bill, initially introduced by Grassley and Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, provides a path to citizenship for 1.8 million DACA recipients, includes $25 billion in border security and wall funding, and limits family-based migration while eliminating the diversity visa lottery.\n\nPresident Trump's statement emphasizes that the Grassley bill is the only legislation on the table that has a chance of becoming law and serves as a workable compromise. The bill's backers argue that it protects nearly two million immigrants while also addressing the security funding that immigration hawks desire.\n\nIn addition to Grassley's bill, House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte and House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul have also introduced immigration legislation that the President says \"also enshrines our four pillars.\" Goodlatte's bill, unveiled last month, takes a tougher stance on illegal immigration enforcement and addresses the future of DACA recipients, allowing beneficiaries to be eligible for 3-year renewable permits to stay in the U.S.\n\nWhile the Goodlatte bill does not include 35 out of the 70 security points outlined in the Trump administration's immigration wish list sent to Congress in October, it does contain funding for the border wall and aims to end the chain migration system and the visa lottery program. Goodlatte's bill also includes a long-term plan for DACA recipients that outlines a potential path to citizenship while not necessarily favoring DACA recipients over other immigrants seeking citizenship.\n\nPresident Trump has expressed optimism about the developments in the House and has hailed Goodlatte's bill as a \"good starting point\" for his administration to accomplish its immigration goals. The President has stated that his focus is now on \"enacting responsible and commonsense immigration reform that delivers for the American People.\"",
    " Title: The Royal Exit: Meghan and Harry's Decision to Step Back from Senior Royal Roles and Its Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe decision of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, to step back from their roles as senior royals and carve out a more independent path has sent shockwaves through the British royal family and beyond. The couple's decision, announced earlier this year, comes amidst a backdrop of a tumultuous relationship with the British press and growing public scrutiny.\n\nThe couple's decision to distance themselves from the British royal family, the symbolic heart of a nation with a complex and troubled history, has been met with a mix of surprise and understanding by many, particularly within the black British community. The legacy of Britain's colonial past, marked by its role in the slave trade, the ideologies of racism, and discriminatory policies towards people of color, has left a lasting impact on society.\n\nMeghan's decision to join the royal family, a move that was perplexing to many, has been followed closely by the couple's actions, which some interpret as a rejection of the traditional royal lifestyle and a desire to distance themselves from the negative aspects of the institution. The couple's decision to withhold a title for their son, Archie, and the rumors of a potential relocation to southern Africa, were seen as early indicators of their intention to chart a different course.\n\nIn recent months, the couple have opted to bypass official royal channels and engage directly with the press, a departure from the usual royal protocol. This shift was further underscored by Meghan's candid admission in a television documentary that adjusting to royal life was challenging, and Harry's revelation that the tragic death of his mother, Princess Diana, had left him determined to protect his wife and family.\n\nThe announcement of their decision to step back from their senior royal roles appears to have taken Buckingham Palace by surprise, signaling a significant break from tradition. As the couple embarks on this new chapter, the implications of their decision will continue to unfold, offering a glimpse into the evolving nature of the British monarchy and its relationship with the public.",
    " Title: UN Imposes Toughest Economic Sanctions on North Korea in Response to Missile Tests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a unanimous decision by the United Nations Security Council, new economic sanctions have been imposed on North Korea in response to its recent intercontinental ballistic missile tests. The sanctions, which could reduce the regime's annual export revenue by a third, target key revenue earners such as coal, iron, lead, and seafood, but not oil.\n\nThe North Korean government, through the official KCNA news agency, has denounced the sanctions as a \"violent violation of our sovereignty\" and part of a \"heinous plot to isolate and stifle\" the country. In a statement, Pyongyang threatened to take \"righteous action\" and described the sanctions as a crime for which the US would pay \"thousands of times\" over.\n\nThe US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, stated on Monday that North Korea should halt missile launches if it wanted to negotiate. He added that the best signal North Korea could give to the US for negotiations would be to stop these missile launches. Tillerson also mentioned that unspecified \"other means of communication\" were open to Pyongyang.\n\nNorth Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, in a speech at a regional conference, stated that the new sanctions would not force Pyongyang into negotiations over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Ri also said that North Korea would not put its nuclear deterrent on the negotiating table and would continue to strengthen its nuclear might.\n\nThe White House stated that US President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed that Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs pose a \"grave and growing direct threat\" to the US, South Korea, Japan, and most countries around the world. The leaders also agreed to continue applying pressure to North Korea.\n\nMany experts believe that Pyongyang is still some way off being able to mount a miniaturized nuclear warhead on a long-range missile, but the regime now has missiles that are theoretically capable of striking the US mainland. The KCNA alluded to this new capability, stating, \"There is no bigger mistake than the United States believing that its land is safe across the ocean.\"\n\nThe new sanctions come as part of an effort to persuade countries attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting to push Pyongyang to end its nuclear plans. Pressure on China, North Korea's main ally and by far its biggest trading partner, to sign up to and enforce more robust sanctions has mounted since the regime conducted two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month.\n\nChina has stated that any punitive actions targeting North Korea must \"avoid bringing disaster\" to the economically fragile state. In a front-page commentary, the overseas edition of the ruling Communist party's official People's Daily stated that sanctions must be employed with precision, avoiding negative impacts on ordinary people and third countries, and avoiding causing disaster to the country in question's normal and legal trade and business exchanges with the outside world, people's normal lives, and the humanitarian situation.",
    " Title: A Retrospective on the Tenure of Attorney General Eric Holder Jr.: A Mixed Legacy of Groundbreaking Achievements and Controversial Decisions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic tenure spanning nearly six years, Eric Holder Jr., the first African-American to serve as the United States' top law enforcement official, has left an indelible mark on the nation's legal landscape. His announcement of resignation on Thursday, effective until his successor's confirmation, marks the end of a tenure that was both groundbreaking and contentious.\n\nHolder's tenure was marked by bold and commendable stances on numerous hot-button issues, despite a frequently antagonistic Congress. However, his legacy is not without blemish, particularly in relation to the role the Justice Department played in matters of secrecy and national security under his leadership.\n\nSame-sex Marriage: In 2011, Holder announced that the Justice Department would no longer defend the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a federal law that defined marriage as between a man and a woman. He declared the law unconstitutional. This decision foreshadowed President Obama's own \"evolution\" on same-sex marriage the following year and the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling that invalidated a significant part of the law. Since the court's decision, nearly two dozen federal courts have struck down state bans on same-sex marriage across the country, and the Supreme Court has been asked again to rule on whether there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage\u2014a question it avoided in 2013.\n\nVoting Rights: Under Holder's leadership, the Justice Department successfully fought discriminatory voting restrictions before the 2012 elections. In the wake of the Supreme Court's 2013 decision that gutted the core of the Voting Rights Act, Holder swiftly found new ways to challenge discriminatory laws. Shortly after the ruling, the Justice Department joined lawsuits challenging new restrictions, such as strict voter-ID requirements and cutbacks to voting hours, in North Carolina and Texas. In both states, Republican-controlled legislatures imposed rules that disproportionately affected poorer and minority voters, who tend to vote Democratic.\n\nAs Holder steps down, his legacy remains a complex tapestry of groundbreaking achievements and controversial decisions. His tenure will be remembered for his unwavering commitment to civil rights, particularly in the areas of same-sex marriage and voting rights, as well as the role the Justice Department played in matters of secrecy and national security. His departure marks a significant shift in the nation's legal landscape, and it remains to be seen who will continue to carry on his legacy.",
    " Title: Trump Expands on Foreign Policy Stances in Anti-Terrorism Speech, Proposes US-Russia Cooperation Against ISIS\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a measured and scripted address at a rally in Youngstown, Ohio on Monday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump outlined his stance on radical Islamic terrorism, emphasizing the threat it poses and proposing a shift in US foreign policy, particularly in relation to Russia and ISIS.\n\nThe speech, while quieter in tone, could have significant implications for the campaign, which has been marked by the candidate's unpredictability in recent weeks. Trump, in his speech, reiterated the threat of radical Islamic terrorism and expanded upon some of his most contentious foreign policy statements.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of the speech was Trump's proposal for the US to work with Russia in \"coalition operations\" to fight ISIS. He acknowledged Russia's own battles with Islamic terror and suggested that their interests in Syria's outcome could be leveraged in the fight against ISIS. This departure from current US policy, which has long insisted on the removal of Syria's embattled president Bashar al-Assad, could potentially mark a significant shift in US-Russia relations.\n\nAnother key point in the speech was Trump's emphasis on \"extreme vetting\" for immigrants and refugees from regions plagued by terrorism. This method, Trump suggested, would involve questioning potential entrants about their beliefs regarding a \"tolerant\" way of life and agreement with US values on women's rights, the rule of law, and the primacy of the US Constitution.\n\nCritics on social media pointed out that such a test could be easily manipulated, and the process of scrutinizing applicants' social media records would require significant time and effort. The proposal, some argue, seems more a rebranding of Trump's previously proposed temporary ban on the entry of non-citizen Muslims into the US, rather than a departure from it.\n\nTrump also appeared to walk back his previous statement about the US withdrawing from NATO unless other members contributed more to the common defense. He acknowledged NATO's new anti-terrorism initiative and suggested that this could justify the US's continued membership.\n\nReactions to the speech were mixed. Trump's allies, such as former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, praised the speech as a demonstration of Trump's presidential capabilities. Critics, however, such as President Obama's former speechwriter Jon Favreau, characterized the speech as a continuation of Trump's dishonesty and incompetence.\n\nThe speech serves as a reminder of the stark contrast between the two presidential candidates' foreign policy stances, and the potential implications of their respective policies for US relations with other nations. As the election approaches, the focus on foreign policy will likely remain a key point of contention between the two candidates.",
    " Title: House Democrats Stage 25-Hour Sit-In on Gun Control, Claim Progress Despite Failed Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, House Democrats staged a 25-hour sit-in on the House floor Thursday, demanding a vote on gun control measures. The sit-in, which began around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday and ended early Thursday afternoon, failed to force a vote, but Democrats claimed they had made \"some progress\" on the issue.\n\nAs House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) decried the protest as a \"publicity stunt,\" Democrats argued they had succeeded in dramatizing the arguments for action to stem gun violence. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared, \"Just because they cut and run in the dark of night, just because they have left does not mean we are taking no for an answer.\"\n\nThe sit-in, which lasted over 25 hours, came to an end hours after Republicans held a final vote on the Zika response and sent lawmakers home until July 5. The spectacle captured the attention of a Washington gridlocked on guns despite the slaughter in Orlando.\n\nGeorgia Rep. John Lewis, who had participated in the civil rights sit-ins in the 1960s, declared Thursday that \"some progress\" was made in the lawmakers' efforts to get the attention of the nation to recognize the need for a vote on gun control legislation.\n\nRepublicans, however, said their colleagues had accomplished nothing other than disrupting the business of the House to score political points. Pressure had been building on both sides of the Capitol in the wake of the shooting rampage at a Florida gay nightclub earlier this month that killed 49 people and injured 53 others.\n\nThe agitation for action caused a Senate filibuster last week and led to the chaos on the House floor that lasted well into Thursday. A burst of activity in the middle of the night, including recorded votes on some other issues such as the Zika virus, capped more than 15 straight hours of Democratic protests.\n\nThe sit-in had the look of a 1960s-style protest, as some lawmakers sat on the floor, others in their seats. The House chamber grew increasingly chaotic as the night wore on, and some lawmakers took breaks on pillows and blankets.\n\nC-SPAN, a cable and satellite network that provides continual coverage of House and Senate floor proceedings, did not control the cameras. They're run on authorization by legislative leaders. Although the cameras were turned off Wednesday, lawmakers relied on social media to transmit video, using Facebook, Twitter, and Periscope. C-SPAN broadcast live video streamed on Periscope and Facebook from lawmakers' accounts. Democrats posted the Capitol's main telephone number, which was overwhelmed, and urged constituents to call and request a vote. They also encouraged tweeting under the hashtag #NoBillNoBreak.",
    " Title: Trump Delivers Polished Address to Congress, Aims for Bipartisan Cooperation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his debut speech to Congress, President Donald Trump awarded himself a C or C+ in terms of messaging, stating that he would give himself a lower grade on communication. However, the polished and optimistic address delivered on Tuesday night may prompt a revision of this self-assessment.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, described the speech as a \"new face\" on the president that looked very presidential. The speech, delivered after almost six weeks in office, is seen by Trump supporters as a sign that he is hitting his stride and learning from his early stumbles.\n\nThe next phase of Trump's political journey now moves to Congress, where he will embark on the delicate task of trying to pass a budget, and legislation on health care, tax reform, and immigration. Whether this marks a long-awaited pivot toward a more presidential Trump, or a rare night of polished oratory remains to be seen.\n\nWhile even Democratic lawmakers and commentators agreed that the president showed a new face Tuesday, some offered a caveat: A more effective communicator of an unacceptable agenda makes Trump more dangerous. Embedded in Trump's agenda, Democrats warn, is the threat of mass deportations, the gutting of environmental protections, and the loss of health coverage for millions of newly insured low-income Americans.\n\nFor now, Trump is apparently allowing himself to linger in this presidential \"moment,\" and reportedly will not sign a revised travel ban on Wednesday, as planned. The original order, drafted hastily and now on hold, temporarily barred travel to the US by citizens of seven largely Muslim countries and suspended Syrian refugee resettlement.\n\nTrump did not discuss the travel ban in his speech Tuesday, or his reported willingness to allow millions of otherwise law-abiding illegal immigrants to stay in the US and work \u2013 a revival of campaign talk of a compromise on immigration.\n\nOn its face, the content of Trump's speech contained many of the touchstones of a typical State of the Union address. He spoke of healing and hope, and called for bipartisanship in the name of common national purpose.\n\nAnd he began by condemning the recent vandalism and threats against Jewish targets, and the shooting of two Indian men in Kansas last week, following criticism that he was slow to speak out against such attacks.\n\n\"I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength,\" Trump said.\n\nThe speech was centered on policies that serve his controversial campaign theme of \"America first,\" including a major increase in defense spending, a pull-back from multilateral trade agreements, the border wall, and tax cuts for corporations and the middle class. He expressed support for NATO, but also signaled a retrenchment of America's role on the global stage.\n\n\"My job is not to represent the world,\" Trump said. \"My job is to represent the United States of America.\"\n\nIn addition, Trump offered policies that play well across the aisle, such as a call for investment in infrastructure, paid family leave, and guaranteed access to health insurance for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe speech won early high marks from the American public, with 7 in 10 Americans who tuned in saying it made them feel more optimistic about the country, according to a CNN poll.\n\nThese are early days for the mercurial Trump, and it's anybody's guess as to whether he can keep up the more presidential posture he adopted Tuesday night. All through the campaign, as even supporters and family members urged him to tone down the inflammatory rhetoric, he insisted he could be \"presidential.\"\n\nBut he never quite got there, until now. His convention address came across as dark and dystopic; ditto his short inaugural speech, remembered for the phrase \"American carnage.\" Now his supporters have a more positive message to point to.\n\nRepublican strategist Ford O'Connell points to a particular moment of \"optimism and compassion\" in Tuesday's speech: \"Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope.\"\n\nSome Democrats weren't particularly moved by Trump's message. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) dismissed his talk of clean air and water as \"empty\" words. He was also unimpressed by the president's inclusive language.\n\n\"It's just a rehash of everything we've heard before,\" said Senator Merkley, one of the chamber's most liberal members.\n\nDemocrats are in the minority on Capitol Hill, and they have pledged to do everything they can to block a Trump agenda that aims to undo key parts of President Obama's legacy. But Republicans are hopeful.\n\n\"Trump's overall goal of the address was to instill in Congress the 'will to govern,' to compromise where possible in an effort to get things done on behalf of the American people,\" writes Mr. O'Connell in an email. \"It's not an easy task in a broken, bipartisan town like Washington, D.C. But on this night, he succeeded.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Job Growth Slows Down, Unemployment Rate Rises to 8.2 Percent in May\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate increased from 8.1 percent to 8.2 percent last month as businesses across various sectors reduced their hiring activities, according to a report released by the Labor Department on Friday. Job growth fell significantly to 69,000 during the month, marking the weakest growth in a year, and revisions showed that only 77,000 jobs were created in April, far below the 115,000 previously reported.\n\nThe slowdown was observed in numerous industries, with construction, which had seen unusual job gains in the winter due to mild weather, reporting a loss of jobs. The business services sector, a key sector that has created 1.4 million jobs since the end of the recession, lost 1,000 jobs in May. On the positive side, health care, transportation, and wholesaling sectors reported healthy job gains.\n\nEconomists attributed the slowdown to a combination of factors, including the possibility of payback after stronger-than-usual hiring earlier in the year due to warmer-than-normal weather in the winter months, as well as potential signs of a fundamental slowdown in the economy that could lead to further increases in the unemployment rate.\n\nThe average workweek declined 0.1 hour to 34.4 hours in May, and average hourly wages slumped to a 1.7 percent yearly rate, close to a record low. The rise in unemployment was not only due to the slowdown in job growth but also a surge in people looking for work but unable to find jobs. About 642,000 more people went on a job hunt last month, but only 422,000 of those landed jobs, the department said.\n\nEconomists are currently scrambling for an explanation as to why the job market has fallen into a spring slump for the second year in a row. One underlying source of friction, according to Aparna Mathur, economist at the American Enterprise Institute, is the millions of long-term unemployed people who lack the technical skills needed to fill many of the jobs that are coming open, creating a situation where both employers and the unemployed cannot find what they need and want.\n\nThe report has sparked a heated political debate, with Republicans criticizing President Obama's economic policies, while the White House Council of Economic Advisers chairman Alan B. Krueger attributed the slowdown to external factors such as the European economic crisis and the spike in gasoline prices this spring.",
    " Title: President Trump Denies Campaign-Russia Connection, Accuses U.S. Intelligence of Leaking Information\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Wednesday, President Donald Trump denied reports suggesting his associates had contact with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign, labeling the allegations as \"non-sense.\" The President accused the U.S. intelligence community of illegally leaking information to news outlets.\n\n\"This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton\u2019s losing campaign,\" Mr. Trump tweeted. He also claimed that the \"real scandal\" is that the intelligence community is giving out classified information \"like candy.\"\n\nThe President's tweets come after multiple news outlets, including CNN and The New York Times, reported Tuesday that Russian officials were in touch with members of Mr. Trump's team during the campaign. According to CNN, advisers close to Mr. Trump were in \"constant communication during the campaign with Russians known to US intelligence.\"\n\nAmong those reportedly communicating with Russian nationals was former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Manafort, in response, denied ever knowingly talking to any intelligence official or anyone in Russia regarding matters under investigation.\n\n\"I have never had any connection to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin or the Russian government before, during or after the campaign,\" Manafort told CNN.\n\nMr. Trump and his team have consistently denied any contacts between the campaign and Russian officials ahead of the November election. The reports come on the heels of the resignation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who reportedly misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about the nature of his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the November election but before Mr. Trump was sworn into office.",
    " Title: California Primary Election: Clinton and Sanders Battle for Delegates as Unity Concerns Loom\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the California primary election approaches on Tuesday, the race for Democratic delegates remains uncertain, with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders vying for the 475 delegates at stake in the Golden State. In a recent interview with CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Clinton expressed confidence in her chances, stating, \"I believe, on Tuesday, I will have decisively won the popular vote and I will have decisively won the pledged delegate majority.\"\n\nHowever, Sanders' campaign counters that the delegate count and financial resources do not tell the whole story. In a press conference in Los Angeles on Saturday, Sanders stated, \"It is extremely unlikely that Secretary Clinton will have the requisite number of pledged delegates to claim victory on Tuesday night.\" He further predicted that the Democratic National Convention will be a contested convention, with no candidate having enough pledged delegates to secure the nomination outright.\n\nThe ongoing competition between the two candidates has raised concerns about the potential impact on Democratic unity ahead of the general election, with the possibility of a significant portion of Sanders supporters refusing to vote for Clinton if she were the nominee. According to a Quinnipiac University poll, 25% of Sanders supporters would not vote for Clinton in a general election matchup against Donald Trump. In California, the USC Dornsife/LA Times poll indicates that Clinton trails Sanders 43% to 44% among registered voters.\n\nAs of now, Clinton holds 1,809 delegates and 548 superdelegates, totaling 2,357. To secure the nomination, she needs at least 2,382 delegates. The upcoming Democratic primaries on Tuesday, which include California, New Jersey, the Dakotas, Montana, and New Mexico, will award 694 delegates, including 475 in California.\n\nSanders has also been campaigning vigorously in California, emphasizing the importance of voter turnout and his momentum in the race. During a rally outside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, he told supporters, \"If we can win, and win big here in California and in the other states, and in Washington D.C., we are going to go into the Democratic convention with enormous momentum.\"\n\nThe outcome of the California primary and the ensuing contests will significantly shape the Democratic race and the party's unity ahead of the general election.",
    " Title: U.S. Faces Tough Decision on Egypt: Navigating the Complexities of a Military Takeover\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the political landscape in Egypt continues to shift, President Barack Obama finds himself in a precarious position, facing mounting pressure to clarify the U.S.'s response to the ongoing chaos in Cairo. The administration has so far been reluctant to label the current situation as a coup d'etat, instead opting for cautious statements expressing concern.\n\nWith the return of Congress and the Independence Day holiday, the debate over U.S. policy towards Egypt is heating up, blurring traditional partisan and ideological lines. The coalition that once united over the Iraq war is now fractured, with Israel supporters welcoming the ousting of President Mohamed Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood government, while democracy advocates argue that his removal was an illegitimate overthrow of a democratically elected regime.\n\nThe Washington Post and The New York Times have offered contrasting perspectives, with the former criticizing Obama's response as \"feckless\" and the latter praising his \"appropriate caution.\" Under U.S. law, the $1.3 billion in military aid to Egypt must be suspended if Morsi's ouster and the arrest of his allies are formally declared a coup.\n\nTwo emerging camps in Washington are taking shape, each offering a different approach to the Egyptian crisis. One camp, which includes both Republicans and Democrats, argues that the Egyptian military, despite its self-serving culture, is a stabilizing force in the region and a key partner of the U.S. They advocate for maintaining aid to exert influence within the Egyptian power structure and, ideally, to coax the generals back to civilian rule.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) is among those in this camp, stating, \"The Egyptian military has long been a key partner of the United States and a stabilizing force in the region, and is perhaps the only trusted national institution in Egypt today.\"\n\nOn the other hand, some observers argue that the military takeover may merely return Egypt to its previous state of a bloated and dysfunctional government controlled by a self-serving military elite. However, they contend that the removal of the Muslim Brotherhood from power has partially discredited radical Islam, a significant threat to global peace.\n\nAs the situation in Egypt remains fluid, President Obama will need to make a clear choice. His decision will not only impact the future of Egypt but also the broader region and U.S.-Egypt relations. The choice will be a difficult one, as both sides in this complex conflict present their own set of challenges and uncertainties.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates Express Frustration Over Debate Format, Rapid-Fire Exchanges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the second round of Democratic presidential debates, several candidates, including Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, have expressed frustration with the debate format they believe did not allow for in-depth discussion of policy issues.\n\nThe debates, which took place in Detroit on July 30 and 31, featured ten candidates each night, a crowded field that has led to rapid-fire exchanges. This format, according to the candidates, did not provide ample time for each candidate to explain their views, leading to sound-bite-oriented discussions.\n\nU.S. Senator Kamala Harris, who faced a series of attacks on her record during Wednesday's debate, stated, \"It can be a frustrating process. There are so many of these issues that can not be captured in 60 seconds.\" Harris, a U.S. senator from California, added, \"It is a process that is conducive to sound bites.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic front-runner, who was also a target of attacks over healthcare, immigration, and criminal justice reform, echoed Harris' sentiments. \"That's not a debate,\" Biden said. \"I understand why it has to be that way, but I'm looking forward to getting to a place where we can actually exchange ideas.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has doubled the fundraising and polling requirements to qualify for participation in an effort to reduce the number of candidates on stage for the next debate, which is not until September.\n\nBoth Biden and Harris acknowledged that they were not surprised to be the target of attacks from all directions during the debate. Harris stated, \"If you're considered a front-runner, you should be prepared to take a hit.\" Biden added, \"This, going back 10, 20, or 30 years, is just a game to make sure we hand the Republicans an election.\"\n\nThe candidates' clashes, particularly between Biden and Harris over their healthcare plans, have been a topic of discussion. Harris criticized Biden for leaving too many people uninsured under his proposal, while Biden ridiculed the idea that Harris' plan would not require a middle-class tax hike.\n\nCory Booker, a U.S. senator from New Jersey who clashed with Biden on criminal justice records, expressed optimism about the primary debates, stating, \"We may be having a primary debate right now, but we know we are going to close ranks behind the candidate.\"",
    " Title: Moore Denies Sexual Misconduct Allegations, Accuses Washington Post of Political Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a defiant response to the allegations made by The Washington Post, embattled Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore has accused the newspaper of having a \"political agenda.\" During a campaign appearance in Birmingham on Saturday, Moore stated, \"In the next few days, there will be revelations about the motivation and the content of this article.\"\n\nMoore, a former chief justice of Alabama's Supreme Court and a staunch social conservative, has been accused of pursuing relationships with four teenage women dating back to the 1970s when he was in his early thirties and single. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that one woman claimed she was 14 when the 32-year-old Moore asked her out and made sexual advances.\n\nIn response to the allegations, Moore admitted on Sean Hannity's radio show that \"after my return from the military, I dated a lot of young ladies.\" However, during his Saturday appearance, Moore insisted the accusations about his conduct \"nearly 40 years ago\" are \"completely false and untrue.\"\n\n\"I have not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone,\" Moore said.\n\nThe allegations have caused significant damage to Moore's campaign ahead of next month's special election for the seat once held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Top Republicans, including President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have called for Moore to drop out of the race if the allegations are true. However, Moore has shown no sign of doing so.\n\nMoore also accused The Washington Post, which has endorsed his Democratic opponent Doug Jones, of \"yet another attack on my character and reputation in a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign for United States Senate.\"\n\nThe story has sparked talk of possible write-in campaigns from other Republicans, though nothing has yet materialized. On Saturday, President Trump, who has been traveling in Asia over the past week, did not seem interested in commenting further on the situation, stating he's been too busy reading documents and has not had time to catch up on television news coverage about Moore.",
    " Title: Washington Post Apologizes for Controversial Cartoon Depicting Sen. Ted Cruz's Children\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a swift response to public outcry, The Washington Post has removed a controversial cartoon by Ann Telnaes, the paper's editorial cartoonist, that depicted Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and his two daughters. The cartoon, which was published earlier this week, sparked a wave of criticism from both Cruz and his fellow Republican presidential candidate, Senator Marco Rubio (R-Florida), as well as a fundraising appeal from the Cruz campaign.\n\nThe cartoon, which has since been taken down, depicted Cruz dressed as Santa Claus accompanied by his two daughters, who were dressed in red outfits and appeared to be attached to strings, as Cruz put it. Cruz, who spent his 45th birthday Tuesday campaigning across several SEC primary states, responded swiftly to the Washington Post cartoon on Twitter, calling it \"classy\" and stating that the newspaper was attacking his girls, who are \"out of your league.\"\n\nRubio later tweeted his own disgust for the newspaper and support for Cruz, stating that the cartoon featuring Cruz's children was \"disgusting\" and that The Post's statement that the kids are \"fair game\" was even worse.\n\nThe Cruz campaign was quick to turn the cartoon into a fundraising appeal to supporters, characterizing it as an attack on Cruz and his family from the \"liberal media.\" The first line of the email from Cruz, which includes a screen grab of the cartoon, reads, \"I'm sickened... I knew I'd be facing attacks from day one of my campaign but I never expected anything like this.\"\n\nIn response to the backlash, The Washington Post's editorial page editor, Fred Hiatt, issued an editor's note stating, \"It's generally been the policy of our editorial section to leave children out of it. I failed to look at this cartoon before it was published. I understand why Ann thought an exception to the policy was warranted in this case, but I do not agree.\"\n\nThe headline of the original article still stands, reading, \"Ted Cruz uses his kids as political props (updated with statement),\" but the cartoon has been replaced with the editor's note. The Washington Post has not issued a formal apology to Cruz or his family.",
    " Title: \"The Road to Herd Immunity: Cautious Optimism and the Pursuit of a Coronavirus Vaccine\"\n\nThe global race to develop a coronavirus vaccine is in full swing, with over 100 potential candidates in various stages of development. The U.S., spearheaded by the Trump administration's \"Operation Warp Speed,\" aims to have millions of doses available by the end of the year. However, experts caution that a game-changing vaccine may not be just a few months away, and preparations for a long-term response are equally crucial.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, expressed \"cautious optimism\" that a vaccine could be ready by early 2021. To achieve herd immunity, experts estimate that about 70 percent of the population must develop immunity, either through vaccination or recovery from the virus. The alternative\u2014waiting for natural infections to build herd immunity\u2014could lead to millions of deaths, epidemiologists warn.\n\nWhile promising progress is being made on several vaccine candidates, there are valid reasons to remain skeptical of a vaccine being available in a matter of months. Developing a vaccine in such a short timeframe would break the current record of four years for the fastest vaccine ever developed. Even if this milestone is achieved, drug companies will still need to produce hundreds of millions of doses and distribute them efficiently.\n\nSome experts worry about investing too heavily in a best-case scenario, suggesting that a more prudent approach would be to focus on developing effective systems for testing, tracing, and therapeutic medicines that can last as long as they're needed. There is also concern that the idea of a vaccine being imminent may be hindering the implementation of necessary virus mitigation measures in the present.\n\nRushing development could increase the risk of an unsafe vaccine reaching the market first, which may exacerbate anti-vaccine sentiment among the public and undermine herd immunity. Additionally, any setbacks could further delay the vaccine's availability, and there is a possibility that any new vaccine may not be entirely effective or may provide immunity for a limited period.\n\nAs Dr. Fauci stated, \"An approved coronavirus vaccine won't do any good if people aren't willing to roll up their sleeves for it.\" A vaccine won't be a magic solution, but it remains the best path out of the pandemic. In the words of Caroline Chen from ProPublica, \"There's much to be hopeful about, and enormous challenges lie ahead.\"",
    " Title: Former College Interns Reflect on Personal Growth and Political Evolution in Shared Journey\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an intimate conversation, two former college interns, Lindsey and Annie, reminisce about their shared journey of personal growth and political evolution during their time in Washington D.C. The duo, who hail from the University of Oklahoma, discuss their political leanings, the impact of feminism, and the importance of self-discovery in their formative years.\n\nLindsey, who was once a self-proclaimed Republican, shares her experiences growing up in a socially liberal, fiscally conservative household. She explains that her political affiliation has shifted over time, but her core values remain unchanged. Annie, on the other hand, maintains a strong connection to the Democratic Party, a bond forged by her family's political beliefs.\n\nThe turning point in their relationship came when Lindsey, initially skeptical of feminism, was enlightened by Annie's explanation of the movement's importance. Lindsey admits to having a misguided understanding of feminism, believing it to be a system that catered to women without merit. However, through conversations with Annie and her peers, Lindsey came to understand the uneven playing field and the importance of feminism in advocating for equal treatment and opportunities for women.\n\nAnnie, in turn, credits Lindsey for teaching her the value of self-confidence and the importance of embracing her womanhood. Annie recalls feeling insecure and ashamed, while Lindsey exuded a level of self-assuredness that was foreign to her. Lindsey, in her own words, taught Annie that her body and sexuality should be celebrated, not hidden or ashamed.\n\nThe duo's shared journey serves as a testament to the power of open dialogue, self-discovery, and the transformative impact of feminism. Their story underscores the importance of understanding and respecting differing viewpoints, while also highlighting the role models that can shape and empower individuals during their formative years.",
    " Title: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Laments Partisanship, Expresses Hope for Bipartisan Cooperation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a talk at Stanford University on Monday, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg voiced her concerns over the current partisanship in Congress, expressing a hope that it would return to an era where it worked for the good of the country and not just along party lines. Ginsburg refrained from commenting on the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court seat vacated by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, as well as President Donald Trump's travel ban, which could potentially be heard by the high court.\n\nDuring the discussion, Ginsburg did express a desire to change the Electoral College, a comment that was met with applause from the packed church. She did not elaborate on her reasons for this desire.\n\nGinsburg had previously stated during the presidential campaign that she presumed Democrat Hillary Clinton would win and would have the opportunity to make a few appointments to the court. She had also called Trump a \"faker\" with an \"ego\" in one interview.\n\nOn Monday, Ginsburg recalled receiving bipartisan support for her nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, stating that Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch was her most ardent supporter. \"I think today he wouldn't touch me with a 10-foot pole,\" she joked.\n\nGinsburg's talk was billed as an exploration of what it means to lead a meaningful life. The discussion took place after Trump last week nominated Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, a nomination that would likely restore the court's conservative tilt.\n\nAs the leader of the court's liberal wing and the oldest justice on the court, Ginsburg's health and future impact on the court has been a topic of concern among liberals. With Trump's potential opportunity to replace her or any of the other liberal judges on the bench, her supporters have joked about steps she could take to stay healthy, such as eating more kale.\n\nWhen asked by a Stanford student who else should eat more kale in Washington, D.C., the justice quipped, \"Justice Kennedy.\" Anthony Kennedy, 80, is the second oldest justice on the Supreme Court and is considered a swing vote.\n\nGinsburg has shown no signs of slowing down and has said she has a personal trainer who leads her through hour-long workouts that include push-ups and weights. She emphasized the importance of family in her life and expressed a resilient attitude, stating, \"The attitude is I'm going to surmount this whatever it is.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court Ruling Leaves FCC Free to Modify Indecency Policy, Protecting Children from Broadcast Content\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the indecency case FCC vs. Fox Television Stations, leaving the door open for the FCC to modify its current policy regarding profanity and nudity on television. The ruling, however, does not determine whether the FCC's indecency rules violate the First Amendment.\n\nThe court's decision avoids the central question of whether the FCC's indecency rules, which police passing profanity or fleeting glimpses of nudity on air, infringe on the First Amendment. Instead, the court ruled 8-0 that the FCC ran afoul of due process by failing to give the networks fair notice that they had broken the rules, thus letting them off the hook from paying steep fines.\n\nThe ruling leaves the FCC \"free to modify its current indecency policy in light of its determination of the public interest and applicable legal requirements,\" according to Justice Anthony Kennedy. The courts, Kennedy added, are also free to review the current policy or any modified policy.\n\nFCC commissioners are now reviewing the decision, with Chairman Julius Genachowski remaining noncommittal about the panel's next steps. In a statement, Genachowski said the commission is reviewing the decision, which appears to be narrowly limited to procedural issues related to actions taken a number of years ago. However, he also assured lawmakers that the FCC will continue to protect young TV viewers in line with the First Amendment principles.\n\nLawmakers from both parties have expressed support for the continuation of broadcast regulations. \"The decision leaves in place the FCC's authority to protect children from indecent programming,\" said Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), chairman of the commerce committee. \"This is a victory for those of us who believe that we must be doing more, not less, to give the FCC and parents all across America the resources they need to protect their children from indecent programming.\"\n\nThe ruling means Fox and ABC won't have to worry about FCC fines and sanctions in their cases, and it signals that the FCC should go back to the drawing board to tweak its policy. \"This is great for the parties, both Fox and ABC; they're done. The commission sanctions are no more,\" said broadcast attorney Jack Goodman. \"In terms of the issue of whether the commission can continue to have an indecency policy at all and whether that indecency policy is constitutional as established, [those] are left for another day.\"\n\nThe case stems from a series of court findings sparked by the FCC's decision to change the indecency rules following rock star Bono's impromptu utterance during his acceptance speech at the 2003 Golden Globe Awards on NBC. During the broadcast, Bono said, \"This is really, really f---ing brilliant.\" The FCC decided in 2004 that broadcasters could be fined for airing a \"fleeting expletive.\" Since the commission changed its rules, it decided not to fine NBC at the time.",

The positive movement in the markets was driven by news from China about potential tariff and currency moves that could ease trade tensions.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index soared to a record close, led by the technology, health-care, and financial sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also reached a new pinnacle, with 28 of 30 constituents flashing green. Most European and Asian shares also gained, indicating a positive trend in global equity markets.\n\nTrade conflicts that had stocks gyrating earlier in the week have since cooled off. China is reportedly planning to cut the average tariff rate it charges on imports from the majority of its trading partners as soon as next month. On Wednesday, Premier Li Keqiang stated that China's government would not devalue the currency in order to boost its exports amid the trade war.\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries held above 3 percent, near its high for the year. The greenback weakened after a report suggested that the U.S. and Canada are unlikely to reach a deal on NAFTA in Washington this week. Jobless data was solid but did little to change the mood. The pound surged after August retail sales came in higher than expected.\n\nEquity markets have so far remained resilient in the face of rising bond yields, suggesting investors are comfortable with the outlook for corporate earnings and global growth even as borrowing costs rise along with trade tensions. Ahead of the Fed meeting next week, some other central banks, such as Norway's policy makers, raised interest rates for the first time in seven years, while the SNB kept deposit rates unchanged.\n\nElsewhere, emerging-market assets continued to rally off the lows seen earlier this month, with the rand among the leading developing-world currencies as the South African Reserve Bank held its key interest rate at a two-year low. Norway's krone retreated as investors saw the central bank's rate trajectory as dovish, while the Swiss franc strengthened.\n\nWest Texas crude dropped after U.S. President Donald Trump resumed his criticism of OPEC on Twitter. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies meet in Algiers this weekend. The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Dollar Spot Index decreased 0.4 percent to the lowest in eight weeks, while the Japanese yen sank 0.1 percent to 112.41 per dollar.

Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar from entering the country as part of a planned visit, a reversal that comes amid pressure from President Trump and concerns about their support for boycotts of Israel. The move has sparked a significant outcry from Democratic lawmakers in Washington, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling it a \"sign of weakness\" and Omar accusing Israel of implementing \"Trump\u2019s Muslim ban.\"\n\nThe Israeli government defended the decision, suggesting that the lawmakers had ulterior motives with their planned trip. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, explaining the decision at length on his office's Twitter account, said that Tlaib and Omar's itinerary \"revealed that they planned a visit whose sole objective is to strengthen the boycott against us and deny Israel's legitimacy.\"\n\nNetanyahu pointed out that the Palestinian organization that planned the visit, MIFTAH, supports the boycott movement, and that people associated with the group have supported terror against Israel in the past. He also noted that the congresswomen were not interested in meeting with Israeli officials.\n\nThe decision was made by Interior Minister Arye Deri and announced earlier Thursday by deputy foreign minister Tzipi Hotovely, despite prior assurances that the congresswomen would be allowed in. \"Israel has decided \u2014 we won\u2019t enable the members of Congress to enter the country,\" Hotovely told public broadcaster Kan. \"We won\u2019t allow those who deny our right to exist in this world to enter Israel.\"\n\nOmar and Tlaib were among 17 members of Congress who voted against a resolution condemning the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement in July. This was after Omar introduced a resolution of her own that encouraged the use of boycotts as a political tool.\n\nNetanyahu confirmed that Deri would consider permitting Tlaib to visit her Palestinian family members if she filed a humanitarian request and promised not to promote boycotts of Israel while she visits.\n\nPresident Trump cheered the decision, tweeting, \"Representatives Omar and Tlaib are the face of the Democrat Party, and they HATE Israel!\" This, after he publicly pressured Israel to stand firm in blocking Omar and Tlaib amid earlier reports that the government was considering doing so.\n\nWhile the U.S. ambassador to Israel put out a statement of support for the decision, Democratic lawmakers and even Israel's Washington allies were critical. Notably, pro-Israel lobby AIPAC tweeted that while they disagree with Omar and Tlaib's positions, \"We also believe every member of Congress should be able to visit and experience our democratic ally Israel firsthand.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers expressed strong opposition to keeping Omar and Tlaib out. \"Banning Congresswomen Omar and Tlaib from entering Israel and Palestine is a sign of enormous disrespect to these elected leaders, to the United States Congress, and to the principles of democracy,\" presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in a tweet. \"The Israeli government should reverse this decision and allow them in.\"\n\nAnother presidential candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., weighed in before the decision was formally announced. \"Israel doesn't advance its case as a tolerant democracy or unwavering US ally by barring elected members of Congress from visiting because of their political views,\" Warren tweeted, saying it would be \"shameful\" and \"unprecedented.\"\n\nThe Jerusalem Post reported Thursday that Netanyahu met Wednesday with Deri, Foreign Minister Israel Katz, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, National Security Council leader Meir Ben-Shabbat, and Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit to discuss the matter.\n\nBefore the formal denial, Israeli Channel 13's Barak Ravid reported, according to officials, that Netanyahu had been considering allowing Tlaib and Omar to enter Israel, but only to travel within the territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Tlaib and Omar had been scheduled to arrive in Israel on Friday.",

This represents a significant increase from the 380 cases reported last week.\n\nThe CDC reported Thursday morning that seven deaths resulting from vaping-related illness have been confirmed in six states, with more expected. By Thursday evening, the Missouri Department of Health confirmed the first death in Missouri, making it the eighth nationwide.\n\n\"We are in desperate need of facts,\" said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products. Zeller clarified that the criminal probe will not focus on personal use of vaping-related products but will instead investigate the products themselves, their sources, and their usage.\n\nThe cause of the outbreak remains elusive, with no consistent product, substance, or brand identified in all cases. Most, but not all, patients reported a history of using e-cigarette products containing THC, a psychoactive chemical found in cannabis.\n\nThe FDA has collected over 150 vaping product samples for forensic analysis, testing them for traces of nicotine, THC, and other cannabinoids, opioids, cutting agents, additives, pesticides, poisons, toxins, and more. While vitamin E acetate has been found in some of the FDA's lab samples, no singular compound has been identified in all the samples.\n\nOfficials continue to warn consumers against purchasing vapes off the street or modifying vape products. \"People are dying,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director at CDC. \"We ask you to take these recommendations seriously.\"\n\nOf the reported cases, about three-fourths of those diagnosed with an illness have been male, slightly over-representative of males in the general vaping population. Young people have been particularly affected, with more than half of those who have gotten sick being under 25, and 2 out of 3 cases being people between 18 and 34 years old.\n\nIn an effort to crack the case, Illinois health officials are turning to the public for help. \"We are asking Illinois residents who have recently vaped to fill out an online, anonymous survey regarding their vaping habits,\" said Dr. Jennifer Layden, chief medical officer and state epidemiologist for the Illinois Department of Public Health. No personal information will be collected in the survey, which is being advertised through social media.\n\nAs e-cigarette maker Juul faces lawsuits across the country, politicians, businesses, and individuals are taking action against the vaping industry. On Thursday, U.S. Reps. Diana DeGette (D-CO), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), and Peter King (R-NY) announced the formation of a new congressional caucus aimed at curbing the nation's teen-vaping epidemic.\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump announced plans to ban the sale of flavored vaping products in an effort to discourage young people from using e-cigarettes. Michigan became the first state to ban sales of flavored e-cigarettes in stores and online, citing health concerns related to vaping. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called for a ban a week later, and other cities are now considering similar measures.\n\nCBS, WarnerMedia, and Viacom announced this week that they will no longer run advertisements for e-cigarettes on their networks. Many young people who previously vaped are taking to social media to warn their peers about the dangers of e-cigarettes, with Miami teen Chance Ammirata, who was hospitalized with a vaping-related illness, posting about his journey with the hashtag \"#lunglove.\"\n\n\"The fight has just begun,\" Ammirata said in a recent post.",

Vyacheslav Ponomarev, self-proclaimed people's mayor of Slovyansk, a city 90 miles west of Russia, described the detained observers as \"captives.\"\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Ponomarev stated, \"As we found maps on them containing information about the location of our checkpoints, we get the impression that they are officers carrying out a certain spying mission.\"\n\nUkraine's state security service issued a statement Saturday claiming that \"the official representatives of the OSCE are being held in inhuman conditions\" and that \"among those detained is a person who needs immediate medical help,\" according to Russia Today.\n\nThe German-led, eight-member team was traveling under the auspices of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe when they were detained. Germany's Defense Ministry said it had lost contact with the team, which included five Ukrainians.\n\nTim Guldimann, OSCE's special envoy for Ukraine, told German public radio WDR on Saturday that \"efforts are being made to solve this issue.\" He declined to elaborate.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine's acting prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk met with Pope Francis at the Vatican, but escalating Ukrainian-Russian tensions prompted him to return home instead of staying for the canonization ceremony on Sunday.\n\nFrancis gave Yatsenyuk a fountain pen, telling him, \"I hope that you write 'peace' with this pen.\"\n\nIn a joint statement released Friday night by the White House, the United States and other nations in the Group of Seven agreed to \"move swiftly\" to impose additional economic sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine.

    " Title: FBI Investigates \"Targeted Attack\" on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Offices in Texas\n\nArticle:\n\n- The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has classified the shooting incident at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) offices in San Antonio, Texas, as a \"targeted attack\" against federal employees.\n- The shooting occurred at around 03:00 local time (08:00 GMT) on Tuesday, with several shots fired at the ICE offices and two neighboring buildings.\n- According to the FBI, no injuries were reported, and the incident involved shots being fired at the offices on two different floors. The FBI is currently reviewing surveillance footage as part of its investigation.\n- ICE has blamed the shootings on \"political rhetoric\" and \"misinformation\" about the Trump administration's detention policies.\n- Daniel Bible, ICE's director for San Antonio, stated that the shootings \"shroud our critical law enforcement function and unnecessarily put our officers' safety at risk.\"\n- Christopher Combs, head of the FBI's San Antonio operations, described the shootings as \"cowardly, brazen, violent acts\" and said those responsible \"did some research\" because they \"knew what floors ICE was on, and they hit those.\"\n- Bullet holes can be seen in several windows at the buildings located near Brookhaven Drive, north-east San Antonio. A picture tweeted by Ken Cuccinelli, acting head of Citizenship and Immigration Services, shows a bullet hole in a window at one of the offices targeted.\n- The building is mainly used for executive and administrative purposes, ICE said.\n- According to the Washington Examiner, the shooting is the latest of four recent attacks at ICE facilities across the country. The three previous incidents happened in Washington DC, Tacoma, Washington, and Aurora, Colorado, within days of each other in July.\n- Given the current climate, FBI investigators fear there could be more attacks. \"We can not allow political discourse to lead us to the point of violence, where federal employees, innocent people doing their jobs, are put in harm's way,\" Mr. Combs said.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Vows to Concede if Biden Secures Plurality of Delegates Ahead of Democratic National Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development for the Democratic primary race, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has announced that he will drop out of the race if, by the time of the Democratic National Convention, former Vice President Joe Biden has a plurality of delegates.\n\nThe Democratic primary candidates need a majority (1,991 delegates) to secure the nomination. Projections have shown throughout the primary so far that there is a significant chance that no candidate will get that many. If no candidate gets a majority, the primary goes to a second ballot. Superdelegates, who make up about 15% of all delegates, can vote on the second ballot. Superdelegates include major elected officials, former presidents or vice presidents, and prominent members of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nSanders' decision to concede the nomination to Biden, even if Biden only has a plurality rather than a majority of delegates, is a move aimed at avoiding a contested convention. Sanders stated, \"I think it would be a real, real disaster for the Democratic Party\" if a contested convention were to occur. \"People would say 'the person who won the most votes didn't get selected.' Not a good idea,\" Sanders added.\n\nThis decision could be seen as Sanders sticking to his dislike of superdelegates and his loyalty to the will of the people. However, it is more likely that Sanders is trying to set a standard for the convention that he hopes Biden will follow if Sanders enters the convention with a plurality.\n\nCurrently, Biden has 596 delegates, while Sanders has 531. Biden has gained momentum in the past seven days, winning 581 of his 596 delegates with big wins in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday. If Biden enters the convention with a plurality and Sanders pushes it to the second ballot, Biden would likely win most of the superdelegates and get the nomination anyway because he is the establishment candidate. Sanders conceding would just make that process easier.\n\nHowever, if Sanders, who is openly hostile to the Democratic establishment, enters with a plurality and Biden pushes it to a second ballot, there is a significant chance that Sanders will have the nomination taken from him. The race for the Democratic nomination is heating up, and the outcome remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Outlines Democratic Socialism Ideology, Emphasizing Human Rights in CNN Town Hall Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a CNN town hall event on Monday night, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders outlined his vision of democratic socialism, emphasizing the importance of human rights, including a living wage and free college tuition for all Americans.\n\nDuring the event, moderated by CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Sanders was asked to respond to President Trump's repeated attacks on socialism. Trump, in his State of the Union address earlier this month, declared that \"America will never be a socialist country.\"\n\nSanders responded by stating that the country is moving in that direction whether the president likes it or not. \"If I am elected president, we will have a nation in which all people will have health care as a right, whether Trump likes it or not,\" the senator said. \"We are going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We are going to raise the minimum wage to a living wage of at least $15 an hour.\"\n\nSanders also addressed climate change, stating that it is a disgrace and an embarrassment that the United States has a president who rejects science and does not understand that climate change is real and caused by human activity.\n\nDuring the Q&A, a woman in the audience asked Sanders to explain why democratic socialism is preferable to capitalism. Sanders explained that while the United States prides itself on political rights, there are no economic guarantees.\n\n\"We don't have guarantees regarding economic rights,\" he said. \"We've got to understand that everybody needs a decent paying job, that people need health care, that people need an education... These are not radical ideas.\"\n\nSanders added that democratic socialism means having a civilized society with the understanding that we can make sure that all of our people live in security and in dignity. \"So what democratic socialism means to me is having a nation in which all people have the right to a living wage, to health care, to education, and to a healthy and habitable planet,\" he concluded.",
    " Title: Cruz and Kasich Announce Strategic Partnership to Block Trump's Path to Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Republican presidential candidates Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich announced a strategic partnership on Sunday, a move that both candidates had previously sworn off: an official alliance. The two candidates have agreed to divide some of the remaining primary states, avoiding competition in three states.\n\nSenator Cruz, for instance, largely avoided campaigning in New York, where polls showed he was trailing Trump in the run-up to the April 19 primary, and instead focused on California. Governor Kasich, on the other hand, cut his losses in the South, campaigning in Vermont and Massachusetts instead, where he had better poll numbers, in the week before South Carolina's primary.\n\nThis Sunday's announcement marks a new political twist. Both Cruz and Kasich released formal statements to share their strategy with American voters. According to Kasich's campaign, \"Keeping Trump from winning a plurality in Indiana is critical to keeping him under 1,237 bound delegates before Cleveland,\" where the Republican National Convention will be held July 18-21. \"We are very comfortable with our delegate position in Indiana already, and given the current dynamics of the primary there, we will shift our campaign\u2019s resources West and give the Cruz campaign a clear path in Indiana.\"\n\nCruz and Kasich have been fighting for the #NeverTrump vote since the field shrunk to three candidates last month. However, Cruz was initially fighting for a conventional nomination, while Kasich has long banked on a contested convention. Now, after the probability of a Cruz pre-convention was shrunk to nearly nil by the New York primary, the two candidates share the same #NeverTrump goal: block Trump from reaching 1,237 delegates before the Republican National Convention in July.\n\n\"Having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in November would be a sure disaster for Republicans,\" said Cruz's campaign manager Jeff Roe in a statement Sunday. \"To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Party and win in November, our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov. Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico, and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead.\"\n\nTrump, in response, tweeted, \"Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!\" and \"Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!\"\n\nWhile Cruz and Kasich's strategy is surprising and a first for modern presidential elections, their specific allocation of Indiana, Oregon, and New Mexico might be perplexing. The choice of these three states can't be defended by primary dates. Five Northeastern states hold primaries on Tuesday. Indiana's Republican primary is on May 3, followed by Nebraska and West Virginia before Oregon's primary on May 17. And New Mexico's primary occurs on the last primary voting day for Republicans, June 7.\n\nThese three states are not exactly rich with delegates. Indiana has 57 delegates up for grabs, which is not insubstantial but is also less than Pennsylvania's 71 the week before. And on Kasich's end of the agreement, he is looking to gain Oregon's 28 delegates and New Mexico's 24. Of the five GOP primaries on June 7, New Mexico has the least amount of delegates, led by California's 172 delegates and New Jersey's 51.\n\nInstead, the Cruz-Kasich alliance highlights the importance of Indiana. This late in the race, with Trump so close to 1,237, Indiana's 57 delegates could be a game changer. A Cruz win in Indiana is the best prospect for a contested convention.\n\n\"[Indiana] is likely to be the biggest battleground in coming weeks, given both the closeness of the race and the huge haul of delegates,\" explains Politico's Shane Goldmacher last week. \"If Trump is to get to 1,237 delegates, he would likely need to win Indiana. Without it, his best mathematical alternative would be either to flip a likely Cruz state \u2013 Montana or South Dakota \u2013 or to sweep almost all 172 of California's delegates, a tall task.\"\n\nDespite a polling blackout in Indiana due to a state law that prohibits automated polling, it's looking like a good state for Cruz. The Upshot's demographic-based model has Cruz leading Trump 43 to 40 percent with Kasich trailing at 16 percent. And two anonymous polling groups told Politico last week that Cruz and Trump were in a statistical tie, both with 32 percent. Giving Oregon to Kasich also makes sense for the #NeverTrump duo, as early polls predict Kasich winning that primary over Cruz and Trump.\n\n\"It may sound strange, but when you start gaming out the rest of the primary contest, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that [Trump's] quest to reach a majority of delegates before the convention could all turn on Indiana,\" adds The New York Times' Nate Cohn. \"If you divvy up the states by expected results, Mr. Trump wins big in the East and West Virginia, loses the winner-take-all rural Western states, and earns his expected share of proportional delegates in Washington, Oregon, and New Mexico.\"\n\nThis puts Trump 175 delegates short of the nomination. If Kasich needs a contested convention for a chance to win the presidential election, and Cruz winning Indiana is the best chance for a contested convention, then giving Indiana to Cruz is the best option for both sides of the #NeverTrump fight.",
    " Title: President Obama Kicks Off Fiscal Cliff Discussions with Labor Leaders, Aims to Leverage Election Victory for Policy Shaping\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to steer clear of the looming \"fiscal cliff,\" President Barack Obama convened with labor leaders at the White House on Tuesday. This meeting marks the first of many sessions aimed at avoiding automatic tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect at the start of the new year.\n\nThe meeting comes a week after Obama's re-election, demonstrating the President's commitment to translating his electoral success into policy-shaping influence. The 62 million Americans who voted to re-elect Obama in 2012 have a clear understanding of his policy objectives, particularly his stance on raising taxes for the wealthiest Americans.\n\nDuring the 2012 election, Obama's desire to increase taxes for the wealthy was a recurring theme, whether in stalled budget talks with congressional Republicans or during the lengthy presidential campaign. In his victory speech, Obama highlighted the public's support for his approach, stating, \"We found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach.\"\n\nExit polls revealed that 60% of voters believe income taxes should increase, either for the wealthiest Americans or for all. This includes 40% of voters who supported Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nFormer White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, now the mayor of Chicago, believes lawmakers should heed these numbers. At Obama's victory celebration last week, Emanuel suggested that the election results could pave the way for the kind of compromise President Clinton achieved with a Republican Congress when he was re-elected in 1996.\n\nRepublican House Speaker John Boehner has shown some willingness to collect more tax revenue from the wealthy, provided it can be done without raising tax rates. Obama has expressed encouragement over Boehner's newfound flexibility, but he is not passively waiting for congressional Republicans to align with the majority of voters.\n\nObama has emphasized the importance of public pressure in moving a reluctant Congress. He suggested he might turn to the public more frequently in the future to exert this pressure. However, Obama acknowledged the challenges in maintaining public focus during lengthy debates over tax policy.\n\nDespite these challenges, Obama remains determined to engage more with the American people in his second term. He told voters in Ohio before the election that their involvement is crucial for the democratic process to function effectively.\n\nThese meetings with labor leaders and CEOs are part of Obama's strategy to gather support as he enters negotiations with Congress, not just from his grassroots supporters, but also from the business community. The President's goal is to navigate the fiscal cliff and shape policy in line with the will of the majority of American voters.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Issues Decree on Transgender Student Rights in Public Schools\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to escalate the ongoing national debate on LGBT rights, the Obama administration has announced that it will send a decree to all US public schools, requiring them to allow transgender students access to facilities consistent with their gender identity. This decision comes in response to North Carolina's controversial \"bathroom bill\" and is aimed at protecting transgender students from discrimination.\n\nThe decree, set to be sent on Friday, offers guidelines to school districts across the country on how to ensure fair treatment and appropriate facilities for transgender students. The letter, obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588, does not add new legal requirements but provides extensive guidelines on ensuring trans students' rights.\n\nThe letter states that schools may provide separate facilities based on sex, but they must allow transgender students access to such facilities consistent with their gender identity. Schools are also prohibited from requiring transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so.\n\nThe decree also makes clear that transgender students must have access to facilities \"even in circumstances in which other students, parents or community members raise objections or concerns.\" The letter emphasizes that accommodating others' discomfort cannot justify a policy that singles out and disadvantages transgender students.\n\nThe notice is accompanied by a lengthy document providing examples of policies and emerging practices for supporting transgender students, as well as guidelines on privacy, confidentiality, anti-bullying, and other issues affecting LGBT students.\n\nUS Attorney General Loretta Lynch commented, \"There is no room in our schools for discrimination of any kind, including discrimination against transgender students on the basis of their sex.\" She added, \"This guidance gives administrators, teachers, and parents the tools they need to protect transgender students from peer harassment and to identify and address unjust school policies.\"\n\nThe announcement comes as the justice department and North Carolina move forward with a high-profile legal battle over the state's bathroom law. The law, HB2, has been criticized for forcing trans people to use restrooms that correspond to the sex assigned to them at birth, which critics say is unenforceable and a clear violation of the US Civil Rights Act.\n\nThe fight over trans rights extends beyond North Carolina. A federal appeals court in Virginia recently ruled that barring a transgender boy from using the boys' bathroom was a civil rights violation, and school officials in Chicago and Oregon have recently outlined protections for trans students.",
    " Title: House and Senate Leaders at Impasse as Fiscal Cliff Deadline Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a high-level telephone conference call, House Republican leaders have called on the Senate to act, leaving open the possibility of bringing last-minute legislation to the House floor if the Senate passes it. The statement, issued on behalf of Speaker John A. Boehner and his top lieutenants, stated that the House would act on any Senate-passed legislation, but the Senate must act first.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, however, has called on House Republicans to pass an existing Senate measure that would prevent tax increases on household income up to $250,000. In a statement, Reid criticized House Republicans for their Tea Party bills and accused them of obstruction.\n\nAs of Thursday evening, Senators will return to the Capitol with no immediate legislation to consider. The House is expected to be gaveled into session at 2 p.m., but since Speaker Boehner has not recalled members to Washington, it will likely be gaveled back into recess shortly thereafter.\n\nThe focus has shifted to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader and a deal-making veteran. Democrats are seeking assurances from McConnell that he will not use procedural tactics to delay any potential bill aimed at averting the fiscal crisis.\n\nDon Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell, stated that neither the White House nor Reid's office has reached out to begin negotiations. Democrats argue that McConnell is well aware of their proposed legislation: the Senate bill that passed in July, which extends all the expiring Bush-era income tax cuts on incomes below $250,000, sets the tax rate on dividends and capital gains at 20 percent, and prevents the alternative minimum tax from rising to hit more middle-class taxpayers. Democrats also want to add an extension of expiring unemployment benefits and a delay in across-the-board spending cuts while negotiations on a broader deficit reduction plan are pushed into next year.\n\nDemocrats now suggest that Republicans are content to wait until after the January deadline. On Jan. 3, Boehner is likely to be re-elected speaker for the 113th Congress. After that roll call, he may feel less pressure from his right flank against a deal.\n\nThe Senate may simply be running out of time. Without unanimous agreement, Reid would have to take procedural steps to begin considering a bill. He could then be forced to press for another vote to cut off debate before final passage. If forced to jump through those hoops, the 112th Congress could expire before final votes could be cast.\n\nRepresentative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, said on CNBC on Wednesday, \"I think there's some chance that we get a deal done in the early weeks of January, which technically means you're going over the cliff.\"\n\nLawmakers from both parties agree that McConnell could be the key to a resolution. He has played the role of adjudicator for Congressional Republicans before, during last year's fight over a payroll tax extension and the battle between Democrats and Republicans over how, or if, to pay for an emergency disaster financing bill.\n\nWith days to spare, McConnell must decide whether to allow the Democrats' bill to extend expiring tax cuts onto the Senate floor. If passed without a filibuster, that legislation could force the House speaker's hand and quiet his raucous Republican conference. Alternatively, McConnell, who is up for re-election in 2014 and would like to avoid a primary fight, could stand back quietly and hope that Boehner and Obama manage to put together a deal that saves him the trouble.\n\nIf McConnell cannot come to the rescue, there is another hope: Starbucks. Howard Schultz, the company's CEO, asked baristas who work in Washington-area Starbucks to scrawl \"Come Together\" on coffee cups for the rest of the week to generate enthusiasm for a compromise.",
    " Title: Online Donations Fuel Democratic Advantage in House Races, Countering GOP Advertising Assault\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing battle for control of the U.S. House of Representatives, a significant shift in fundraising dynamics is emerging, with hundreds of thousands of online donors pouring money into Democratic campaigns at an unprecedented rate. This surge in online contributions is countering a late-summer advertising assault by the Republicans, who have traditionally relied on their outside-money advantage.\n\nAccording to a review of TV spending totals, Democrats in nearly 20 districts aired TV ads first to define themselves before facing GOP attacks, while CLF went on the offensive in seven districts. This sustained cash flow has extended Democrats' already formidable edge in the House race. In August alone, Democratic House candidates raised more than $35.8 million online, a sixfold increase from their online total in August 2016.\n\nThe influx of funds has been broadly distributed, with 14 Democratic challengers raising at least half a million dollars via ActBlue in August, and another 38 bringing in at least $250,000 online.\n\nJesse Ferguson, a former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee staffer and Democratic consultant, commented on the phenomenon, stating, \"For a number of years, Democrats searched for our answer to the Koch brothers and found our own billionaire. In reality, it's a 67-year-old grandmother on a fixed income who's donating $25 every month to candidates.\"\n\nOne standout candidate is Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer running in Virginia. Spanberger raised $790,000 online in August, and saw a fundraising spike after disclosing that CLF had obtained her confidential security clearance application while conducting research on her employment history.\n\nBy the time CLF used the information to attack Spanberger on TV on Sept. 6, the Democrat had already aired nearly 900 positive TV spots in her race against GOP Rep. Dave Brat. Spanberger stated, \"Our ads helped set the baseline of who I am, and that was probably very helpful in combating those attacks. The juxtaposition of the visuals of the ads, ours showing me as a normal person and theirs, are just scary.\"\n\nCLF has continued its attacks, focusing on Spanberger's stint as a substitute teacher at the Saudi-funded Islamic Saudi Academy in Mount Vernon, Va., and labeling it \"Terror High.\" A Republican familiar with polling in the district stated that \"the race was trending in the wrong direction, and that ad helped stabilize things.\"\n\nCLF spokeswoman Courtney Alexander countered, stating, \"Democrats have been 'forced to spend whatever they have raised responding to attack ads which are putting Democratic candidates on defense and setting the terms of these races.' She added, \"No first-time candidate wants their first ad to be a response ad, and that's what we have seen repeatedly from Democrats across the country as they are forced to scramble to answer for their records as the truth comes out.\"\n\nHowever, Spanberger called the ads \"ridiculous,\" adding that the attack has \"fallen flat.\"\n\nSpanberger is just one of many Democrats bringing in big money and pouring it into mass communication with voters. Overall, ActBlue, which surpassed $1 billion raised in 2018 on Aug. 2, had its biggest month ever in August, bringing in $100 million to candidates and progressive organizations. Other top House fundraisers that month included Sharice Davids and Jared Golden.\n\nThe money has sprouted after months of groundwork by campaigns and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The DCCC placed digital staffers in each of its regional political teams for the first time this election, helping campaigns grow online and be prepared to capitalize on viral moments and other opportunities.\n\nThe resulting well-funded campaigns have put House Democrats in an unusual position: They and their allied outside groups are currently outadvertising the GOP in some battlegrounds. Charlie Kelly, executive director of House Majority PAC, the Democratic House super PAC, stated, \"Candidates and Democratic groups have been running even or we have an advantage in paid communications on the air in many of the top 25 to 30 districts across the country. Time and time again, Democratic enthusiasm is off the charts.\"\n\nThese August online fundraising totals track with Democratic candidate performance over the past year. A whopping 56 Republican House incumbents raised less money than their Democratic challengers during the second quarter, along with 16 congressmen with less cash on hand than their Democratic opponents.\n\nA Republican consultant working on House races, granted anonymity to speak candidly, stated, \"This is the manifestation of a larger problem\u2014the massive enthusiasm gap. Republicans and our outside groups are raising a lot of money, too, but we can no longer say or think we can rely on just our super PACs, because now Democrats have money as well. Everyone has money.\"\n\nHowever, the money is no guarantee of success. Amy McGrath, a former combat pilot challenging Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.), also caught fire online early by telling a compelling personal story in TV ads. Her first campaign video has received nearly 2 million views on YouTube, and public polling shows the first-time candidate jumped ahead in public polling.\n\nHowever, CLF aired TV ads featuring a clip of McGrath saying, \"I don't know that I'm different than the Democratic Party nationally,\" then cut to a voter saying, \"When I first saw Amy McGrath's ads, I thought she was a moderate, but now we know the truth.\"\n\nCLF released a polling memo earlier this month, showing that an early lead built by McGrath had evaporated. (A recent poll conducted by The New York Times also shows a tied race.) \"Now, 66 percent of voters see her as a liberal, compared to 39 percent in June,\" the CLF polling memo reads.",
    " Title: West Hollywood City Council Votes to Urge Removal of Donald Trump's Hollywood Walk of Fame Star\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a unanimous vote on Monday evening, the West Hollywood City Council has expressed its intention to remove U.S. President Donald Trump's star from the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The council, however, has no jurisdiction over the Walk of Fame, which is located in neighboring Hollywood, and can only urge the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, the entity responsible for the attraction, to take action.\n\nThe resolution, announced by West Hollywood Mayor John Duran, states that the individual honored by the star does not align with the values of West Hollywood, one of the country's most liberal communities. The council's decision is based on allegations of sexual harassment made against Trump by several women, which he has denied, and his controversial policy of separating asylum-seeking migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe star, which has been a focal point for anti-Trump protests since 2015, has been vandalized twice, with men using heavy tools to damage it. Each time, the star has been swiftly repaired. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which manages the Walk of Fame, has never removed a star from the attraction, which honors celebrities from the entertainment industry.\n\nIn response to the West Hollywood City Council's request, Leron Gubler, the chamber president, stated that there are currently no plans to remove any stars from the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The council's request will be considered at the chamber's next meeting, according to NBC News.\n\nThe Hollywood Walk of Fame accepts nominations for new stars once a year, with the nominee's sponsor required to pay a $40,000 fee for the honor. Trump's star was added in 2007 in recognition of his work in television, including his role as host of NBC's \"The Apprentice\" and his production of the Miss Universe beauty pageants.",
    " Title: A Decade of Political Correctness: 24 Absurd Moments Defining the 2010s\n\nIn the last decade, the concept of political correctness has been a hot topic, with numerous instances being labeled as racist, sexist, offensive, or insensitive. Here, in no particular order, are 24 of the most absurdly politically correct moments of the decade:\n\n1. A college diversity-training course taught that it was culturally insensitive to expect people to be on time, as \"time may be considered fluid\" in other cultures.\n2. A piece in Everyday Feminism argued that \"trigger warning\" is actually a trigger, as it could \"be re-traumatizing for folks who have suffered military, police, and other forms of violence.\" The recommendation was to use \"content warning\" instead.\n3. A professor was accused of sexual harassment for stating that effort was 10 percent of the grade.\n4. A campus survey included a trigger warning to caution college students that it may contain \"anatomical names of body parts.\"\n5. University researchers demanded that we accept people who \"identify as real vampires\" to prevent anti-vampire discrimination.\n6. A Seattle-area councilman was concerned about the city hosing poop off of its sidewalks because he thought that it might seem too racially insensitive.\n7. A bathing-suit advertisement was criticized for being \"sexist\" because it depicted a woman in a bathing suit.\n8. Some feminists decided that \"pussyhats\" were both racist and transphobic, due to the fact that not all women have vaginas, and not all vaginas are pink.\n9. A professor claimed that the small chairs in preschools are sexist, \"disempowering,\" and \"problematic.\"\n10. College students decided against bringing a camel to school for a \"Hump Day\" event, due to concerns about racism.\n11. A school in Seattle reportedly insisted that Easter eggs be called \"spring spheres.\"\n12. A group of Berkeley students insisted that they could not take their in-class exam due to their lack of privilege.\n13. The phrase \"long time, no see\" was reportedly declared to be \"derogatory\" toward Asians.\n14. A college newspaper changed its name from \"The Bullet\" because its editors were concerned that that name was too dangerous.\n15. Lecturers were warned that capital letters might scare students and that they should avoid using them.\n16. A campus-wide email told white students to stop wearing hooped earrings, because doing so was cultural appropriation.\n17. A campus Christian club was found guilty of discrimination for requiring its leaders to be Christians.\n18. Oxford University law students were told that they didn't have to learn about rape or violence law if they found it too triggering.\n19. A liberal author demanded that \"normal people\" avoid wearing any kind of red hat, because all red hats can be too scary.\n20. Several colleges and universities either canceled or adapted performances of The Vagina Monologues over concerns about excluding women without vaginas.\n21. A school in Texas canceled their performance of The Vagina Monologues for another reason: because a white lady wrote it.\n22. Evergreen State University told professors to take student protesters' feelings into account when grading them.\n23. A lot of college kids were upset about The Vagina Monologues.\n24.

    " Title: Egypt Launches Airstrikes Against ISIS in Libya in Response to Execution of Coptic Christians\n\nArticle:\n\nEgypt has launched a series of airstrikes against ISIS targets in Libya in retaliation for the execution of 21 Coptic Christian citizens. The airstrikes, announced on state radio Monday, targeted ISIS weapons caches, training grounds, and camps in Libya.\n\nThe Egyptian government described the airstrikes as a means to \"avenge the bloodshed and to seek retribution from the killers.\" In a statement, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi vowed that Egyptians have a \"shield to protect and safeguard the security of the country and a sword that amputates terrorism and extremism.\"\n\nA five-minute propaganda video released by ISIS on Sunday showed the execution of the men, who were paraded onto a beach, each accompanied by a masked jihadist. The video, which was widely circulated on social media, showed the Coptic Christians from Egypt being forced to kneel as one jihadist addressed the camera in English.\n\n\"All crusaders: safety for you will be only wishes, especially if you are fighting us all together. Therefore we will fight you all together,\" he said. \"The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah we will mix it with your blood.\"\n\nThe men were then forced to lay face-down in the sand and were simultaneously beheaded. The same jihadist speaker then pointed to the sea and said, \"We will conquer Rome, by Allah's permission.\"\n\nThe men were not in Libya to fight ISIS. Rather, they were in the country to make a living when they were kidnapped in two separate incidents in December and January from the city of Sirte.\n\nIn addition to Egypt's airstrikes, Libya's air force also carried out its own airstrikes in the eastern city of Darna, which an ISIS affiliate took over last year. According to Libyan air force commander Saqer al-Joroushi, there were casualties among individuals, ammunition, and ISIS communication centers. He also reported that roughly 40 to 50 militants were killed.\n\n\"More air strikes will be carried out today and tomorrow in coordination with Egypt,\" he added.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Egypt has already carried out a second wave of airstrikes in Darna. The execution of the 21 Coptic Christians has sparked widespread condemnation and outrage, with many calling for a stronger international response to ISIS's actions.",
    " Title: Nick Sandmann Defends Actions During Controversial Confrontation, Disputes Phillips' Version of Events\n\nIn an interview with NBC's \"Today,\" Nick Sandmann, the Covington Catholic High School student at the center of a controversial confrontation with Native American activist Nathan Phillips, defended his actions during the incident.\n\nDuring the interview, Sandmann asserted that both he and Phillips were exercising their First Amendment rights during the confrontation that took place on Friday. The incident occurred after another protest group, the Black Hebrew Israelites, began taunting the Covington Catholic students. Phillips and his group approached the students, stopping in front of Sandmann.\n\nSandmann explained that the students had received permission from chaperones to shout school chants to drown out the insults from the Black Hebrew Israelites. He stated that he felt threatened, despite being in a much larger group, because the protesters were adults, and he \"wasn't sure what was going to happen.\"\n\n\"In hindsight, I wish we had just found another spot to wait for our buses, but at the time, being positive seemed better than letting them slander us with all of these things,\" Sandmann said.\n\nPhillips, in other interviews, explained that he went toward the students to defuse what he saw as a tense situation between the Black Hebrew Israelites and the students.\n\nSandmann also stated that his group should have walked away once the Native American activists came to them, but he \"didn't want to be disrespectful to Mr. Phillips\" if he was trying to have a conversation.\n\nSandmann, who can be seen in videos staring back at Phillips with what some have described as a smirk, said he was not intending to be disrespectful. In his view, he was trying to show that he wouldn't be moved to \"any further reaction of aggression.\"\n\n\"As far as standing there, I had every right to do so,\" he said. \"I can't say that I'm sorry for listening to him and standing there.\"\n\nPhillips, who has done several interviews since the incident went viral, disputes Sandmann's version of events. He contends that Sandmann locked eyes with him and approached him.\n\n\"I have read the statement from Nick Sandmann, the student who stared at me for a long time. He did not apologize, and I believe there are intentional falsehoods in his testimony,\" Phillips said.\n\nCovington Catholic High, an all-boys school, closed on Tuesday for safety reasons and reopened on Wednesday, although parents do not have to send their sons to school for the time being.",
    " Title: Rise in Islamophobia in Nepal: A Consequence of India's Hindu Nationalist Agenda and Media Influence\n\nArticle:\n\nKATHMANDU, Nepal\u2014Nepal, a country with a long history of religious tolerance, has seen a surge in Islamophobic incidents in recent weeks, with Muslims, who make up about 4 percent of the population, becoming targets of hate speech and rumors. This rise in Islamophobia can be attributed to the influence of India's Hindu nationalist fundamentalists and Islamophobic media, which have exploited the coronavirus pandemic to spread hatred towards Muslims in Nepal.\n\nThe rise of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his association with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh organization and its Hindu nationalist ideology has emboldened the New Delhi establishment to remake Nepal as a Hindu country once again. In 2006, Nepal became a secular country after it ousted the old constitutional monarchy, with a more secular Indian government helping to push former Maoist rebels to a peace deal and into mainstream politics. However, it has been easy for Indian Islamophobia to spread to Nepal, thanks to the number of Hindi speakers there and the wide range of Indian TV available.\n\nRecent incidents in Nepal, such as the false rumors about two Muslim women spreading the coronavirus by spitting on rupee bills, have caused widespread panic and hate speech. The initial quick test of one of the women produced a positive result for COVID-19, but further testing gave negative results, revealing that the initial test was incorrect. The two women had merely dropped the notes accidentally while returning from the bank.\n\nA week earlier, India's right-wing media, particularly Hindi news channels, circulated sensationalized news that Pakistan might have sent coronavirus-infected Muslim men to India via Nepal. The claims were based on an unverified and largely unsourced report sent by the state of Bihar to the Indian Home Ministry, which included false claims that Jalim Miya, a Muslim politician in Nepal, was behind the supposed plot and that the group of men were taking paracetamol to suppress their fevers and pass undetected. Miya explained exasperatedly that there was no such plot and was backed by Nepal's central government.\n\nNepal's Muslims are worried about the rise in Islamophobia, but they hope their friends and neighbors will stop things from getting worse. They point to the failure of the 1992 riots around the destruction of the Babri Masjid, a mosque built on a site also revered by Hindus in Ayodhya, India, to spread over the border. However, there has been a steady rise in attacks against Nepali Muslims on social media. The majority of Nepalis, however, continue to reject the attempts to whip up hatred, and there have been no reported physical assaults on Muslims.\n\nHajji Abdullah Miya, a former member of the Hajj Committee of Nepal, told \u2588\u2588\u2588: \"Especially after the rise of Modi, the attitude towards Muslims in India has changed. In any case, the general tendency to portray Muslims negatively is old in India. India used to spread rumors against the Muslims of Nepal to create animosity with the Indian Muslims. Whether in the name of mosques and madrassas in the Terai border region or on other issues, India has always attacked Nepali Muslims.\"\n\nNepal's Muslims are hopeful that their friends and neighbors will reject the attempts to whip up hatred and that the incidents of Islamophobia will subside. The Nepali government and the public must take a stand against the spread of Islamophobia and work towards maintaining religious harmony in the country.",
    " Title: Family of 17-Year-Old Boy Killed in Indian-Administered Kashmir Faces Long Battle for Death Certificate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370, which granted special status to the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir, a 17-year-old boy named Osaib Altaf Marazi made a fatal decision. On August 5, 2019, Osaib left his home in Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir, to play cricket with his friends. His body was later found in the nearby Jhelum river.\n\nOsaib's mother, Saleema Bano, has been struggling to cope with her youngest son's death for five months. \"He was a beautiful boy,\" she said. \"Everyone asks me to endure, but how can I forget my son who would be in front of my eyes every hour of the day?\"\n\nSaleema vividly remembers the day Osaib left home. \"I told him to have lunch first and not to go out, but he insisted he would be back soon,\" she said. That was the last time Saleema saw Osaib.\n\nThe events that followed forced the Marazi family to embark upon a traumatic quest to prove Osaib's death and seek a death certificate. After four months of denial, Kashmiri police finally admitted that Osaib's death was the first in the wake of the abrogation of Article 370.\n\nOn August 5, roads across Kashmir were blocked, and checkpoints, manned by Indian paramilitary troopers, were set up. A tense atmosphere descended upon the region as phone networks, internet services, and TV channels were blocked. The crackdown seemed designed to prevent Kashmiris from protesting against New Delhi's decision to scrap Kashmir's limited autonomy.\n\nOsaib's older brother, Suhail Ahmad Marazi, was not home on August 5. He later gathered witness accounts of what happened to his brother in the moments before his death. Osaib had been with his friends and, together, they walked a short distance from his home in Palpora village on the outskirts of Srinagar, the main city in the region, when they found themselves surrounded by paramilitary forces.\n\n\"They were 10 boys. As they reached the middle of a footbridge, they saw CRPF personnel running after them from both sides. They were scared and jumped into the river,\" Suhail told \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"The other boys who were present at the spot told us that Osaib held onto the edge of the bridge for a few seconds before the armed men hit him with a stick on his head and hands and he slipped into the waters. It was a murder.\"\n\nAt home, Saleema was doing chores when boys from the neighborhood came running and knocked at her window. \"They said Osaib had been martyred,\" Saleema recalled, overcome by emotion. \"I wait for him every day and call his name every time when I serve the dinner. He was afraid to sleep alone.\"\n\nOsaib's body was handed over to the family for burial, but the hospital refused to issue a death certificate. Officials at Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital in Srinagar asked the Marazi family for a First Information Report (FIR), a police complaint, to certify Osaib's death. It was the start of a months-long battle to secure a death certificate.\n\n\"From the hospital, I went to one police station and then another, and both said that they will not be able to register the FIR as the area does not come under their jurisdiction,\" Suhail said. \"It was a helpless situation.\"\n\nIn September, after two child rights activists, Enakshi Ganguly and Shanta Sinha, filed a petition in India's Supreme Court to investigate cases of rights violations involving children in Kashmir, the court tasked the juvenile justice committee with investigating cases involving minors who were being detained in the region.\n\nIn the midst of their struggle to prove Osaib's death, his family was shocked by a written submission by police to the juvenile justice committee admitting that they had detained 144 minors. \"Osaib Altaf, the incident as reported has been found to be baseless as no such death has been reported to the police authorities as per verification report received from the field formations,\" the police report said.\n\nThe family then approached the lower court to request the FIR. \"We approached the court because how can they deny our child's death?\" Suhail Marazi said. \"While we were mourning at home, every week we had to go to the court as well.\"\n\nLast month, the police finally submitted a report to the court admitting Osaib's death by drowning. \"It is prayed that on 05-08-2019, the deceased Osaib Marazi aged about 24 years allegedly drowned in river Jhelum,\" said the status report submitted by the Parimpora police station to the court. Osaib's school records show he was 17, not \"about 24\" as the police claimed. He was a grade 12 student at a local school.\n\n\"No one gets justice here, and we do not hope for it either. But we want that we should be provided the death certificate,\" said Suhail, adding that they will continue to fight for the certificate. \"Our neighbor Danish was killed the same way in 2016, and even they did not get any justice. They [the police] have found a new way to kill children in Kashmir.\"\n\nAuthorities in Kashmir, who now come directly under India's interior ministry, have denied any killings took place in the wake of the August 5 decision. However, local human rights group Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society (JKCCS) said, in its 2019 human rights review, that six civilians had been killed by the Indian armed forces.\n\nThe list included 17-year-old Asrar Firdous Khan from Soura, Srinagar, who was playing cricket with his friends on August 6 when soldiers shot him in the head several times with pellets, according to his family. Asrar's medical records showed his death occurred due to pellet injuries to his skull, but the police refuted that, saying he was killed when a stone was thrown at him. The police did not specify who threw the stone.\n\nWhile Osaib's family continues to struggle for acknowledgement of his death, Saleema struggles with her pain and longing. \"I want to tear my heart open to find my son. It seems the light of my eyes has gone away.\"",
    " Title: Clinton Campaign Denies Access to Daily Mail Reporter, Stirring Transparency Concerns\n\nIn a move that has reignited longstanding concerns about the Clinton campaign's commitment to transparency, the campaign denied access to print pool reporter David Martosko of London's Daily Mail on Monday. The incident occurred during a campaign event in New Hampshire, where Martosko was told he would not be allowed to cover the day's events as a pool reporter.\n\nMartosko, the U.S. political editor for the Daily Mail, arrived at the campaign's breakfast stop in New Hampshire only to be informed that he would not be part of the pool for the day. Pool reporters are responsible for sending reports from the campaign trail to the rest of the press corps.\n\nAccording to Martosko's report, he was told, \"So I'm afraid it's a no. You're not on the list.\" When asked if the print pooler was being prohibited from getting on either of the pool vans, the campaign's press aide replied, \"I'm afraid that's right.\"\n\nMartosko, denied a ride in the pool van, decided to drive to the first campaign stop in Rochester on his own, hoping that the situation would be resolved during the 75-minute drive.\n\nThe Clinton campaign did not respond to a request for comment, but campaign press secretary Nick Merrill provided an explanation to Martosko, which was relayed in a report on The Daily Mail's website. Merrill stated that the campaign's position is that the Daily Mail does not qualify because it has not yet been added to the White House's regular print pool.\n\nMerrill added that the campaign is \"trying to follow the same process and system the White House has.\" He also emphasized that the decision had \"nothing to do\" with the campaign considering the Daily Mail as foreign press.\n\nThe Clinton campaign later stated that the decision was made due to concerns about foreign outlets not being part of the rotation. The campaign is reportedly working to address these concerns and is in touch with the journalists who coordinate the pool.\n\nThe incident at the YMCA of Strafford County in Rochester, NH, where the campaign's early childhood education summit was held, added to the confusion. Secret Service agents at the main entrance refused to let Martosko in and advised him to go in through another entrance near a playground.\n\nUpon entering the alternative doorway, another agent asked for Martosko's name and outlet. When he identified himself as a Daily Mail reporter, a voice from behind the door, later identified as the head of Clinton's Secret Service detail, was heard saying, \"Oh, no.\"\n\nThe first agent sent Martosko back to the front door, advising that the head of the detail insisted. At the front door again, Martosko was asked to wait while the first agent on duty checked to see if he would be admitted. The answer was a firm \"No.\"\n\nMartosko was advised by that Secret Service agent that he had contacted someone named \"Pollard,\" who personally said no, Martosko could not come in. It's unclear who Pollard is.\n\nMartosko asked if he could come inside to use the restroom, but was advised that the area had been swept already, so he should \"hit the woods.\"\n\nMartosko saw a WMUR-TV truck outside and confirmed with a reporter from a competing local station that there were indeed pool journalists inside from photo and video. With a light rain falling, Martosko went back to his rental car to file this report, after counting about 210 cars in the parking lots and on the street.\n\nBoth press pool vans from Manchester were visible outside, along with the now-famous black \"Scooby\" van and a contingent of New Hampshire state trooper vehicles.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has stated that they are working to create an equitable system and have had some concerns expressed by foreign outlets about not being part of the rotation. The journalists who coordinate the pool are in touch with them, and the campaign is simply asking that until they can work all of that out, they send an outlet in keeping with previous precedents.",
    " Title: Fox News Analyst Brit Hume: Mueller Investigation Shifts Focus to Clinton Campaign, Raising Questions About Previous Reporting\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Tuesday, Fox News Channel's \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" network senior political contributor Brit Hume reacted to Tucker Carlson's earlier report that the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller has expanded to include elements of Hillary Clinton's campaign, Donald Trump's opponent in the 2016 presidential election. Hume suggested that the investigation's focus may now implicate some long-time Washington, D.C. Democrats.\n\nDuring the discussion, Carlson questioned the fact that an earlier report indicated that Paul Manafort, who was Trump's campaign manager, was working for the Podesta Group on behalf of Russian interests before joining the Trump campaign. Hume noted that the Podesta Group, run by brothers Tony and John Podesta, lies at the heart of the Democratic Party and the Clintons' political endeavors.\n\nHume expressed surprise that, despite the Podesta Group's central role, journalists had not uncovered the connection between Manafort and the Podesta Group during the 11-month investigation. Hume also suggested that the investigation, initially focused on Russian efforts to influence the election, may now be a broader effort to determine the extent and depth of Russian efforts to influence American policy going back several years.\n\nThe discussion also touched on the Uranium One matter, in which the Obama administration's effort to seek a closer relationship with Russia resulted in the sale of strategic materials that could potentially place American security interests at risk. Hume noted that this matter has been known for some time but is coming into sharper focus.\n\nRegarding the dossier that BuzzFeed published, Hume stated that it was paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, and if this is true, it tends to soil the allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians even further.\n\nHume concluded that the tide may now be turning in political and journalistic terms, and the Democrats may not enjoy the outcome of the investigation. Carlson agreed, stating that he would be concerned if he were the Podestas. The discussion ended with Hume thanking Carlson for having him on the show.",
    " Title: Sanders, Buttigieg, and Warren Lead the Pack in New Hampshire Primary, Biden Struggles\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the New Hampshire primary, Bernie Sanders emerged as the clear winner, bolstered by his strong leads in the state's largest cities. He outperformed his main rivals in Manchester by over 2,000 votes, and in Concord and Nashua by 500 votes each. Pete Buttigieg performed well in communities south of Manchester, in Boston's suburbs, and in college towns such as Hanover, home of Dartmouth College.\n\nJoe Biden, who was once the national front-runner, finished a disappointing fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire. Elizabeth Warren, the neighboring state's senator who had almost a third of the Democratic vote in an October poll, edged out Biden by less than a percentage point for fourth place.\n\nSanders, Warren, and Buttigieg, who between them led 20 of the 39 polls of New Hampshire primary voters conducted before the Iowa caucuses, now face a grueling 11-day sprint to the next contest in Nevada and an 18-day wait for the South Carolina primary. Both will have to convince donors and supporters they can regroup and rebuild their campaigns to secure a win.\n\nThere were concerning signs for both Biden and Warren in Tuesday's results. Warren, who is known for her detailed policy plans, struggled among those who prioritized electability over plans. Among the 33% of voters who preferred a candidate who agreed with them on major issues, more than a third chose Sanders, and only a small fraction chose Warren. Among the three in five voters who supported replacing America's healthcare system with a single-payer plan, three times as many chose Sanders over Warren.\n\nBoth Biden and Warren took steps Tuesday to distance themselves from the New Hampshire results, even before the polls closed. Warren stayed in New Hampshire to concede, offering kind words to Amy Klobuchar and pledging to continue the fight. In a memo to supporters, Warren campaign manager Roger Lau wrote that Warren's candidate remains \"the consensus choice of the widest coalition of Democrats in every corner of the country.\" He said Warren's formidable campaign organization was well-positioned to win delegates across most of the states and districts that will vote on Super Tuesday, and that her ceiling is higher than Biden's, Sanders's, or Buttigieg's.\n\nEach campaign will now have to convince its chief supporters that its candidate still has a path to the 1,990 delegates necessary to win the convention. Without the support necessary to sustain national field organizations and seven-figure television budgets, any candidate's campaign withers and dies; when a candidate loses or falls short of expectations, those financial problems mount even more rapidly.\n\nBoth Warren and Biden face challenges moving forward. Warren, who does not lead in polls in Nevada, South Carolina, or most Super Tuesday states, will have to break through for the first time. It is unclear where she will secure her first win.\n\n\"The road to the Democratic nomination is not paved with statewide winner-take-all victories. This is not a race for governor, the U.S. Senate, or the state treasurer's office,\" Lau wrote in his memo. \"This is a district-by-district contest for pledged delegates awarded proportionally.\"",
    " Title: The Evolution of Census-Taking: From Ancient Arrowheads to Modern Data Collection\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is currently in the midst of its decennial census, a process aimed at counting every individual residing within its borders. Over 150 other countries will join in this global census round, with approximately 90 percent of the world's population already accounted for. Despite the impressive scale of this endeavor, the modern census is not technologically spectacular. The American questionnaire asks just seven questions of each person, with a few additional queries for households as a whole.\n\nThis contrasts starkly with the complex technological challenges posed by census-taking in ancient times. While it is difficult to pinpoint the first census, it is likely that the idea arose independently in various places and times. For instance, the Scythians, nomadic warriors of the first millennium BCE, used a method that, while rudimentary by today's standards, worked effectively for them. They counted their population by having each individual contribute an arrowhead, with the total number of arrowheads serving as a census count.\n\nProto-literate societies were also capable of conducting complex censuses. The Inca, who dominated Andean America at the time of the Spanish conquest in the 15th century CE, recorded elaborate census statistics in connection with taxation, despite lacking a written language. They used knotted strings, known as khipu, to encode information. Of the thousand khipu that exist in museums today, two-thirds contain numerical data, and at least 50 are thought to pertain to censuses.\n\nPerhaps the most significant ancient census was that of Rome. The Romans adopted the census during their regal period, shortly before the more familiar republic was declared in 509 BCE. They named the procedure \"census\" (from the Latin ce\u0304nse\u0304re, \"to assess\"), made it fundamental to their social order, and spread it further as their territory grew.\n\nThe censors, the officeholders who conducted the census, determined each Roman citizen's position in an elaborate class hierarchy. This stratification of Roman society, performed every five years, dictated how that citizen and his family lived, from clothing and legal treatment to political power. The census process, in principle, involved each head of household making a declaration, providing personal and property information. The sheer logistics suggest that the count must have taken most of the 18-month term of the censors.\n\nThis brief exploration of census-taking throughout history underscores the evolution of this essential process, from the simple method of the Scythians to the more complex systems of the Inca and Romans. The modern census, while technologically unspectacular, remains a crucial tool for understanding and shaping societies.",
    " Title: Secret Service Lapses in White House Security: A Look at Recent Incidents and Their Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of unsettling incidents, the United States Secret Service has come under scrutiny for lapses in security at the White House. The latest incident involved a man, Omar Gonzalez, who managed to breach the White House grounds on September 19, 2014, despite several security measures failing to prevent his intrusion.\n\nOn that day, Gonzalez, who was not apprehended until he ran past the staircase leading to the Obama family's living quarters, should have been stopped immediately. However, a plainclothes surveillance team tasked with this duty failed to notice him, as reported by The Washington Post. The attack dog that was supposed to be released did not respond, and the front door of the White House was left unlocked. An alarm box at the entrance was muted due to its annoyance to members of the usher's staff who work nearby. The agent who eventually tackled Gonzalez was off-duty and happened to be passing by at that moment.\n\nIn 2011, another equally alarming incident occurred, but was not fully disclosed at the time. A man named Oscar Ortega-Hernandez parked his car approximately 700 yards from the White House and fired a semiautomatic weapon into the upstairs residence area. One of the Obama daughters was home at the time. Some Secret Service officers thought there might have been an attack, but their supervisor decided it was just backfire from a vehicle and ordered them to stand down. It took four days for the Secret Service to understand that there was an armed attack, and only after a housekeeper discovered broken glass and chipped cement.\n\nThe President and First Lady, Michelle Obama, were reportedly furious when they were informed of the incident several days later. Several lawmakers noted at a hearing that the damage could have been catastrophic if the attackers had been organized terrorists rather than deranged individuals. Considering President Obama has received three times the number of threats as his predecessors, there should be greater security for this White House.\n\nThe budget and size of the Secret Service have fallen in the last few years. In 2011, the agency had about 6,900 staff positions; it now has about 6,600. Its budget fell from $1.9 billion in 2012 to $1.8 billion in 2013, in part due to automatic cuts demanded by Congress, and it has only slightly increased since then. Though money cannot be the only reason for these errors, people inside the agency say the cuts have led to staff burnout, low morale, and unmonitored posts.\n\nPresident Obama now faces the decision of whether Secret Service Director Julia Pierson is capable of protecting him and his family, as well as upholding the nation's reputation. However, at a minimum, he must insist on an independent, top-to-bottom review of the Secret Service, not one conducted by officials trying to protect themselves or their agency.",
    " Title: California Bill to Limit Vaccine Exemptions Advances, Sparking Debate on Individual Rights and Public Health\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at addressing a recent measles outbreak, a California bill that restricts vaccine exemptions for schoolchildren based on personal beliefs has progressed, though it still faces several hurdles before becoming law. The bill, which allows students to opt out of mandatory vaccinations only if they have a medical condition, was introduced in response to a measles outbreak at Disneyland in late December that has been linked to nearly 150 cases.\n\nOutside the Capitol building in Sacramento on Wednesday, the bill sparked a heated debate between several hundred supporters and protesters. Opponents, some wearing American flags and carrying signs such as \"Force my veggies, not vaccines,\" argue that eliminating the personal belief exemption infringes upon their ability to make informed decisions about their children's health.\n\nLisa Cadrein, a Los Angeles resident, expressed her concerns about the potential adverse effects of vaccines on her daughter. \"I think that everybody should be able to make their own choice,\" she said. \"I am afraid that her big beautiful blue eyes will not focus on me anymore, and she won't be the kid that she is.\"\n\nHowever, scientific studies have consistently found no link between vaccines and autism spectrum disorder. Inside the hearing, parents also spoke about protecting their children from those who are not vaccinated.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Lois Wolk, a member of the Senate Health Committee, spoke in favor of the pro-vaccine parents. \"Our individual rights are not without limits, and in this particular case, your insistence on your right really could harm my children or my grandchildren,\" Wolk said.\n\nThe health committee in California's Senate passed the bill 6-2 on Wednesday. The proposed legislation now has many more hearings before it could become law. Meanwhile, similar legislation to limit families' rights to opt out of mandatory vaccinations has been considered in Washington, Oregon, and North Carolina, but all efforts have stalled.\n\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with Capital Public Radio and Kaiser Health News.",

In a press briefing on Thursday, McEnany advocated for President Donald Trump's push to physically reopen schools, stating that the \"science should not stand in the way\" of schools reopening.\n\nMcEnany's remarks came as Trump has vocally advocated for schools to physically reopen over the past week, threatening funding to schools and saying he would put pressure on governors to reopen schools in their states. However, health experts have pointed to the risk of children contributing to the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nA number of school districts have moved forward with plans that incorporate virtual learning in the fall to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19, including public schools in Richmond, Va., which announced Wednesday they would have full virtual learning in the fall.\n\nMcEnany cited a study published by JAMA Pediatrics, which she argued demonstrates that the risk of critical illness due to the novel coronavirus to children is \"far less\" than the seasonal flu. She continued, \"The science is very clear on this, and we encourage localities and states to just simply follow the science, open our schools.\"\n\nMcEnany emphasized the importance of schools for the wellbeing of students and their parents, stating, \"Our schools are extremely important, they're essential, and they must reopen.\" She also highlighted the potential negative effects of school closures on children, including a lack of reporting of abuse, mental depression, and suicidal ideations.\n\nTrump has forcefully advocated for schools to reopen, arguing that the risk to children remains low. Last week, he stated, \"We're going to be putting a lot of pressure on: Open your schools in the fall.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been praised by Trump for directing schools to reopen in the fall, despite a large surge in coronavirus cases in the state recently. The GOP has scaled back its convention in Florida next month as a result.\n\nThe study cited by McEnany on Thursday found that \"severe illness in children is significant but far less frequent than in adults\" and that preexisting medical conditions seem to be an \"important factor\" with respect to children who contract the disease.\n\nTrump has been accused of eschewing the advice of public health experts, including by Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who penned a scathing op-ed criticizing the president's response to the coronavirus on Thursday. Trump last week criticized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for reopening schools as \"very tough\" and \"expensive.\"",
    " Title: The New York Times Acknowledges Cautious Approach in 2016 Report on FBI's Trump-Russia Investigation\n\nThe New York Times has issued a correction to a 2016 article regarding the origins of the FBI's investigation into potential links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The paper admitted that it had played down the case due to cautious statements from law enforcement officials.\n\nIn the closing weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, The New York Times reported that the FBI had uncovered no \"conclusive or direct link\" between Donald Trump and the Russian government. The key fact of the article\u2014the FBI's investigation into possible links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\u2014was published in the 10th paragraph. The article's tone and headline, \"Investigating Donald Trump, F.B.I. Sees No Clear Link to Russia,\" gave an air of finality to an investigation that was just beginning.\n\nThe Times' correction disclosed that during the 2016 probe, dubbed \"Crossfire Hurricane,\" at least one government informant met several times with two Trump campaign aides, Carter Page and George Papadopoulos. This has become a contentious point, with Trump's allies questioning whether the FBI was spying on the Trump campaign or trying to entrap campaign officials.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted yesterday that if it's true, \"this is bigger than Watergate!\" The paper casts the FBI's judgments\u2014and even misjudgments\u2014in a sympathetic light. The bureau was aggressive in the Hillary Clinton investigation, but cautious on Trump due to political considerations.\n\nThe Times narrative suggests that the FBI was just starting to scrutinize possible links between Trump associates and Russia and did not have enough evidence to go public. The paper also notes that anything the FBI did publicly would only give fodder to Trump's claims on the campaign trail that the election was rigged.\n\nTrump yesterday linked to a National Review piece by Andrew McCarthy, who argued that the paper's analysis was \"bunk.\" He said the Hillary probe was a criminal investigation involving her email server, while Trump was subjected to a counterintelligence probe in the hope of turning up evidence to use against him.\n\nThe correction comes as the origins of the Trump investigation are under scrutiny, with some arguing that the FBI's actions were politically motivated. The investigation remains a contentious issue, with opinions divided between those who believe the FBI quietly did its job and those who see a bogus investigation that unfairly put Robert Mueller on Trump's trail.",

The theme of the evening was \"Stronger Together,\" a slogan that Clinton emphasized throughout her speech.\n\nClinton's focus was on differentiating herself from her rival, Donald Trump, and highlighting her steady leadership on foreign policy and the economy. Faith, religious liberty, and abortion were largely absent from her speech, but she did mention her Methodist faith and referenced her mother's admonition to \"do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.\"\n\nChelsea Clinton, her daughter, also made history as the child of two presidential candidates from their respective parties. In her speech, Chelsea expressed her pride in her mother and gratitude for being her daughter.\n\nHillary Clinton's speech aimed to unite the party, with a special shout-out to Bernie Sanders supporters, some of whom protested her nomination with glow-in-the-dark shirts. She also affirmed her former opponent in the first few minutes of her speech, hoping to appease his supporters.\n\nThroughout her speech, Clinton took aim at Trump, criticizing his campaign and presenting her own vision for the country. She emphasized the importance of unity and cooperation, stating, \"We are not a country that says 'never mind.' We say 'let's get it done.'\"\n\nClinton made multiple promises throughout her nearly one-hour speech, including her plan to support local forces in taking out ISIS, creating more good jobs with rising wages in the United States, and working with Sen. Bernie Sanders on education. She also promised to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all, and to liberate millions of people who already have student debt.\n\nClinton also addressed foreign policy, attacking Trump's ability to handle complicated foreign affairs and promising to provide the necessary leadership. She ended the night on a note of promise for the future, telling Americans, \"We are stronger together.\"",
    " Title: Theresa May's Third Brexit Defeat: A Turning Point in Britain's EU Exit Saga\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, British Prime Minister Theresa May suffered her third consecutive defeat in the House of Commons on Friday, leaving the country in a precarious yet potentially transformative position regarding its exit from the European Union. The margin of defeat was smaller than the previous two, with a majority of 58 against May's deal, compared to the previous 230 and 149. This latest defeat, in all but name, marked the third \"meaningful vote\" on the Brexit deal this year, all of which have ended in the same result.\n\nFollowing the latest defeat, May seemed to hint at a potential fourth attempt at passing her deal. However, this would be an unprecedented move, and many argue that the limit has been reached, as three consecutive defeats effectively signal a clear rejection of the deal. The prime minister's deal, therefore, appears to be dead, and it is time for it to be buried.\n\nThe question arises as to why May would willingly subject herself to such repeated humiliation. Several reasons can be attributed to this decision. The prime minister's stubbornness, her questionable strategy, and the erosion of her authority are among the underlying factors.\n\nOne reason for the repeated attempts was to keep the Brexit process moving forward. The original deadline set by May for Britain's departure from the EU, on 29 March 2019, was not met due to a series of misjudgments on May's part, including her refusal to engage with remain supporters and the loss of her majority in the 2017 general election. By persisting with her deal, May was attempting to demonstrate to leave voters that, despite obstacles, she was the one driving the Brexit process. However, this strategy has only served to highlight her own failures and weaknesses.\n\nThe attorney general had suggested that the primary reason for another attempt was procedural, aiming to move the latest Brexit deadline from 12 April to 22 May to allow for the passage of the final tranche of withdrawal legislation without the UK becoming embroiled in the European parliament elections. With the latest defeat, this is no longer a likely outcome. Instead, Britain now faces a choice between a no-deal exit in two weeks or a much longer delay to Brexit, during which the UK will likely participate in the EU elections. Given the unthinkable dangers of a no-deal exit, the choice must be for a longer delay.\n\nMay also had more partisan reasons for her persistence. Last Monday's revolt by MPs, in which they took control of parliament from the government, opened up the possibility that opposition MPs and pro-European Tories might soften the deal, revoke Article 50, or insist on a second referendum. Many Conservative MPs were alarmed by this prospect, and with May also promising to step down if her deal was adopted, more than 40 of her MPs switched their support to a deal they had previously rejected. This tactic, however, was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nWith May's defeat, the way is now clear for a different approach. This week's indicative votes are unfinished business, with new versions to be put before MPs on Monday. The movers have learned from their defeats, something May seems incapable of doing. Two propositions \u2013 in favor of a customs union and for a second referendum on the final deal \u2013 are very much in play. If the Commons can rally behind these, the EU summit on 10 April should be asked to grant the UK a longer extension of Article 50 to cement a different form of deal, with a public vote on it at the end. It is ironic that May's third defeat may have finally created space for a very different approach from the one she has followed for three wasted years.",
    " Title: Allegations of Secret Deal and Potential Misconduct Surface in Labor Secretary Nominee's Past\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report released by a bipartisan group of congressional committees has raised allegations that Labor Secretary nominee Thomas Perez, in his previous role as Assistant Attorney General, made a \"quid pro quo\" deal with leaders of the city of St. Paul, Minnesota, in 2012. The report, obtained by Fox News, claims that Perez manipulated federal law and potentially cost taxpayers up to $200 million by persuading the city to drop a contentious lawsuit in exchange for the Justice Department staying out of whistleblower cases brought against the city.\n\nThe report, titled \"How Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez Manipulated Justice and Ignored Rule of Law,\" states that Perez's actions were unusual and may have violated his duties of loyalty and confidentiality to the United States. The allegations could impact Perez's pending confirmation hearing, scheduled for this Thursday.\n\nThe report details two cases involving the city of St. Paul. The first case, which the Justice Department opted out of, potentially cost taxpayers as much as $200 million, the amount the government could have won had it pursued damages in the case. The department allegedly stayed away from this case to get the city to drop an appeal to the Supreme Court on another matter.\n\nThe second case involved St. Paul's appeal to the Supreme Court, where property owners claimed the city made extraordinary efforts, through strict code enforcement, to condemn their properties. The owners argued that reducing the amount of affordable housing for minorities violated the federal Fair Housing Act, a provision known as \"disparate impact.\"\n\nThe report concludes that Perez sought to stop the Supreme Court from ruling on the case, as he feared the Court would find the \"disparate impact\" provision unsupported by the text of the Fair Housing Act. The other end of the alleged deal was for the Justice Department not to get involved in cases against the city of St. Paul that alleged the city received millions in Department of Housing and Urban Development funds but failed to file the requisite paperwork regarding the hiring of low-income workers.\n\nThe Obama administration has acknowledged that senior Justice Department attorneys recommended intervening in the case, but characterized the False Claims Act infractions reported by plaintiff Thomas Newell as \"particularly egregious.\" However, they thought the case would be \"quite weak and never should have been a serious candidate for intervention.\"\n\nThe Justice Department claims everything was above board, stating that the department held three staff briefings, heard 24 hours of additional testimony, and reviewed 1,400 pages of documents before deciding not to intervene. The department maintains that the litigation decisions made were in the best interests of the United States and were consistent with the department's legal, ethical, and professional responsibility obligations.\n\nFormer Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler also questioned the use of the term \"quid pro quo\" to describe what happened, stating, \"It's such a loaded term. I think in fact you have almost everybody agreeing nothing inappropriate happened.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats have put out a statement and memo of their own refuting the details of the report, stating that Perez and others \"acted professionally to advance the interests of civil rights and effectively combat the scourge of discrimination in housing.\" They argue that the decision not to intervene in the suit against St. Paul was based on expert recommendations.\n\nThe report's release has sparked a political debate, with some arguing that the allegations against Perez are part of a broader political campaign to undermine legal safeguards against discrimination, while others maintain that the report raises serious questions about Perez's integrity and his ability to serve as Labor Secretary. The confirmation hearing for Perez is scheduled for this Thursday.",
    " Title: A Historical Perspective on the Role of Intelligence Agencies in U.S. Politics: A Look at the Russia Probe Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of American politics, the role of intelligence agencies has always been a subject of debate, with the line between politics and intelligence often blurred. This is particularly evident in the ongoing debate about the CIA and FBI's role in the origins of the Russia probe.\n\nAttorney General William Barr's decision to investigate the origins of the Russia investigation has sparked controversy, with Democrats expressing concern over what they perceive as an attempt to shift the narrative from Trump's alleged collusion with Russia to potential abuses of power by the FBI. The investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller failed to prove the collusion allegations, and Barr's attempt to determine whether the unprecedented probe of a presidential campaign was an abuse of power is a significant concern for Democrats who are pursuing the impeachment of President Trump.\n\nCNN crime-and-justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz this week expressed his concern over the Department of Justice's scrutiny of the CIA's work. However, this is not a new phenomenon. The CIA, like other intelligence agencies, has often been the subject of investigation, particularly when its activities are perceived to further a political agenda.\n\nThe political ferment of the 1970s and '80s, during which congressional committees led by Democrats such as Frank Church and Otis Pike conducted far-reaching investigations, is a testament to this. The debates about intelligence after the 9/11 attacks and the heated run-up to George W. Bush's Iraq War also highlight the political nature of intelligence.\n\nThe political parties have switched sides in this latest controversy, with Democrats defending the intelligence community and Republicans criticizing it. However, this shift in perspective is not unprecedented. In the past, it was Republicans defending the FBI and CIA against Democrats' charges, while today, Democrats are acting as if the agencies are beyond reproach.\n\nSensible people of either party will always seek to balance deference to the intelligence community's mission with an understanding that all government officials and agencies must be kept on a tight leash lest they abuse their power. The ongoing Russia probe controversy serves as a reminder of the need for transparency and accountability in the intelligence community's activities.",
    " Title: Boehner Pushes for Immigration Reform Amidst GOP Resistance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that defies the skepticism of some Republican leaders, Speaker John Boehner is persistently advocating for the passage of immigration reform in the House of Representatives. Despite Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's statement last week that immigration is not a priority for 2014, Boehner has been relentless in his pursuit of the issue.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Jeff Denham of California, who has recently met with Boehner on the matter, stated, \"Leadership's focus, and my focus, is to get [immigration] done as early as possible.\" Denham added, \"It's part of our conference agenda right now. It doesn't go on the agenda without scheduling bills and scheduling time on the floor.\"\n\nBoehner's office has released several documents outlining the Republican principles for immigration reform since the GOP retreat last week. These principles include a proposal to eliminate the ability for the administration to arbitrarily decide which laws to enforce.\n\nHowever, the push for immigration reform is facing resistance within the Republican party. The pushback has caused significant doubt within Boehner's leadership team, particularly for GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy, who represents a highly conservative district with anti-amnesty sentiment. In response, McCarthy's spokesperson stated, \"There has been nothing scheduled as of now.\"\n\nMeanwhile, top amnesty proponents outside Congress, such as Frank Sharry, founder and executive director of America's Voice, have expressed relative satisfaction with the principles and their reception by the GOP. Sharry noted, \"This is the party that voted against the DREAM Act in Dec. 2010. Republicans backed Mitt Romney and his call for self-deportation in 2012. And now in early 2014, the House Republicans are saying citizenship for DREAMers and legal status with no special path for the rest. That's a pretty significant shift, it seems to me.\"\n\nThe future of immigration reform in the House remains uncertain, with some members, like Rep. Tom Cotton, stating, \"At this point I don't anticipate legislation will come to the floor.\" However, Boehner's determination to push for reform continues, as he seeks to address the issue as early as this spring.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush Raises Political Profile Amidst 2016 Presidential Speculation\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington D.C. is currently experiencing a snowstorm, but the political rumor mills remain active. The possibility of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush making a presidential run in 2016 has been a topic of discussion, amplified by his recent appearances on various media outlets, including NBC's \"Today\" show.\n\nOn Monday, Bush voiced his opinions on current issues such as immigration reform, the 2013 sequester, and other budget crises. His book, \"Immigration Wars,\" outlines his stance on giving illegal immigrants legal status but not a pathway to citizenship. He is also a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) 2013, running from March 14 to 16 in Washington D.C.\n\nDuring his interview with \"Today\" host Matt Lauer, Bush expressed optimism about finding a consensus on immigration but emphasized the need to resolve budget matters to focus on immigration reform and energy policy. When asked about a potential 2016 run, Bush neither confirmed nor denied the speculations, stating, \"That's way off into the future... I'm not going to declare it today either.\"\n\nAnother potential 2016 contender is New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who was notably absent from CPAC this year despite being a popular choice. Bush expressed surprise at Christie's exclusion, attributing it to his handling of budget issues related to Hurricane Sandy and his public appearances with President Barack Obama. However, Bush clarified that CPAC's decision had nothing to do with Christie's actions with the President, stating, \"I think the issue of castigating the House... that's what I think was the critique. Look, I love Christie. I think Gov. Christie is a part of the future of the Republican Party for sure, and whether he's going to CPAC or not is not really changing that.\"\n\nThis development has Washington abuzz, as Bush is seen as elevating his public profile amidst the growing speculation about a potential presidential run in 2016.",
    " Title: Romney and Trump Engage in Heated Twitter Exchange Ahead of Republican Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange on Twitter, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and current frontrunner Donald Trump have been trading barbs over the latter's tax returns. The war of words between the two began on Wednesday, when Romney, in a Fox News interview, suggested that there might be something amiss in Trump's tax returns.\n\n\"We're now, you know, in late February and we still have not seen either Donald Trump's or Marco Rubio's or Ted Cruz's taxes,\" Romney told Fox's Neil Cavuto. \"Frankly, the voters have a right to see those tax returns before they decide who our nominee ought to be.\"\n\nRomney's comments were specifically directed at Trump's tax returns, which he described as \"likely to be a bombshell.\" Trump, however, has only said that his campaign will \"make that determination over the next couple of months.\"\n\nTrump's response to Romney's comments was swift and scathing. He tweeted, \"Mitt Romney, who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guy \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2016.\"\n\nSince that first tweet, Trump has continued to lash out at Romney with a series of personal attacks. He labeled Romney \"one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics\" and called him a \"dope.\" He also promised that he was \"going to do what @MittRomney was totally unable to do- WIN!\"\n\nTrump has also enlisted the help of his Twitter followers, reposting their attacks on Romney. One such tweet read, \"@ahernandez85a: @realDonaldTrump Mr. Tough Guy Romney should be backing Trump like Trump backed him last time # NoLoyalty\" \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2016.\n\nThe attacks are expected to continue on the Republican debate stage Thursday night, where the remaining five GOP candidates will gather for their last bout before the Super Tuesday nominating contests.

    " Title: Attorney General Eric Holder Faces Congressional Scrutiny Over AP Phone Records, Alleges Shoddy Conduct by Rep. Darrell Issa\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange at a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Attorney General Eric Holder accused Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of shoddy conduct, following allegations that Holder had purposely withheld information from Congress. The hearing, which focused on a series of scandals, including the government's secret collection of AP phone records, saw Holder grilled on his role in the AP case and other allegations.\n\nThe exchange between Holder and Issa, who has been a vocal critic of Holder regarding the botched Operation Fast and Furious, took place during a House Judiciary Committee hearing. Lawmakers pressed Holder on the AP case, expressing frustration when Holder repeatedly claimed he was not involved in the decision-making process.\n\nRep. James Sensenbrenner, a bipartisan lawmaker, questioned Holder about the Justice Department's secret collection of telephone records. Holder responded that he had recused himself from the case because he was a \"possessor of information eventually leaked.\" He also said he was unable to answer questions about why the department failed to negotiate with the AP before obtaining subpoenas, a standard practice in such cases.\n\nHolder testified that all the decisions made in the case fell on Deputy Attorney General James Cole's shoulders. Sensenbrenner suggested having Cole testify before the House Judiciary Committee, but noted that he would be prohibited from discussing any ongoing case, likely yielding few answers.\n\nRep. John Conyers, a Democrat, expressed concern about the government's actions, but was unable to pull any new information about the AP case from Holder. On Monday, AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt disclosed the government's action in a letter to Holder, calling the collection of phone records at four AP bureaus a \"massive and unprecedented intrusion\" of the news agency's freedom of press rights.\n\nThe AP case has sparked bipartisan outrage, with members of both parties publicly questioning the government's actions. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called for Holder's resignation, stating, \"Freedom of the press is an essential right in a free society.\" Holder acknowledged Priebus' calls for his resignation during his opening remarks, but reiterated that he was not behind the subpoena.\n\nIn response to the AP case, New York Sen. Charles Schumer plans to reintroduce legislation that would protect journalists from revealing their sources. The bill, which was brought up in 2009, has since stalled in Congress.\n\nUnder Holder's command, the Justice Department has prosecuted more government officials for alleged leaks under the World War I-era Espionage Act than all of the AGs who came before him \u2013 combined. The Obama administration has been aggressive in going after government workers leaking classified information, with the White House bringing indictments against five workers and the Defense Department pursuing a sixth case against a U.S. Army soldier accused of sending classified documents to the anti-secrecy online group WikiLeaks.",
    " Title: Texas Senator Ted Cruz Announces 2016 Presidential Bid: A Comprehensive Look at His Strengths as a GOP Candidate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that marks the beginning of the 2016 Republican presidential race, Texas Senator Ted Cruz officially announced his candidacy on Monday. As the first major contender to declare, Cruz presents several compelling reasons that make him a strong GOP candidate for the upcoming election.\n\n1. Early Start: Cruz is expected to launch his campaign immediately, rather than forming an exploratory committee, a strategy often adopted by potential candidates.\n\n2. Tea Party Support: Amy Kremer, former head of the Tea Party Express, told The Associated Press that Cruz's announcement will significantly boost the Republican field, exciting the base in a way not seen in years.\n\n3. Obamacare Opponent: Cruz is known for his vocal opposition to Obamacare. In September 2013, he spoke for over 21 hours on the Senate floor in an attempt to defund the Affordable Care Act.\n\n4. Strong Immigration Stance: Cruz has taken a firm position on immigration, defying GOP leaders to force a vote on opposing President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration, despite the strategy's ultimate failure.\n\n5. Independent Image: Cruz's defiance of party leaders on immigration issues demonstrates his independence, an appealing quality to voters frustrated with Washington's partisan politics.\n\n6. Mainstream Republican Views: Unlike some fellow candidates, Cruz aligns with the mainstream of Republican voters on most issues. For instance, Jeb Bush supports legalization for undocumented immigrants, a stance many Republican activists oppose, while Rand Paul supported normalizing relations with Cuba.\n\n7. Campaigning Skills: Cruz demonstrated his strong campaigning abilities in the 2012 election, defeating David Dewhurst in the Texas GOP primary despite Dewhurst's significant financial advantage.\n\n8. Potential Appeal to Hispanic Voters: Cruz's father was born in Cuba, and he is the first Hispanic U.S. Senator from Texas. This could make him more appealing to Hispanic voters than other GOP candidates.\n\n9. Past Election Analysis: Cruz argues that the GOP needs a strong conservative to win the general election, citing past elections where a more moderate candidate resulted in voter apathy.\n\n10. Bipartisan Appeal: Cruz's campaign could potentially attract disillusioned voters from both parties, as people look for something new and different.\n\n11. Legal Background: Cruz has a strong legal background, having earned his law degree at Harvard University and clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist.\n\n12. Campaign Asset: Cruz's wife, Heidi Cruz, is a significant asset in the campaign. She worked on George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign, served at the National Security Council under Condoleezza Rice and at the Treasury Department, and most recently was a managing director for Goldman Sachs in Houston. She has taken an unpaid leave to help her husband's campaign.\n\nAs the 2016 presidential race unfolds, Cruz's early start, strong Tea Party support, and unwavering conservative stance make him a formidable contender in the Republican field.",
    " Title: Four Major Corporations Explain Payments to Michael Cohen's Shell Company Amidst Allegations of Hush Money\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of attorney Michael Avenatti's recent claim that a shell company linked to Michael Cohen, Essential Consultants LLC, received large sums from companies potentially influenced by Trump administration decisions, these corporations are now providing explanations for their payments to Cohen.\n\nEssential Consultants LLC, a single-member LLC solely owned by Cohen, has been described in court documents as a real estate consulting company. The company was created and registered in Delaware less than a month before the 2016 election, with no known employees, website, or physical office space.\n\nHere's what the corporations say they paid Cohen's company for:\n\n1. Korean Aerospace Industries, a defense contractor, paid $150,000 to Essential Consultants for \"legal consulting concerning accounting standards on production costs.\" The company claims it was unaware of Cohen's connection to Donald Trump.\n\n2. AT&T paid Cohen $600,000 for \"help understanding how the President and his administration might approach a wide range of policy issues, including regulatory reform at the FCC, corporate tax reform, and antitrust enforcement.\"\n\n3. Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis paid Cohen $1.2 million for \"advice on how the Trump administration might approach certain U.S. healthcare policy matters, including the Affordable Care Act.\" However, Novartis claims it did not meet with Cohen until a month after the contract was signed and decided not to engage further with him.\n\n4. Columbus Nova, a New York investment firm, paid Cohen $500,000 for \"business consulting regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures.\" Columbus Nova's CEO is the cousin of a Russian billionaire, Viktor Vekselberg, who controls the Renova Group. The Renova Group's website previously listed Columbus Nova as a subsidiary, but the pages have since been taken offline.\n\nIn the same period that Essential Consultants was involved in nondisclosure payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, these four entities paid Cohen millions of dollars for advice about accounting standards, telecom reform, tax policy, antitrust law, the Affordable Care Act, and high-end investment opportunities. Additionally, one of the companies that paid Cohen, Novartis, is now downplaying a previously disclosed connection to a Russian billionaire affected by economic sanctions.",
    " Title: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Refers Michael Avenatti and Julie Swetnick to Justice Department for Criminal Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has further escalated the already contentious confirmation battle for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley has referred attorney Michael Avenatti and his client, Julie Swetnick, to the Justice Department for criminal investigation. The referral stems from Swetnick's unsubstantiated allegation that Kavanaugh participated in a gang-rape ring while in high school.\n\nThe referral comes amidst the heated, partisan battle over Kavanaugh's confirmation, sparked by Christine Blasey Ford's allegation of sexual assault. Avenatti, who publicized Swetnick's claims, presented them to the Committee on September 26 in a sworn statement. However, Swetnick later retracted her claims during an October 1 interview with NBC News, conceding that she never witnessed Kavanaugh spike anyone's drink or participate in gang rape.\n\nIn a lengthy letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Grassley outlined his rationale for the referral, stating, \"When a well-meaning citizen comes forward with information relevant to the committee's work, I take it seriously. It takes courage to come forward, especially with allegations of sexual misconduct or personal trauma.\" He further added, \"But in the heat of partisan moments, some do try to knowingly mislead the committee. That's unfair to my colleagues, the nominees, and others providing information who are seeking the truth.\"\n\nGrassley emphasized that the law prohibits false statements to Congress and obstruction of congressional committee investigations. He stated, \"I don't take lightly making a referral of this nature, but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future.\"\n\nIn response to the referral, Avenatti expressed his support, tweeting, \"Maybe if Grassley was actually a lawyer that knew something about the law, he would realize what he has done. He just opened up Pandora's box as it relates to Justice Kavanaugh's conduct. It is Christmas in October!\" and \"Ironically, Senator Grassley now is interested in investigations. He didn't care when it came to putting a man on the SCOTUS for life. We welcome the investigation as now we can finally get to the bottom of Judge Kavanaugh's lies and conduct. Let the truth be known.\"\n\nThe referral marks a significant development in the ongoing controversy surrounding Kavanaugh's confirmation, with the Justice Department now tasked with investigating the allegations made by Swetnick and Avenatti. The outcome of this investigation remains to be seen.",

During the interview, Trump engaged in verbal sparring with \"60 Minutes\" anchor Lesley Stahl, at one point telling her, \"In the meantime, I'm the president \u2013 and you're not.\"\n\nThe interview also touched on several other topics, including climate change. When asked about the impact of Hurricane Michael, one of the most powerful hurricanes in U.S. history, Trump and Stahl debated the issue.\n\n\"I think something's happening. Something's changing and it'll change back again. I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference. But I don't know that it's manmade,\" Trump said.\n\nStahl pressed Trump on his views on climate change, to which he responded, \"I'm not denying climate change. But it could very well go back. You know, we're talking about over millions of years.\"\n\nWhen Stahl asked Trump to acknowledge the findings of scientists regarding climate change, he replied, \"You'd have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda, Lesley.\"\n\nTrump also discussed his relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, stating, \"I do trust him, yeah, I trust him.\" However, he added, \"That doesn't mean I can't be proven wrong about (denuclearization).\"\n\nStahl also brought up first lady Melania Trump's comments in an ABC News interview last week, in which she said she didn't trust everyone in the White House. Trump agreed with his wife, stating, \"I feel the same way. I don't trust everyone in the White House, I'll be honest with you.\"\n\nThe interview also touched on the 2016 election, with Trump stating that there was interference, but not just from Russia. \"They meddled. But I think China meddled, too,\" Trump said when asked if he believed Russia had run interference in the last presidential election.\n\nWhen asked about the current state of the country and the need for unity, Trump lamented the Democrats' treatment of Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court nomination process and stated, \"I don't think they want to heal yet.\"\n\nTo close the interview, Trump was asked about finding his \"sea legs\" as president. While he initially found it \"a little surreal to say I'm President of the United States,\" he quickly added, \"Now, I very much feel like POTUS. I do. I feel like the president.\"",
    " Title: Understanding the Collapse of the American Health Care Act: A Closer Look at the GOP's Internal Struggles\n\nArticle:\n\nThe collapse of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) last week has left many questioning the political acumen of President Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan. The good news is that no one can say President Trump didn't try to persuade House Republicans to pass the AHCA. He invited lawmakers to the White House, dispatched his key aides to Capitol Hill, worked the phones, cajoled, charmed, arm-twisted, threatened, but failed to understand the reasons behind the GOP's reluctance to vote for the bill.\n\nPresident Trump and Speaker Ryan chose to cancel the vote on the AHCA late Friday afternoon. Earlier this week, the loudest argument from Trump was that if House Republicans didn't pass the bill, it could cost the GOP their majority in 2018. This may or may not be true; it's also possible that passing a disappointing replacement could cost the GOP their majority. Either way, Trump went so far as to threaten primary challenges to those who didn't sign on.\n\nHowever, it wasn't the fear of such threats or nonchalance about keeping their majority that held House Republicans back. Instead, they simply didn't like what was in the bill and didn't have faith that the Senate would improve it or that it would get better in conference committee. At least for now, a significant number of House Republicans fear the consequences of passing an insufficient bill more than the consequences of failing to pass a bill.\n\nSome Republicans felt that the AHCA wouldn't do enough to lower premiums, which many consumers find too high. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score said that the bill would reduce the costs of insurance eventually, but increase them in the first three years. It's fair to ask whether voters would feel warm to Republicans in fall of 2018 if a GOP replacement plan passed and they still found themselves paying too much for too little care.\n\nSome House Republicans want to repeal Obamacare's requirement that insurance plans cover outpatient care, emergency-room visits, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental-health and addiction treatment, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, lab services, preventive care, and pediatric services. On the one hand, mandating so much coverage does add to the costs of insurers, raising premiums. On the other hand, consumers like being comprehensively covered.\n\nIt appears President Trump cared a lot more about getting a win than about what, exactly, he would be winning. Others contended that the replacement just worked too much like Obamacare to meet their standards. Mo Brooks of Alabama declared, \"It doesn't deliver on the promise I made to fully repeal Obamacare.\" Representative Rick Crawford of Arkansas tweeted that \"the bill currently maintains [Obamacare's] overall structure/approach, an approach that cements the federal government's role in health insurance.\"\n\nConservative health-policy wonks had their own objections. Avik Roy pointed out that the AHCA \"would lead to significant spikes in net insurance premiums for lower-income participants in the individual insurance market, with particular problems for those in their fifties and sixties.\"\n\nThese are thorny issues that involve trade-offs. You can try to sweep away everything that's bad about Obamacare, but there's no way to do that without disrupting millions of voters' lives. You can try to control costs, but that's hard to do without limiting benefits. You can't enact some of Republicans' favorite proposals, such as tort reform and selling insurance across state lines, without either some support from Senate Democrats or the elimination of the filibuster.\n\nAs House Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows put it, almost no one in his caucus wanted to vote no. They wanted to get to yes but simply didn't see enough good in the bill to make voting for it worthwhile. A strong leader can help sort out conflicting priorities, but there's little sign that President Trump had any interest in that role. Throughout the last days of arm-twisting, there were ominous reports that he was quite passionately attempting to persuade House Republicans to pass the bill, without really understanding what was in the legislation that made them so reluctant to vote for it. An unnamed House GOP aide told CNN that when it came to the details of the legislation, Trump \"either doesn't know, doesn't care, or both.\"\n\nIn the Los Angeles Times, Michael Steel, a former GOP leadership aide, offered a bizarre portrait of a president who's somehow simultaneously eager and clueless:\n\nRyan has learned that his wonky style of communication is wasted on Trump, given the president's lack of interest in policy details, Steel said. But he has come to value Trump's eagerness to exert pressure on wavering Republicans.\n\nIt appears President Trump cared a lot more about getting a win than about what, exactly, he would be winning. And that lack of focus on the details helped deny him the victory he wanted so badly.",
    " Title: Obama Chooses Middle Ground in Syria: Limited Strike as Least Bad Option\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that seems to be leaning towards the least bad option, President Barack Obama appears to be preparing for a limited military strike in Syria. This decision comes after the reported use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war, which has claimed the lives of over 100,000 people since its outbreak.\n\nThe choice of a limited strike, while risky, is seen as less so than doing nothing or attempting regime change, according to Aaron Miller, a veteran U.S. diplomat and scholar at the Wilson Center. If Obama does not act in response to the large chemical weapons attack, he risks being perceived as ineffective, according to Miller.\n\nThe decision to intervene militarily in Syria is a complex one, with three main options: do nothing, do everything, or find a middle ground and muddle through. In the case of Syria, the president seems to have chosen the latter, as the administration has been telegraphing its military action more than ever before.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry's powerful statement of moral outrage and the president's recent PBS interview have created a strong commitment to strike, making it one of the most authoritative commitments to military action in modern warfare. If Obama does not enforce this commitment, he will be severely damaged in terms of foreign policy for the remainder of his term.\n\nCritics of the president's Syria policy, including Sens. John McCain and Lindsay Graham, have repeatedly called for a more robust policy, suggesting that the president's inaction has enabled the ongoing misery in Syria. They argue that Syria poses a major threat to U.S. interests and to allies in the region, and that only a takedown of the Assad regime through supporting the opposition and direct application of U.S. military power will begin to address the problem.\n\nHowever, President Obama has avoided this approach due to the general problem of an open-ended military commitment and the lack of correlation between the use of U.S. military power and its relation to the end state. The complexity of the Syrian conflict, with more than 1,000 disparate rebel groups, including those allied with al-Qaeda and other Sunni extremists, makes devising a serious military strategy to get rid of Assad a daunting task.\n\nThe limited strike that the U.S. is likely to undertake is focused on deterring the Syrians from using chemical weapons again and degrading Assad's military capacity in the process. While this option is far from ideal, it is unlikely to change the arc of the battlefield balance. There are also other downsides, such as the potential for escalation and the risk of undermining American credibility through episodic intervention without a real strategy.\n\nIn conclusion, President Obama's decision to intervene militarily in Syria, albeit in a limited capacity, is a complex and risky move. The president, who has been criticized for his reluctance to use military force, is now faced with the realities of the Syrian conflict and the need to respond to the use of chemical weapons. The choice of a limited strike is a calculated risk, aimed at deterring further chemical weapons use and degrading Assad's military capacity, while avoiding the risks and complexities of a more robust intervention.",
    " Title: \"Sanders' Electability: A New Perspective on the 2020 Democratic Race\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing 2020 Democratic presidential race, concerns are mounting among some Democrats that Bernie Sanders' potential nomination could lead to a defeat in the general election and a potential party setback. However, a closer look at the polling data suggests a different narrative.\n\nVirtually every national and swing state poll shows Sanders tied with or beating President Donald Trump. For instance, a Quinnipiac Poll last week indicated Sanders' victory in Michigan and Pennsylvania, while a CBS News/YouGov poll showed him beating Trump nationally. A Texas Lyceum poll shows Sanders performing better against Trump in Texas than any other Democrat, losing by just three points.\n\nOne factor that sets Sanders apart is his significant social media presence. He has larger followings on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other platforms than his rivals, and has consistently demonstrated new media sophistication that others lack.\n\nAnother crucial factor is Sanders' loyal base. His supporters are not only financially committed, making him the best-funded non-billionaire in the Democratic game, but they also show up at rallies, on social media, and in elections. This level of dedication is something that Trump himself has acknowledged as a significant factor in his own success.\n\nSanders' self-proclaimed big government socialism, a point of contention for some, has not seemed to deter voters. In fact, 45% of the electorate does not seem to be bothered by Trump's outlandishness, suggesting that Sanders' socialist leanings may not be a deal-breaker for voters.\n\nPeter Hamby, who works for Snapchat and writes for Vanity Fair, argues that the \"bed-wetting\" Democrats might be misguided in their assessment of Sanders' electability. Hamby suggests that Sanders, in the age of Trump, hyper-partisanship, institutional distrust, and social media, could be the most electable Democrat.\n\nHamby posits that Sanders, with his Trump-like celebrity status, is well-positioned to win the attention war, a crucial aspect of any presidential campaign. \"Running for president has always been about winning the attention war, and the competition for attention has never been more difficult than it is in 2020,\" Hamby writes.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2020 Democratic race remains unpredictable, and it is impossible to know with certainty what voters want or will accept. However, the evidence, particularly the polling data, suggests that Sanders could be the most electable Democrat in the race.",
    " Title: Texas Legislature Passes Controversial Abortion Bill, Prompting Promise of Legal Challenge and Vows of Continued Resistance\n\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 The Texas Legislature has passed an omnibus abortion bill, one of the most restrictive in the nation, which is expected to face legal challenge and political resistance. The bill, which bans abortions after 20 weeks, requires abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, and mandates all abortions to take place in surgical centers, was passed unchanged just before midnight on Saturday.\n\nThe Republican majority in the Legislature passed the bill despite Democratic opposition, with all but one Democrat voting against it. The bill's passage follows more than 2,000 demonstrators filling the Capitol building in Austin to oppose the measure, with state troopers removing six protesters from the Senate chamber for attempting to disrupt the debate.\n\nGovernor Rick Perry, who will sign the bill into law in the coming days, stated, \"Today the Texas Legislature took its final step in our historic effort to protect life.\" Perry added, \"This legislation builds on the strong and unwavering commitment we have made to defend life and protect women's health.\"\n\nSen. Royce West, a Democrat, vowed, \"There will be a lawsuit. I promise you.\"\n\nDemocrats offered 20 amendments to the bill, ranging from exceptions for rape and incest to allowing doctors more leeway in prescribing abortion-inducing drugs. However, Republicans rejected all amendments.\n\nThe bill is part of a series of measures championed by anti-abortion groups aiming for a constitutional challenge to Roe vs. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that guarantees a woman's right to decide on an abortion before the fetus is viable outside the womb.\n\nThe 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, to which Texas falls under, has shown a willingness to accept more stringent limits on abortions. Passing the law also appeases Christian conservatives, who make up the majority of Republican primary voters.\n\nHowever, the measure has sparked protests in Texas not seen in at least 20 years, with thousands of abortion rights supporters flooding the Capitol to draw out normally boring committee hearings and disrupting key votes. Protesters finished a filibuster started by Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth by jeering for the last 15 minutes of the first special session, effectively killing the bill.",
    " Title: Investigative Report: EPA's Collusion with Environmental Groups Alleged in \"Sue and Settle\" Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent U.S. Chamber of Commerce study, it has been revealed that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been granting unprecedented access to radical environmental groups during the drafting of environmental regulations, while excluding the industries and people most likely to be affected. This allegation, if true, could have far-reaching implications for millions of Americans.\n\nThe study found that the Sierra Club, WildEarth Guardians, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Environmental Defense Fund have all had significant influence on EPA policy decisions. These groups have reportedly participated in \"closed-door deals\" with the EPA 64 times since 2009, with the EPA striking 34 deals with the Sierra Club alone.\n\nThe controversy revolves around a legal technique known as \"sue and settle,\" where environmental groups file lawsuits against federal agencies, and the agencies settle the suits in closed-door meetings, often resulting in regulations that are detrimental to industries and job creation. These settlements, which bypass the public comment period, allow the EPA to implement policies favored by the environmental groups and the Obama administration.\n\nSen. David Vitter (Louisiana Republican) has highlighted a case involving the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Center for Biological Diversity over endangered-species rules. The settlement could lead to federal control over private lands in states like New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Kansas, which are major oil and natural gas producers.\n\nRep. Tim Huelskamp (Kansas Republican) has criticized these settlements, stating, \"The bird is so populous that it is hunted in Kansas. This is not about preservation of a species \u2014 it\u2019s about federal control of private landowners and limiting the ability to develop and grow rural America.\"\n\nThe \"sue and settle\" litigation has reportedly taken a toll on industries, consumers, and state treasuries across the nation. For instance, a suit filed by WildEarth Guardians has led to eight states spending millions to comply with EPA regulations to improve visibility in national parks and wilderness areas. The settlement agreement allows the EPA to exert its authority over state haze-mitigation plans, expanding its power base and increasing utility costs for consumers.\n\nA \"sue and settle\" case involving the Navajo Generating Station could result in electricity costs for Arizonans increasing by an estimated 20 percent annually. A case involving the potential impact of 200 pesticides has been called \"the mother of all lawsuits,\" with the potential to cause \"severe economic harm and loss of jobs to tens of thousands of farmers\" across the country.\n\nThe high costs for consumers are not the only concern. Under federal law, taxpayers are also responsible for covering the environmental groups' legal bills. Between 1995 and 2010, Earth Justice was paid nearly $4.7 million, the Sierra Club received about $967,000, and the Natural Resources Defense Council got more than $252,000.\n\nThe EPA's alleged complicity in the \"sue and settle\" method of promulgating regulations has raised serious questions about the agency's accountability and direction. The apparent collusion between the EPA and environmental groups, as well as the agency's stonewalling of Freedom of Information Act requests, has led to concerns about the EPA's focus on its primary mission: \"to protect human health and the environment based on the best available scientific information.\"\n\nFormer Republican member of the House of Representatives, Bob Beauprez, has criticized the EPA, stating, \"Science has taken a back seat to a green ideology that puts politics before 'we the people.'\" The American Traditions Institute has sued the EPA for failing to respond to a Freedom of Information Act request for details about these questionable alliances.\n\nAs the EPA continues to face allegations of collusion and stonewalling, it remains to be seen how these developments will impact the agency's future and its relationship with the industries and people it is meant to serve.",
    " Title: Senate Passes Bipartisan Budget Agreement, but Partial Government Shutdown Looms as House Faces Internal Divisions\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate has passed a two-year budget agreement, which, if approved by the House, would increase defense and domestic spending by over $400 billion. However, a partial government shutdown is imminent as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) blocked the bill from passing before a midnight deadline.\n\nThe budget deal, negotiated by congressional leaders and released late Wednesday, hit a snag when Sen. Paul demanded a vote on restoring the 2011 budget caps that limited congressional spending. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to allow the vote, and Paul refused to back down.\n\nThe Senate will proceed to vote on the measure, which includes short-term federal funding through March 23. However, federal funding from the last short-term spending bill expires at midnight. If the Senate approves it, the 652-page budget bill would then go to the House, where it faces stiff opposition from liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans.\n\nThe budget agreement eliminates the budget caps, paving the way for Congress to increase defense spending by $165 billion and hike domestic spending by $131 billion over the next two years. The measure includes a major disaster relief package for regions hard-hit by last year's devastating storms and a one-year suspension of the debt limit.\n\nPresident Trump offered a full-throated endorsement of the deal in a Wednesday evening tweet, saying \"Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill.\"\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have both championed the agreement as a bipartisan breakthrough that would end the destabilizing cycle of short-term spending bills.\n\n\"No one would suggest it's perfect, but we worked hard to find common ground and stay focused on serving the American people,\" McConnell said Wednesday.\n\nWith the backing of the two Senate leaders, the bill is expected to win bipartisan support in that chamber. However, its fate in the House remains unclear, with both Democrats and Republicans facing internal party divisions over the deal.\n\nDefense hawks and moderate Republicans said it's a strong compromise that will provide a much-needed boost to the military. However, conservatives called it a budget-busting proposal that would further sink the country in a sea of red ink.\n\nDemocrats are also conflicted because while the deal would increase spending for their favored domestic programs, the agreement does nothing to protect the DREAMers, the undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) delivered a record-breaking 8-hour speech on the House floor Wednesday, telling the stories of DREAMers without a break to object to the budget plan's failure to protect those immigrants.\n\nIf conservative Republicans in the House oppose the agreement, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) will need a significant number of Democratic votes to get it passed. However, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the Democratic whip, urged his members to line up in opposition to the deal.\n\n\"This package leaves DREAMers isolated, without a path to resolution in the House,\" Hoyer's notice to House Democrats states.\n\nIf it passes both chambers, it would give Congress six weeks to craft a spending bill for the rest of 2018 that meets the new budget targets before the government runs out of money again.",
    " Title: FBI Investigation and the Clinton-Weiner Connection: A Retrospective on the Clinton's 35-Year Political Career\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final stretch of the 2016 presidential race, the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server has become a significant factor, casting a shadow over her campaign. This article takes a retrospective look at the Clinton's 35-year political career, focusing on their relationship with the FBI and the controversy surrounding Huma Abedin and her husband, Anthony Weiner.\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, has kept Huma Abedin, a woman married to a man embroiled in multiple scandals, on her highest-level staff. Anthony Weiner, a former Congressman, has been involved in two scandals, the first of which led to his resignation from Congress and his failed bid for Mayor of New York.\n\nDespite Weiner's scandalous past, Clinton has maintained Abedin on her team. This raises questions about Clinton's judgment, particularly in light of her long-standing commitment to children's advocacy. Some argue that Clinton, with years of child advocacy behind her, should have addressed Weiner's inappropriate behavior and questionable judgment.\n\nThe latest controversy involves the discovery of 650,000 emails, many containing classified information, on Weiner's laptop. Former FBI agents have expressed concern that these classified documents may now be in the hands of America's enemies, with the Russians mentioned as a potential threat.\n\nThe Clinton-FBI relationship dates back to the 1980s, with FBI Special Agent I.C. Smith questioning Clinton's role in fundraising for her husband, Governor Bill Clinton, in Arkansas. The relationship continued into the 1990s, culminating in 1997 when then-FBI Director Louis Freeh compared his experiences with the Clintons to his 16 years doing organized crime cases in New York City.\n\nThis summer, the relationship reached a climax with the investigation into Clinton's email server, led by Director James Comey. Although Comey did not recommend an indictment in July as many observers expected, he did emphatically state that Clinton had lied to the bureau in her testimony and that her handling of classified information was \"extremely careless.\"\n\nThe FBI's investigation and Comey's statements have left many questioning Clinton's judgment and her fitness for the presidency. The controversy has also led to comparisons between the Clintons and a \"crime family,\" as described by former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom.\n\nAs the election approaches, the FBI's investigation into Clinton's email server has become a significant factor, raising questions about Clinton's judgment and her relationship with the FBI. The investigation, and the controversy surrounding Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner, has cast a shadow over Clinton's campaign and her 35-year political career.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Upholds Indiana Abortion Remains Law, Sparking Nationwide Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court's recent decision to uphold an Indiana law requiring the burial or cremation of fetal remains following an abortion has reignited the ongoing national debate on abortion. The debate, which has seen a shift in recent years, is increasingly dominated by extremists on both sides.\n\nThe political left, once advocating for the Bill Clinton standard of \"safe, legal, and rare,\" has become more comfortable with expanded abortion rights. This shift is evident in the \"Shout Your Abortion\" movement and abortion-rights-expanding bills in states like Virginia, New York, and elsewhere.\n\nOn the other hand, the right has responded with its own extreme counterpart, as seen in the recent Alabama law, which bans abortion except to protect the life of the mother and imposes serious jail time for abortion providers.\n\nHowever, the debate is not just a political one. It is also a scientific debate, as advancing neonatal research and technology reveals more detail about life in the womb. This challenges the notion of thinking about the fetus as a clump of cells beyond the early weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe challenge is that this advancing science denies us the luxury of self-delusion about the fetus. Yet, it does not necessarily mean that abortion should be outlawed. Instead, it calls for an adjustment in our thinking on the issue.\n\nThe silent majority of Americans, often overlooked in the extremist debate, is held hostage by the intractable extremities. As we all know, extremists are fixated on principle and purity, not on pragmatism, compromise, and real-world concerns.\n\nFor the moderates, the issue simplifies itself: Banning abortion is out of the question because it will only drive it underground, but most of us can manage our moral discomfort enough to be OK with abortion early in the pregnancy, in cases of rape, incest, and for the life of the mother, and in rare, wrenching cases, later-term abortion to protect the life of the mother.\n\nThe phrase \"the life of the mother\" carries meaning. When supplemented with \"the health of the mother,\" as in the New York law, pro-lifers, understandably, worry about the abuse of the exception.\n\nMeanwhile, a few loose ends remain. If liberals want science to be respected on the climate issue, they must respect the science on abortion as well. They should realize that as gestation advances, a fetus comes closer to being a baby, and elective abortion up to the time of delivery essentially means terminating a human who deserves dignity and has rights.\n\nSimilarly, the pro-life community should be more supportive of more freely available birth control and more support for pregnant women, especially from impoverished backgrounds.\n\nIn an age of abortion extremism, let's be clear: Either side winning completely is to enter a realm of dystopia. This article is a call for moderation, compromise, and a recognition of the complexity and gravity of the issue at hand.",
    " Title: Lawmakers Call for Trump Administration to Outline Syria Strategy Following Missile Strikes\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the U.S. missile strikes in Syria in response to the apparent chemical weapons attack by Syrian President Bashar Assad, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are urging the Trump administration to outline a broader strategy for the region.\n\nSenate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) told MSNBC on Friday morning that the strikes were appropriate, but cautioned that the situation in the Middle East is complex and requires a long-term strategy. \"It's the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end,\" McCain said, quoting Winston Churchill.\n\nMcCain added that the Middle East is in chaos, Europe is being destabilized, and the Islamic State is spreading throughout the world. He emphasized that the challenges of Bashar al-Assad and the Islamic State are significant, and there is much more to be done.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also urged the administration to collaborate and elaborate on the strategy moving forward. \"In the days ahead, I am committed to working with the administration to continue developing a counter-ISIL strategy that hastens the defeat of ISIL and establishes objectives for dealing with the Assad regime in a manner that preserves the institutions of government in an effort to prevent a failed state,\" he said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said late Thursday that making sure Assad knows that he will pay a price for committing such atrocities is the right thing to do. He added that the Trump administration needs to come up with a strategy and consult with Congress before implementing it.\n\nSenators were scheduled to hold a classified briefing with military and intelligence officials on Friday afternoon. The Senate adjourned for a two-week Spring recess, while the House has already left town for the break.\n\nSome Democrats, as well as at least two Republicans, are questioning the strikes' constitutionality. The military action is reviving debate over Congress's role in the matter and whether the president needs to obtain congressional authorization for any prolonged military engagement in the region.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who favors a more isolationist foreign policy approach, wrote on Twitter that the president needs Congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution. Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) echoed Paul's remarks, stating that airstrikes are an act of war and cannot justify a departure from the Constitution, which vests in Congress the power to commence war.\n\nRep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), a prominent liberal supporter of Congress passing a new authorization for the use of military force (AUMF), characterized the airstrikes as an act of war on Twitter. She tweeted that she was the lone vote against the 2001 AUMF and that Syria strikes are far beyond the scope of this war authorization.\n\nPresident Trump, like President Barack Obama before him, has launched airstrikes against ISIS targets using the 2001 war authorization Congress passed after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as legal justification. However, lawmakers are split over whether that justification covers attacks against the Assad government.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said the strike was \"appropriate and just\" and signaled that he also wants the Trump administration to consult Capitol Hill lawmakers on the matter. \"I look forward to the administration further engaging Congress in this effort,\" he said.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Rolls Back CFPB Auto Lending Guidelines, Sparking Controversy Over Fair Lending Practices\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and raised concerns about fair lending practices, President Donald Trump on Monday signed legislation that undoes a 2013 effort by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to discourage discrimination in auto lending. The move marks the first time that lawmakers have successfully used their authority under the Congressional Review Act to kill a regulatory action taken by an agency several years in the past.\n\nThe guidelines issued by the consumer bureau outlined steps that lenders should take to address discrimination by auto dealers, who often determine the terms for car loans that they help facilitate for their customers. With the backing of auto dealers and lenders, Republicans who drove the rollback argued that the CFPB should have followed formal rule-making procedures and sought more public feedback before issuing the guidelines. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law prohibits the bureau from regulating auto dealers. The CFPB guidance was addressed to lenders that fall under the bureau's jurisdiction.\n\nCFPB acting Director Mick Mulvaney praised the move to rescind what he called a \"misguided\" initiative by his predecessor, who was appointed by President Barack Obama. \"I am heartened that the people, through their elected representatives, have corrected this instance of Bureau overreach,\" Mulvaney said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats and consumer watchdogs warned that, in addition to encouraging unfair lending practices, the rollback opened a whole new front in Republicans' deregulation drive under Trump that would be felt well-beyond the CFPB. They argue that the move could lead to discriminatory practices in auto lending, particularly against minority groups.\n\n\"This controversial abuse of the CRA should never have been allowed to happen in the first place,\" said Amit Narang, regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen. \"By signing it, President Trump is turning his back on consumers by giving auto dealers license to discriminate against minorities.\"\n\nMulvaney, who also serves as the White House budget director, said the bureau will \"continue to fight unlawful discrimination at every turn.\" The CFPB said the process clarified that a number of its other guidance documents may be considered rules subject to the Congressional Review Act and that it will \"confer with congressional staff and federal agency partners\" to identify additional documents to submit to Congress.",
    " Title: Trump's Strong Economy and Job Approval Ratings: A Potential Path to Reelection\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent job creation numbers for November, with 266,000 jobs added and the unemployment rate at a 50-year low, have set a clear path for President Donald Trump's reelection bid in 2020. While the debate continues on whether the economic growth is a result of Trump's policies or external factors, historical trends and current polling data suggest that the economy is a significant factor in presidential elections.\n\nIn a CNN poll released last month, Trump's overall job approval was 42%, with 54% disapproving. However, when respondents were asked about Trump's handling of the economy, 52% approved, while 40% disapproved. This is the only area in the poll where a majority of respondents approved of the job Trump is doing.\n\nIn response to the positive jobs report, Trump took to Twitter to highlight his economic successes. He wrote, \"Without the horror show that is the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, the Stock Markets and Economy would be even better, if that is possible, and the Border would be closed to the evil of Drugs, Gangs and all other problems!\"\n\nThe phrase \"It's the economy, stupid\" coined by Democratic strategist James Carville during the 1992 presidential campaign, has proven true once again. Incumbent presidents do not lose often, and when they do, it is usually because the economy is perceived to be weak or faltering.\n\nHistorically, presidents such as Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and Gerald Ford have lost reelection bids due to weak economies. The only other president in the last nine decades to lose a bid for reelection was Richard Nixon, but his loss was due in large part to his decision to pardon the man he replaced in office.\n\nThe data shows that it is very difficult to beat an incumbent president unless the economy is seen by a majority of the public to be weakening badly. Voters consistently cite the economy as the most important issue affecting their vote, with 52% saying so in the 2016 election, 59% in the 2012 election, and 63% in the 2008 election.\n\nHowever, Trump's unique personality and unpredictable behavior could impact his chances of winning a second term. While his approval numbers on the economy have been strong for much of the past few years, his overall job approval numbers have never shown that a majority approve of the job he is doing overall. Additionally, Trump's inability to stay on message could negatively impact his reelection bid.\n\nIn conclusion, the strong economy and Trump's job approval ratings on the economy provide a clear path for Trump's reelection bid. However, Trump's unique personality and unpredictable behavior could negatively impact his chances of winning a second term. The economy is Trump's trump card with voters, but he must know how and when to play it effectively.",
    " Title: GOP Faces Moral Dilemma as Roy Moore's Victory in Alabama Senate Race Appears Imminent\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final stretch of the Alabama Senate special election, the Republican Party finds itself in a precarious position as Roy Moore, the embattled Senate nominee, appears to be gaining momentum. This development has prompted a series of events, with President Donald Trump endorsing Moore and several senators walking back their initial criticisms of the candidate.\n\nOn Monday, President Trump endorsed Moore in a tweet and a phone call, urging him to \"go get 'em.\" This endorsement came after several senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, called for Moore to step aside following allegations of sexual misconduct. However, McConnell, on Sunday, stated that the people of Alabama will decide who they want to send to the Senate, and the Senate will address the matter appropriately a week from Tuesday.\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch of Utah, who was traveling with Trump in Utah, furthered McConnell's rationalization on Monday. Hatch defended Trump's endorsement of Moore, stating that the President had no other choice, as he needs every Republican he can get to push his agenda through. Hatch also addressed the allegations against Moore, stating that many of the alleged actions were decades ago, making it a decision that has to be made by the people in Alabama.\n\nThis shift in stance from establishment Republicans, from condemning Moore to leaving the decision to the people of Alabama, is a stark contrast to their initial reactions to the allegations. The change in position is a result of Moore's unwavering commitment to the race and the potential for a victory, as polling suggests Moore's numbers have bounced back after an initial dip following the allegations.\n\nThe logic behind this shift in stance is transparently obvious in Hatch's comments about Moore and the race. Hatch's statement that Trump needs every Republican he can get to push his agenda through implies that any Republican, even one facing allegations of sexual misconduct, is better than any Democrat. This logical leap also calls into question the idea that, if Moore wins, Senate Republicans would move to expel him from the chamber, as suggested by Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner (R).\n\nThe potential expulsion of Moore from the Senate raises questions about the long-term consequences of the Republican Party's \"winning is everything\" strategy. Critics argue that this approach risks sacrificing the party's moral high ground in exchange for a two-seat Senate majority. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, tweeted on Monday night that a Moore victory would be a stain on the GOP and the nation, while Matthew Dowd, who handled polling for George W. Bush's presidential campaign, stated that the party has no moral authority to discuss sexual misconduct in politics if they support Moore.\n\nIn conclusion, the Republican Party's stance on the Alabama Senate race raises questions about the party's core principles and the potential long-term consequences of prioritizing short-term gains over moral integrity. The party's approach to the Moore allegations highlights the risk of sacrificing the moral high ground in exchange for a single Senate seat.",
    " Title: Senate Rebukes Trump Administration Over ZTE Deal, Amendment to Defense Bill Aims to Reinstate Penalties on Chinese Telecom Company\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, members of the U.S. Senate are gearing up to deliver a stinging rebuke to President Donald Trump's efforts to normalize trade with China, as they seek to reverse the administration's softening of penalties on the Chinese telecom company, ZTE. The amendment, co-sponsored by Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), aims to prohibit the entire U.S. government from purchasing or leasing equipment from ZTE and a similar telecom company, Huawei, cited for national security risks.\n\nThe amendment, added to the annual defense policy bill, would essentially reinstate the original penalties on ZTE, including a seven-year ban on ZTE's ability to purchase U.S. parts. The amendment also aims to restore penalties on ZTE imposed in March 2017 after the company was caught selling equipment to Iran and making false statements assuring it had disciplined executives.\n\nJohn Cohen, a former acting undersecretary for intelligence at DHS, stated, \"China's intelligence agencies regularly embed eavesdropping and other collection tools in technologies sold by Chinese tech firms. China's intelligence services also collaborate with these Chinese tech firms to achieve other intelligence objectives. Allowing ZTE to resume operation will likely cause great concern amongst those intelligence professionals responsible for protecting our national security.\"\n\nThe administration had previously reached a \"definitive agreement\" with ZTE, which included a billion-dollar fine and ZTE's agreement to install a new, American-picked compliance board. However, ZTE had already agreed to a $1.2-billion dollar fine in the 2017 penalty package.\n\nSenate Republicans have also expressed displeasure over the president's bellicose language towards Canada during the weekend's G7 meeting. While Canada had already announced retaliatory steel and aluminum tariffs on the U.S., it seemed to be Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's comments at a press conference, in which he said Canada would not be \"pushed around,\" that upset the president and his advisors.\n\nThe amendment is expected to pass this week, but it remains unclear whether the White House will weigh in on this latest development. Sen. Van Hollen stated that vetoing the entire National Defense Authorization Act defense policy bill, to which the ZTE amendment has been attached, would represent a massive concession to China.\n\nSenate Republicans are also working on a bill that would check the president's ability to impose tariffs on the basis of national security concerns, as he did in the Canada case, without congressional approval. However, the bill seems to be ineligible due to procedural hurdles related to its economic impact. Some Senate Republicans also have concerns that the bill would violate the president's constitutional authority as head of the executive branch.\n\nSen. John Thune (R-S.D.) noted that some Republicans are opting to give the administration space to negotiate with Canada and other partners in the near term, and that it would be best not to try to rein in the president's authority at the same time. The amendment to the defense bill is expected to pass this week, but the future of the bill remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Progressive Lawmakers, Led by Ocasio-Cortez, Plan to Leverage Banking Ties to Advance Anti-Second Amendment Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move reminiscent of her grilling of Wells Fargo CEO Timothy Sloan, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is reportedly planning to use similar tactics to advance her anti-Second Amendment agenda. According to Politico, Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive lawmakers aim to pressure America's financial institutions into taking a stand on some of the country's most divisive issues, including climate change, gun violence, and immigration.\n\nThe lawmakers, who hold seats on the powerful House Financial Services Committee and boast a significant following on social media, intend to confront finance industry executives and discourage them from funding oil pipelines, firearms makers, and private prison companies that operate immigration detention centers. Allied activist groups are amplifying the message.\n\nOcasio-Cortez admitted to Politico that part of the strategy to bring about the changes she desires is to circumvent Congress. \"There's more than one way to skin a cat, and not everything has to be done through legislation explicitly,\" she said. \"We can also use the tools that we have here to pressure change in other ways as well.\"\n\nIf history is any indication, this strategy could prove successful. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo announced earlier this month they would cut ties with prisons following pressure from Ocasio-Cortez and progressive activists. The tactic also worked last year against the National Rifle Association (NRA). In the wake of the Parkland, Florida, massacre, millions of Americans boycotted the NRA, which forced First National Bank to sever ties with the pro-gun organization, which supplied the NRA with its branded credit card.\n\nKaren Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics, told Politico that banks are particularly susceptible to public pressure. \"Banks are acutely sensitive about their reputations because they are in a business acutely susceptible to severe and sudden customer attrition if consumers vote with their wallets,\" she explained. \"As a highly regulated business, banks are also acutely aware of how changing reputations alter their political-risk profile and what Congress can do to them when and if desired.\"",
    " Title: Global Trends in Civic Engagement: A Look at Community Participation and Trust\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an ongoing quest to understand the dynamics of civic engagement, researchers worldwide are exploring various methods to measure the extent of community involvement. A recent experiment in Perth, Australia, offers an interesting insight into this phenomenon. Researchers left 300 letters on the streets, half of them pre-stamped and half not. The results showed that 92 of the stamped letters were delivered compared to 42 of the unstamped ones.\n\nThe experiment aimed to investigate why certain communities showed higher levels of letter delivery, thereby indicating a higher degree of trust and neighborly connections. The findings could potentially provide valuable insights into what fosters community cohesion and trust.\n\nSimilar experiments have been conducted in other parts of the world. For instance, in Birmingham, Alabama, local volunteer groups were given small grants for neighborhood improvement projects, such as graffiti removal, by the national group Love Your Block. This initiative led to a decrease in crime due to the increased social cohesion in these neighborhoods.\n\nCivic engagement encompasses a wide range of activities, from community service to voting or even posting a found letter. At its core, civic engagement is characterized by qualities of hope and trust that extend beyond family and friends. While democratic politics and national elections are often considered the pinnacle of civic engagement, President Obama once emphasized that democracy thrives on civic engagement from the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down.\n\nIn a 2016 survey of 140 countries by Gallup, the global state of civic engagement was assessed. The survey ranked countries based on the proportion of their population inclined to give back to their communities. Surprisingly, the top ten countries on the Gallup index included more than just wealthy countries. Myanmar topped the list, with Sri Lanka and Indonesia not far behind.\n\nThe survey also revealed that the most common form of giving back to a community was helping a stranger in need (44%), followed by donating money (27%) and volunteering (20%).\n\nRegardless of the method of measurement, civic engagement is the foundation of social peace and economic prosperity. One potential way to cultivate more of it could be to mirror a community's own actions, perhaps by dropping a few letters on the street to see how many are delivered. This could provide valuable insights into the levels of trust and community engagement in different cities and towns.",
    " Title: U.S. Places Hold on World Health Organization Funding Amidst Criticism of Pandemic Response\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could have significant implications for global health, President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that the U.S. is placing a hold on funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) for 60 to 90 days, pending a review of the organization's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDriving the news: Trump accused the WHO of \"severely mismanaging and covering up\" the coronavirus crisis, adding that the U.S. \"has a duty to insist on full accountability.\"\n\nAt a briefing in the Rose Garden, Trump expressed concerns about the effectiveness of U.S. contributions to the WHO, stating, \"With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have deep concerns whether America\u2019s generosity has been put to the best use possible.\"\n\nThe U.S. is the WHO's largest donor, contributing more than $400 million to the organization last year. In contrast, China contributes roughly $40 million a year, or less.\n\nTrump's decision comes amidst a series of criticisms leveled at the WHO for its response to the pandemic, particularly its initial stance on travel restrictions and its deference to China. The President has been vocal about his dissatisfaction, tweeting last week, \"The WHO really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look.\"\n\nTrump's national security team has reportedly rallied behind him, believing that the U.S. needed to take action beyond public statements to make the WHO feel the impact of its missteps. The decision, according to officials involved in the internal discussions, provides Trump with someone else to blame and a way to deflect from his own handling of the virus.\n\nThe President outlined specific complaints that led to his decision to freeze U.S. funding, including the WHO's alleged failure to obtain, vet, and share information in a timely and transparent manner, its failure to investigate credible reports from Wuhan that conflicted with the Chinese government's official accounts, and its delay in declaring a public health emergency, among other criticisms.\n\nOver the past week, officials within the White House's Office of Management and Budget have been working on a menu of options for how to snub the WHO. The most likely route is to reprogram U.S. funding that was allocated to the WHO, moving it to other international organizations that can administer it for comparable purposes, officials said. A more dramatic, but less likely, approach is to send a rescissions package to Congress, rescinding from the federal budget funds already allocated to the WHO.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, to whom the WHO reports, issued a statement, saying, \"Now is a time for unity in the global battle to push the COVID-19 pandemic into reverse, not a time to cut the resources of the... WHO, which is spearheading and coordinating the global body\u2019s efforts.\"\n\nThe WHO has yet to respond to the U.S.'s decision.",
    " Title: EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson's Alias Email Account Used for Training Certifications\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, documents disclosed late last week reveal that former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lisa Jackson used a controversial alias email account, [email protected], for completing various technology training courses, including declaring her as a \"scholar of ethical behavior.\" This revelation comes amidst questions about the EPA's compliance with open-records laws.\n\nThe new records, part of a series obtained through open-records requests, suggest that Ms. Jackson used the alias email address more extensively than previously known, including for taking required agency computer training under the fake identity. The EPA states that this practice is not unusual, as Ms. Jackson regularly used the alternate address for conducting agency business.\n\nThe records show that the Windsor account was awarded certificates for completing online email records management training, the 2010 \"No FEAR Act Training Module,\" and a cybersecurity awareness training course in 2011, where she scored 83 percent. The alias was also recognized as a \"scholar of ethical behavior\" each year from 2010 through 2012. Ms. Jackson appears to have taken only one training course under her own name, for cybersecurity awareness in 2010.\n\nChristopher Horner, the researcher and senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute who made the open-records request, commented, \"At least her alter ego was up on the law and ethics of federal record-keeping.\" Mr. Horner first revealed the existence of the alternate addresses last year in his book \"The Liberal War on Transparency.\"\n\nIn a letter to Mr. Horner, EPA official Eric W. Wachter, director of the office of the secretariat, stated that it was not unusual for Ms. Jackson to get certified under her alias, as that was the account she was signed in as when she took the online testing. EPA officials claim that Ms. Jackson kept the secondary address to avoid her main email, which was published on the agency's website, being overwhelmed by a flood of public emails. They also assert that previous administrators, including those under Republican President George W. Bush, also had secondary emails for internal use.\n\nHowever, Republicans argue that Ms. Jackson took the secondary email further than any of her predecessors, as she did not attach her real name to her secondary account. In response to a request from The \u2588\u2588\u2588, EPA officials could not say whether those prior administrators ever got certified under any of their aliases.\n\nIn a set of emails released to Mr. Horner earlier this year, Ms. Jackson appeared to be using the email to pretend she really was Richard Windsor. Mr. Horner argues that the secondary email matters because it wasn't clear that EPA was searching those records in response to open-records requests for Ms. Jackson's emails. Mr. Horner said that EPA didn't really begin to produce emails from the Richard Windsor account until after he exposed that address.\n\nEPA contends that it did search the Windsor account as part of open-records requests. However, the agency has acknowledged it has fallen short in many transparency areas. In April, acting Administrator Bob Perciasepe wrote a letter to all agency employees, stating they must do a better job of storing emails and computer instant messages, as required by law. He also said all employees would have to retake training classes.",
    " Title: The Legal Minds Behind the Health Care Reform Law's Constitutional Challenge\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming Supreme Court decision on the future of President Barack Obama's health care reform law, several legal minds who have played a significant role in challenging the law's constitutionality will likely leave a lasting impact on the court and their careers.\n\nIn 2009, when Congress began debating health care reform, the individual mandate, a requirement for nearly all Americans to buy health insurance, was not a major point of contention. However, a group of conservative legal scholars, including Nicholas Rivkin and Paul Casey, began writing articles, including an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal in September 2009, that suggested the mandate could be the bill's Achilles' heel.\n\nNow, the law's future hangs in the balance due to the mandate, with the potential for it to be significantly altered or even repealed.\n\nRivkin and Casey, constitutional lawyers at the law firm Baker Hostetler, were the first to publicly question the constitutionality of the mandate. Their op-ed in The Wall Street Journal served as the catalyst that sparked a wave of skepticism.\n\n\"We concluded pretty quickly that this kind of mandate was beyond the constitutional power of the federal government,\" Rivkin said in an interview.\n\nIn fact, Rivkin and Casey shared similar reservations when a health mandate was proposed in the early 1990s. When it became clear that the 2010 health law was going to pass with a mandate, several states hired Rivkin and Casey to represent them in a lawsuit against the federal government. This lawsuit, which now includes 26 plaintiff states and the National Federation of Independent Business, was filed the day Obama signed the bill into law.\n\nRivkin represented some states in the district court and won, with Judge Roger Vinson ruling that the mandate was unconstitutional and that the entire law should fall. Rivkin is confident the Supreme Court will rule against the mandate, arguing that the Obama administration has never defined a \"limiting principle.\"\n\n\"Every single judge and justice has asked the government, 'If you can do this mandate, what is it that you can not do?'\" Rivkin said. \"It's all very fine to say the federal government is denied general police powers, but it's pure verbiage, it's meaningless unless there is this limiting principle.\"\n\nBill McCollum, the former Florida attorney general who hired Rivkin and Casey and filed the states' lawsuit against the health law, credits the Rivkin-Casey op-ed with igniting his interest in the issue. McCollum assigned lawyers in the Florida attorney general's office to do their own research and concluded that he wanted to challenge the mandate and the law's expansion of Medicaid.\n\nBy early 2010, McCollum, who was working with then-South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster, asked his fellow attorneys general if they wanted to join. McCollum reported that he received a significant amount of interest, with one Democratic attorney general coming very close to joining but ultimately deciding against it at the last minute due to political concerns.\n\nMcCollum said he always thought the constitutional issue would wind up in the country's highest court, but even he was surprised by just how partisan the suit became.",
    " Title: Trump and Fauci Disagree on School Reopening, Economy, and Coronavirus Response\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo, President Donald Trump expressed his belief that political opponents want a slower reopening of the economy to harm him politically in the November election. The president's comments came in the same interview where he also disagreed with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), on the measures needed to reopen schools.\n\nWhen asked if he thinks his political opponents want him to keep the economy closed going into the presidential election, Trump responded, \"Yeah, I do. I do. I think it's a political thing.\" When pressed on whether such a move would be putting money ahead of lives, Trump countered, \"The people that want to see the right thing happen, they agree with me. We have to get our country open.\"\n\nTrump also criticized Fauci's stance on reopening schools during a Senate Health Committee hearing earlier this week. Fauci did not necessarily weigh in on whether schools should open, but said it's unlikely a vaccine would be ready in time for the school year.\n\n\"So [Dr.] Anthony [Fauci] is a good person, a very good person \u2013 I've disagreed with him,\" Trump said. \"We have to get the schools open, we have to get our country open, we have to open our country. Now we want to do it safely, but we also want to do it as quickly as possible, we can't keep going like this\u2026 You're having bedlam already in the streets, you can't do this. We have to get it open. I totally disagree with him on schools.\"\n\nEarlier this week, the White House touted the United States' progress on coronavirus testing, a major benchmark many experts and governors have said is necessary to hit before moving to lift stay-at-home orders and business closures. Trump also noted in the interview that young people tend not to get as sick because of the coronavirus and have lower death rates.\n\nHowever, this point, when made by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., in the Tuesday Senate hearing, was a concern for Fauci. \"We should be humble about what we do not know,\" Fauci told Paul. \"And I think that falls under the fact that we do not know everything about this virus, and we really got to be very careful, particularly when it comes to children.\"\n\nTrump also noted in the Wednesday morning interview that Fauci has supported his earlier move to restrict travel from China in the earlier stages of the coronavirus outbreak. Fauci, in Senate testimony, warned of new coronavirus outbreaks if states jump \"checkpoints\" to reopen.\n\n\"He said I saved hundreds of thousands of lives, which is what happened,\" Trump said. \"Everybody disagreed when I did that.\" Trump also criticized the Chinese government, which knew about the coronavirus outbreak when it signed a trade deal with Trump in January.\n\nTrump's comments come despite conservative reopening guidelines released by his own administration that Fauci emphasized need to be followed in his Tuesday testimony. Fauci warned that prematurely lifting coronavirus restrictions, closing schools and businesses, and limiting travel would lead to \"suffering and death\" and \"turn the clock back instead of going forward.\"",
    " Title: Republican Presidential Candidates Grapple with Immigration Policy as 2016 Campaign Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2016 presidential campaign heats up, Republicans are facing a significant challenge in crafting a coherent immigration policy that appeases both their conservative primary voters and the general election's Hispanic voters. The issue, which Hillary Clinton has sought to make a defining one, has left the Republican field divided on the question of how to handle the millions of people in the U.S. illegally.\n\nWhile Clinton forcefully advocates for a pathway to citizenship for many illegal immigrants, the Republican field features a diverse range of positions. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who once supported a path to citizenship, now talks about offering legal status instead. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who was an architect of a broad immigration bill that included a citizenship path, now favors a piecemeal approach.\n\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker has reversed his stance on the issue, now opposing a pathway to citizenship, a position he once supported. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a critic of offering citizenship to illegal immigrants, has left unanswered the question of whether they should eventually be allowed to earn legal status. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee both advocate for tightening border security but are vague about further policy.\n\nAn Associated Press-GfK survey released May 6 found that 53% of respondents support a path to citizenship, while 50% expressed support for a path to legal status. Among Republicans, only 4 in 10 support allowing immigrants who arrived as children, along with parents of citizens or permanent residents, to legally remain.\n\nThe current stances of GOP candidates also present a campaign issue for Clinton, who said while campaigning this week in Nevada that Republicans' refusal to embrace a pathway to citizenship would relegate millions of people to underclass status.\n\nRepublican strategist Andy Puzder, chief executive of CKE Restaurants, warned that the biggest risk for Republicans is using the immigration issue as a cudgel to beat each other up, which could harm their chances in the general election. Javier Palomarez, president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, noted that immigration is a unifying issue and that any candidate who cannot speak to it will have an uphill climb.\n\nIn 2012, only 27% of Hispanics voted for Mitt Romney, a steep decline from the 44% who voted for the re-election of President George W. Bush in 2004. The dynamic is far different within the Republican primary electorate than it is sure to be among general-election voters. For Jeb Bush, past support for a pathway to citizenship looms as a potential obstacle to winning the GOP nomination.\n\nSenator Rubio, who is Cuban-American, helped write the 2013 Senate bill that included a path to citizenship for many illegal immigrants, enhanced border security, and other sweeping changes to the immigration system. Mr. Rubio backed away from the legislation after it died in the House. Now he emphasizes the importance of border security and says nothing can be done to put illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship until Americans are convinced the border is secure.\n\nMr. Walker earlier supported immigration legislation that offered a chance at citizenship to people here illegally. He has since renounced that position and argued that the jobs of U.S. citizens could be threatened by giving citizenship to illegal residents and even, potentially, by expanding legal immigration.\n\nResponding to Clinton's call for a pathway to citizenship, Mr. Walker said on Twitter that her \"full embrace of amnesty is unfair to hardworking Americans & immigrants who followed the law to achieve these rights.\"\n\nSenator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) a year ago seemed to be signaling openness to granting legal status to undocumented workers, but he ended up voting against the Senate immigration bill that included such provisions, saying it didn't do enough to secure the border.\n\nSenator Cruz opposes citizenship for illegal immigrants, but at a session last week with the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, he deflected questions about whether he would support a pathway to legal status. Mr. Cruz said politicians should stay focused on advancing policies where there is consensus.",
    " Title: Media's Portrayal of Hillary Clinton as 'Inevitable' Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe portrayal of Hillary Clinton as the inevitable Democratic nominee for the 2016 presidential election has been a recurring theme in the media since the 2012 election. This narrative gained momentum following a joint interview with Clinton and then-President Barack Obama on \"60 Minutes,\" and was further reinforced by magazine covers and media polls showing Clinton with a significant lead over potential Democratic challengers.\n\nHowever, this narrative has recently become the subject of criticism, with some media outlets and political strategists arguing that Clinton's campaign-like efforts, despite her insistence that she has not yet decided to run, are a repeat of the mistakes she made in 2008.\n\nIn a story published by Buzzfeed, Obama aides and strategists warn that Clinton is building a machine in lieu of a message, and is lumbering toward the Democratic nomination with the same deep vulnerabilities that cost her the nomination eight years earlier.\n\nWhite House pollster Joel Benenson is quoted as saying, \"I just don't see any strategic value in stories positioning her as inevitable or the pre-emptive nominee, and I don't think people who are out there talking about this help her. And I think she should make that clear.\"\n\n2012 Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt adds, \"Even if it is a well-known candidate\u2014sometimes more so\u2014activists, donors, and voters like to see candidates fighting for every vote.\"\n\nWhile it is true that Clinton's top-heavy operation proved the media wrong in 2007 and 2008, and that she does not have a clear message, her status as a potential first female president, wife of a controversial ex-president, and a political persona that overshadows all possible rivals, even an incumbent vice president, sets her apart from other front-runners.\n\nClinton's recent appearance with Univision, where she spoke about her relationship with her daughter Chelsea, is an example of her campaign-style efforts. However, she took no questions from reporters, which has been a point of criticism.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding her media portrayal, Clinton remains the frontrunner in early polls, leading every major GOP contender by at least 15 points. However, the validity of these polls is questionable, as they are often meaningless in the early stages of an election cycle.\n\nIn conclusion, the media's portrayal of Hillary Clinton as the inevitable Democratic nominee has sparked controversy, with some arguing that her campaign-like efforts are a repeat of the mistakes she made in 2008. However, Clinton's unique status as a potential first female president, wife of a controversial ex-president, and a political persona that overshadows all possible rivals, may make it difficult for her to muffle the media's narrative of inevitability.",
    " Title: White House Warnings of Sequester's Impact on Air Travel and Government Services Spark Controversy\n\nThe Obama administration's warnings of the potential consequences of upcoming spending cuts, known as the sequester, have sparked debate and concern among lawmakers and the public. In recent days, officials have issued dire warnings of increased forest fires, workplace deaths, and even chicken shortages.\n\nOn Tuesday, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood warned of significant air travel delays across the country as air traffic controllers may be forced off the job due to budget cuts. LaHood suggested that smaller airports, such as the airport at golfing paradise Hilton Head, South Carolina, might have to reduce hours of operation or even temporarily close.\n\nThe administration's warnings have raised questions about the impact of the automatic spending cuts set to go into effect on March 1 and the government's ability to find relatively modest savings without cutting essential services.\n\nThe Department of Transportation's budget for 2013 is $74.2 billion. The automatic spending cuts would slice $1 billion out of its budget, equating to a cut of less than 1.4 percent. It is worth noting that even if the cuts go into effect, the Department of Transportation will spend more money this year ($73.2 billion) than it spent last year ($72.6 billion).\n\nAt a White House briefing, Secretary LaHood was asked if there were other ways to cut without telling air traffic controllers to stay home. LaHood responded, \"This has to be a part of it. DOT has 55,000 employees. The largest number of those employees are at the FAA, and the largest number of those employees are controllers, and they're all over the country. There has to be some impact in order to save a billion dollars. A billion dollars is a lot of money.\"\n\nAnother fact lost amidst the dire warnings is that although the cuts go into effect on March 1, most of the impact will not be felt until weeks or even months after that. On March 1, the federal government will give employees 30 days notice that they may have to take unpaid leave (furlough). The first furloughs can not happen until March 31 at the earliest. For employees of the Department of Transportation, the most they will be asked to take is one unpaid day off every two weeks.\n\nPress Secretary Jay Carney insisted at the White House that the administration is not exaggerating when it warns of more forest fires, chicken shortages, and long air travel delays. \"I think all of those things come from reduced, you know, numbers of people fighting fires, you know, reduced numbers of people doing inspections of our food, reduced numbers of people, you know, engaging in air traffic control,\" Carney said. \"I mean, those are just the facts.\"\n\nFor more information on the potential consequences of the spending cuts, readers are encouraged to review the Administration's list of 57 Terrible Consequences of the spending cuts compiled by Chris Good of \u2588\u2588\u2588.",
    " Title: Donald Trump Jr. Met with UAE and Saudi Arabian Representatives in 2016, Offered Help to Campaign\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of U.S. President Donald Trump, met with an envoy representing the crown princes of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in August 2016. The meeting was first reported by the New York Times on Saturday and was later confirmed by an attorney representing Trump Jr.\n\nThe meeting, held on Aug. 3, 2016, was a chance for the envoy to offer help to the Trump presidential campaign, according to The New York Times. The newspaper said the meeting was arranged by Erik Prince, the founder and former head of private military contractor Blackwater, who also attended the meeting. Joel Zamel, a co-founder of an Israeli consulting firm, was also in attendance.\n\nAlan Futerfas, Trump Jr.'s attorney, said on Saturday that nothing came of the meeting. \"Prior to the 2016 election, Donald Trump Jr. recalls a meeting with Erik Prince, George Nader, and another individual who may be Joel Zamel,\" Futerfas said in an emailed statement. \"They pitched Mr. Trump Jr. on a social media platform or marketing strategy. He was not interested and that was the end of it.\"\n\nA company connected to Zamel also worked on a proposal for a \"covert multimillion-dollar online manipulation campaign\" to help Trump, utilizing thousands of fake social media accounts, the New York Times report said.\n\nThe envoy, Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, told Trump Jr. that the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and the UAE were eager to help his father win the 2016 presidential election, the paper said.\n\nSince 1974, the United States has barred foreign nationals from giving money to political campaigns and it later barred them from donating to political parties. The campaign financing laws also prohibit foreign nationals from coordinating with a campaign and from buying an ad that explicitly calls for the election or defeat of a candidate.\n\nThe Saudi and UAE embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal last month reported that investigators working for U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had met with Zamel, and that Mueller's team was looking into his firm's work and his relationship with Nader.\n\nMueller is investigating whether Russia meddled in the presidential election and if Moscow colluded with the Trump campaign, as well as whether Trump committed obstruction of justice by trying to thwart the U.S. Department of Justice probe. Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and has called the Mueller investigation a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nThe New York Times report said the meetings are an indication that other countries besides Russia may have offered help to Trump's presidential campaign. Mueller's investigators have questioned witnesses in Washington, New York, Atlanta, Tel Aviv, and elsewhere regarding possible foreign help to the campaign, the report said.\n\nPeter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller's team, declined to comment on the report.\n\nZamel's attorney, Marc Mukasey, said in a statement to AP that his client \"offered nothing to the Trump campaign, received nothing from the Trump campaign, delivered nothing to the Trump campaign, and was not solicited by, or asked to do anything for, the Trump campaign.\"\n\n\"Media reports about Mr. Zamel's engaging in'social media manipulation' are uninformed,\" Mukasey added. \"Mr. Zamel's companies harvest publicly available information for lawful use.\"\n\nKathryn Ruemmler, Nader's lawyer, told the paper that her client \"has fully cooperated with the U.S. special counsel's investigation and will continue to do so.\"\n\nErik Prince, who is also the brother of U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, could not be immediately reached for comment.",
    " Title: U.S.-China Trade Negotiations Resume Amidst Ongoing Disagreements and Uncertainty\n\nPresident Donald Trump has criticized China for its alleged lack of commitment to purchasing American agricultural products, accusing the nation of \"ripping off\" the U.S. as trade negotiations resumed in Shanghai following a three-month hiatus. Trump's comments come as the two nations engage in another round of talks aimed at resolving their ongoing trade dispute.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Tuesday, Trump stated, \"China is doing very badly, worst year in 27 -- was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now -- no signs that they are doing so.\" He further added, \"That is the problem with China, they just don\u2019t come through.\"\n\nTrump's remarks were made as he departed the White House for Jamestown, Virginia. He also told reporters, \"We\u2019re either going to make a great deal or we\u2019re not going to make a deal at all.\"\n\nTrump also mentioned that he had recently spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but did not provide details about the conversation or its substance. Trump asserted that Beijing is willing to make concessions in trade talks, but he is unsure if he will accept them, and that the decision on reaching a deal ultimately rests with him, not his Chinese counterparts.\n\nChina's state media refuted Trump's comments without directly naming him. The People's Daily, the Communist Party's flagship newspaper, said in a commentary that China has no intention of \"ripping off\" the U.S. and has not done so. The U.S., it said, seemed to have forgotten that it had pledged to \"restart negotiations on a basis of equality and mutual respect,\" instead only hoping to threaten China into making concessions, a tactic that will ultimately fail.\n\nStocks slid earlier in the day after Trump's criticism of China, with the S&P 500 Index closing lower for a second consecutive day. China's imports of U.S. soybeans dropped to the lowest level since at least 2004.\n\nTrump also warned that if he is re-elected in 2020, China faces a much tougher deal. He said, \"They always change the deal in the end to their benefit,\" adding, \"They should probably wait out our Election to see if we get one of the Democrat stiffs like Sleepy Joe.\" This is a reference to Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe trade talks between the world's largest economies are taking place amidst a two-day Federal Reserve meeting that started on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to lower interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, partly due to trade war concerns slowing business investment.\n\nU.S. delegates, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, arrived in Shanghai to begin another round of talks with their Chinese counterparts. The Americans attended a dinner at the Fairmont Peace Hotel on Tuesday evening, and talks are scheduled to continue on Wednesday in China's bustling port city.\n\nExpectations for a breakthrough in the trade talks remain low. The two sides are further apart than they were three months ago, when negotiations broke down, and each side blamed the other for derailing attempts to reach a deal. China is pushing for compromise in the talks, with state media underlining this week that the U.S. should meet it \"halfway.\"\n\nThe outcome of the Shanghai talks will help determine whether China will resume negotiations from a draft text agreed before the impasse in May, or wait for the 2020 election, or propose a different approach. Michael Pillsbury, director of the Center on Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute, said on Tuesday, \"This could be real suspense.\"\n\nIt remains unclear what triggered Trump's latest outburst. U.S. soybean exports to China slumped in the first half of the year to the lowest level in more than a decade, while pork sales in June slipped from a month earlier. China has said the purchase of American farming products will be contingent on the U.S. following through on Trump's pledge to allow American companies to resume sales to Huawei Technologies Co. Speaking to reporters at an event in Sao Paulo on Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said he has received more than 50 applications for special licenses for companies to do business with Huawei, and that he and Trump met with \"supply chain\" representatives last week. The administration put the Chinese telecommunications giant on a trade blacklist in May, which means American firms need a special license issued by the Commerce Department to ship to the company.",
    " Title: Unconventional Pre-Rally Scene: Alex Jones and a Pile of Manure\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, a bizarre incident involving Infowars' Alex Jones and a pile of manure marked the prelude to President Donald Trump's rally in Houston, Texas, on October 22, 2018.\n\nJournalist Elizabeth Nolan Brown, who was in the vicinity of the Cruz/Trump rally, reported that she encountered Jones, huffing away from the area with a small entourage of men in MAGA hats. As she turned to ask if he had just had a confrontation with protesters, she witnessed Jones taking to the middle of the street to shout at the pile of manure, addressing it as if it were Beto O'Rourke, the Texas Democrat challenging sitting Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nThe main event, however, was the rally itself, where President Trump, who earlier in the day had referred to Cruz as \"Beautiful Ted,\" gave a speech that focused more on his administration's achievements and his political opponents than on Cruz. The pre-Trump speakers also seemed to prioritize criticizing O'Rourke over praising Cruz.\n\nOne notable point in the president's speech was his emphasis on the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and his administration's record number of Supreme Court justices appointed in \"less than two years.\"\n\nIn a separate development, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is taking action against a website, Aid Access, that has been shipping abortion-inducing drugs from a pharmacy in India to women in the U.S. for the past six months. The FDA claims that the site, run by founder Rebecca Gomperts, is illegally importing the drug mifepristone, which is used in approximately one-third of all first-trimester abortions, and can only be distributed at pre-approved clinics, hospitals, and private practices. The FDA allows personal use of imported medicines, but the distribution of mifepristone is subject to a strict protocol that prevents it from being sold online or in retail pharmacies.",
    " Title: Obama's \"Captive Nations Week\" Proclamation Amidst Syria Crisis Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of mounting criticism over his handling of the political and humanitarian crisis in Syria, President Barack Obama signed a \"Captive Nations Week\" proclamation on Monday. The order, which has been a routine practice by presidents since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959, does not directly address the Syrian conflict.\n\nIn the proclamation, the president declared, \"As individuals rise to demand their universal rights, the United States stands with them in pursuit of equality, justice, and freedom.\" He further stated, \"And as long as there are people who live in the darkness of oppression, America will remain their steadfast friend, linked by a common dream and our common ideals.\"\n\nThe Syrian crisis, where forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have reportedly killed nearly 15,000 civilians in 16 months of open revolt against the regime, is not mentioned in the proclamation.\n\nCritics, such as Douglas Feith, a former undersecretary of defense in the administration of President George W. Bush, have accused the Obama administration of a timid response to the Syrian crisis. In an article published in the Wall Street Journal on Monday, Mr. Feith stated, \"The Obama administration has neither promoted humanitarian'safe zones' on Syria's Turkish border, nor provided arms to the rebels. It has not helped establish a no-fly zone, nor has it supported NATO military strikes against Assad's forces.\"\n\nRussia, a key ally of the Syrian regime, accused the West of attempting to use blackmail to secure a new U.N. Security Council resolution that could allow the use of force in Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters that the Kremlin has no intention of supporting a British proposal to enact U.N. sanctions to resolve the crisis.\n\nThe U.S. has consistently supported sanctions, which the Obama administration has stepped up as the crisis has deepened. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also worked with the U.N. Security Council and U.N. envoy Kofi Annan on a June 30 accord calling on Syrians to come up with a political transition.\n\nA mandate for a U.N. observer force expires on July 20, and Mr. Lavrov accused the West of using the deadline as a bargaining chip. \"To our great regret, there are elements of blackmail,\" Mr. Lavrov said. \"We are being told that if you do not agree to passing the resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, then we shall refuse to extend the mandate of the monitoring mission.\"\n\nMr. Feith criticized the president for ceding U.S. sovereignty to the United Nations in the debate. \"By refusing to act on Syria, the president is missing an opportunity to advance U.S. security interests in the Middle East, while benefiting Iran, the principal sponsor of the Assad regime,\" Mr. Feith said. \"And by suggesting that America lacks international legal authority to act, he is undermining U.S. sovereignty.\"\n\nIn the \"Captive Nations\" proclamation, Mr. Obama said, \"America renews our abiding ties to all peoples who struggle to claim their inalienable rights.\" He further stated, \"As strongly as my administration condemns tyranny, we embrace emerging democracies and welcome the chance to work with those who seek to restore their people's liberty.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Call for International Investigation into China's Handling of COVID-19\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan push for accountability regarding China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged on Capitol Hill, with a proposed resolution calling for an international investigation into the Communist Chinese Party's (CCP) response to the virus. The resolution, introduced by Representative Elise Stefanik (R-NY) in the House of Representatives and Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO), aims to investigate the CCP's actions and the role their cover-up played in the global spread of the pandemic.\n\nThe resolution asserts that the CCP intentionally concealed information about the virus, with knowledge of its existence as early as December, while ordering laboratories to destroy samples and silencing doctors. This alleged cover-up, according to the resolution's proponents, led to the deaths of thousands of people worldwide, including hundreds of Americans.\n\nSenator Hawley stated in a release, \"Since day one, the Chinese Communist Party intentionally lied to the world about the origin of this pandemic. It is time for an international investigation into the role their cover-up played in the spread of this devastating pandemic. The CCP must be held to account for what the world is now suffering.\"\n\nRepresentative Stefanik, in a statement, emphasized the need for China to be held accountable for the harm caused by their actions. \"There is no doubt that China\u2019s unconscionable decision to orchestrate an elaborate coverup of the wide-ranging and deadly implications of coronavirus led to the death of thousands of people, including hundreds of Americans and climbing. This Resolution calls for China to provide compensation for the harm, loss, and destruction their arrogance brought upon the rest of the world,\" she said.\n\nThe proposed legislation seeks to investigate the CCP's knowledge of the virus and their decision to withhold this information, as well as to condemn the widespread harm caused by the Chinese government. While Democrats have so far refused to concede any criticism toward the CCP for their role in the spread of the virus, the resolution's proponents argue that the communist regime must be held accountable for their intentional negligence.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Condemns Rep. Don Young's Use of Offensive Term, Amidst Sensitive Immigration Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, has publicly condemned the use of the term \"wetbacks\" by Rep. Don Young, a senior member of the Republican Party from Alaska, during a radio interview. The remark, followed by a swift apology from Young and Boehner's statement that the comment was \"beneath the dignity of the office he holds,\" comes at a particularly sensitive time for the Republican Party in its relationship with Hispanic voters.\n\nThe GOP is currently grappling with calls for changes in immigration law, with more party leaders now backing a so-called path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, a stance opposed by many conservatives. The November elections saw Latinos voting overwhelmingly for President Obama, and the party is attempting to navigate this complex issue.\n\nYoung, in the interview with an Alaska radio station, used the term \"wetbacks\" to describe Hispanic migrant workers who used to pick tomatoes on his father's family ranch. He stated, \"My father had a ranch. We used to hire 50 or 60 wetbacks and \u2014 to pick tomatoes. You know, it takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now. It's all done by machine.\"\n\nIn a subsequent statement, Young, who is 79 and has spent four decades in Alaska's only U.S. House seat, said, \"I meant no disrespect\" in using the term, a slur for Mexicans crossing illegally into the United States. The Alaska Dispatch reported the apology:\n\n\"During a sit-down interview with Ketchikan Public Radio this week, I used a term that was commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in Central California. I know that this term is not used in the same way nowadays and I meant no disrespect. Migrant workers play an important role in America's workforce, and earlier in the interview, I discussed the compassion and understanding I have for these workers and the hurdles they face in obtaining citizenship. America must once and for all tackle the issue of immigration reform.\"",
    " Title: Justice Department Declines to File Federal Civil Rights Charges Against NYPD Officer Involved in Eric Garner's Death\n\nThe Justice Department on Monday declined to file federal civil rights charges against Officer Daniel Pantaleo, the New York Police Department (NYPD) officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner in 2014. The decision comes one day before the fifth anniversary of Garner's death and the expiration of the statute of limitations.\n\nGarner, a 43-year-old father of six, was ruled a homicide in August 2014. His dying words, \"I can't breathe,\" on July 17, 2014, became a national rallying cry for demonstrations about police treatment of minorities.\n\nEric Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, after a meeting with federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, expressed her disappointment, stating, \"The Justice Department has failed us.\"\n\nIn August 2014, a Staten Island grand jury chose not to indict Officer Pantaleo on any state criminal charges four months after Garner's death.\n\nAttorney General William Barr made the decision, which was based on the Eastern District of New York's recommendation not to prosecute over the department's civil rights division's recommendation to move forward with a prosecution.\n\nThe decision was made after the Justice Department determined it could not establish the willful intent requirement, and it did not seek to analyze elements like whether Pantaleo's actions were not permissible or even reasonable under NYPD or other law enforcement policies.\n\nPatrolmen's Benevolent Association (PBA) President Patrick J. Lynch stated, \"In both cases, a careful review of the facts led investigators to the truth, although Mr. Garner\u2019s death was an undeniable tragedy, Police Officer Pantaleo did not cause it.\"\n\nLynch further added, \"Scapegoating a good and honorable officer, who was doing his job in the manner he was taught, will not heal the wounds this case has caused for our entire city.\" The PBA believes that if the NYPD decides the disciplinary case on the facts, free of improper political influence, Officer Pantaleo will be fully exonerated of any wrongdoing.",
    " Title: Twin Bombings Near Iranian Embassy in Beirut Leave 20 Dead, Raise Concerns Over Lebanon's Stability\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo explosions near the Iranian embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday have left at least 20 people dead and over 100 injured, according to various reports. The Iranian cultural attache, Ebrahim Ansari, was among the casualties. The attacks, which some observers are linking to the ongoing Syrian civil war, have raised concerns over deepening sectarian divisions across the region.\n\nThe incidents occurred in the Jnah district, home to the Iranian embassy, following a double suicide bombing. One attacker detonated explosives on foot, while another did so in a car, as reported by The Los Angeles Times. Television images showed dark smoke, several fires, and blazing cars.\n\nThe perpetrators of the attack, reportedly the Lebanese Sunni jihadi group the Abdullah Azzam Brigades, have claimed responsibility, according to the BBC. The group is said to have sent a \"clear message.\"\n\nThe area has been targeted by a series of attacks in recent months, with Lebanon as a whole experiencing cross-border rocket attacks, deadly car bomb attacks, sectarian clashes, and roadside bomb attacks against suspected Hezbollah vehicles, as reported by The \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nLebanon's Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, stated that the aim of the blast was to \"stir up the situation in Lebanon and use the Lebanese arena to convey messages.\"\n\nIran and Hezbollah, Lebanon's largest political group, are major backers of the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, recently announced that the group would continue to send its militiamen to Syria to fight alongside government forces, drawing condemnation from anti-Assad groups in both Lebanon and Syria.\n\nLebanese officials have declared a policy of neutrality in the Syrian war, aiming to avoid their nation being drawn into Syria's civil war. Many in Lebanon fear the Syrian conflict could destabilize Lebanon's fragile, multi-sectarian democracy, still brittle following Lebanon's own 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990.\n\nThe attacks took place amidst the Syrian government's aggressive pushback against rebel fighters on three fronts, including one in the region of Qalamoun along the Lebanese border, as reported by The New York Times.\n\nThe potential outcomes of the Syrian conflict remain uncertain, with experts suggesting that if there is one outright \"winner,\" it could critically affect Lebanon's stability. If the Assad regime manages to cling to power and reduce the threat posed by the rebels, Hezbollah will remain strong in Lebanon, and the cross-regional alliance between the Shiite group and its backers in Damascus and Tehran will endure. Conversely, if the Assad regime falls and is replaced by a Sunni regime that moves closer to Saudi Arabia and the Sunni Gulf, Hezbollah will be isolated from Iran and will feel dangerously vulnerable.\n\nDespite the attacks and bombings on Lebanese soil, it is not yet clear if Syria is tipping Lebanon toward its own civil war.",
    " Title: AOC Discusses Vice Presidency, Sanders Endorsement, and Language in Spanish-Language Interview\n\nIn a recent interview with Noticias Telemundo, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., expressed her desire to serve as vice president, acknowledging, however, that she is five years short of the constitutional age limit for the position. The 30-year-old freshman congresswoman delivered a keynote address at Sen. Bernie Sanders' Spanish-language town hall in Las Vegas on Sunday, where she endorsed him for the White House in October.\n\nDuring the interview, Ocasio-Cortez, whose mother is Puerto Rican, emphasized the importance of preserving her Spanish language skills. She had previously expressed nervousness about hosting the town hall in Spanish due to her limited use of the language.\n\n\"If we are first- or second-generation, it is important that we cultivate our language,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"I must speak and practice more to improve my own Spanish. Our language is the link with our families and our communities.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez also reflected on her political journey, from working as a waitress and bartender in a taqueria to her current role as a congresswoman. She emphasized that her values remain the same, focusing on fighting for working families, healthcare, education, and fair wages.\n\n\"Last year I worked in a taqueria, as a waitress and as a bartender, and now I am a congresswoman,\" she said. \"That is a huge change. But my values are the same. And we are saying the same thing we were saying last year: that we must fight for working families, for health insurance, for education for all children and a fair salary.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez also took the opportunity to reiterate her support for Sen. Sanders, mentioning her previous work as a community organizer for him during the last presidential campaign. She could play a key role in helping Sanders secure Nevada's large Latino vote, differentiating him from fellow progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren.",
    " Title: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry Issues Blunt Warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin Over Ukraine Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stern warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday evening urged Putin to reverse his actions in Ukraine or face \"grave\" and \"costly\" consequences from the international community. Kerry's statement, delivered in the State Department briefing room, marked the most detailed and direct warning from U.S. leaders regarding the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.\n\nKerry outlined a list of covert and destabilizing actions he said Russia has pursued against Ukraine over the past week, including disciplined paramilitary groups occupying Ukrainian government buildings, arrests of undercover Russian intelligence agents, and the kidnappings and murders of local Ukrainian officials and journalists.\n\nPresident Obama, on a four-nation tour of Asia, also weighed in on the crisis, raising the prospect of tougher economic sanctions from the West and stating, \"We are ready to act.\" Obama's comments came in response to Putin's Thursday warning that Ukraine would face \"consequences\" for moving against pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAppearing to presage deeper Russian intervention, Putin said Russia would \"have to react to such developments.\" Ukrainian security forces, attempting to clear roadblocks and take back barricaded government buildings in eastern Ukraine, killed as many as five separatists on Thursday.\n\nKerry's statement, which sounded like a final warning shot, emphasized that Russia's destabilizing activities and covert actions in Eastern Ukraine had started even as the U.S., Russia, the European Union, and Ukraine were meeting in Geneva last week to forge a stabilization plan to end the Ukraine standoff. However, while the government in Kiev was doing everything it had agreed to under the plan, Kerry said, Russia was stepping up activities designed to undermine and provoke the Kiev government.\n\nKerry also offered statistics suggesting the Russian economy is already hurting from sanctions imposed over the Crimea annexation and cited some Russian officials acknowledging the blow sanctions have already struck, in particular to foreign investment and the confidence of foreign investors in considering Russia in the current climate.\n\nHowever, some analysts are less confident that the \"international community\" will be united in imposing a new round of broader sanctions on sectors of the Russian economy. Experts considering sanctions at a Washington forum sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Thursday underscored that Western Europe remains reliant on Russian energy and is likely to find it difficult to replace that energy in time for next winter.\n\nSome also note that the European Union is not united on imposing broad sector sanctions, and that some Europeans could be sympathetic to a Russian claim, if it moved into Ukraine, that it acted to restore order where a civil war threatened.\n\n\"I can imagine the Russians claiming they acted to stop the unrest and reestablish order, and if they take that to the Germans and maybe some others, that could fall on some sympathetic ears, and we could see some breaks in a united Western front,\" says Nikolas Gvosdev, a specialist in Russian security affairs at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I. \"That would put Obama in a tough spot.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Urged to Provide Diplomatic Support for Guaid\u00f3, Avoid Military Intervention in Venezuela\n\nArticle:\n\nThe political crisis in Venezuela has reached a critical point, with the left supporting Juan Guaid\u00f3, the self-proclaimed interim president, but urging against U.S. military intervention. The Maduro regime, which has been accused of destroying democratic institutions, devastating the economy, and causing widespread social unrest, has not touched Guaid\u00f3, recognizing the risks of detaining the man whom many world governments recognize as the legitimate president of Venezuela.\n\nTensions escalated this week as Guaid\u00f3 led a military uprising, with the U.S. and other countries expressing support for the opposition. The U.S. has promised a \"significant response\" if Guaid\u00f3 is harmed, but many argue that military intervention is not the solution.\n\n\"The U.S. should refrain from intervening militarily, but should continue providing decisive diplomatic, and even logistical, support,\" said a spokesperson for the left. \"The Venezuelan people have international moral support for their cause and the promise of aid to rebuild, but they're on their own against a regime backed by Cuba, Russia, China, and Iran.\"\n\nThe spokesperson also warned against the U.S. government taking a role in the foreign crisis, stating, \"It's dangerous to encourage that hope \u2014 because it may induce them to take unwise risks, and because it could lead us to plunge into another country where our interests, like our understanding, is minimal.\"\n\nThe situation in Venezuela has led to a massive exodus of Venezuelans, with the United Nations estimating that there will be more than 5 million refugees by the end of this year, comparable to the exodus caused by the Syrian civil war.\n\nAs the crisis continues, the focus remains on whether the military will abandon the Maduro regime and join the opposition. Officers and soldiers who join the revolt will be at risk if the government prevails, but those who are loyal to Maduro can expect that if he falls, the new government will find it more urgent to bring them on board than to punish them.\n\nThe outcome of the crisis in Venezuela remains uncertain, but many believe that the Venezuelan people will ultimately prevail if they continue to show up against the odds. \"They've already proven their country is worth fighting for,\" said the spokesperson. \"It will be their fight to win or lose.\"",
    " Title: US Senate Passes Tax Cuts Bill, Marking First Major Legislative Victory for President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic vote, the US Senate has passed a sweeping tax cuts bill, marking President Donald Trump's first significant legislative victory. The bill, which saw a 51-49 vote after a series of amendments in a marathon session, is set to be the biggest tax overhaul since the 1980s.\n\nThe package, which was passed despite warnings of a potential $1tn increase in the budget deficit, includes significant cuts in corporation tax. The corporate tax rate would be permanently lowered from 35% to 20%, while future foreign profits of US-based firms would be mainly exempt from tax.\n\nThe bill's passage comes after a contentious debate, with Democrats criticizing the bill for allegedly benefiting the wealthy and big business. Middle-class taxpayer benefits, according to a Senate Joint Committee on Taxation, have sunset clauses, while corporations are set to receive permanent tax cuts.\n\nThe House of Representatives passed a similar bill last month and will now have to merge their legislation with the Senate's version before it can be signed into law by the president. The final draft of the bill underwent several changes to bring reluctant Republicans on board.\n\nThe tax cuts bill is a significant victory for President Trump, who has faced challenges in getting major legislative movement in Congress, including his promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. The president's tenure has also been marked by an independent investigation into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 US election and possible collusion with his campaign team. On Friday, former national security adviser Michael Flynn became the Trump administration's most senior member to be charged in the investigation.\n\nThe Senate, a seemingly insurmountable roadblock for the Republican agenda for much of this year, has at last given its assent to a major piece of legislation. The hope is that a booming economy will give Republicans a chance to run on their tax policy when they stand before voters next November. The fear was that yet another failure would have led to a revolt among the party's big donors and traditional business constituencies.\n\nThe tax cuts bill is not without controversy, with some opponents highlighting a measure that would end a requirement introduced under Obamacare for most taxpayers to buy health insurance or face a fine. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, scrapping the mandate would push up insurance premiums and lead to 13 million people losing cover by 2027.\n\nThere were some last-minute changes, including a $10,000 property tax deduction as requested by Senator Susan Collins, one of the Republicans who had been reluctant to back the bill. After the vote, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said his opponents would pay the price at the ballot box in mid-term elections next year.\n\n`` My Republican friends will ultimately pay consequences for this bill in 2018 and beyond. The Republican party will never again be the party of tax cuts for middle-class people, '' he warned. He also expressed concerns about the bill's potential impact on social security and medical provision.\n\nIndependent Senator Bernie Sanders was among the most vocal critics, declaring during the debate that the American treasury was \"being looted.\" However, Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who succeeded in bringing dissenting party members into line, said the legislation would prove to be \"just what the country needs to get growing again.\" He brushed aside complaints that it was pushed through without proper scrutiny.\n\nRepublican Senator Bill Cassidy also praised the bill, saying \"working families and middle-income families across the nation will be better off.\" The only Republican senator who refused to back the legislation was Bob Corker. \"I am not able to cast aside my fiscal concerns and vote for legislation that... could deepen the debt burden on future generations,\" he said.",

Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas), toured a remote tent city in West Texas on Saturday where they estimated approximately 2,700 immigrant teenagers are being held at a daily cost of around $1 million.\n\nThe lawmakers, who included U.S. Sens. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon), Tina Smith (D-Minnesota), and California Rep. Judy Chu, urged the nonprofit running the facility, BCFS Health and Human Services, not to renew its federal contract, which expires on December 31. This move could potentially close the camp, although the request seems unlikely to succeed.\n\nO'Rourke, who has been mentioned as a potential 2020 presidential candidate following his close Senate race against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in a deep-red state, was joined by the other lawmakers. O'Rourke stated that they were not allowed to speak to the children in a meaningful way during the tour.\n\n\"They kind of nodded their heads, but what are they going to say when everyone around them is watching?\" O'Rourke said after the tour. \"But there was something in the look on their faces that we saw, the way that they weren't really engaged in the sports that they were playing out on those fields.\"\n\nChu added, \"We need to shut it down. It is inhumane. It is a child prison. It has no right to exist.\"\n\nO'Rourke made no mention of his potential White House aspirations after his fourth visit to the camp, which is located just outside Tornillo. He noted the area was about an hour's drive from his native El Paso, which borders Mexico at the westernmost tip of Texas.\n\n\"It's in a remote location on purpose so that the American people do not know what's happening here,\" O'Rourke told reporters.\n\nThe lawmakers stated that 2,700 boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 17 were being held at Tornillo. They described touring the tents housing the teens but could only ask light questions. O'Rourke said he asked a few of them what countries they were from\u2014Guatemala and Honduras, they said\u2014and received assurances that the conditions were \"OK.\"\n\nTornillo opened as a temporary facility in June, amid what President Donald Trump's administration described as an emergency situation on the U.S.-Mexico border. Since then, the contract keeping it open has been renewed, and the number of kids being held inside has grown, although determining the rate of growth has proven difficult.\n\nThe lawmakers said BCFS Health and Human Services, the contractor running the facility, told them that the tent city has cost taxpayers $144 million since opening, or about $1 million a day.\n\nThe Democrats said they urged BCFS Health and Human Services to refuse to renew its contract with the U.S. government. However, even if that happened, the lawmakers said they weren't sure where the children being held at Tornillo would be transferred as a result.\n\nThe Associated Press previously reported that the Trump administration waived FBI fingerprint checks for caregivers and experienced short-staffing of mental health workers at Tornillo.\n\nO'Rourke said Saturday that the contractor told him that a recent agreement with Texas now allows for state background checks, but that the facility still doesn't have the capacity to do FBI fingerprint checks.\n\nThe lawmakers said many of the teens have family already in the United States who would like to take them. However, federal authorities have begun fingerprinting and conducting background checks on would-be \"sponsors,\" resulting in 170 apprehensions on possible immigration violations.\n\nThey also said that even with the added scrutiny, the contractor said 1,300 children have relatives ready to take them but have remained at Tornillo due to unexplained federal delays.\n\nO'Rourke stated that public pressure could force federal authorities to close Tornillo, but in the meantime, federal policies mean the country is \"turning our backs on these people.\"",
    " Title: Trump's New Negotiating Strategy Yields Government Reopening, Causes Internal Democratic Discord\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a three-day government shutdown that ended Monday night, President Donald Trump adopted an uncharacteristic low-profile approach, avoiding public appearances, leading to frustration among Democrats. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., even taunted the president, stating, \"The great deal-making president sat on the sidelines.\"\n\nHowever, it was Schumer who ultimately had to concede and lead his party in a retreat on the shutdown. Many Democrats attributed their failure to the White House's new strategy. Politico reported that the stand-back-and-watch approach was effective, putting pressure on Senate leaders to reach an agreement to reopen the government without Trump's direct involvement, resulting in a victory for the president.\n\nIn his new book, \"Media Madness: Donald Trump, The Press, And The War Over the Truth,\" Fox News \"MediaBuzz\" host Howard Kurtz reports that Trump aides have coined a term for Trump's penchant for going against advice: \"Defiance Disorder.\" The phrase refers to Trump's seeming compulsion to do the opposite of what his advisers are strongly urging, leaving his team to handle the fallout.\n\nAs negotiations to keep the government open stalled on Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called Trump and urged him not to engage with Democrats like Schumer to strike a grand bargain. McConnell advised, \"Make them come to you.\" Trump agreed, and the new strategy proved successful.\n\nSenate Republicans were forced to take charge, and House Republicans were able to communicate that they had voted to keep the government open, while Democrats were refusing to do so due to prioritizing immigrant rights. The shutdown strategy failure also sparked a mini-civil war within the ranks of congressional Democrats.\n\nRep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, D-Ill., a strong advocate for immigrants, criticized his Senate colleagues, stating, \"They blink, they just do, and it's unfortunate.\" Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., expressed her discontent, questioning, \"How do we know the Senate isn't screwing us?\" House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the second-ranking Democrat in House leadership, confirmed her sentiment.\n\nEvery confrontation between Congress and the White House is unique, but after a year in office, Trump aides now believe they have new tools in their negotiating arsenal. One White House aide told a reporter, \"No one is saying Trump won't be Trump, and he knows how to pivot and attack better than anyone. But he is also figuring out that timing is everything, and you sometimes have to wait and let your adversaries trip over themselves.\"\n\nDemocrats may soon realize that the 71-year-old Trump has learned new tactics and may surprise them again in the run-up to November's midterm elections.",

The event followed a controversy over Romney's criticism of President Obama's handling of the unrest in Libya and Egypt, which had sparked a debate over Romney's foreign policy remarks.\n\nAt the rally in Fairfax, Virginia, Romney began his speech by expressing his condolences for the four American diplomats who lost their lives in the recent attacks. \"We're in mourning for Ambassador Chris Stevens and the three other embassy staffers killed,\" Romney said, \"We've lost four of our diplomats across the world. We're thinking about their families and those that they've left behind. What a tragedy to lose such wonderful people that have been so wonderful and [we] appreciate their service to the country.\"\n\nRomney largely avoided the controversy surrounding his claims that the Obama administration's statements, made through the embassy in Egypt, were akin to an apology. The Republican nominee faced criticism, including from fellow Republicans, for his aggressive response to the unfolding international incident.\n\nDuring the speech, a heckler interrupted Romney, asking, \"Why are you politicizing Libya?\" The crowd attempted to drown out the heckler with chants of \"Mitt\" and \"U-S-A!\" Romney responded, \"I would offer a moment of silence, but one gentleman does not want to be silent, so we're going to keep on going.\"\n\nPresident Obama, meanwhile, traveled to Golden, Colorado, where he spoke about improving the economy. However, he also vowed to find those responsible for the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens. \"I want people around the world to hear me: To all those who would do us harm, no act of terror will go unpunished. It will not dim the light of the values that we proudly present to the rest of the world. No act of violence shakes the resolve of the United States of America,\" Obama said.\n\nOn Thursday, Libyan officials informed the U.S. that four people were in custody in connection with the attack.\n\nIn his speech in Virginia, Romney reiterated a general vision of a United States \"that's strong, that helps lead the world...

Pastor John Paul Walker of St. Mary's Parish, which comprises both St. Mary's Catholic Church and St. Joseph's Catholic Church, announced in a Thursday Facebook post that St. Joseph's Church was vandalized sometime between 9 p.m. Wednesday and 6 a.m. Thursday.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Hartford also confirmed the incident, stating in a Facebook post that \"a person or group of persons had painted anarchist and satanic symbols on the doors of St. Joseph Church in New Haven.\"\n\nPastor Walker wrote in his post that this incident, along with similar incidents in cities such as Chattanooga, Queens, Boston, Sacramento, and Ocala, is part of a trend of desecrating Catholic spaces across the nation. \"The underlying motive of these sacrilegious attacks is clear: to intimidate and instill fear in the hearts of those who worship Christ,\" he stated.\n\nPastor Walker expressed resilience in the face of the vandalism, stating, \"The Catholic faith has survived for over 2,000 years and is not about to yield now.\" He added, \"Therefore, we remain unafraid and resolute in our faith, and we will pray for a conversion of the hearts of those who wish to terrorize us.\"\n\nThe New Haven police did not immediately respond to requests for comment from \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation on the matter.\n\nThis latest incident follows the vandalism of a statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus at Sacred Heart Church in Calgary, Alberta, on Tuesday around 1:30 a.m., as confirmed by Fr. Wilbert Chin Jon of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Calgary to \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation on Thursday. Numerous other statues of the Virgin Mary have also been vandalized throughout the country.",
    " Title: New Poll Shows Slip in Trump's Job Approval Rating Amid Economic Concerns and Recession Fears\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll conducted by \u2588\u2588\u2588/Washington Post shows a decline in President Donald Trump's job approval rating, with six in ten Americans expressing concerns about a potential recession and higher prices due to the ongoing trade war with China. The poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, indicates that Trump's approval rating has dropped from a career-high 44% in July to 38% currently, marking a significant decrease in public support.\n\nThe poll reveals that Trump's handling of the economy has slipped by 5 percentage points, from 51% approval in midsummer to 46% now. Moreover, only 35% approve of his handling of trade negotiations with China, and 60% are concerned that the trade dispute will raise the cost of goods they purchase.\n\nThe overall rating of the U.S. economy, at 56% positive, has decreased from 65% last fall in this poll. Notably, 60% of respondents see a recession as very or somewhat likely in the next year, which is close to the 69% who expressed similar concerns in November 2007, just before the Great Recession.\n\nThe poll also shows that Trump receives far more criticism than praise for his economic stewardship, with Americans expressing a 3-1 margin (43-16%) that his trade and economic policies have increased rather than decreased the likelihood of a recession in the next year.\n\nEconomic attitudes are found to be highly partisan, with 90% of Republicans rating the economy positively, compared to 52% of independents and 33% of Democrats. However, the poll suggests that negative economic attitudes pose a risk to Trump, particularly among Republicans who are concerned about the impact of the trade dispute with China and those who see a recession as likely.\n\nThe statistical analysis, known as regression, supports this result. Controlling for demographics, partisanship, and political ideology, seeing a recession as more likely, being concerned about paying more due to the trade dispute with China, and holding more negative views of the economy overall are found to be the strongest predictors of Trump's approval rating.\n\nEconomic anxiety is nearly as high in the red states Trump won in 2016 as in the blue states, with 58% of respondents in red states seeing a recession as very or somewhat likely, compared to 63% in blue states. Trump's approval rating is underwater in the red states, at 43%, compared to 32% in the blue states.\n\nThe poll also reveals a significant decline in Trump's approval among various demographic groups, including a 10-point drop among urban residents, 9-point drop among college graduates, and 8-point drop among women. Trump's approval rating among whites has also decreased slightly, to 48%, compared to 25% among Hispanics and just 10% among blacks.\n\nTwo other shifts this month indicate that Trump appears increasingly isolated in a core support group, white men who don't have a college degree. They give him 69% approval, but he has lost 12 points among non-college white women, to 42%, and 15 points among college-educated white men, to 34%.\n\nThe poll was conducted between September 2-5, 2019, among a random national sample of 1,003 adults. The results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including the design effect. The partisan divisions are 28-24-37% Democrats-Republicans-independents. The survey was produced for \u2588\u2588\u2588 by Langer Research Associates of New York, New York, with sampling and data collection by Abt Associates of Rockville, Md.",
    " Title: Senate Considering Additional Sanctions on Iran Nuclear Program: A Look at the Historical Role of Congress in American Foreign Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Washington, discussions are underway regarding potential actions if Iran fails to comply with its commitments in the Geneva agreement or refuses to dismantle its nuclear program entirely. The Senate is contemplating further sanctions that would empower the President, should diplomatic efforts falter, to take decisive and swift action to pressure Iran into a mutually acceptable agreement with the West.\n\nThis move is not without precedent, as the President previously sought Congressional legislation on the use of force to curtail Syria's chemical weapons capabilities just a few months ago. Historically, the Senate has played a significant role in shaping American foreign policy, from its early approval of the Alaska Purchase in 1867, the United Nations in 1945, and the Marshall Plan in 1948, to Senate authorization for World War I, World War II, and both Persian Gulf Wars.\n\nKey Senators, such as J. William Fulbright, Chuck Percy, Jacob Javits, John Kerry, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton, have all left indelible marks on American foreign policy. Given this historical context, one might wonder why President Obama has not welcomed Congressional legislation imposing additional sanctions to bolster his efforts to dismantle the Iranian nuclear program.\n\nThe rationale behind these additional sanctions is rooted in the strategic implications of a nuclear-armed Iran. With Iran nearing the capability to detonate an atomic bomb, it would significantly elevate its status in the Middle East and pose a threat to countries it perceives as hostile, such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.\n\nDomestically, the nuclear program enjoys broad support among Iranians, with 80% in favor. Nuclear weapons would also deter any Western attempts, as in 1941 and 1953, to overthrow the regime.\n\nA nuclear Iran could trigger an arms race in the Middle East, with several countries likely acquiring nuclear weapons. This would embolden radical Islamist forces in the region while discouraging more moderate, pro-American states, potentially feeling threatened by their own survival.\n\nBy 2020, according to a dated report, Iran may possess Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the East Coast of the United States. Before then, Iran may be able to target Western and Central Europe with nuclear weapons. Consequently, the diplomatic effort to dismantle the Iranian nuclear program is crucial to American national security.\n\nTough sanctions have already shown effectiveness, bringing Iran to the negotiating table for the first time. Iran remains vulnerable to economic sanctions due to the poor state of its economy. A United Nations study ranked Iranian GDP per capita 82nd in the world, below that of Botswana. A World Bank study showed the ease of doing business in Iran is 152nd in the world, below that of Liberia. Another World Bank study showed that in getting electricity, Iran ranks 166th in the world, below that of Swaziland. A new round of sanctions will ensure that Iran will have to choose between total economic destitution (with likely political unrest as a consequence) or giving up its nuclear program.\n\nHistory has shown that the mullahs in Iran have surrendered under extreme duress. In 1987, Grand Ayatollah Khomeini ended the war against Iraq when he realized that further massive casualties would not lead to victory. In 2003, Grand Ayatollah Khamenei slowed down the nuclear program when the American army took Baghdad. This new round of sanctions will provide President Obama with the leverage to ensure that Iran will have no choice but to dismantle its nuclear weapons program.",
    " Title: U.S. Accuses Qatar of Cheating on Airline Trade Deal, Raising Concerns for Future Trade Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could have far-reaching implications for future trade negotiations, the United States has accused Qatar of cheating on an airline trade deal. The allegations come as President Donald Trump continues to push for fair trade deals, with China being the latest target of his tariff strategy.\n\nThe U.S. claims that Qatar, a U.S. ally and host to the largest American military base in the Gulf, is using a subsidiary airline, Air Italy, to bypass the terms of an Open Skies agreement signed in January 2018. Under the agreement, an airline is not supposed to use government subsidies to establish lower fares in competition with U.S. carriers.\n\nQatar Airways, the state-owned airline, is reportedly providing financing and operating losses for Air Italy, which has been offering bargain-rate flights from Milan to several U.S. cities. The airline's crew uniforms, financial statements, and top executives are all linked to Qatar Airways.\n\nU.S. carriers and their advocates on Capitol Hill, including Senators Ted Cruz and Bob Menendez, are urging the Trump administration to take action against Qatar. If Qatar Airways continues to use Air Italy as a proxy, it could send a message to other major U.S. trading partners that they can cheat on trade deals without consequences.\n\nThe Qatar incident comes as the U.S. imposes additional tariffs on selected goods from China, Europe, Mexico, and Canada, a move that has been criticized by supporters of free trade. The stock market dropped 500 points after the new China tariffs were announced.\n\nThe tariff strategy, while controversial, is part of Trump's efforts to protect American intellectual property and push for fair trade deals. However, the long-term success of this approach remains to be seen, and critics argue that tariffs lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers and protect inefficient markets from the need to innovate and increase productivity.\n\nAs the U.S. and Qatar navigate this trade dispute, the focus is on accountability and the message it sends to other trading partners. The outcome could shape the future of U.S. trade negotiations and the balance between free trade and protectionism.",
    " Title: Indictment Alleges Negligence in Jeffrey Epstein's Death, Citing Failure to Perform Mandatory Checks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, an indictment has been filed against two correction officers, Tiffany Noel and Thomas Morrow, for alleged negligence in the death of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The indictment, unsealed on Thursday, details the officers' failure to perform mandatory checks on Epstein on the night of his death.\n\nOn August 9, the day before Epstein was found dead, his cellmate was transferred out in a \"routine, prearranged transfer,\" the indictment stated. That evening, Ms. Noel and Mr. Thomas were both working overtime shifts. Ms. Noel, a correction officer since 2016, and Mr. Thomas, who started in 2007, were supposed to check on inmates every half-hour.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Epstein was escorted into his cell by Ms. Noel and another guard shortly before 8 p.m. Inmates were locked in their cells for the night by 10 p.m. However, between 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m., the indictment alleges that Ms. Noel and Mr. Thomas were not monitoring the inmates as required. Instead, they reportedly sat at their desk, browsed the internet, and moved around the common area. They also allegedly signed \"count sheets\" stating they had checked on inmates multiple times overnight when they had not.\n\nThe indictment further states that when Ms. Noel and Mr. Thomas entered Epstein's cell the next morning, they found him unresponsive with a noose around his neck. When a supervisor arrived, the guards admitted they had not performed their duties as required.\n\n\"We did not complete the 3 a.m. nor 5 a.m. rounds,\" Ms. Noel reportedly said, according to the indictment. Mr. Thomas is quoted as saying, \"She's not to blame, we didn't do any rounds.\"\n\nIn response to the allegations, Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, stated that the agency is taking the matter \"very seriously\" and that the allegations of misconduct will be \"responded to appropriately.\"\n\nThis development in the Epstein case adds a new layer of complexity to the circumstances surrounding his death, which has been ruled a suicide by the medical examiner. The indictment against Ms. Noel and Mr. Thomas is a reminder of the importance of diligent oversight in correctional facilities and the potential consequences of negligence in carrying out such responsibilities.",
    " Title: White House Prepares for Proactive Presidential Agenda in State of the Union Address\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep on Morning Edition, White House Senior Advisor John Podesta revealed that President Obama will announce an executive order during his State of the Union address tonight, raising the minimum wage for workers on new federal contracts. This move marks a shift in the President's approach to executive orders, signaling a more proactive presidency.\n\nPodesta stated, \"Across a wide range of topics, including retirement security, moving forward on his climate change and energy transformation agenda, there's a lot that he has the authority to do.\" He added that where the White House and Justice Department agree that Obama can, he will take such executive actions in the coming year.\n\nThe executive order will increase the minimum wage from the current federal minimum of $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour. This change will apply only to new federal contracts, and not to renewals of existing agreements. Podesta also mentioned that the President will renew his push for an increase in the federal minimum wage for all workers during the State of the Union address.\n\nIn addition to the minimum wage issue, Podesta hinted at other topics the President will address, including the bilateral security agreement with Afghanistan, the economy, and the administration's plans for the coming year to keep the recovery going.\n\nThe State of the Union address is scheduled to begin shortly after 9 p.m. ET. NPR will provide live blogging and a stream of the speech and its coverage. Stay tuned for more updates as the time approaches.

    " Title: Putin Claims Convincing Trump on Russia's Non-Involvement in U.S. Election\n\nArticle:\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin stated on Saturday that he believes he successfully convinced President Donald Trump that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election during their first face-to-face meeting on Friday. The meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, was overshadowed by allegations of Russian meddling and unsubstantiated claims of Trump campaign collusion.\n\nDuring the meeting, Russian meddling was the first topic Mr. Trump brought up, and Mr. Putin reiterated his denials that Moscow was involved. \"He asked many questions on that subject,\" said Mr. Putin. \"I answered those questions as best I could.\" Mr. Putin gave his assessment of Mr. Trump's reaction at a press conference in Hamburg.\n\nThe meeting, initially scheduled for 30 minutes, lasted for 2 hours and 15 minutes, and the two leaders also discussed a Syrian cease-fire agreement, Russia's disputed annexation of Crimea, and the fight against ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who attended the meeting, said Mr. Trump pressed Mr. Putin about election interference and a \"very robust and lengthy exchange\" ensued.\n\n\"The president pressed President Putin on more than one occasion regarding Russian involvement,\" he said. \"President Putin denied such involvement.\"\n\nMr. Putin also expressed optimism about the potential for cooperation between the two countries on various issues. \"As for personal relations, I think that they are established,\" said Mr. Putin. \"I think that if we continue building our relations like during our conversation yesterday, there are grounds to believe that we'll be able to \u2014 at least partially \u2014 restore the level of cooperation that we need.\"\n\nMr. Trump has faced criticism for expressing doubt about Russian interference in the election, despite several U.S. intelligence agencies believing Russia was responsible. Mr. Trump said Thursday that he believed Russia was involved but that other countries or individuals could also have been involved. The interference included the spread of disinformation during the campaign, as well as hacking into emails at the Democratic National Committee and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign officials, exposing embarrassing information.\n\nThere has been no evidence that the efforts impacted the outcome of the election, but Democrats have pointed to Russian interference to delegitimize the Trump presidency. The meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin is the first of what is expected to be several high-level discussions between the two leaders.",
    " Title: The Iowa Caucuses: A Turning Point for the Presidential Race, as Governors Fade and the Next President Emerges from a Different Pool\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Iowa caucuses have left the presidential race in a state of flux, but one thing is clear: the next president will not be a governor. This revelation is surprising, as just a year ago, the Republican governors were considered the party's most promising candidates.\n\nThe reasoning behind this prediction was simple: if Jeb Bush, the former two-term Florida governor with a strong job performance, was not the nominee, the voters would likely turn to governors like Wisconsin's Scott Walker, the conservative fiscal reformer, or Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, the policy expert. If these candidates failed to gain traction, a second tier of popular and talented governors, including Ohio's John Kasich, Texas' Rick Perry, New Jersey's Chris Christie, and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, were ready to step in.\n\nHowever, like the snow that blanketed Washington, these state CEOs have all but disappeared. Scott Walker, poof, gone. Mr. Jindal, bye-bye. Mike Huckabee, adios amigos. The remaining candidates, Mr. Bush, Mr. Kasich, and Mr. Christie, combined for about as many votes in Iowa as surgeon Ben Carson, who finished in fourth place. These three are the walking dead of the race, pinning their hopes on a strong showing in New Hampshire. Only Mr. Kasich of Ohio appears to have a shot.\n\nSo, what happened? In a year when politicians are widely distrusted, their experience became a liability. Even their successes were dismissed. John Kasich's impressive record of balancing budgets in the 1990s and as governor for five years was met with skepticism from conservatives, who saw him as having been around too long.\n\nJeb Bush, easily the most qualified for the Oval Office, having masterfully run the fourth-largest state with more people than most nations, was dismissed by voters who felt he wasn't conservative enough. The governors ran lousy campaigns and sounded tone-deaf to voter rage.\n\nThe art of politics is finding common ground and making deals, as demonstrated by Ronald Reagan, who was a steadfast conservative but made deals that benefited the country and the cause of freedom. The ultimate victory is getting the other side to vote with you.\n\nAs the race moves forward, it remains to be seen if the next president will be one of the three remaining candidates, all of whom have never governed. One hope is that they will choose a governor as their running mate, as governors have a proven track record of effective leadership and policy implementation. The talent pool runs deep in the state capitals.",
    " Title: House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Sets Final Deadline for Trump Tax Returns, Potential Legal Showdown Ahead\n\nIn a move that could lead to a legal showdown between the House of Representatives and the Trump administration, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) has set a final deadline of April 23 for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to hand over President Trump's tax returns. The administration, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is currently studying the legal questions involved, and if the documents are not provided or a resolution to the dispute is not reached by the deadline, a court battle could ensue.\n\nThe administration missed an initial April 10 deadline, with Mnuchin citing consultations with the Department of Justice regarding the law and the legitimacy of Neal's request. Under the U.S. tax code, Neal is entitled to request any taxpayer's returns, and the Treasury Department is required to furnish them.\n\nIn a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, Neal asserted that the law clearly entitles him to receive the six years of business and personal returns of Trump that he requested. Neal's letter stated that the IRS, Treasury, and Justice should not question or second-guess the motivations of the Committee or its reasonable determinations regarding its need for the requested tax returns and return information.\n\nIf the IRS fails to comply with Neal's April 23 deadline, he may issue a subpoena or seek to enforce the law in a federal court. The legal question would extend beyond the language of the statute and consider the extent of constitutional constraints on legislative inquiries.\n\nMatthew Leas, an IRS spokesman, declined to comment on Neal's letter. Mnuchin stated that Treasury officials are working diligently on resolving the legal issues, and emphasized the potential implications of the IRS becoming weaponized, citing the Nixon administration as an example.\n\nTrump has broken with decades of precedent by refusing to release his tax returns, citing an ongoing audit. Although no law prevents Trump from revealing his returns at any time, he has said he would release them after the audit is complete. Neal has used the president's argument against a voluntary release as his rationale for a mandatory handover of the returns, arguing that the committee needs to determine if the IRS is conducting the audits properly.\n\nA subsequent committee vote would be required to publicly release all or part of the returns. The administration has not formally denied Neal's request, but White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and Trump's personal lawyer, William Consovoy, have expressed opposition to the request.",
    " Title: Wall Street Endures Fourth Consecutive Day of Triple-Digit Moves, Led by Tech Sector\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, the stock market experienced its fourth consecutive day of triple-digit moves on Thursday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closing down nearly 265 points, or 1.5%. The Dow ended the day at 16,945.80, marking a decline below the 17,000 mark.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index also saw a drop of 1.6%, finishing at 1,965.99. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite experienced the worst losses of the day, ending down 1.9%, or 88.47 points, at 4,466.75. The decline in the Nasdaq was primarily driven by a 3.8% drop in Apple shares, which closed slightly below $98.\n\nThe Dow had gained 154 points on Wednesday, but all its other triple-digit moves since setting a new closing high on Friday have been on the downside. This was the same day Alibaba Group, the biggest-ever initial public offering, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have been down for the fourth day of the past five sessions.\n\nThursday's drop was attributed to increasing concerns about the global economy and a growing backlash against issues consumers are reporting with Apple's latest software updates and its new product launches, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.\n\nThe rising volatility on Wall Street is causing concern after the stock market enjoyed a long run of relatively uneventful trading earlier in September. A measure of volatility known as the \"fear gauge\" jumped 25% on Thursday.\n\nAnalysts are worried about the buildup of complacency among investors and the approach of what could be a disappointing third-quarter earnings season, which could mean more trouble in the weeks ahead. However, the damage is relatively minor, given that the Dow and S&P are both down roughly 2% from the record highs they set last week.\n\nApple (AAPL) was a standout as its shares fell for a second straight day and dropped below $100 again after glitches with the tech giant's new phones and operating system came to light.\n\nFixed-income investments appeared to benefit from the flight out of stocks. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, fell to 2.51% from 2.57% Wednesday as investors sought the relative safe haven of U.S. Treasuries.\n\nIn economic news, durable goods orders plunged 18.2% in August, largely due to a sharp drop in aircraft orders. Orders for durable goods excluding the volatile transportation category rose 0.7%.\n\nApplications for unemployment benefits rose 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 293,000 last week. Despite the rise, applications remain near pre-recession levels.\n\nAsian markets were mixed, with Japan's Nikkei index jumping 0.3% to 16,734.14 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index falling 0.6% to 23,768.13. European markets were trading lower, and losses accelerated after Wall Street's decline, with Britain's FTSE 100 dropping 1% and Germany's DAX falling 1.6%.",
    " Title: Alternate Campaign Reality: The Rise of Unskewed Polls and the Romney Lead\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unusual turn of events, a parallel universe has emerged within the Republican political sphere, where Mitt Romney is leading in nearly every national poll released in September. This contrasts sharply with the reality portrayed by private polls among working Republican political operatives, who see Romney trailing in the race against President Obama.\n\nThis alternate campaign reality is most evident on television, talk radio, and the Internet, where swing-state polls showing Romney losing are not just inaccurate but part of a deliberate plot, according to some conservative pundits. Dick Morris, a former advisor to Bill Clinton and now a conservative commentator, predicted on Fox News last week that the GOP ticket would win in Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. In public polls right now, Romney is losing in each of those states. Morris attributes the discrepancy to inaccurate polling data.\n\nRush Limbaugh, a conservative talk radio king, goes a step further, suggesting a more sinister motive behind the media and university polls. He claims that these polls are designed to depress and suppress Republican voters, with the intention of convincing the public that the election is already over.\n\nThe divide between Republican consultants and conservative media figures is not new, but the Internet has allowed this alternate campaign reality to flourish in a way that is both striking and depressing to political professionals and pollsters. One website, unskewedpolls.com, adjusts public polling data by including more Republicans in samples. The results: Romney leads in nearly every national poll released in September.\n\nWhile arbitrarily reweighting polls is considered wildly unscientific, this has not stopped Republicans like Limbaugh and even Texas Governor Rick Perry from endorsing the site. Perry tweeted last week, \"Always nice to get unfiltered, or in this case \u2018unskewed,\u2019 information.\"\n\nAs the election approaches, the divide between the real and alternate campaign realities continues to widen, raising questions about the role of media, polling, and information in shaping public opinion and voter behavior.",

This potential showdown could mark a historic moment in the investigation, which has been a significant point of contention for the White House amidst other pressing issues such as international trade and the summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.\n\nCritics view Mueller's investigation as a serious distraction, while his supporters argue that he needs to complete his work. The investigation has been ongoing, yet there have been no charges related to the Trump campaign's alleged collusion with Russia.\n\nA key figure in the investigation, former FBI director James Comey, is expected to face scrutiny in an upcoming report by the Justice Department inspector general. According to ABC, the draft report alleges that Comey was \"insubordinate\" for his behavior during the Hillary Clinton email probe. Comey played a significant role in initiating Mueller's probe, having leaked some of his conversations with President Trump in the hope of sparking a special counsel investigation into Russia, which eventually transpired.\n\nThe investigation has raised numerous questions, including the question of whether the president could pardon himself, a topic that has divided legal experts. However, the most pressing issue remains whether the president will agree to an interview with Mueller's team. In an exclusive interview with Pat Robertson on The 700 Club, Giuliani stated, \"We're leaning toward not [agreeing to testimony]. But look, if they can convince us that it would be brief, it would be the point, there are five or six points they have to clarify. And with that, we can get this over, this long nightmare for the American public over.\"\n\nIf Mueller subpoenas Trump to testify, Giuliani's team would not passively accept it, potentially leading to a protracted legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court.

    " Title: \"John W. Dean Reflects on Watergate: A Retrospective on the Mother of All Modern Political Scandals\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN, John W. Dean, former counsel to the president during the Nixon White House, discusses his latest book, \"The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He Knew It.\" Dean, who also writes a biweekly column for Verdict at Justia.com, invites viewers to watch his interview with Wolf Blitzer in the 6 p.m. hour Wednesday and see the story of Watergate on CNN's \"The Seventies\" at 9 p.m. ET Thursday.\n\nDean, who was in the midst of the Watergate scandal as White House counsel, emphasizes the complexity and historical significance of the Watergate scandal, which is considered the mother of all modern political scandals. He notes that, four decades later, there is no American scandal as well-documented as the Watergate scandal, nor is there any scandal that has left a deeper scar on American politics.\n\nDean explains that, over the past 40 years, he has devoted considerable time to studying the Watergate scandal, as the record has slowly surfaced in testimony, autobiographies, diaries, with the release of contemporaneous documents and secret tape recordings, investigative files of the FBI, the Watergate-related grand juries, a Senate Watergate committee, and a House impeachment committee, among other sources.\n\nDean warns that, as a nation, we easily forget our history, and asks if we want to repeat the mistakes of the 1970s, particularly Watergate. The Watergate scandal began on June 17, 1972, with the arrest of five burglars dressed in business suits, wearing surgical gloves, and carrying suitcases filled with electronic bugging equipment. The burglars were later identified as the director of security for the Committee to Reelect the President, and suspicion immediately focused on the Nixon White House.\n\nDean recounts his own role in the Watergate scandal, admitting that he made mistakes, such as returning to Washington from a trip to the Philippines when he had planned to spend a few days in San Francisco. He explains that, by the end of the day on June 19, 1972, he understood why the White House was assisting in the cover-up, as he learned that the same men involved in the Watergate break-in had undertaken an earlier operation for the White House by breaking into and ransacking the files of a psychiatrist treating Daniel Ellsberg, who had leaked the Pentagon Papers a year earlier.\n\nDean notes that, while he has never found any evidence that Nixon knew in advance of or ordered the Watergate break-in, he does know that Nixon had ordered an earlier break-in at the Brookings Institution when he believed they had a copy of the Pentagon Papers. He also reveals that Nixon's secret recordings of his conversations during those first few days after the arrests at the Watergate show that had the Watergate burglars not been arrested, they would have gone on to their true mission that night, which was to break in and bug the campaign headquarters of Nixon's Democratic opponent, Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota.\n\nDean concludes by emphasizing that Watergate did not really end with Nixon's resignation and departure from the White House on August 9, 1974. Rather, it played out for many months more in headline-grabbing events during the cover-up trial of his top aides, including former chief of staff H.R. \"Bob\" Haldeman, former top domestic affairs adviser John D. Ehrlichman, and former attorney general John N. Mitchell, who would be found guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice on January 1, 1975. Dean emphasizes that, while these men claimed at the time they were innocent men wrongly convicted, the record now shows that each of them quietly admitted to Judge John J. Sirica that in fact they had committed the offenses a jury had found them guilty of beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nDean's interview with CNN and the series on the 1970s, titled \"The Seventies,\" are informative, engaging, and accurate, uncovering video footage of the events long buried in archives, bringing to life memorable moments from these historic events.",

The Pentagon has called on Russia to \"de-escalate the situation.\"\n\nThe statement came as the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized nations agreed on Saturday to swiftly impose new sanctions on Russia over Ukraine. The G7's joint statement expressed concern over Russia's lack of concrete actions in support of the Geneva accord and committed to act urgently to intensify targeted sanctions.\n\nTalks are underway to secure the release of international observers seized by separatists in Ukraine. Russia has tens of thousands of troops deployed along its border with Ukraine, with pro-Moscow separatists occupying official buildings in a dozen eastern towns.\n\nRussia has accused the West of wanting to \"seize\" Ukraine. In a statement on Friday, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steven Warren said Russian aircraft had entered Ukrainian airspace several times in the past 24 hours. He called on Moscow to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation.\n\nLast week, Ukraine and Russia struck an agreement in Geneva, calling for separatists to leave official premises and give up their arms. However, pro-Russian activists have refused to comply with the demands.\n\nThe G7's joint statement said Russia had taken \"no concrete actions in support of the Geneva accord.\" The statement also committed to act urgently to intensify targeted sanctions and measures to increase the costs of Russia's actions. White House sources told reporters that sanctions could be in place as early as Monday, but it is unclear what form they will take.\n\nOn Friday, Ukraine's interior ministry said armed separatists had seized seven representatives from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), as well as five Ukrainian army personnel and a bus driver. Pro-Russian leaders in Sloviansk confirmed the bus had been stopped near the town of Sloviansk and were checking the identities of those on board.\n\nThe self-proclaimed mayor of Sloviansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, said at least one passenger had been carrying maps showing separatist checkpoints in the area, which suggested \"their involvement in espionage.\" Last weekend, Mr. Ponomaryov broadcast an appeal to President Putin asking for Russian troops to protect the city from \"fascists\" after three of his men died in a gunfight.\n\nTensions have risen in recent days as Ukraine launched military raids to try to regain occupied buildings. At least two separatists have been killed in the raids, which Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described as a \"bloody crime.\" Mr. Lavrov repeated the accusation made previously by Moscow that Ukraine was waging a war against its own people.\n\nUnrest in Ukraine began last November over whether the country should look towards Moscow or the West. Last month, Russia annexed Ukraine's mainly ethnic-Russian Crimean peninsula, following a referendum in the region that backed joining the Russian Federation but which the West and Kiev deemed illegal.",
    " Title: Trump's China Policy: A Closer Look at the Challenges and Opportunities\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Donald Trump meets with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, the looming threat of a trade war between the two largest economies continues to dominate discussions. The potential consequences of such a conflict, as warned by rival candidate Jeb Bush and President Xi himself, could lead to a global depression. However, the focus on the potential negative outcomes may overlook the deep-seated flaws in the global trade system, particularly those related to China.\n\nFor years, China has been integrated into the global trade system, with the expectation that it would adhere to the same rules as other nations. Trade experts argue that China has not lived up to these expectations, repeatedly violating both the letter and spirit of global trade rules.\n\nTrump's election win, in part, was fueled by his critique of trade policies that he believes harm American workers. While outside experts may not share the president's broad brush approach, some argue that a tougher stance toward China is necessary. A damaging trade war may not be the most likely outcome, and the \"just be patient\" strategy carries its own risks.\n\nRobert Atkinson, an economist who studies the ties between global trade and national economic performance, argues that China is a unique challenge due to its size and its determination to leverage its market power to gain a leadership role in advanced industries. When Beijing doesn't play by the accepted rules, the damage to other nations, including the US, is considerable.\n\nUnder President Barack Obama, the office of the US Trade Representative ramped up its engagement on alleged violations by China. The USTR's annual report covering 2016 lists settlements reached with China last year over subsidies, taxes, or other policies in industries including aircraft, autos, financial information, wind power, and green technologies.\n\nHowever, critics of China's trade policies argue that much more needs to change. One of the biggest sore spots is the way foreign companies doing business in China are pressured to transfer knowledge to Chinese partner firms in industries such as aerospace. The World Trade Organization prohibits such demands, yet the Chinese arrangements are, in practice, hard to prosecute.\n\nAs Trump and Xi met at the Trump-branded Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, there were few early signs of either progress or breakdown. The White House statement said the US president \"noted the challenges caused by Chinese government intervention in its economy and raised serious concerns about the impact of China's industrial, agricultural, technology, and cyber policies on United States jobs and exports.\"\n\nThe outcome of Trump's policy toward China remains uncertain. His trade team is still in the process of being assembled, and some of his appointees differ in tone. One crucial decision will be how much to seek a broader international coalition to press China. Trump has voiced a penchant for bilateral dealing and dealmaking, but many experts argue that working with allies is more effective than working alone.\n\nAtkinson argues that the goal isn't to block China's development but to insist on a rule-of-law system under which all parties can benefit. Coupled with innovation policies to maintain America's dynamism at home, such a strategy could avert the potential loss of key industries. \"When we have pushed the Chinese in the past, in a respectful but firm way with our allies, we have prevailed,\" Atkinson says.",
    " Title: Iowa Caucus Results Signal Long-Lasting Tension Within the Democratic Party\n\nArticle:\n\nThe narrow victory of Hillary Clinton in the Iowa Democratic caucus has set the stage for a potentially prolonged conflict between the Clinton establishment and the party's younger, more progressive base. The results, which saw Clinton edging out Bernie Sanders by a margin of 0.3 percentage points, have been described as a statistical tie, with the final delegate count decided by six coin tosses that have sparked controversy among Sanders' supporters.\n\nClinton's victory, while technically a win, has been met with skepticism and disappointment from both the media and Sanders' camp. The nature of the victory has left Clinton in a precarious position, as she cannot celebrate her \"win\" without appearing ungracious and grasping. Her supporters have been quick to oversell the victory, further antagonizing Sanders' supporters, many of whom are already hostile towards Clinton.\n\nThe Iowa caucus results have also dealt a significant blow to the Democratic Party, as the close margin of victory has all but sealed Clinton's nomination and effectively closed the door on any potential saviors entering the race. The ghost of Eugene McCarthy, who challenged President Johnson in the 1968 New Hampshire primary, has been invoked as a reminder of the potential impact of a left-wing challenger on the party.\n\nThe close results in Iowa have left the Democratic Party with a difficult road ahead, as Clinton and Sanders are set to face off in the New Hampshire primary on February 9th. The party will need to unite in order to take on the eventual Republican nominee in the general election, but the tension between the two candidates and their respective bases could make that a difficult task.\n\nJonah Goldberg, an American Enterprise Institute fellow and National Review contributing editor, is a member of \u2588\u2588\u2588's Board of Contributors.

    " Title: US Increases Troop Presence on Southern Border, Deploys Additional 2,000 Soldiers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is set to augment its military presence on its border with Mexico, with an additional 2,000 troops to be stationed, according to a Pentagon announcement. This brings the total number of troops stationed on the southern border to approximately 4,300.\n\nThe soldiers will assist border-patrol agents, carry out surveillance work, and install miles of razor wire. The move comes as President Donald Trump continues his battle with Congress over funds for a proposed wall along the border. Trump argues that such a barrier is necessary to curb illegal immigration.\n\nThe president's insistence on including wall funding in the US budget led to the longest government shutdown in US history. He recently struck a temporary deal to reopen government departments but has threatened to initiate another shutdown or declare a national emergency if his demands are not met. The current agreement expires on 15 February.\n\nTrump is expected to address the issue in his annual State of the Union speech on Tuesday. Initially, the US defense department announced that 3,750 extra soldiers would be sent to the border, with many replacing troops already there. The first deployments took place in November.\n\nAccording to a Pentagon statement, these additional units will be deployed for 90 days, and the force composition will be evaluated to meet the mission of protecting and securing the southern border. Their tasks will include a mobile surveillance capability through the end of September 2019, as well as the emplacement of approximately 150 miles of concertina wire between ports of entry.\n\nLast Thursday, President Trump tweeted that extra forces were being sent to the border to stop migrants he described as traveling in \"caravans\" and threatening an \"invasion.\" He reiterated his claims on Sunday, tweeting, \"If there is no wall, there is no security.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly described the situation on the Mexican border as a \"crisis,\" although his critics have dismissed the use of troops as a political stunt. However, it is worth noting that Trump is not the first US president to send troops to the border with Mexico. President Barack Obama sent some 1,200 National Guard soldiers to guard the boundary, while President George W. Bush deployed about 6,000 troops to help Border Patrol agents in what was called Operation Jump Start.\n\nIn related news, officials in Texas recently revealed that nine migrants on hunger strike at an immigration detention center were being force-fed. Immigration officials are using plastic nasal tubes to feed some of the men, but relatives claim this is causing severe nosebleeds and vomiting. The detainees have refused food in protest against conditions at the El Paso Processing Center. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) says a federal judge authorized the force-feeding last month.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Email Practices During Tenure as Secretary of State Under Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a report by the State Department's Inspector General (IG), it has been found that Hillary Clinton, during her tenure as Secretary of State, disregarded cybersecurity guidelines when she used a private computer server for official communications. The IG's report criticizes Clinton for not preserving federal records and not complying with the Department's policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act.\n\nThe report states that Clinton should have printed and filed any federal records she created and received on her personal account with the related files in the Office of the Secretary. Furthermore, Clinton should have surrendered all emails dealing with Department business before leaving government service. However, she or members of her team deleted about 30,000 of these emails before an investigation of her practices began.\n\nThe IG's report also mentions that Clinton stonewalled requests by the government for access to her server, which was in her Chappaqua, N.Y., home, with another discovered at an unsecured location in a Denver bathroom closet. Marcel Lazar, a Romanian computer hacker known as \"Guccifer,\" has claimed to have hacked into Clinton's servers. The possibility of Chinese and Russian hackers accessing Clinton's emails also exists.\n\nClinton has claimed that she only used private email for her daughter's wedding and yoga classes. However, high-ranking government officials are aware of the regulations governing their tenure while in office and their responsibilities for the handling of records once they leave it. The FBI is currently investigating whether Clinton's failure to comply with the State Department's policies on records will lead to an indictment.\n\nClinton has invoked the \"everybody has done it\" defense, but this is not entirely accurate. The Wall Street Journal editorial notes that former Secretary of State Colin Powell's use of private email was limited, and he never set up an unsecure server in his home, as Clinton did.\n\nThe IG's report also refutes Clinton's defense by stating that notification is required when a user suspects compromise of a personally owned device containing personally identifiable information. However, the IG found \"no evidence\" that Clinton or her aides complied with this requirement.\n\nFor years, the Clintons have been accused of skirting laws and practicing disinformation, obfuscation, changing the subject, non sequiturs, and other tactics to block their enrichment or achieve political goals. This time, it is crucial that Hillary Clinton is not allowed to evade accountability for her actions, and her incidents of malfeasance should not be rewarded by being elected as the President of the United States.",
    " Title: President Obama to Deliver Major Economic Speech in Midwest, Avoids Detroit Bailout Discussion\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama will embark on a tour of the Midwest this week, delivering a significant speech on economic revival in Galesburg, Illinois, and Warrensburg, Missouri. The tour will commence with an address at Knox College in Illinois, where the president will outline his vision for rebuilding an economy that prioritizes the middle class and those striving to join it.\n\nAccording to White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer, the speech will mark the beginning of a series of speeches that will detail the president's plans for economic recovery. Pfeiffer stated that the president aims to shift the focus from political point-scoring and rekindle discussions on issues that directly impact the middle class.\n\nThe speech is also intended to help the president regain control of his second term, which has been marred by scandals such as Benghazi, secret surveillance, and the misuse of Internal Revenue Service powers. Pfeiffer noted that the president believes that Washington has neglected the most pressing issue facing the country, and that too many in Congress are more concerned with political games and fabricated scandals.\n\nThe president will discuss economic measures he intends to implement, actions Congress should take, and initiatives that private industry can undertake to bolster the economy. He will also set the stage for upcoming budget and debt limit debates with Congress.\n\nDetroit's financial woes, however, have dominated economic news in recent days. The city filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection last Thursday, grappling with significant unfunded pension obligations for its unionized employees and other fiscal challenges. Despite calls for federal intervention, the White House has indicated that it will not provide financial aid to Detroit.\n\nVice President Joe Biden expressed uncertainty about the administration's ability to help Detroit, while White House press secretary Jay Carney stated that resolving insolvency issues is a matter for local leaders and creditors.\n\nDuring his re-election campaign, President Obama emphasized his role in saving Detroit's auto industry with an $80 billion federal bailout in 2009. However, the president has resisted calls for a similar bailout for Detroit, opting instead to focus on infrastructure spending, universal preschool programs, and the economic benefits of comprehensive immigration reform during his Midwest tour.\n\nThe White House chose Knox College as the location for the president's speech due to its historical significance, as it was the same place where he delivered his first economic speech on a national stage in 2005, as a U.S. senator.",
    " Title: Moderate House Republicans Break Ranks, Call for End to Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could signal a shift in the ongoing government shutdown standoff, some House Republicans facing tough reelection battles in 2014 are advocating for compromise and an end to the government shutdown. The focus of their ire is the ongoing fight over defunding the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nRepresentatives Scott Rigell of Virginia, Pat Meehan of Pennsylvania, and Jon Runyan of New Jersey, who represent moderate districts, have expressed their desire for a clean Continuing Resolution (CR) to reopen the government.\n\nRigell, whose military-heavy district in the Hampton Roads area was narrowly carried by President Barack Obama in 2012, stated, \"Republicans fought the good fight. The fight continues but is not advanced by a government shutdown that damages our economy and harms our military.\"\n\nMeehan, whose suburban Philadelphia district was carried by Mitt Romney by a slight margin, said, \"I came to Washington to fix government, not shut it down. At this point, I believe it's time for the House to vote for a clean, short-term funding bill to bring the Senate to the table and negotiate a responsible compromise.\"\n\nRunyan, whose south central New Jersey district was carried by Obama by four percentage points, said, \"Enough is enough. Put a clean (CR) on the floor and let's get on with the business we were sent to do.\"\n\nJoining Rigell, Meehan, and Runyan in their call for a compromise are New York Rep. Peter King and Pennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent, who have been vocal in their efforts to convince the House GOP to abandon its fight.\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Frank LoBiondo, who represents an Atlantic City-area seat that Obama won by eight percentage points, has indicated his displeasure with the House GOP's course of action. The 10-term congressman was quoted in the Philadelphia Inquirer as saying, \"At a certain point, if the strategy is not going to get us a result or a conclusion, I'm not going to go along with it...I want to see a result. The bigger fight's coming on the debt limit.\"\n\nAnother endangered Republican, Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis, stopped short of calling on his party to throw in the towel but stressed that he wanted to reach an agreement. Davis, a freshman incumbent who represents a district that is nearly evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, said, \"Like most of those I represent, I remain opposed to Obamacare, but a government shutdown is absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has not been idle in this matter. On Tuesday, the DCCC launched an automated call campaign blasting vulnerable Republicans, including Davis, over the shutdown. The call targeting Davis stated, \"While you were sleeping, Congressman Rodney Davis shut down the government. You heard that right. But even worse \u2013 Congressman Davis is still getting paid \u2013 and he's just not listening to our frustration.\"\n\nIn response, the DCCC labeled Davis as a member of the \"Too Little, Too Late Caucus.\" This development comes as the DCCC and the Republican National Committee (RNC) have been engaged in a series of attacks over the shutdown, with the RNC accusing the DCCC of playing politics and the DCCC accusing the RNC of hypocrisy.\n\nAs the shutdown enters its second week, the pressure on both parties to find a solution is mounting. The potential for a default on U.S. debt obligations looms large if a deal is not reached by October 17, when the U.S. Treasury Department has estimated that the government will run out of cash to pay its bills. The stakes are high, and the clock is ticking.",
    " Title: The American Health Care Act: A Step Toward Repeal and Reform, Despite Conservative Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nFrom the moment the Republican Party unveiled the American Health Care Act, the first iteration of what would evolve into the Obamacare repeal and replace legislation, conservatives have expressed dissatisfaction. The editors of Investor's Business Daily succinctly summarize the general right-wing reaction as: \"Republicans have labored to produce a plan that replaces Obamacare with...Obamacare.\"\n\nHowever, the editorial's assertion that the bill supports the key elements of Obamacare is disputable. In fact, the bill addresses several issues that conservatives have long criticized in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFirst and foremost, the American Health Care Act repeals the unconstitutional individual mandate, effective after December 31, 2015. This means that no American who failed to buy coverage last year will owe the Internal Revenue Service a penny in penalties, fines, taxes, or whatever Chief Justice John Roberts is currently calling them.\n\nSimilarly, the job-killing employer mandate will be retroactively repealed. Employers will no longer have to hold off hiring new workers to avoid hefty fines for not providing health insurance coverage that neither they nor their employees can afford.\n\nThe bill also eliminates numerous stealth taxes imposed by Obamacare. For example, it eliminates the tax on over-the-counter medications. Prior to Obamacare, individuals could pay for over-the-counter medication on a pre-tax basis using a Flexible Spending Account (FSA). The Affordable Care Act abolished that. The bill repeals Obamacare's cap on FSA contributions, which were unlimited before the advent of President Obama's \"signature domestic achievement.\" This cap was particularly hard on parents of special needs children, many of whom used FSAs to pay for special needs education.\n\nThe much-maligned GOP plan also eliminates the high medical bill tax. Before \"reform,\" people who incurred high medical bills received a deduction for medical expenses exceeding 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. The Affordable Care Act increased that percentage to 10 percent. The much-maligned Republican plan also reduces Obamacare's HSA tax. Prior to Obamacare, early withdrawals from an HSA were taxed at 10 percent. The American Health Care Act takes that back down to 10 percent. The plan also eliminates the medical device tax, a natural-born job killer.\n\nThe list goes on, yet conservatives and libertarians are voicing complaints about provisions like the 30 percent premium surcharge that the bill would allow insurers to charge patients who wait until they are ill to buy coverage. However, such comparisons between this surcharge and the individual mandate are misleading. The individual mandate requires individuals to buy health insurance simply because they are alive, an assault on personal liberty. The GOP plan's much-discussed premium surcharge is an incentive based on an individual's choices. The former eliminates personal choice altogether. The latter incentivizes intelligent choices.\n\nMoreover, while conservatives complain about the bill, they should consider that it does two things for which they have long been clamoring: it defunds Planned Parenthood and it reforms Medicaid. The benefits of the former are obvious\u2014the taxpayers will no longer be forced to fork over hundreds of millions to the world's most notorious abortion mill and purveyor of infant body parts. Anyone who objects to the crimes against humanity committed by Cecile Richards and her army of abortionists should be celebrating this bill.\n\nLikewise, they should beat the drum for the Medicaid provision. As House Speaker Paul Ryan put it in a press conference yesterday:\n\n\"It has a Medicaid per capita block grant, that's the biggest entitlement reform anybody has seen here for decades. It nearly doubles the amount of money people can contribute to health savings accounts, that is fundamental part and a crucial part of conservative healthcare policy.\"\n\nHowever, it would appear that a lot of conservatives would rather have 100 percent of nothing than the partial repeal offered by the American Health Care Act. They carp about tax credits and inaccurately conflate them with Obamacare's unworkable system of subsidies. They claim the bill leaves the law's Byzantine regulations in place. And it is true that this plan isn't perfect. But perfect isn't one of our choices. If conservatives hold out for full repeal and cling to the fantasy of a free market replacement plan, there is a real danger that Obamacare will never be repealed.",
    " Title: Al Qaeda Claims Responsibility for Charlie Hebdo Attack, French Authorities Investigate Paris Kosher Market Siege\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a video released on Wednesday, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) claimed responsibility for last week's deadly attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The attack, which left 12 people dead, was years in the making, according to an AQAP leader in the video. The leader claimed U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was the mastermind behind the attack. Al-Awlaki, who was a spokesman for AQAP before his death in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, is believed to have had ties with the gunmen who attacked the magazine.\n\nIntelligence analysts have been trying to piece together whether the gunmen who attacked Charlie Hebdo met al-Awlaki on trips to Yemen. The new video's claim could bolster this theory. AQAP did not claim responsibility for Friday's deadly siege at a kosher grocery store in Paris, but praised it.\n\nFrench security services have identified a suspected accomplice in that attack, according to the French newspaper Le Parisien. Police sources cited by the newspaper said one line of investigation is that the accomplice, a man from a Paris suburb, may have driven gunman Amedy Coulibaly to the kosher supermarket, where Coulibaly later shot dead four people. Coulibaly was killed in a police raid to end the siege. Said and Cherif Kouachi, the brothers who authorities say were behind the Charlie Hebdo attack, are also dead.\n\nCharlie Hebdo's new edition hit newsstands Wednesday, a week after authorities say terrorists Said and Cherif Kouachi burst into its newsroom and gunned down staffers. The cover features a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed crying. All 3 million copies sold out quickly, but more copies are coming soon, the magazine said.\n\nThe claim of responsibility for the deadly attack on the magazine came in a video showing AQAP commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi, with pictures of the Kouachis in the background. Al-Ansi praised the attack, saying it was revenge for Charlie Hebdo's depictions of Mohammed. Al-Ansi blamed not only Charlie Hebdo, but also France and the United States.\n\nU.S. authorities said they think the video is authentic. But they were not ready to say that AQAP helped carry out the assault. \"We're not there yet. There are good indicators that the group was behind the attack, but the intelligence community is still assessing,\" a senior administration official told CNN.\n\nInvestigators believe Cherif Kouachi left Yemen with as much as $20,000 from AQAP to carry out attacks, a U.S. official said. Le Parisien's report said investigators identified Coulibaly's suspected accomplice using keys for a motorbike discovered in an apartment they raided over the weekend. Also found inside the apartment, according to Le Parisien: a stash of weapons, explosives, and two ISIS flags. Coulibaly purportedly told authorities before he was killed that he belonged to ISIS.\n\nWith France on its highest level of alert, 10,000 troops have deployed across the country. Thousands of police officers are on patrol, including hundreds assigned to protect Jewish schools. Since the attacks, dozens of cases have been opened in France against people accused of expressing support for terrorism since the attacks, the Justice Ministry said. It's unclear how many people are blamed for the 54 infractions. The cases include investigations involving phone threats, cyberattacks, and Facebook posts, the ministry said. Some are in prison awaiting trial, some have already been convicted, and some have been released with a notice of a court date, ministry spokesman Pierre Rance said.",
    " Title: Political Campaigns Employ Personalized and Targeted Approaches in Fundraising Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to connect with potential donors on a more personal level, political campaigns are resorting to increasingly personalized and desperate-sounding fundraising emails. One such email, with a subject line reading \"Need to reach you,\" mimics the tone of a plea from a friend or family member in distress.\n\nBill Scheel, a member of the campaign team for Arizona Democratic gubernatorial candidate Fred DuVal, acknowledges this trend towards personalization. \"We want to be as personal as possible,\" he told FoxNews.com. \"It's all part of a tremendous science that is now very important to campaigns.\"\n\nHowever, Scheel clarifies that the DuVal campaign draws the line at sending \"doom and gloom\" emails, citing an example from this summer by the Tea Party Patriots, which began with the line, \"The tears are starting to flow.\" Scheel believes such messages send the wrong message and are not in line with the positive and upbeat tone of their campaign.\n\nFormer Bush campaign and White House aide Taylor Griffin argues that the use of technology extends beyond subject lines to include email content and all of social media. He highlights the power of Facebook in crafting narrowly focused messages to potential voters based on their Internet profiles, including their shopping habits and websites visited.\n\nGriffin also points out that campaigns typically hire firms that specialize in voter contact, phone canvasing, culling voter rolls, and acquiring membership lists. Strategists give the example of sending a pro-gun message to potential voters listed in the membership rolls of a Second Amendment advocacy group.\n\nOne email that particularly resonated with message-weary voters this year began with the subject line, \"Would You Like Us to Leave You Alone?\" This email, sent eight days before election night by the Conservative Campaign Committee, started with a compelling narrative of a long-time female conservative, described as a \"true patriot\" but tired of the constant stream of emails. However, the message eventually transitioned into a standard fundraising pitch.\n\nScheel understands the frustration such emails may cause, which is why the DuVal campaign and others allow recipients to unsubscribe. He also notes that too many unopened or rejected emails can create problems for campaigns with Internet watchdogs. \"It's not to our advantage to keep sending emails that people won't open,\" Scheel said.",
    " Title: GOP Healthcare Reform Bill in Jeopardy as Key Senators Express Opposition\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, two Republican lawmakers have admitted that the initial GOP bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is likely \"dead.\" President Trump's proposal to solely repeal the law appears to be a \"non-starter.\"\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) expressed his doubts in a televised interview on CBS, stating, \"I think my view is it's probably going to be dead.\" If Democrats are included in the process, he said, it does not mean they control the proposal. Instead, it means they can have amendments considered, and even when they lose, they are part of the democratic process.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), speaking on a Sunday talk show, expressed uncertainty about the future of the healthcare reform. \"We don't know what the plan is. Clearly, the draft plan is dead. Is the serious rewrite plan dead? I don't know,\" he said.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) also signaled pessimism, expressing concerns about the potential loss of the Senate majority if they fail to pass healthcare legislation. He added that the party should be \"ashamed\" for not being able to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPresident Trump, in a tweet on Sunday, urged Republicans to follow through on their pledge to get rid of the health care law. \"For years, even as a 'civilian,' I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nAt least 10 GOP senators have expressed opposition to the initial bill drafted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). With Republicans holding a 52-48 majority and Democrats standing united against the bill, just three GOP defections will doom it. The weeklong July 4 recess only raised more doubts among senators as many heard from constituents angry about the GOP bill and the prospect of rising premiums.\n\nMcConnell last week said he would introduce a fresh bill in about a week, aiming to scuttle and replace much of former President Barack Obama's health care law. However, McConnell also acknowledged that if the broader effort fails, he may turn to a smaller bill with quick help for insurers and consumers and negotiate with Democrats.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) plan, which aims to lower premiums for healthy people, has drawn support from the White House and some conservatives in the House. However, his proposal has limited appeal to Republican moderates, with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) telling Iowa Public Radio that it may be \"subterfuge to get around pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nCruz, on Sunday, sought to dismiss Grassley's criticism as a \"hoax\" being pushed by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. Cruz insisted that people will be able to get the coverage they need at an affordable price, casting his plan as a compromise to unify the Republican party on a GOP health bill.\n\n\"When it comes to repealing Obamacare, what I think is critical is that Republicans, we've got to honor the promise we made to the voters that millions of Americans are hurting under Obamacare,\" Cruz said. \"In my view, failure is not an option.\"",
    " Title: New Book by Gabriel Sherman Provides Controversial Insight into Fox News and Roger Ailes\n\nArticle:\n\nA new book titled \"The Loudest Voice in the Room,\" written by New York Magazine contributing editor Gabriel Sherman, is set to be published on January 21. The book promises to offer a fresh perspective on Fox News, drawing on over 600 interviews with individuals who have interacted with Roger Ailes, the network's founder and former CEO.\n\nIn anticipation of potential backlash, the book's publisher and author are already preparing a countermeasure. A new website has been launched to promote the book and serve as a source for fact-checking and combating misinformation throughout the book's release.\n\nThe website features caricatures of key figures in Ailes' world, including Rupert Murdoch, \"The Mogul,\" and \"Champ,\" described as Ailes' guard dog. The book's release coincides with USA Today's publication of \"The Unbeatable Roger Ailes,\" an article focusing on Fox News' 2013 ratings triumphs.\n\nDespite the competitive landscape, Fox News' audience outpaced both MSNBC and CNN combined in 2013. However, it's worth noting that the cable audience, despite its political influence, is not particularly large. The average Fox prime-time audience in 2013 was little over a million people, while MSNBC's 2013 non-election-year prime-time viewership was 640,000, and CNN's was 568,000.\n\n\"The Loudest Voice in the Room\" has been in the works for over two years. Sherman did not interview Ailes for the book, and Ailes granted nearly unprecedented access to Zev Chafets for his biography. In August, after Brian Lewis, a senior adviser to Ailes, was fired, Sherman speculated that it meant Ailes was \"more isolated than ever before\" \u2014 a claim that Fox News executives quickly refuted.\n\nThe book's release is expected to stir controversy and provide a unique insight into the inner workings of Fox News and its influential figurehead, Roger Ailes.",
    " Title: Iowa Democrats Show Resistance to Clinton's Presidential Bid, Raising Questions for 2016 Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2008 presidential race, it was the state of Iowa that thwarted Hillary Clinton's presidential aspirations. The energetic caucus-goers in Iowa, known for their preference for non-establishment ideals, voted for Barack Obama and John Edwards over Clinton, forcing her to earn the party's nomination. Now, as Clinton prepares to mount a new campaign for the presidency, she faces a similar challenge in Iowa.\n\nAccording to a report in Monday's Wall Street Journal, county Democratic officials in Iowa have expressed reservations about Clinton's ability to win a general election and her fundraising ties to Wall Street firms and corporations, which remain a target of liberal ire. Many county officials have expressed a desire to see senators such as Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont enter the race, though they are split over whether any could gain traction and overtake Clinton.\n\nJennifer Herrington, chair of the Page County Democrats in southwest Iowa, stated, \"My heart wouldn't be in it for Hillary to the extent that it might be if it was a different candidate. I admire Hillary, she'd be a great president, but you know, she isn't my first choice I guess.\"\n\nIowa's Democratic electorate mirrors its Republican counterpart. In 2012, Mitt Romney came in a narrow second place behind former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, and for much of the evening, it looked like Romney had shocked the political world by emerging from Iowa victorious. However, for all of Romney's 24.5 percent of the Iowa vote, another three-quarters backed a non-establishment candidate.\n\nA narrow loss for Clinton in Iowa could spell disaster for her second presidential bid, but that prospect seems remote. The Clinton machine has, thus far, been able to fend off top-tier challengers. However, the discontent with Clinton is palpable, and her support in the polls could be an artificial result of standing alone on the presidential stage.\n\nDemocrats who want to see Clinton challenged in a primary are also smartly laying the foundations to blame her for a 2016 defeat if a challenge does not materialize. Local Democrats note that the energy, donations, and political infrastructure acquired during a contested primary also become critical tools to use in the general election. Without those, the Democratic nominee is likely to be at a disadvantage when the vibrant and ideologically diverse GOP concludes its primary contest.\n\nWhile the argument that a party that undergoes a contested primary is a stronger party is a valid contention, Clinton is unlikely to welcome a serious challenge. Memories from Iowa in 2008 are still fresh, and anti-Clinton forces, too, seem resigned. Those disaffected liberals who are prepared to accept her coronation are also preparing to consign the name Clinton to history's dishonorable scrap piles should she lose. It would be a bitter irony that the name Clinton, one which for the last 20 years has been associated with reviving the moribund Democratic brand, might soon become synonymous with its destruction.",
    " Title: Financial Challenges for Churches During Holy Week Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the traditional Holy Week commences with Palm Sunday tomorrow, many churches across the United States are grappling with the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With most churches closed due to government decrees or voluntary shutdowns, the usual Sunday collection plates have disappeared, leading to a financial crisis for churches that heavily rely on donations from worshippers for their survival.\n\nIn response, the Archdiocese of Newark, New Jersey, has set up an online GoFundMe donation page, allowing anyone to contribute to specific parishes or a more general \"Parishes in Need Fund.\" Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin stated, \"Our parishes face increased risk of financial shortfalls due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on everyday life.\"\n\nHoly Week is a significant source of donations for these churches, with a substantial portion of the funds used to support charitable work. The priests and clergy use these donations to aid hungry families, pay rent, and fund various other charitable activities.\n\nBishop Robert Casey of the Archdiocese of Chicago expressed concern, stating, \"It's a homecoming time for us, but it's also a very important fundraising time that allows us to continue with our mission and our ministries. This Holy Week will be especially worrisome for our parishes.\"\n\nIn addition to funding charitable activities, donations are crucial for payroll, church employees, and third-party employee contracts, including maintenance workers and cleaning staff. Father Paul Vigil of St. Timothy's Catholic Church in Los Angeles emphasized the Archdiocese of Los Angeles's efforts to avoid furloughs and layoffs during this time.\n\nWith many families struggling financially, the churches are facing a tough time asking for donations. Father Vigil said, \"The last thing we want to do is lay off anyone or furlough especially during this time.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, the historic generosity of the American people is expected to help churches navigate through this pandemic. The churches will continue their mission, seen as God's work on earth, with enough devout believers to carry on. As always, they will survive, having weathered depressions, wars, and now, a pandemic, the latest challenge they face.",
    " Title: Assessing the Assassination of Qassim Suleimani: A Historical Perspective on U.S. Assassination Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the targeted assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a high-ranking official of a foreign government, questions have arisen regarding the legality and morality of the U.S.'s actions. This article aims to provide a historical perspective on the United States' assassination policy, tracing its evolution from the 1970s to the present day.\n\nThe assassination of Qassim Suleimani, carried out last week, has been labeled a state-sponsored murder. This act, however, is not a new phenomenon in U.S. foreign policy. The United States has a long history of attempting to skirt the assassination ban, a policy put in place following the disclosures by the Church Committee in the 1970s, which revealed the CIA's secret attempts to assassinate foreign leaders, most notably Cuba's Fidel Castro.\n\nIn the 1970s, the assassination ban was not an accepted practice in a democracy that aspired to serve as a role model for the world. However, the reform-minded era now seems antiquated in a nation whose greatest military innovation in the 21st century has been the targeted killing of individuals by remote control.\n\nThe Clinton administration initiated this pattern in 1998, in response to the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa by Al Qaeda. The White House launched cruise missile strikes against what they claimed were terrorist training camps near Khost, Afghanistan. The primary target was Osama bin Laden. In this instance, the Clinton administration's lawyers prepared a euphemism-laden opinion to provide legal cover for their actions, marking the beginning of a long pattern.\n\nAfter 9/11, political concerns about the assassination ban were largely set aside due to the overwhelming public support for the new, so-called global war on terror. However, the government's lawyers still sought legal authorization for counterterrorism strikes. This authorization came in the form of the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), a congressional legislation passed just days after 9/11, which has provided the basic legal authorization for counterterrorism strikes ever since.\n\nArmed with the AUMF and other legal backstops, the Bush and Obama administrations began to kill at will. This campaign, which has claimed countless innocent lives and destabilized nations, has been almost entirely counterproductive. It has made Americans numb to endless war. However, the U.S. gained public and legal support for targeted killings only for what it described as the asymmetric fight against terrorism, targeting suspected terrorists, or \"non-state actors.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's assassination of Qassim Suleimani, a high-ranking official of a foreign government, marks a departure from this pattern. Suleimani was not a \"non-state actor.\" He was the head of the Quds Force, the elite external operations arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which operated with impunity throughout Iraq under his leadership. He ran Iran's ground campaign against ISIS in Iraq, in parallel to the American air campaign, and employed Shia militias and their ruthless tactics to defeat the cult-like group.\n\nIn conclusion, the assassination of Qassim Suleimani raises questions about the United States' assassination policy and its adherence to international law. As the U.S. continues to grapple with these issues, it is crucial to understand the historical context that has led to this moment.",
    " Title: Trump's Policy Stances: A Mixed Bag of Traditional Republican and Democratic Ideologies\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2016 presidential race heats up, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, is facing a challenge in winning over skeptical Republicans. In several key policy areas, Trump's views align more with the Democratic Party, particularly on trade and social issues, creating a complex political landscape for the billionaire businessman.\n\nTrump's policy positions are not easily categorized within traditional Republican orthodoxy. He has expressed opposition to environmental and corporate regulations, advocates for lower tax rates, and maintains a firm stance on abortion rights. However, his views on trade, social security, and foreign policy diverge significantly from the GOP's established positions.\n\nTrade, for instance, is a contentious issue for Trump. While he claims his views are not dissimilar from the rest of the Republican Party, he has vowed to renegotiate or abandon existing trade deals, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Trump's stance on trade is shared by Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders.\n\nOn social security, Trump's position aligns with that of Hillary Clinton. He has stated that he has no plans to scale back benefits or raise the qualifying retirement age, a stance that puts him at odds with House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has advocated for fundamental changes to entitlement programs.\n\nTrump's tax plan, which calls for lowering the top tax rate for the wealthiest Americans and slashing the corporate tax rate, has been criticized as disproportionately benefiting the rich. Trump now appears to be distancing himself from his own tax plan, stating that it was a starting point for negotiations and that he would like to see the middle class benefit more from any tax law changes.\n\nTrump's foreign policy stance is also a departure from traditional Republican views. He has advocated an \"America First\" approach, which some of his advisers describe as a \"third way.\" Clinton, on the other hand, has advocated for a \"smart power\" approach that combines diplomatic, legal, economic, political, and cultural tools to expand American influence.\n\nIn the foreign policy arena, Trump has sought to portray Clinton as a hawkish candidate who is quick to lead the country into conflict. He has also criticized international alliances, such as NATO, questioning the structure that sees the U.S. paying for most of its costs.\n\nTrump's policy positions, particularly on trade and social security, have created a complex political landscape for the 2016 presidential race. As the general election approaches, it remains to be seen how Trump will navigate these differences and appeal to both Republican and Democratic voters.",
    " Title: St. Louis Couple Surrenders Rifle to Police After Confrontation with Protesters\n\nA husband and wife who gained national attention after brandishing firearms at protesters outside their St. Louis home have turned over a rifle to police following a search warrant execution. The incident occurred on Friday, as authorities investigated the June 28 confrontation between the couple and a group protesting police brutality and the city's mayor's actions.\n\nThe couple, Mark and Patricia McCloskey, were caught on video armed with a rifle and a handgun as they confronted the protesters in their affluent St. Louis neighborhood of Central West End. Images and videos of the confrontation circulated on social media during the Black Lives Matter protests that took place across the country following the death of George Floyd.\n\nIn a video of the incident, Mark McCloskey is heard yelling, \"Get the hell out of my neighborhood. Private property. Get out.\"\n\nThe St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department (SLMPD) stated in a Saturday statement that detectives executed a search warrant at the McCloskey residence. According to the statement, seized as evidence from the residence was a Colt, semi-automatic,.223 caliber rifle.\n\nAttorney Joel Schwartz, who is now representing the McCloskeys, told NBC News in a phone interview that the McCloskeys' home was not searched by police, and they voluntarily surrendered the rifle. The second weapon was turned over to the previous lawyer, Schwartz said.\n\nSchwartz maintained his clients' innocence and stated they were \"law-abiding citizens who were well within their rights.\" The attorney added that the couple regrets their actions but did not break any laws. The St. Louis Circuit Attorney's Office said the matter remains under investigation.\n\nIn a June statement, police described the McCloskeys as \"victims\" of trespassing and fourth-degree assault. According to police, the McCloskeys stated they were on their property when they heard a loud commotion coming from the street. When they went to investigate, they observed a large group of subjects forcefully breaking an iron gate marked with \"No Trespassing\" and \"Private Street\" signs.\n\nDemonstrators were in the neighborhood to protest against police brutality and Mayor Lyda Krewson, a Central West End resident who had released the names and addresses of activists who want to defund the police. Krewson has since apologized.\n\nDaniel Shular, a freelance photojournalist who was at the protest, previously told NBC News that he did not see anyone break the gate leading to the neighborhood and recalled seeing people simply walk through an open gate.\n\n\"I kind of turned around to take some pictures of people coming through the gate, then I turned back around, and by then, he had his long gun in his hand,\" he said. \"And the woman came out with a pistol and started pointing it with her finger on the trigger at everybody.\"\n\nShular said he saw at least one armed protester but added, \"It's not super out of the ordinary for the protests here.\"\n\nAlbert Watkins, the previous attorney for the McCloskeys, said last month that his clients are supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement and became fearful because white protesters were acting aggressively.",
    " Title: Univision's Controversial Coverage of President Trump's Mount Rushmore Speech Sparks Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a divisive turn of events, Univision, a broadcast network known for its advocacy on immigration issues, has been criticized for its coverage of President Donald Trump's Independence Day eve address at Mount Rushmore. The Trump campaign labeled the network's reporting as biased, comparing it to MSNBC, while Univision's coverage more closely resembles a hybrid of TeleSur and Al-Jazeera, as it is owned by the National Council of La Raza.\n\nThe network's coverage of Trump's Rushmore speech was criticized for its framing of the event as a \"campaign rally\" and the omission of significant portions of the president's speech. Anchor Arantxa Loizaga reported that the event, which issued 7,500 tickets, lacked social distancing and face masks, and that Trump's speech further divided the nation during a time of social, economic, and health crises. However, the network omitted Trump's mentions of Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, and Jefferson, as well as his proposed National Garden, and his denunciations of the radical left's attempts to erase history.\n\nSenator Tammy Duckworth's (D-IL) subsequent reaction to the speech, dismissing Trump as spending all his time \"talking about dead traitors,\" only makes sense if all she watched was Univision's report. This suggests that Univision's reporting may have influenced Duckworth's perspective.\n\nUnivision's coverage of Tucker Carlson's subsequent criticism of Duckworth's willingness to have a \"conversation\" on the erasure of George Washington is also noteworthy. Carlson's criticism came after Duckworth told CNN that she supported a \"national dialogue\" over the request to eliminate monuments to such personalities as George Washington, a slave owner, in the midst of the debate over symbols and racism.\n\nUnivision's reporting, in this instance, has been criticized for enabling the move to erase America's founding. There is no mention of the movement to erase American history, or of the broader effort to cancel America's Founding. There is no mention of the violent mobs that have endeavored to vandalize statues of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Frederick Douglass. Univision, in an attempt to stoke racial grievance, seems to focus on the side of the monument debate that best suits their interests.",
    " Title: ESG Investing Proves Profitable Amidst COVID-19 Crisis: A Shift Towards Ethical Corporate Practices\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the global coronavirus pandemic, a new wave of corporate behavior is emerging, signaling a shift towards a more communal and sustainable approach. This change in ethos is reflected in the growing emphasis on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices, a code of conduct that has gained traction in the business world in recent years.\n\nCompanies are adopting measures such as furloughing workers instead of firing them, donating equipment, and contributing to their communities in various ways. They are also suspending dividends to shareholders and postponing executive bonuses.\n\nIntriguingly, research by Bloomberg Intelligence and RBC Capital Markets indicates that investors who have purchased stocks in companies with strong ESG performance have outperformed other broad indexes this year. Moreover, Bank of America reports an ongoing influx of money into ESG mutual funds.\n\nThis trend suggests that, as the economic tide recedes, corporations that prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term profits, and address issues like climate change and inequality, are proving to be more financially viable. In other words, doing good is proving to be profitable.\n\nLooking ahead to the post-COVID-19 world, Barclays estimates that the use of ESG by investors may accelerate. The crisis is viewed as a prelude to potential economic shocks in the future, such as climate change. Investors are increasingly looking to corporations to aid in our collective resilience.\n\nAmidst the current investor panic, there appears to be a growing appreciation for ethical values in companies over bottom-line profits. The virus crisis seems to be lifting many codes of behavior. Could this mark a significant shift in capitalism?",

He emphasized the administration's focus on prioritizing American families and workers in their policy initiatives.\n\nOne of the key points Kennedy made was the significant economic benefits for blue-collar workers, particularly in the manufacturing sector. He stated that non-supervisory positions, or those who are on the factory floor, have experienced the highest wage gains. The USMCA, according to Kennedy, will further strengthen and accelerate this growth by implementing tougher labor standards for manufacturing, thereby discouraging factories from moving to Mexico.\n\nKennedy also mentioned that Republicans are united in their opposition to the Democrats' impeachment push against the president. In response to a question about a potential Senate impeachment trial, Kennedy expressed the belief that a bipartisan opposition in the Senate is more likely, with Republicans remaining united in their support for the president.\n\nThe interview concluded with Kennedy noting the Republicans' strong unity and the Democrats' apparent division on the impeachment issue. \"\u2588\u2588\u2588 Sunday\" broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern (4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Pacific).",
    " Title: Tacoma Gun Sales Tax: A New Frontier in the Gun Regulation Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nTacoma, Washington, is poised to become one of a select few U.S. cities to impose a high tax on gun sales, marking a new phase in the ongoing debate over local governments' authority to regulate firearms. The proposed tax, which would collect $25 per gun sale to fund violence prevention programs, is modeled on a law in neighboring Seattle that has already been upheld by the state supreme court.\n\nThe tax, which would also apply to ammunition, has sparked controversy, with opponents arguing it could drive gun shops out of the industrial port city of 215,000 residents. In Seattle, lawmakers projected $300,000 to $500,000 in annual gun taxes, but last year only received $77,642 due to gun stores relocating.\n\nDan Davies, co-owner of Mary's Pistols in Tacoma, expressed concern, stating, \"It'll put us out of business; there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.\"\n\nRyan Mello, the Tacoma councilman behind the measure, counters these concerns, predicting the tax will generate between $30,000 and $40,000 annually for violence prevention programs while making gun purchases less appealing.\n\nThe proposed tax has drawn opposition from major pro-gun groups, including the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms-industry trade association. Lawrence Keane, the senior vice president of government relations and public affairs for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, expressed concern that the tax could set a precedent for other cities to follow.\n\nAero Precision, a gun parts manufacturer with around 400 employees in Tacoma, has stated its opposition to the tax and threatened to explore other options if the tax is implemented. Gun store owner Sergey Solyanik moved his business from Seattle to Lynnwood due to the city's gun tax, citing lower prices outside the city.\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) has been a significant force in the passage of so-called gun pre-emption laws, or laws that limit local authorities' ability to regulate guns. Cities across the country have attempted to circumvent these prohibitions with limited success.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, restrictions on semiautomatic rifles like the AR-15 model used in a 2018 mass shooting at a synagogue were met with a lawsuit backed by the NRA and have since been put on hold. Last week, a Washington state judge ruled that Edmonds, a municipality north of Seattle, cannot enforce a new city law requiring gun owners to keep their guns locked up at home.\n\nCook County in Illinois, home to Chicago, passed a gun tax in 2013, and Seattle followed in 2015. Tim Burgess, a former Seattle city council member, introduced the tax as a means to fund a gun violence research and prevention program at a local hospital, Harborview Medical Center.\n\nIn 2017, the state supreme court ruled in favor of Seattle and against the NRA, the NSSF, and the Second Amendment Foundation, stating that the tax's primary purpose is not to regulate firearms but \"to raise revenue for the public benefit.\"",
    " Title: GOP Lawmakers Remain Silent on Trump's Call for Foreign Interference in Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the release of a rough transcript of a call in which President Donald Trump urged Ukraine's president to investigate the Bidens, a notable silence from Republican lawmakers has been observed on television. This silence has been particularly evident on MSNBC, with none of the 53 Republican senators appearing on the network since the call's release, according to a source. Similarly, only four of 197 Republican House members have appeared on MSNBC, with one of them not running for reelection.\n\nCNN has reported a similar trend, with only seven Republican House members appearing on the network during this time period, but no senators. The lack of response from Republican lawmakers has become a story in itself, with CNN displaying the names of the lawmakers in a graphic that read, \"GOP Lawmakers Silent On Trump's Call For China To Dig Up Biden Dirt.\"\n\nOne Republican senator, Ron Johnson, broke the silence on Sunday's \"Meet the Press,\" but the interview quickly went viral due to its contentious nature. Host Chuck Todd became visibly exasperated with Johnson after the senator deflected questions about Ukraine to talk about emails by former FBI agent Peter Strzok, a recurring character in the conservative media narrative of a \"deep state\" out to get Trump.\n\nThe tense exchange between Todd and Johnson was met with praise for Todd's aggressive handling of the interview, with New York University journalism professor and media critic Jay Rosen tweeting, \"I view @ MeetThePress almost every week. Today his tone \u2014 I mean his voice itself \u2014 was different, as if the gravity of events had sunk in and his patience with denial had run out.\"\n\nAnother GOP senator, Roy Blunt of Missouri, visited CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, where host Margaret Brennan asked if it were \"appropriate to ask for a foreign government to interfere in the election.\" Blunt suggested the president was joking when he called on China to investigate the Bidens, a response echoed by stalwart Trump defender Rep. Jim Jordan on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers have successfully dodged questions in the past about Trump's conduct, such as an outrageous tweet or offensive remark. However, impeachment is not a matter that can be easily dismissed, and the silence from Republican lawmakers has become a story in itself after two weeks of revelations, including explosive text messages among diplomats and Trump's shocking call on the White House lawn for China to investigate the Bidens.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers have criticized the Syria decision, while also blasting the NBA for apologizing to China after the general manager of the Houston Rockets expressed support on Twitter for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. However, the idea of China interfering in the sanctity of the NBA is offensive to them, while the same standard for American elections results in the sound of crickets, according to CNN's Jake Tapper.\n\nAs the impeachment inquiry moves forward, it remains to be seen if more Republican lawmakers will break their silence and speak out against Trump's actions. The silence of these lawmakers has raised questions about their willingness to stand up for the principles of free and fair elections and their allegiance to the president.",

The site experienced temporary downtime, returning an error message when users attempted to log in or update. The authenticity of the president's participation was confirmed by the Obama campaign with a tweet and a photo of the president at his computer.\n\nDuring the AMA, the president discussed a range of topics, including internet freedom, the space program, the most challenging decision of his first term (the surge in Afghanistan), and the White House beer (\"it's tasty\").\n\nReddit founder Alexis Ohanian expressed his excitement about the event in a quick email to \u2588\u2588\u2588, stating, \"I'm thrilled, obviously, but what makes this even more exciting is that President Obama is doing this AMA from Charlottesville, VA - the same place where 7 years ago, Steve Huffman and I started the company that'd create Reddit.

The bus will travel from Denver to Danville, Kentucky, where organizers will speak with Americans, including students and startup founders, about their internet usage and legislation surrounding it.\n\nAfter an hour, Obama had amassed hundreds of comments and questions on Reddit.

ET in Charleston, South Carolina. The debate, which will feature seven candidates in the main event, is set to take place at the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center.\n\nThe debate's location is significant, as it is less than 10 miles from the Emanuel AME Church, the site of last June's mass shooting. Gun control is expected to be a topic of discussion, given President Obama's mention of it in Tuesday's State of the Union Address and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley's revisiting the incident in her Republican response.\n\nThe debate's venue is situated near the Cooper River and a bustling container-ship and car-carrier operation, which has transformed Charleston from a Navy town to a thriving hub of maritime commerce. This provides an opportunity for questions about the global economy.\n\nThe debate's format could potentially see a more civil and focused discussion among the candidates, as there are only seven participants in the main event. The debate will be the second time the Fox Business Network has hosted a Republican debate, and it may be the first time an evening with the Republicans does not devolve into pouting, posturing, and crosstalk.\n\nThe debate will follow Sunday's Democratic debate, which will be carried by NBC. The Republican candidates will be vying for the support of South Carolina's conservative electorate, which is the most conservative of the four stops on the February primary circuit.\n\nThe debate's format will allow for each candidate to present their views on various issues, including gun control, the global economy, and foreign policy. The debate is expected to provide insight into the candidates' positions and their ability to articulate their views in a clear and concise manner.\n\nIn the spirit of the Low Country, here are six things to watch for during the debate:\n\n1. The candidates' responses to President Obama's State of the Union Address, particularly on issues such as the situation in Iran, the emphasis on guns, and the use of the term \"Muslim\" in relation to hate crimes.\n2. The potential for a heated exchange between candidates Ted Cruz and Donald Trump regarding Cruz's Canadian birth and any undisclosed loans from Goldman Sachs.\n3. The candidates' positions on social issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage, and their appeal to the conservative electorate in South Carolina.\n4. The candidates' strategies for appealing to moderate voters in the upcoming primaries, particularly in New Hampshire.\n5. The candidates' positions on foreign policy, particularly in relation to the Middle East and North Korea.\n6. The candidates' ability to present a clear and concise message, particularly in relation to their economic plans and their ability to create jobs.\n\nThe debate is expected to be a lively and informative event, providing insight into the candidates' positions and their ability to articulate their views in a clear and concise manner. The debate will be an important event in the 2016 presidential campaign, and it is expected to be closely watched by voters across the country.",
    " Title: Defense Cuts Threaten Political Reputations as Sequester Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nThe impending automatic spending cuts, colloquially known as the sequester, are not only a pressing policy concern but also a potential political liability for lawmakers representing defense-heavy districts. The $1.2 trillion in defense and domestic spending cuts could not only trigger another recession, but also pose a threat to the re-election prospects of lawmakers who support the cuts.\n\nFrom the Navy shipyards of Norfolk to the aerospace industry hangars in Southern California, and in the corporate towers of defense contractors within the Beltway, the sequester is not just an urgent policy matter, but a political issue that could impact the 2013 elections.\n\nRepublicans, who are advocating for the elimination of the sequester and the sparing of the Pentagon, are already targeting Democrats who insist on new tax revenues as part of any deal to roll back military cuts.\n\nRep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), a veteran of the first Gulf War and the Iraq War, stated, \"Any member of Congress that would defend the sequester and not come up with an alternative or [insist on revenues], I think that in a competitive district, that they would be open to attack for cutting defense too deeply.\"\n\nA study showed that deep defense cuts would cost 1 million jobs nationwide, with significant impacts in California, Virginia, and Florida. In the tossup race between Democratic Rep. Mark Critz and Republican Keith Rothfus in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, Rothfus has criticized Critz for rejecting GOP proposals to shield the Pentagon cuts, despite both parties having issues with the package of cuts, which affects domestic safety net programs.\n\nThe looming sequester leaves Democrats in a difficult position, as they must balance honoring last year's debt limit deal, which put the defense cuts trigger into law, and protecting jobs in their home district. The projected military cuts have made for easy targeting by Republican operatives, who are trying to portray some Democrats as willing to eliminate stable defense-oriented jobs.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee has criticized Democratic lawmakers like Reps. Larry Kissell of North Carolina, Bill Owens of New York, and John Barrow of Georgia for rejecting plans to save cuts from hitting Forts Bragg, Drum, and Gordon.\n\n\"These Democrats are already on record opposing common-sense reforms that would avoid these devastating cuts to local jobs and America's military,\" said Paul Lindsay, an NRCC spokesman.\n\nRep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) agrees with Republicans on at least this point: that these cuts would be cataclysmic. The sequester's impact on jobs and the economy, as well as its political implications, will likely be a significant factor in the upcoming elections.",
    " Title: FDA Approves Emergency Use of Ebola Blood Testing Kit as Survival Rates in West Africa Improve\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency approval for a new diagnostic kit to test blood for the Ebola virus, as doctors report a survival rate in one hard-hit area that has climbed to about 70 percent. The FDA's announcement came on Wednesday, following a day-earlier posting of the approval on its website.\n\nThis latest move is part of a series of emergency authorizations issued since October, following the federal government's declaration that the ongoing health crisis necessitates the use of testing methods that have not undergone the ordinary regulatory approval process. The approval was based on a 2006 determination by then-Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff that the Ebola virus poses a material threat against the United States population sufficient to affect national security.\n\nThe United States has seen four confirmed cases of the virus so far, including three healthcare workers and one man, Thomas Eric Duncan, who died in Texas after contracting the virus in Liberia. On Wednesday, Liberia's U.N. peacekeeping mission reported its fourth Ebola case. A U.N. spokesman stated in a statement that the infected worker was from Liberia and was transferred to an Ebola treatment unit.\n\nThe 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was the largest outbreak of the disease in history, killing over 7,500 people in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, according to figures released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, doctors are reporting signs of improvement, with survival rates in Sierra Leone dramatically increasing.\n\nIn a letter published online Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine, several doctors described 581 cases they dealt with at an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, in late September. About 31 percent of the patients died, including 38 people who were dead upon arrival. But even those numbers appear to be improving. Among patients admitted since November 5, the mortality rate was less than 24 percent.\n\nThe figures compare to a 74 percent death rate for 106 patients who were treated in the eastern Sierra Leone town of Kenema in May and June, when some health workers were on strike and the response to the outbreak was in crisis mode. The spread of the outbreak has slowed significantly, according to the CDC, which gave a worst-case scenario estimate of as many as 1.4 million cases by mid-January if the region did not receive more aid. Last month, the agency said that prediction would not happen.\n\n\"There's been real momentum and real progress,\" CDC Director Thomas Frieden said Monday after his second trip to Ebola-stricken countries. \"The challenge is not to let up.\"\n\nThe article is based in part on wire service reports.",
    " Title: Conservative Republicans Challenge Boehner's Government Funding Plan, Threaten to Derail Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives is once again causing problems for the Republican leadership, as they have expressed dissatisfaction with a government funding plan outlined by Speaker John Boehner during a closed-door meeting on Tuesday.\n\nInstead of a spending bill that keeps the government funded through September with a chance to review the Department of Homeland Security's funding in March, the lawmakers want to pass a much shorter resolution.\n\nRep. John Fleming (R-La.) said, \"I think a lot of us, in discussion, we don't see the purpose of having a long CR. Why not do it the first day we're in session? I'm not sure it's going to pass the way they are proposing it. I think it's likely they are going to have to improve it if they want it to pass.\"\n\nConservative Republicans estimate the number of Republican \"no\" votes to be near 30 to 40, which could derail a vote on the government funding bill if Democrats oppose the measure.\n\nSenate conservatives are also beginning to pressure House leaders over their plan to fund the government and symbolically disapprove of the president's immigration action. GOP Sens. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, David Vitter of Louisiana, and Mike Lee of Utah have criticized the House GOP leadership's plan.\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) laid out a detailed roadmap to taking on the executive action in a statement to Breitbart News, arguing for a short-term continuing resolution that blocks funding for the executive action.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) gave a tepid endorsement of the House leadership's plan on Tuesday, while Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has largely deferred to the House, emphasizing that there will be no shutdown.\n\nMissing from this drama, for now, is Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who was central to the movement to defund Obamacare in October 2013, which eventually led to a lengthy government shutdown. On Tuesday, Cruz declined to speak about the House's bill and referred a reporter to his press office, which did not respond to questions.\n\nAcross the Rotunda, House conservatives are beginning to converge around the idea of a shorter-term CR that strictly limits funds to the Department of Homeland Security, the agency tasked with implementing Obama's immigration executive actions.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said, \"For me, something that is shorter term allows us to hopefully deal with a Senate that is more negotiable. I'm probably leaning no [on the current House plan].\"\n\nThe atmosphere could be better for Republicans in January, as the Senate will then be controlled by the GOP, increasing the likelihood that any long-term spending legislation passed in the House could be put to a vote in the Senate. Plans floated by conservatives include passing a CR that keeps the government open just until the first week of the next Congress in January.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a leading conservative in the House, said on Tuesday that \"the cavalry is coming\" and that he preferred to deal with the larger funding issues next year. Outspoken Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), who has built a reputation around opposing Republican leadership, also backed a proposal that would only temporarily extend government funding.\n\n\"For me, it's generally in appropriations the shorter the better,\" the Kansas Republican said.",
    " Title: Election 2018: Senate and House Outcomes Hinge on Modest Turnout Shifts\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Election Day draws near, the anticipated outcomes for the Senate and House of Representatives remain largely unchanged from the past six months. In the Senate, the Republican party is more likely to gain seats, while in the House, the Democratic party is favored to win control, but not by a significant margin.\n\nThe general expectations are influenced by geography and historical trends. The Senate's Republican advantage is due to the need for Democrats to defend numerous seats in traditionally GOP-leaning states. Conversely, the Democrats are expected to perform well in the House due to the historical pattern of the party out of power gaining ground in midterm elections.\n\nHowever, the wide range of possible outcomes is a testament to the close nature of many races. As of Wednesday, there are six highly competitive Senate races, with five (Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, and Nevada) being pure toss-ups, and Montana slightly favoring the Democrats with Jon Tester's re-election bid in a Republican-leaning state.\n\nScottRasmussen.com, conducting private research for the Auto Alliance and the National Retail Federation, has examined three different turnout models for these six races. The results indicate that a slight increase in Republican turnout could result in a GOP sweep of the competitive races, giving them a 56-44 majority in the Senate. Conversely, a slight increase in Democratic turnout could lead to a 50-50 Senate.\n\nThe House of Representatives faces a similar dynamic, with the Democrats needing to pick up 23 seats to win control. ScottRasmussen.com currently projects a Democratic gain of 12 seats, with 33 seats too close to call. The Democrats need to win 11 of these 33 races, but the outcome is not guaranteed.\n\nThe Generic Congressional Ballot polling shows the Democrats with a 7-point advantage. If they win the popular vote by this margin on Election Day, they would be favored to win most of the 33 competitive races. However, a slight shift in the popular vote could have a significant impact, with the Republicans potentially keeping their majority if they boost turnout and narrow the gap, or the Democrats enjoying a large night and gaining up to 45 seats if the popular vote shifts in their favor.\n\nIn conclusion, the final outcome of Election 2018 will be determined by modest changes in voter turnout. The elections will hinge on who decides to show up and vote, emphasizing the importance of every individual's participation in the democratic process.",
    " Title: Twitter's Policy Allows Chinese Officials to Spread Coronavirus Conspiracy Theories Without Violation\n\nArticle:\n\nChinese state officials are not in violation of Twitter's terms of service when they use the platform to spread propaganda and conspiracy theories regarding the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, a Twitter representative has confirmed.\n\nAccording to a report by The Daily Beast, a company representative stated that direct interactions with public figures, comments on political issues, or foreign policy discussions are generally not in violation of Twitter's rules. This policy seems to allow world officials to engage in disinformation without consequence.\n\nThe representative's anonymity was requested, and a Twitter spokeswoman confirmed the report to the \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation but did not provide a reason for not going on the record.\n\nThe policy was applied to recent examples of Chinese officials using Twitter as a propaganda tool, as reported by The Daily Beast. One such example is a tweet by Chinese senior official Lijian Zhao on March 12, where he suggested that the United States was trying to covertly inject the virus into China.\n\nZhao's tweet read, \"When did Patient Zero appear in the United States? How many people are infected? What is the name of the hospital? It may be that the US military brought the epidemic to Wuhan.\" Zhao also falsely stated that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield was \"arrested\" before floating the conspiracy theory to his 317,000 followers. Redfield was not apprehended.\n\nFurthermore, Zhao tweeted on Sunday, suggesting that some CDC patients were misdiagnosed as having the flu during the 2019 flu season. He implied that patient zero may have originated in the United States.\n\nHealth officials have stated that the virus began in China's Wuhan region and expanded geometrically from there, contradicting Zhao's suggestions.\n\nTwitter has also allowed other instances of misinformation to persist on its platform. For example, Tesla CEO Elon Musk told his Twitter followers on March 20 that children are \"essentially immune\" to coronavirus, a claim that Twitter previously stated was impermissible. However, Twitter appeared to backtrack after Musk's comment, stating that the tweets did not violate its rules at the time.\n\nThe company stated, \"We reviewed the Tweets, and they don't violate our rules at this time. Please continue to share anything you think we should take a closer look at\u2014we'll continue to rely on trusted partners, such as health authorities, to flag content that is harmful.\"",
    " Title: Delegate Suggests GOP Convention Freely Allows Delegates to Vote According to Personal Preference\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with Morning Edition on Thursday, Curly Haugland, a Republican National Committeeman from North Dakota, suggested that the upcoming Republican National Convention in Cleveland could allow delegates to vote according to their personal preference, rather than being bound by primary results or candidate preferences.\n\nHaugland, who has previously expressed this view, argued that party rules do not bind delegates to vote for a specific candidate. He contends that even delegates who are \"pledged\" to Donald Trump or other contenders due to state primary results are, in reality, free to vote as they wish.\n\nHaugland's interpretation is based on the GOP's convention Rules 37 and 38. He interprets these rules to mean that delegates may \"vote their conscience.\" While the rules do not explicitly state this, Rule 37 is a detailed explanation of the procedure for roll call votes, and Rule 38 does say that no delegate may be \"bound\" by the \"unit rule,\" meaning that delegates from a state cannot all be forced to vote the same way.\n\nHaugland's interpretation is not a unanimous view. It is more widely accepted that delegates currently pledged to Trump, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, or others must support them at least on the first ballot. However, if no candidate receives a majority, delegates would necessarily vote differently on later ballots to resolve the impasse.\n\nAnother of Haugland's points is indisputable: \"When the convention convenes,\" he said, \"the delegates adopt their own rules, which have not been adopted yet.\" There is a standard template for conventions, but delegates could tweak the template, changing the game in any way they want. The only real constraint is that their actions would be publicly known and therefore open to criticism.\n\nThe latitude afforded delegates explains why it is considered significant that Senator Ted Cruz has outmaneuvered Trump in several states, ensuring that as many delegates as possible are Cruz supporters.\n\nHaugland's personal goal is to adopt a rule that assures delegates the chance to choose from a wide range of alternatives, including candidates such as Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio who have suspended their campaigns.",
    " Title: CDC Outlines Ebola Policies: Voluntary Home Quarantine for High-Risk Individuals\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to address the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has outlined updated guidelines for monitoring individuals entering the United States from the affected regions. The new policies, announced Monday, emphasize voluntary home quarantine for those at the highest risk of Ebola transmission.\n\nThe CDC's best practices, detailed in a press call Monday afternoon, are designed for four categories of individuals who are not exhibiting symptoms. These guidelines cover both international travelers and those who may have had domestic contact with the virus.\n\nIndividuals at the highest risk, such as healthcare workers who experienced a needle stick while treating Ebola patients, will be asked to remain under voluntary home quarantine and receive daily, in-person checks by a health official for 21 days.\n\nHealthcare workers returning from Africa will be included in the \"some risk\" category, which involves daily direct monitoring but allows for more freedom of movement, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nCDC Director Tom Frieden did not directly address the policies implemented by states like New York and New Jersey, but expressed concern over certain policies that might increase stigma towards healthcare workers and give a false impression of Ebola's infectiousness.\n\nFrieden stated, \"If we turn them into pariahs instead of recognizing the heroic nature of the work they're doing, then they may be less likely to identify themselves as health workers\u2014and thus go unmonitored\u2014and less likely to go help [Africa] in the first place.\"\n\nVirginia also announced enhanced monitoring plans for individuals entering the country from the affected West African regions on Monday. Some considered at high risk will face a quarantine at home, with daily check-ins by health officials.\n\nLast week, the CDC announced that all individuals entering the United States from the West African countries would be required to provide detailed contact information, monitor their temperature twice daily, and report the results to local health officials daily. This measure began in six states on Monday and will be expanded nationwide.\n\nThe quarantined nurse, Kaci Hickox, who was detained in New Jersey despite testing negative for Ebola and having no symptoms, had retained a civil rights attorney and threatened to sue New Jersey over her detention. Hickox, who had spent a month treating patients in Sierra Leone with Doctors Without Borders, had emerged as a prominent figure in the opposition to mandatory 21-day quarantines announced Friday night in New York and New Jersey.",
    " Title: Covington Catholic High School Students Allege Threats and Doxxing Following Viral Video Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a viral video showing a confrontation between Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann and Native American elder Nathan Phillips in Washington D.C., two students from the school have come forward with allegations of threats and doxxing.\n\nSam Schroder, a senior at Covington Catholic, and Grant Hillmann, another senior, released a video statement Monday evening detailing the alleged threats against them, the school, and their families. Schroder stated that the threats ranged from school burnings, bombings, and school shooting threats, to more personal attacks such as doxxing, where their identities and contact information were made public online.\n\nThe students claimed that the threats have escalated to such an extent that police have been stationed at the school, and students are fearful of attending classes the following day. Schroder expressed his concern, stating, \"It's really scary. I know a lot of people are scared to go to school tomorrow and won't be attending because of what could happen.\"\n\nBoth Schroder and Hillmann alleged that they, as well as other students and their parents, have been doxxed. Hillmann stated, \"I, myself, wasn't even present but I am very vocal about defending my school and my peers, and I have been doxxed on three separate occasions.\"\n\nThe students also accused several media outlets of blatantly lying about the encounter and claimed that the coverage had a significant impact on their community. Hillmann stated, \"Several outlets blatantly lied about the encounter and the coverage affected our community greatly.\"\n\nNick Sandmann, the student featured in the viral video, was wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat and was seen seemingly smirking at Phillips, a tribal leader and U.S. veteran, who was beating a drum in front of him during a D.C. protest. In a statement released Sunday, Sandmann claimed he was attempting to \"diffuse\" the situation by smiling and that Phillips had \"singled [him] out for a confrontation.\"\n\nPhillips, on the other hand, claimed he saw \"hatred\" in the \"beastly young men\" who surrounded Sandmann and cheered him on during the encounter. The incident has sparked a heated debate, with many calling for further investigation and others defending the actions of the students.",
    " Title: AI Adjustments and Oversight in a Pandemic: A Closer Look at Machine Learning Models and Their Resilience\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of the ongoing global crisis, it has become evident that traditional worst-case scenarios in machine learning models may not fully prepare for the unprecedented events that have unfolded. This is according to Sharma, who suggests that more AI systems should be trained on historical events such as the Great Depression, the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash, and the 2007-2008 financial crisis. \"A pandemic like this is a perfect trigger to build better machine-learning models,\" he says.\n\nHowever, it is impossible to prepare for everything. As David Excell, founder of Featurespace, a behavior analytics company, points out, problems arise when a machine-learning system doesn't see what it expects to see. Despite this, Featurespace's AI has not been significantly impacted during the pandemic. People are still buying goods from Amazon and subscribing to Netflix, but they are not making large purchases or spending in new places, which can raise suspicions. \"People's spending behavior is a contraction of their old habits,\" says Excell.\n\nThe firm's engineers have only had to adjust for a surge in purchases of garden equipment and power tools, says Excell. These are the kinds of mid-price anomalous purchases that fraud-detection algorithms might pick up on. \"I think there is certainly more oversight,\" says Excell. \"The world has changed, and the data has changed.\"\n\nAnother AI company, Phrasee, is also taking a hands-on approach. It uses natural-language processing and machine learning to generate email marketing copy or Facebook ads on behalf of its clients. To ensure the tone is appropriate, its AI generates numerous possible phrases, which are then run through a neural network that selects the best ones. However, because natural-language generation can go awry, Phrasee always has humans check what goes into and comes out of its AI.\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit, Phrasee realized that more sensitivity was required and started filtering out additional language. The company has banned specific phrases, such as \"going viral,\" and doesn't allow language that refers to discouraged activities, such as \"party wear.\" It has even culled emojis that may be read as too happy or too alarming. And it has also dropped terms that may stoke anxiety, such as \"OMG,\" \"be prepared,\" \"stock up,\" and \"brace yourself.\" \"People don't want marketing to make them feel anxious and fearful\u2014you know, like, this deal is about to run out, pressure pressure pressure,\" says Parry Malm, the firm's CEO.\n\nAmazon, as a microcosm for the retail industry as a whole, has made subtle behind-the-scenes adjustments to meet demand. As Amazon and the 2.5 million third-party sellers it supports struggle to meet demand, it is making tiny tweaks to its algorithms to help spread the load. Most Amazon sellers rely on Amazon to fulfill their orders. Sellers store their items in an Amazon warehouse, and Amazon takes care of all the logistics, delivering to people's homes and handling returns. It then promotes sellers whose orders it fulfills itself.\n\nHowever, in the last few weeks, Amazon has flipped that around, says Cline. To ease demand on its own warehouses, its algorithms now appear more likely to promote sellers that handle their own deliveries. This kind of adjustment would be hard to do without manual intervention, says Cline. \"The situation is so volatile,\" he says. \"You're trying to optimize for toilet paper last week, and this week everyone wants to buy puzzles or gym equipment.\"\n\nThe tweaks Amazon makes to its algorithms then have knock-on effects on the algorithms that sellers use to decide what to spend on online advertising. Every time a web page with ads loads, a super-fast auction takes place where automated bidders decide between themselves who gets to fill each ad box. The amount these algorithms decide to spend for an ad depends on a myriad of variables, but ultimately, the decision is based on an estimate of how much you, the eyeballs on the page, are worth to them.\n\nThere are lots of ways to predict customer behavior, including not only data about your past purchases but also the pigeonhole that ad companies have placed you in on the basis of your online activity. But now, one of the best predictors of whether someone who clicks an ad will buy your product is how long you say it will take to deliver it, says Cline. So Nozzle is talking to customers about adjusting their algorithms to take this into account. For example, if you think you can't deliver faster than a competitor, it might not be worth trying to outbid them in an ad auction. On the other hand, if you know your competitor has run out of stock, then you can go in cheap, gambling that they won't bid.\n\nAll of this is possible only with a dedicated team keeping tabs on things, says Cline. He thinks the current situation is an eye-opener for a lot of people who assumed all automated systems could run themselves. \"You need a data science team who can connect what's going on in the world to what's going on the algorithms,\" he says. \"An algorithm would never pick some of this stuff up.\"\n\nWith everything connected, the impact of a pandemic has been felt far and wide, touching mechanisms that in more typical times remain hidden. If we are looking for a silver lining, then now is a time to take stock of those newly exposed systems and ask how they might be designed better, made more resilient. If machines are to be trusted, we need to watch over them.",
    " Title: Migrant Caravan Nears U.S. Border, President Trump Threatens Border Closure\n\nArticle:\n\nA small group of approximately 150 migrants, carrying white flags bearing the message \"La paz y Dios\" or \"Peace and God are With Us,\" have moved within 500 feet of the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a report Thursday. The migrants, who are seeking asylum, are approaching the U.S. near Baja, California.\n\nThe migrants are using the white flags to demonstrate their peaceful intentions. They plan to present themselves as asylum seekers at the border. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that Mexican federal police have set up a barrier near a pedestrian crossing and urged the migrants to apply for jobs in Tijuana. The police claim there are thousands of job opportunities in the city.\n\nPresident Trump on Thursday warned that he may close the border with Mexico if his administration determines that Mexico has lost control of the situation. The Union-Tribune reported that Mexican federal police, dressed in riot gear, prevented the caravan from getting closer to the U.S.\n\nCarlos Lopez, a Honduran leading the small group, told the paper that the conditions in Mexico are dire. He stated that there are sick children and women, and that the migrants are forced to remain outside in the elements. Those already in Tijuana have resorted to camping out in tents, sleeping on dirt fields, or under bleachers, or are staying in overcrowded shelters as they wait to determine their next steps.\n\n\"The whole world is watching what is happening here,\" Lopez said.\n\nThe larger caravan, which contains about 6,219 Central Americans, is currently in Mexico. The federal government estimates the number of migrants could grow to 10,000 in the coming weeks or months. President Trump has labeled the caravan a national security threat and has stated that it will not enter the U.S.\n\nOn Monday, a judge barred President Trump from enforcing a ban on asylum for those who cross the U.S. border illegally \u2013 a decision the administration said would cause \" countless illegal aliens to pour into our country.\"\n\nThe migrants who have traveled for over a month can now see a bridge that separates them from the U.S.\n\nSpeaking to reporters while in Florida for the holiday, Trump threatened to close the U.S. border with Mexico for an undisclosed period of time if his administration determines that its southern ally has lost \"control\" on its side. Trump also said he has given the thousands of active-duty troops he sent to the border before the Nov. 6 midterm elections the \"OK\" to use lethal force against migrants \"if they have to.\" He added that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, whom he has faulted for not being tough enough on immigration, is \"in there trying.\"",
    " Title: \"The Redeeming Power of Christmas: The Extraordinary Life of John Newton, Author of 'Amazing Grace' \"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of the bustling cities, the silence that has fallen upon malls and main streets during the holiday season serves as a stark reminder of the tranquility that the Christ child born in a manger 2,000 years ago brought to the world. This peace, this redemption, is vividly illustrated in the incredible life of John Newton, an English slaver who was born 300 years ago.\n\nBorn into a seafaring family in Liverpool, Newton's mother, a godly woman, instilled in him a sense of faith that would remain with him throughout his life, even as he strayed far from the path of righteousness. After his mother's death when he was just 7 years old, Newton's life took a dark turn. He was involved in the slave trade, a life that he himself described as \"big with mischief.\"\n\nHis life at sea was marked by hardship, cruelty, and near-death experiences. He was flogged, left for dead on an African island, and endured years of captivity and abuse. Yet, it was during these darkest moments that Newton's faith, though battered and bruised, remained a beacon of hope.\n\nIt was not until he was rescued and returned to London that Newton encountered the preaching of George Whitefield and the influence of John Wesley. It was then that he was born again, finding solace and redemption in the Gospel.\n\nBefore his death at the age of 82, just days before Christmas in 1807, Newton penned the words that would become the most beloved hymn of Christendom: \"Amazing Grace.\" A testament to the mercy and grace of God, Newton's hymn continues to resonate with people around the world, a reminder of the transformative power of faith and the redemption that can be found even in the darkest of times.\n\nWesley Pruden, editor in chief emeritus of The \u2588\u2588\u2588, reflects on the life of this remarkable man, \"The wanton sinner, the arrogant blasphemer, the mocker of the faith of others was at last driven to his knees. His prayer was like the cry of ravens, which yet the Lord does not disdain to hear.\" Indeed, the story of John Newton serves as a powerful reminder of the transformative power of faith and the redemption that can be found in the Christmas message.",

Scaramucci, a New York financier who joined the Trump administration's press team amid a West Wing shake-up, announced his intention to delete old tweets on Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"Full transparency: I\u2019m deleting old tweets. Past views evolved and shouldn\u2019t be a distraction. I serve @POTUS agenda and that\u2019s all that matters,\" Mr. Scaramucci tweeted.\n\nAs of yet, Mr. Scaramucci has not disclosed which specific tweets will be removed. However, a few tweets from 2012, including ones advocating for \"common sense\" gun laws and complimenting Hillary Clinton, Trump's former campaign rival, were no longer available within hours of his announcement.\n\nOn August 6, 2012, Mr. Scaramucci tweeted, \"We (the USA) has 5% of the world's population but 50% of the world's guns. Enough is enough. It is just common sense it apply more controls.\" He also said, \"I hope she runs, she is incredibly competent,\" of Clinton four months earlier, roughly three years before Trump entered the 2016 race.\n\nAnother tweet, dated March 11, 2016, stated, \"It's possible to combat climate change without crippling the economy. The fact many people still believe [climate change] is a hoax is disheartening.\" This tweet, too, has since been deleted.\n\nScaramucci was named White House Communications Director early Friday, filling a role that has been vacant since Mike Dubke's departure in May. Sean Spicer resigned as spokesman Friday \"to give the President and the new team a clean slate,\" he told CNN.\n\nIn the past, Scaramucci has spoken critically of Trump, but he acknowledged Friday that the president was aware of his earlier remarks. \"One of the biggest mistakes I made, because I was an inexperienced person in the world of politics. I was supporting another candidate. I should have never said that about him,\" Mr. Scaramucci said of his previous comments.\n\n\"I love the president and I\u2019m very, very loyal to the president.

Tony Evers (D). Evers extended the order this week until May 26.\n\n\"They're going to shut down the Capitol. Shh. Don't tell anybody,\" Moore said of those protesting the order. \"This is a great time for civil disobedience. We need to be the Rosa Parks here and protest against these government injustices,\" he added later.\n\nMoore made similar comments in an interview with The Washington Post published Friday. \"I think there's a boiling point that has been reached and exceeded,\" he told the newspaper. \"I call these people the modern-day Rosa Parks\u2014they are protesting against injustice and a loss of liberties.\"\n\nThe remarks drew pushback from some on social media, with Democratic congressional candidate Scott Huffman from North Carolina tweeting, \"Could you have imagined the outcome if Rosa brought a gun to the bus?\" Conservative commentator Bill Kristol called the remark \"at once strikingly stupid and deeply offensive.\"\n\nDuring an interview on CBS News on Friday, Moore maintained that the Trump administration has waited too long to reopen the economy. \"I think actually think we should have started this a week or two ago,\" Moore said. \"I think we lean way too much in the direction of keeping the economy shut down to try to save every life, not realizing that we're causing huge hardship for citizens\u2014again, people at the bottom and businesses\u2014and we're going to suffer a big loss of living standards because of this.\"\n\nProtesters against their states' stay-at-home orders took to the streets in several states this week, with plans for a \"Freedom Rally\" announced for April 24 in Wisconsin after the governor extended his state's stay-at-home order this week. In the YouTube video, Moore said he had been in talks with the protest organizers and noted that an unnamed donor had pledged to \"pay the bail and legal fees\" for anyone who gets arrested during the rally.\n\n\"We're going to see a lot more of [the protests],\" Moore said. \"So this is a great time, gentleman and ladies, for civil disobedience.\"\n\nMany health experts and state leaders, such as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), have repeatedly stressed that more widespread testing is needed before the country can reopen safely. Moore's plan to support the protests comes after Trump on Thursday rolled out a three-phase strategy to reopen parts of the country. However, Trump took to Twitter on Friday, issuing a series of tweets calling to \"LIBERATE\" Minnesota, Michigan, and Virginia, all states that are currently under stay-at-home orders with Democratic governors.",

In an interview with NPR's MORNING EDITION, Herring stated that he believes the anti-gay marriage law violates the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He also pointed to another Virginia law that once limited marriage, in that case multi-racial marriage, which the U.S. Supreme Court struck down.\n\n\"The court did not say that there was a right to interracial marriage. It said that everyone, all individuals have the right to marry. And all individuals means all individuals,\" said Herring.\n\nBackers of the prohibition on gay marriage see it differently. Kirk Cox, the Republican majority leader of the Virginia House of Delegates, stated that the attorney general has a constitutional and statutory obligation to enforce and defend the duly adopted laws and constitution of Virginia. Cox added that the attorney general's decision demonstrates a great deal of disrespect for that obligation, as well as the legislative and democratic processes for which those laws are adopted.\n\nVirginians had varying reactions to Herring's decision. Interviewed outside a diner in Crozet, near Charlottesville, Mary Linn was unhappy. \"I'm absolutely negative on that. Don't want it, because I'm a Christian and the Lord says that's a no-no. That's the reason. And what I try to do is to live my life according to the Bible,\" said Linn.\n\nRetiree Stan Gray stated that he is ambivalent on the issue of same-sex marriage. \"I consider myself not involved in that particular fight. It doesn't bother me one way or the other. I think there are a lot of good reasons for them to be allowed to get married. And there's a lot of history that says we're better off without it. But it doesn't bother me. I can accept either decision,\" said Gray.\n\nIn 2006, the referendum that banned same-sex marriage was approved by 57 percent of the state's voters. However, in keeping with national trends, a recent Quinnipiac poll showed 50 percent of Virginians surveyed now support allowing gays and lesbians to marry.\n\nDemocratic State Senator Adam Ebbin, who is the first openly gay member of the Virginia General Assembly, stated that he's glad his state is, in his view, coming around on the issue. \"We have a conflicting history of both being the birthplace of civil liberties and the Bill of Rights. And at the same time, being the state that resisted interracial marriage and integrating one of our colleges and desegregating our schools. So it's good to be proud of being a Virginian today,\" said Ebbin.\n\nHerring's decision not to defend Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage in court comes after several federal judges have overturned similar bans, including in Utah and Oklahoma. Pennsylvania's attorney general also refused to defend that state's ban, a case now making its way through the courts. In all, more than a dozen states have lawsuits challenging laws forbidding same-sex marriage. And in the end, it's likely to be an issue that's finally decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
    " Title: Cyber Attacks on Federal Agencies: A Growing Concern as Human Error and Espionage Threaten National Security\n\nArticle:\n\nThe number of cyber attacks on government systems has seen a significant increase, with a 35 percent jump in the past three years, according to a CNN review of cyber attacks against federal agencies. This alarming trend has been highlighted by experts who warn that espionage is happening at a rate never seen before.\n\nIn 2014, there were almost 61,000 cyber attacks and security breaches across the entire federal government, according to a recent Obama administration report. This number represents a 35 percent increase from 2010, where the number of cyber incidents involving government agencies was roughly 34,000, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office.\n\nThe threat is not limited to government secrets; personal information accessible through government computer systems is also at risk. Last July, hackers hit the Energy Department and took personally identifiable information from over 100,000 people, according to a post-mortem report by the department's inspector general. The data included names, dates and places of birth, social security and bank account numbers, and information about their education and disabilities. The hack cost the government almost $4 million in credit monitoring fees and lost productivity.\n\nThe uptick in security breaches is not due to a lack of spending, experts say. In fact, the Obama administration report showed that federal government agencies spent $10 billion on information security. However, human error and a patchwork of different systems are the biggest culprits, with billions of dollars in security unable to stop an employee from clicking a malicious link.\n\n\"There is no patch for a stupid user,\" said Denise Zheng, a deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who once oversaw a government cyber warfare program.\n\nAnother troubling incident happened last January when hackers hit the Army Corps of Engineers and took sensitive information about the nation's 85,000 dams. That data included their location, condition, and potential for fatalities if the dams were to be breached, according to a report by Sen. Tom Coburn, the ranking Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee.\n\nExperts warn that the threat is global, with adversaries paid to try to get inside systems 24/7. \"We don't have a malware problem. We have an adversary problem,\" said Tony Cole, vice president of the cyber security firm FireEye.\n\nAs the number of cyber attacks continues to rise, experts call for a unified response to deter future attacks and hold those responsible accountable. \"We need to have a response whether it's an industry or a government response so that folks understand there is a penalty here,\" Zheng said. \"If they go unpunished, the message that sends is detrimental.\"",
    " Title: Justice Department Drops Case Against John Edwards, Will Not Pursue Retrial\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Justice Department has decided to drop its case against former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards, opting not to retry him on campaign finance charges. The decision comes shortly after a jury was unable to reach a verdict in the high-profile case.\n\nGovernment lawyers have requested Judge Catherine Eagles to dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning they will not attempt to re-establish the case. Approximately two weeks ago, a federal jury in Greensboro, North Carolina found John Edwards not guilty on one campaign finance charge. The jury was unable to reach a decision on five other counts that covered payments Edwards received from friends to support his pregnant mistress.\n\nSeveral jurors stated that they did not believe the government's central witness, Andrew Young, an aide who idolized Edwards and later grew disillusioned with him.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Department's Criminal Division issued a statement regarding the decision:\n\n\"We knew that this case \u2013 like all campaign finance cases \u2013 would be challenging. But it is our duty to bring hard cases when we believe that the facts and the law support charging a candidate for high office with a crime. Last month, the government put forward its best case against Mr. Edwards, and I am proud of the skilled and professional way in which our prosecutors from the Criminal Division's Public Integrity Section and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina conducted this trial. The jurors could not reach a unanimous verdict on five of the six counts of the indictment, however, and we respect their judgment. In the interest of justice, we have decided not to retry Mr. Edwards on those counts.\"\n\nEdwards' lawyers released a statement, which reads in part:\n\n\"While John has repeatedly admitted to his sins, he has also consistently asserted, as we demonstrated at the trial, that he did not violate any campaign law nor even imagined that any campaign laws could apply. We are confident that the outcome of any new trial would have been the same. We are very glad that, after living under this cloud for over three years, John and his family can have their lives back and enjoy the peace they deserve.\"",
    " Title: A Reflection on the State of Political Civility: Lessons from the Past and the Pursuit of a More Civil Discourse\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the passing of George H.W. Bush, the nation has been swept up in a wave of nostalgia for a time when politics were kinder and gentler. Some hope that Bush's legacy will usher in a new era of civil discourse, a respite from the often contentious and divisive political climate that currently dominates the landscape.\n\nRecently, a panel of scholars, moderated by a commentator from National Public Radio, discussed the decline in civility and mutual respect in public discourse. The panel, which included a representative from CNN, explored the reasons behind the high levels of negativity in political discourse and the impact it has on society.\n\nArthur Evans, from the National Institute for Civil Discourse, noted that negativity often makes it difficult for people with differing opinions to engage in meaningful dialogue, as it leaves little room for error. He explained that this, in turn, reinforces the idea that the only way to discuss issues is in an extreme manner.\n\nThe idea that politicians of the past may hold valuable lessons for us is a complex one. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, two of the most eminent politicians of their time, engaged in a highly contentious presidential campaign in 1800. Their mudslinging campaign left buckets of blood on the floor, as they accused each other of being everything from hermaphroditical to cowardly.\n\nDespite their bitter campaign, Adams and Jefferson were able to nurture a friendship that survived the election. This friendship, like that between Bush and Clinton, serves as a reminder that civility in politics is a worthy goal, but that bashing and negativity are often seen as necessary evils in the pursuit of victory.\n\nWinning the election is, after all, what politics is all about. Successful politicians understand the rough wisdom of Leo Durocher's famous quote, \"Nice guys finish last.\" The friendship between Adams and Jefferson, despite their contentious campaign, survived, and they were able to put their differences aside and work together in the years that followed.\n\nCivility in politics is a noble pursuit, but it is a difficult one. The stakes are high, and negativity and bashing are often seen as necessary tools in the pursuit of victory. The hope is that, in the spirit of George H.W. Bush, we can find a way to engage in civil discourse while still maintaining the competitive spirit that drives politics.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Apologizes for 'Deplorables' Comment, Stands Firm on Criticism of Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement released on Saturday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton expressed regret for her characterization of half of Donald Trump's supporters as \"deplorables\" during a fundraiser in New York on Friday.\n\nClinton stated, \"That's never a good idea. I regret saying 'half.' That was wrong.\" She went on to say, \"I won't stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign.\"\n\nClinton's initial remark sparked a quick response from the Trump campaign, with senior communications adviser Jason Miller stating, \"This was Clinton, as a defender of Washington's rigged system, telling the American public that she could care less about them.\"\n\nIn her statement, Clinton also criticized Trump for hiring a major advocate of the so-called \"alt-right\" movement to run his campaign and for giving a national platform to hateful views and voices. She added, \"It's deplorable that Trump has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia.\"\n\nThe former secretary of state also addressed the other \"basket\" of Trump supporters, describing them as people who feel that the government has let them down and are desperate for change.\n\nThe Trump campaign's response to Clinton's apology was swift, with campaign manager Kellyanne Conway urging Clinton to make amends and sparring with a Clinton aide on Twitter. Conway tweeted, \"Come to an event; talk to real people who are not donors.\"\n\nClinton's fundraiser on Friday night also featured a performance by singer Barbra Streisand, who performed a parody of her song \"Send in the Clowns\" as a critique of Trump.\n\nTrump responded to Clinton's apology on Saturday afternoon, stating, \"Isn't it disgraceful that Hillary Clinton makes the worst mistake of the political season and instead of owning up to this grotesque attack on American voters, she tries to turn it around with a pathetic rehash of the words and insults used in her failing campaign?\"",
    " Title: Washington's Budget Impasse: A Study in Juvenile Petulance and Contemptible Games\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the looming mandatory budget cuts set to take effect on March 1, the nation's capital is bracing for an impending crisis, reminiscent of an asteroid hurtling towards Earth. The Defense Department, first responders, and the National Park Service are among the entities warning that their respective sectors will face drastic cuts, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences.\n\nHowever, the question arises: When did the preservation of nature become contingent on federal funding? The Grand Canyon, for instance, may cease to be a natural wonder if the National Park Service experiences a slight reduction in funding. Yet, it is essential to step back and question the indispensability of man to nature, rather than focusing on the potential perils of nature without federal funding.\n\nThe current budget standoff is a conflict of interest, as one would expect no public servant to admit that their work is less vital to the nation. The federal government, in its self-proclaimed importance, is holding the American people hostage with their own money, threatening to withhold essential services if their demands are not met.\n\nWashington's behavior is akin to a tantrum, a study in juvenile petulance. The American people have learned to do with less in the past six years, enduring higher taxes, increased fuel costs, job losses, smaller paychecks, shrinking homes, and failed businesses. Yet, the federal government, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, has grown its budget by $1.7 trillion over the past decade.\n\nWashington now boasts the third-largest concentration of high-income households in the United States, surpassing Silicon Valley in average income less than a year ago. The city's elites are known for their extravagant lifestyles, with frequent golf vacations, ski trips, and high-end dining experiences. During his tenure at Citigroup, the current Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew, received a nearly $1 million bonus before the company accepted a taxpayer-funded bailout.\n\nIn such a context, a true leader, a president, would call for government austerity measures, asking the government to tighten its belt by 2%, mirroring the sacrifices made by American citizens. Instead, President Barack Obama directs his lieutenants to issue threats against the very people who pay their salaries. If Congress does not expand the instruments of redistribution deemed necessary by the president, he warns of harsh, arbitrary cuts that would devastate education, energy, and medical research, slow the recovery, and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nThis budget impasse, with its threats and contemptible games, is a stark reminder of the need for leadership and a return to serving the American people. The American people should demand a president who leads by example, who asks the government to tighten its belt and make these cuts as painless as possible, rather than engaging in a dangerous game of political brinkmanship.",
    " Title: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry Declares ISIS's Actions Against Minorities as Genocide\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declared today that the Islamic State (ISIS) is responsible for committing genocide against Christians, Yazidis, and Shia Muslims. This announcement was made on the same day that a congressional deadline urging the Obama administration to make its own judgement was set to expire.\n\nEarlier this week, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a resolution 393-0, stating that the actions taken by ISIS against religious and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria constitute genocide.\n\nSpeaking from the State Department briefing room, Kerry stated, \"Da'esh is genocidal by self-proclamation, by ideology, and by actions in what it says, what it believes, and what it does.\"\n\nThe U.S. military intervened in Iraq in August of 2014 to halt the ISIS massacre of the Yazidis, an ancient ethnic minority living in the Sinjar area. This intervention led to the formation of an anti-ISIS coalition and the ongoing military effort. ISIS, primarily composed of Sunni Muslims, has targeted Shia Muslims, a group it labels as disbelievers.\n\nKerry further elaborated, \"One element of genocide is the intent to destroy an ethnic or religious group in whole or in part.\" He added, \"Da'esh kills Christians because they are Christians, the Yazidis because they are Yazidis, [and] Shia because they are Shia.\"\n\nThe impact of this declaration remains uncertain. While there are legal definitions associated with the term, there are no legal obligations to enforce a response. The last time a U.S. administration declared genocide during an ongoing conflict was in 2004 when Colin Powell determined it applied to the actions of the Sudanese government in Darfur. However, this did not compel the U.S. to act.\n\nSecretary Kerry did not indicate any policy shift in the ongoing U.S.-led effort to degrade and defeat ISIS.",
    " Title: Senator John McCain Urges Donald Trump to Apologize for Prisoner of War Remarks, Condemns Rift in Republican Party\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Senator John McCain of Arizona called on Donald J. Trump to make amends for his derogatory comments about prisoners of war, particularly those who were incarcerated during the Vietnam War. McCain, who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, expressed deep concern over the tone of the Republican presidential race and emphasized the need for Trump to express his appreciation for veterans.\n\nDuring the interview, McCain reiterated his support for Trump as the Republican nominee for president but expressed dismay at Trump's belittling remarks about prisoners of war. Last summer, Trump mocked McCain for having been captured and imprisoned during the Vietnam War, stating that he preferred \"people who weren't captured.\"\n\nMcCain, who was a prisoner of war for over five years, told CNN that he was personally unaffected by Trump's ridicule but that he could not abide the affront to veterans in general. When asked if he would appear on the campaign trail with Trump, McCain said \"a lot of things would have to happen\" first.\n\n\"I think it's important for Donald Trump to express his appreciation for veterans\u2014not John McCain, but veterans who were incarcerated as prisoners of war,\" McCain said. \"When he said, 'I don't like people who were captured,' then there's a body of American heroes that I'd like to see him retract that statement\u2014not about me, but about the others.\"\n\nMcCain's comments add to the already extraordinary pressure on Trump to mend his relationships across the Republican Party and win over a range of party leaders he has alienated in the 2016 campaign. One of McCain's closest friends in the Senate, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, has already announced that he will not vote for Trump under any circumstances.\n\nMcCain's comments also highlight the rift that has opened in the Republican Party, with many party leaders and members of Congress distancing themselves from Trump. The senator noted the personalization of the 2016 race, where \"people's integrity and character are questioned.\"\n\nNoting the divide between party leadership and voters in Trump's constituency, McCain said, \"There is some distance, if not a disconnect, between party leadership and members of Congress. And many of the voters who have selected Donald Trump to be the nominee of the party.\"\n\nThe senator's comments underscore the challenges facing the Republican Party as it attempts to unify ahead of the general election. The party's leaders will need to find a way to bridge the gap between themselves and the voters who have chosen Trump as their nominee, particularly older, white, blue-collar workers who see no job prospects.",
    " Title: Declining Importance of Religious Beliefs in U.S. Presidential Candidates: A Shift in American Voters' Priorities\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in American political landscape, the importance of a presidential candidate's religious beliefs is declining, according to a new study by the Pew Research Center. The study, released on Wednesday, reveals that two-thirds of Evangelicals are planning to vote for Donald Trump, while two-thirds of religiously unaffiliated individuals, often referred to as \"nones,\" are supporting Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe study shows a 10 percentage point drop in the number of Americans who want a president with strong religious beliefs, down to 62 percent from 2008. This trend is evident among both Republicans and Democrats, with an 8-point drop for the former and a 13-point drop for the latter.\n\nThe reasons for this decline differ for each side. For Republicans, Evangelicals are willing to support less-religious candidates to maintain political influence, while the growing \"nones\" of the Democratic Party are emphasizing secular morality over traditional religion.\n\nGreg Smith, co-author of the study, comments, \"For two election cycles now, we've seen a steady decline in the number of Americans who care if the president has strong beliefs. Maybe the attitudes of some religious groups are changing, but more so, the religious composition of the entire country is changing.\"\n\nEvangelicals, who often face the dilemma of choosing a purist candidate versus one with broader appeal, are making concessions to support Donald Trump, despite his lack of religiosity and past lifestyle. James Dobson, an evangelical leader, recently referred to Trump as a \"baby Christian,\" and religious leader Ralph Reed stated, \"We accept him for who he is now\" because he has shown a commitment to Christian ways.\n\nOn the Democratic side, the rise of the \"nones\" appears to be having an effect. In 2012, 25 percent of Americans claimed no religious preference, compared to 7 percent in the late 1980s. This shift could be due to the intense fusing of theological doctrine and politics among religious conservatives, suggesting that inactive liberals who used to identify with a religion may have quit doing so.\n\nMoreover, Democrats are increasingly viewing morality outside of religiousness. Bernie Sanders, who was among the strongest supporters of the \"nones\" in the primary, was drawn to his vision of a society that takes better care of all, from free college to healthcare to a higher minimum wage. Sanders was also seen as a plain speaker whom they could trust.\n\nHowever, \"nones\" have been slow to warm to Clinton's campaign, with concerns about her email misuse and connections to Wall Street. This indicates a focus on the moral character of their candidate, a desire for Clinton to present herself as well-motivated morally.\n\nIn conclusion, this election cycle is witnessing a curious situation in which Democrats appear to be more concerned about the morality of their candidate than Republicans. This shift in American voters' priorities could have significant implications for future elections.",
    " Title: Nine California Students Sue State Over Teacher Tenure and Seniority Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a landmark case set to go to trial on Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court, nine California public school students are challenging the state's laws on teacher tenure, seniority, and other protections that they argue keep underperforming educators in the classroom. The lawsuit, which is part of a growing nationwide effort to hold teachers more accountable for their work, is expected to conclude in March.\n\nThe case, sponsored by an educational reform group, is the latest battle in a contentious debate over union-backed protections for teachers. The nonjury trial will examine the alleged dysfunction and arbitrariness of the current system, which plaintiffs claim is due to outdated laws that restrict school administrators' ability to dismiss ineffective teachers.\n\n\"The system is dysfunctional and arbitrary due to these outdated laws that handcuff school administrators,\" said Theodore J. Boutrous, the lead attorney on the case.\n\nAcross the nation, states have been weakening teaching job protections, including tenure, to provide administrators with more flexibility to fire underperforming teachers. The changes come as states replace automatic \"satisfactory\" teacher evaluations with those linked to teacher performance and base teacher layoffs on performance instead of seniority.\n\nTeachers' unions argue that the changes lower morale, deny teachers due process, and unfairly target older teachers. They also claim that the evaluations are too dependent on standardized tests and that eliminating such protections erases a vital support system for a profession already losing talented individuals to higher-paying private sector positions.\n\nThe California Teachers Association and the California Federation of Teachers have intervened in the lawsuit, asking the court to dismiss the case filed against the state, including Governor Jerry Brown, Superintendent of Public Education Tom Torlakson, and the Department of Education.\n\n\"It is deceptive and dishonest to pretend that teacher due process rights are unfair to students,\" said California Federation of Teachers President Josh Pechthalt, the parent of a ninth-grade student in the Los Angeles Unified School District. \"Students need a stable, experienced teaching workforce. They won't have one if this lawsuit succeeds in gutting basic teacher rights.\"\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to declare unconstitutional five statutes within the state education code, including the one on tenure, three others that outline the steps to dismiss a teacher, and the fifth that mandates the last-hired, first-fired rule, which the lawsuit's attorneys say disadvantages young, talented teachers.\n\nThe plaintiffs are students primarily from the Los Angeles and Bay areas, supported by a nonprofit organization called Students Matter that fights for education equality. Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent John Deasy, who oversees the nation's second-largest school district, will be called to testify by the plaintiffs, Boutrous said.\n\nPlaintiff attorneys claim that teachers too often obtain tenure by simply showing up for work\u2014after about 18 months in California. After tenure, bad teachers are allegedly almost impossible or too expensive to fire, Boutrous said.\n\n\"The school system knowingly puts kids in classrooms with teachers who are grossly substandard,\" Boutrous said, adding that it was crucial to turn to the courts because \"the political system can't fix this.\"\n\nMany districts send substandard teachers to disadvantaged schools instead of dismissing them because those schools are seen as less desirable places to work by experienced teachers, who can have priority where they are assigned, Boutrous said.\n\nThe California teacher unions argue that they support improving teacher evaluations and streamlining the dismissal process. However, they contend that these changes should be the work of the Legislature, not the courts.\n\nLaura Lacar, a high school teacher in the ABC School District, fears the law could expand beyond what happens in the classroom. \"It would be very scary to me, if this lawsuit succeeds, to think that I might not have a job next year, not for anything I've done in the classroom, but because my principal didn't like me, or my clothing, or something I'd said,\" Lacar said.\n\nDeclaring the laws unconstitutional will allow the Legislature to craft legislation that works, the lawsuit's attorneys say. Karen Martinez, who lives in San Jose, said her daughter, Daniella, a plaintiff, reached the third grade unable to read before a teacher helped her. \"I'm hoping with all my heart that we win this case, so California can change a system that is clearly failing so many children,\" Martinez said. \"To me, it's common sense: appreciate and reward the teachers who are doing great, and hold accountable the teachers who are failing our kids.\"\n\nTerry Moe, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution who has researched teacher unions and their impact on public education, said there's a long way to go, even in states that have adopted new laws. \"Unions can make life difficult for administrators in coming years,\" Moe said. \"The political pressure on the ground is strong. It's going to be really difficult to follow through on these new laws and put a dent in teacher tenure and really do away with the role of seniority.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Praise for Confederate General Robert E. Lee and the Evolution of Presidential Admiration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent speech, former President Donald Trump praised Confederate General Robert E. Lee, echoing a sentiment that has been a part of his rhetoric since before his presidency. Trump's admiration for Lee, a divisive figure in American history, has been a recurring theme, particularly in his efforts to preserve Confederate statues and stoke cultural divisions.\n\nTrump's praise for Lee, however, is not a new phenomenon. Presidents, particularly in the 20th century, have often lauded Lee as a symbol of Southern honor, duty, and sacrifice, aiding sectional reconciliation. This trend can be traced back to President Woodrow Wilson, who, as a southerner, held a deep personal affection for Lee.\n\nWilson, who was 13 when Lee visited Augusta, Georgia, cherished the memory of standing by Lee's side as a young boy. After leaving the presidency, Wilson wrote a hagiographic portrait of Lee, portraying him as a \"national hero\" and a figure \"unapproachable in the history of our country.\"\n\nTrump's admiration for Lee, like Wilson's, is not without controversy. Critics argue that Trump's understanding of the Civil War is limited, with a tendency to downplay the role of slavery. However, the significance of Trump's continued praise for Lee lies in the evolution of presidential admiration for a figure whose cause, as General Ulysses S. Grant noted, was \"one of the worst for which a people ever fought, and one for which there was the least excuse.\"\n\nIn the 21st century, Trump's praise for Lee has been used to fuel cultural divisions, most notably during the violent protests against the removal of a Lee statue in Charlottesville in 2017. Trump's equivocations at a press conference following the protests, where he declared there were \"very fine people on both sides,\" have been widely criticized.\n\nAs the 2022 midterm elections approach, Trump's former Virginia campaign chair, Corey Stewart, has made defending Lee's statues a central theme of his Senate campaign. This has led to speculation about whether Trump might distance himself from praise for Lee, a move that would be unprecedented in modern American politics.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's continued praise for Robert E. Lee underscores the enduring significance of the Confederate general in American history and politics. The evolution of presidential admiration for Lee, from Woodrow Wilson to Donald Trump, highlights the complex and often problematic relationship between the nation's leaders and the legacy of the Civil War.",
    " Title: World Leaders Gather in Paris to Address Climate Change: Implications of 2-Degree and 4-Degree Temperature Increases\n\nArticle:\n\nWorld leaders are convening in Paris this month in a final attempt to mitigate the most devastating effects of climate change. Climatologists now warn that even the best-case scenario, assuming immediate and drastic emissions reductions, will result in a planetary temperature increase of at least 2 degrees Celsius in the coming decades.\n\nThis seemingly small temperature rise has significant consequences. Rising temperatures will destroy plant and animal habitats and reduce yields of essential food crops. More people will be exposed to the devastation of floods and droughts.\n\nHowever, if the nations involved in the Paris talks fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, temperatures could increase by almost 6 degrees Celsius this century, according to the Committee on Climate Change, an independent advisory body to the U.K. government on climate issues.\n\nThe effects of a warming planet are already being felt in Alaska, which is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the U.S. Rising temperatures have thawed permafrost in some areas, leaving coastlines vulnerable to storms and tidal activity. Shishmaref, a remote village located 30 miles outside the Arctic Circle, is losing as much as 9 feet of land per year\u2014sections of coastline that simply erode into the sea.\n\nPlant and animal habitats face a dire threat from a warming climate. An increase of 4 degrees Celsius in average planetary temperatures could result in severe habitat loss for almost two-thirds of plant species and one-third of mammal species.\n\nCrop yields are also at risk. A 2-degree increase could result in a 60% reduction in maize and spring wheat yields, while a 4-degree increase could lead to a 40% reduction. Similarly, species losing at least half their habitat could include 60% of plant species and 40% of mammal species.\n\nMore people will be exposed to the threats caused by a warming planet, even if nations meeting in Paris curtail carbon emissions. Vulnerable populations living near water or in arid regions will face significant disruptions to their way of life as flooding and severe drought become more common.\n\nBy 2050, an estimated 2 million to 13 million people each year will be exposed to coastal flooding, roughly equivalent to the population of New Orleans and southern Louisiana. River flooding could affect about 130 million to 250 million people each year, encompassing the entire South and part of the Northeast in the U.S., as well as the entire East and Midwest. Water stress could impact 1.5 billion to 2 billion people each year, affecting almost five times the U.S. population, or six times the U.S. population if protections do not evolve.\n\nHuman activity since the industrial revolution has led to a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions, a greenhouse gas contributing to rising global temperatures. If carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at their current rates, Earth's temperatures could increase dramatically in future decades, leading to catastrophic and irreversible climate change. The 10 largest emitters produced about 26.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide in 2013.\n\nCountries responsible for two-thirds of global emissions have made commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas production. China, the world's largest carbon producer, has pledged to peak its carbon emissions by 2030. The United States, the second-largest emitter, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28% relative to 2005 levels by 2025. The European Union aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% relative to 1990 levels by 2030.\n\nThe race is on to mitigate the worst effects of climate change. The choices made in the coming years will determine the fate of countless species and the livelihoods of millions of people worldwide.",
    " Title: IRS Acknowledges Inappropriate Targeting of Conservative Groups During 2012 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) admitted on Friday that it inappropriately flagged conservative groups for additional review during the 2012 election to determine if they were violating their tax-exempt status. The acknowledgment came from Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups, at a conference sponsored by the American Bar Association.\n\nLerner confirmed that organizations were singled out because they included the words \"tea party\" or \"patriot\" in their applications for tax-exempt status. She stated that some groups were asked for their list of donors, a practice she described as \"wrong, incorrect, insensitive, and inappropriate.\"\n\nJenny Beth Martin, national coordinator for Tea Party Patriots, called the IRS's actions \"disturbing, illegal, and outrageous abuse of government power.\" Republican lawmakers, who had previously complained about the suspected harassment, seized on the acknowledgment. Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell called for a \"government-wide review\" to ensure \"these thuggish practices\" are not in use elsewhere. House Republican Leader Eric Cantor later stated that the House would investigate.\n\nThe IRS, in a hastily arranged conference call following the conference, attempted to offer a fuller explanation of what happened. The IRS stated that protocol was changed at the Cincinnati office in response to the rising number of applications for 501(c)(4) groups. This classification grants tax-exempt status to social welfare groups. The agents tried to \"centralize work\" in response to the applications, leading to problems the agency claims have since been fixed.\n\nLerner acknowledged that some of the letters sent were \"far too broad\" and that asking for donors is \"generally not what we do.\" She stated that mistakes were made, and some people did not use good judgment, while claiming the reviews were not partisan.\n\nDuring the election, numerous conservative groups complained that they were being harassed by the IRS. They accused the agency of frustrating their attempts to become tax-exempt by sending them lengthy, intrusive questionnaires. The forms, which the groups made available at the time, sought information about group members' political activities, including details of their postings on social networking websites and about family members.\n\nIn all, about 300 groups were singled out for additional review, Lerner said. Of those, about a quarter were singled out because they had \"tea party\" or \"patriot\" somewhere in their applications. Lerner stated that 150 of the cases have been closed, and no group had its tax-exempt status revoked, though some withdrew their applications.\n\nAs the news unfolded, reactions were swift and harsh. Many conservative groups condemned the IRS for the additional scrutiny, while IRS officials offered apologies and stated that they have since fixed the situation. The IRS's inspector general is currently investigating the matter.",
    " Title: McCarthy Advocates Senate Approval for Any Future Nuclear Deals, Citing Iran Agreement as Precedent\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with MSNBC, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested that any potential deal with North Korea regarding its nuclear program should be submitted to the Senate for approval as a treaty. McCarthy argued that this approach would ensure the deal's longevity and counter concerns about the uncertainty it may create in international negotiations.\n\nThe California Republican criticized the Obama administration's handling of the Iran nuclear deal, which was not treated as a treaty but rather an executive agreement. This, according to McCarthy, made it easier for President Trump to withdraw the U.S. from the deal earlier this year.\n\nMcCarthy emphasized the durability of treaties, stating, \"The one thing I have found, if it's going to be long-standing, I think treaties are longer standing and supportive from administration to administration.\"\n\nThe House Majority Leader also disputed the notion that the U.S.'s withdrawal from the Iran agreement has complicated negotiations with North Korea. He argued that it would be illogical to negotiate with North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program while allowing Iran to develop its own weapons in the future.\n\nMcCarthy compared President Trump's approach to that of President Reagan in dealing with the Soviet Union. According to McCarthy, Trump is willing to engage in negotiations when they are productive, but is also prepared to walk away when they deviate from the desired outcome, a strategy he believes was effective in the case of the Iran nuclear deal.",
    " Title: IRS Commissioner Defends Actions Amidst GOP Criticism in Congressional Hearing\n\nActing IRS Commissioner Steven Miller faced a grilling from Republican lawmakers on Friday during a congressional hearing, as they accused the agency of systemic abuse in targeting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status.\n\nIn the first hearing investigating the IRS's controversial practice, Miller apologized for the \"foolish mistakes\" made by employees trying to streamline their workload selection process. However, he strongly refuted Republican claims that the agency is politicized and maintained that the practice of flagging key terms in applications for tax-exemptions is legal.\n\nMiller also defended a civil servant under heavy GOP criticism for working in the agency's scandal-ridden tax-exempt division before helping implement the health care overhaul. He insisted that he did not mislead Congress, stating that he answered questions as they were asked, despite not disclosing the targeting program in response to repeated inquiries from Republican lawmakers.\n\nThe four-hour hearing left Republicans dissatisfied and eager for more information. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) expressed that Miller's answers were \"not very complete,\" and stated that the investigation would continue.\n\nMiller stepped down as IRS Commissioner on Wednesday at the request of Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. President Barack Obama announced on Thursday that Daniel Werfel, the current controller of the Office of Management and Budget, would succeed Miller as acting IRS commissioner next week.\n\nTwo things became clear during the hearing: the IRS did not inadvertently announce the targeting program last year, and Republicans are determined to broaden the scope of their investigation.\n\nMiller indicated that agency officials had discussed how to address the controversial targeting program before Lois Lerner, the director of the agency's tax-exempt division, was scheduled to appear at an American Bar Association conference on May 10. Her comments revealing the agency's targeting of groups using terms like \"tea party\" or \"patriot\" sparked a week-long controversy.\n\nRepublicans are also expanding their investigation to include other IRS actions that have long been a source of frustration for conservatives, such as the disclosure of confidential donor information for the National Organization for Marriage and the leak of applications conservative groups submitted for tax-exempt status.\n\nMiller maintained the agency's stance that no one at the IRS informed the White House of its activities.\n\nMiller's testimony did little to quell the Republican outrage that has persisted throughout the week.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that Miller called Lois Lerner a \"superb civil servant.\" Those comments referred to another IRS employee.",
    " Title: Obama's Middle East Visit: Focus on Peace, Security, and Youth Engagement\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Barack Obama embarks on a week-long tour of the Middle East, his first visit to Israel since assuming office, the White House has downplayed expectations, emphasizing the president's aim to foster cooperation among regional leaders towards peace and democracy.\n\nThe President's journey commences in Jerusalem on Wednesday, where he will endeavor to strengthen his relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, following the latter's recent re-election and the formation of a new Israeli government. The coalition government, established on Friday, includes centrist Yesh Atid and pro-settler Jewish Home parties, marking the first exclusion of ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties in a decade.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney stated on Saturday that President Obama looks forward to working closely with the prime minister and the new government to address the region's challenges and advance shared interests in peace and security. Key issues include ongoing peace negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders and the effort to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\nThe White House's strategy appears to be one of lowered expectations, creating space for open and honest peace talks between both sides, potentially including discussions on the conditions necessary to return to the negotiating table. Josh Earnest, the White House deputy press secretary, confirmed on Friday that the administration remains willing to play a facilitating role.\n\nHowever, Earnest noted that face-to-face talks may prove difficult if leaders continue with unilateral actions, such as Israeli settlement construction in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.\n\nIn addressing the Iran issue, Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, stated that the president has been clear: he prefers a peaceful resolution but has established a \"red line\" \u2013 no nuclear weapons for Iran. Netanyahu has questioned Obama's commitment to containing Iran's nuclear ambitions, including military action, and has publicly expressed support for Republican challenger Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential campaign.\n\nThe centerpiece of Obama's visit will be a speech in Jerusalem to an audience primarily of Israeli students, part of the president's effort to engage with the Israeli public, particularly young people. Cultural stops include the Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem, the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, and an Iron Dome battery, a component of the missile defense system for which the U.S. has provided funding.\n\nIn the West Bank, Obama will meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad in Ramallah. The president and Fayyad will visit a Palestinian youth center, another attempt to reach the region's young people.\n\nObama will make a 24-hour stop in Jordan, a vital U.S. ally, where the president's focus will be on the ongoing violence in neighboring Syria. Over 450,000 Syrians have sought refuge in Jordan, straining refugee camps and aid organizations.\n\nFor much of Obama's first term, White House officials saw little reason for the president to visit the region without a realistic chance for a peace accord between Israelis and Palestinians. However, with the president's one attempt at a U.S.-brokered deal thwarted in his first term and the two sides now more divided, the White House has revised its approach.\n\nBeyond Mideast peace, Netanyahu and Obama share similar regional objectives, including ending the violence in Syria and managing the political instability in Egypt, which has a long-standing peace treaty with Israel.\n\nObama's visit to Israel may quell criticism in the U.S. that his failure to travel there during his first term indicated a lack of support for the Jewish state compared to his predecessors. Republican lawmakers frequently leveled this criticism during the 2012 presidential campaign, despite Republican President George W. Bush not visiting Israel until his final year in office.\n\nIn his talks with Jordan's King Abdullah, Obama will also aim to bolster the country's efforts to liberalize its government and counter an Arab Spring-style movement similar to those that have toppled leaders elsewhere in the region.\n\nThe president's final stop will be at Petra, Jordan's ancient city.",
    " Title: U.S. House Judiciary Committee Delays Vote on Impeachment Articles, Citing Transparency\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has delayed a late-night vote on impeachment articles against President Donald Trump, with the committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, announcing a Friday vote at 10 a.m. ET (1500 GMT). The unexpected move has caused a rescheduling headache for Republican leaders and sparked criticism from both parties.\n\nThe committee, which had been expected to approve two articles of impeachment late on Thursday, is now set to make Trump the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. The Democratic-controlled House is expected to vote next week on the impeachment articles, a move that could lead to Trump's trial in the Senate.\n\nThe delay in the vote has been attributed to a desire for transparency, with House Judiciary Democrat Mary Gay Scanlon stating, \"The American people deserve to see the vote.\"\n\nThe extended hearing, which lasted over 14 hours, was marked by a series of amendments proposed by Republicans, led by Doug Collins, the top Republican on the panel. These amendments, which had no hope of passage, led to hours of debate and discussion on a range of topics, from natural gas drilling to the state of the economy.\n\nThe delay and the prolonged hearing have caused frustration among both parties. Republican leaders, who had planned to travel home on Friday, now face schedule changes, while Democrats, who had expected to wrap up the hearing early in the evening, are criticized for the extended meeting.\n\nIf the House impeaches Trump, who is charged with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, he would then go on trial in the Senate. The Republican-led chamber is unlikely to vote to find the president guilty and remove him from office.",
    " Title: Alabama Senate Race: Jones and Moore's Electoral Strategy and the Impact of Write-in Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Alabama Senate race heats up, both candidates, Doug Jones and Roy Moore, are focusing on their respective voter bases to secure a victory. For Jones, energizing the African-American community is crucial, while Moore is relying on his longtime base of rural white voters.\n\nIf rural white voters decide to stay home due to the sexual misconduct allegations, it could significantly complicate the Republican's electoral math. These small-population counties, stretching across the state's northern tier and just above the Gulf Coast, are expected to report early. Moore's performance in these counties will be a significant indicator of his ability to withstand Jones' expected success in Alabama's cities, which typically report later.\n\nIf Moore manages to achieve the marks he reached in his Republican runoff victory in September, with over 60% in several rural counties, he is likely to claim victory. However, if write-in candidates perform well, it might not be necessary for a candidate to secure 50% of the vote to claim victory.\n\nIn Alabama, it is challenging for a Democrat to capture over 50% of the vote. However, Jones may not need a majority to win Tuesday. Senator Richard C. Shelby, a Republican and the state's longest-serving lawmaker, used a national television interview Sunday to remind Alabamians that he had written in the name of another Republican rather than supporting Moore. His example could encourage others in the party to do the same.\n\nThere are two notable write-in candidates. Lee Busby, a Republican and a retired Marine colonel from Tuscaloosa, has announced a write-in bid. Additionally, a significant number of votes are expected to go to Nick Saban, the University of Alabama football coach, who is widely considered one of the most important figures in the state.\n\nThe more Republicans or independents who write in the name of a third candidate, the lower the threshold Jones needs to reach. Depending on the number of write-ins, he could potentially win even if he only captures 48% of the vote. The Alabama Senate race is shaping up to be a closely watched contest, with the outcome likely to hinge on voter turnout and the impact of write-in candidates.",
    " Title: Republican Presidential Race: Trump Accuses Establishment of Exploiting Country as GOP Rivals Plot Against Him\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange with Sean Hannity during a special town hall event on Wednesday, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump accused GOP lawmakers opposed to his campaign of exploiting the country. The billionaire businessman's comments come as a growing movement among the party establishment, including some of his former rivals, seeks to slow down Trump's march to the Republican convention.\n\nTrump's remarks were in response to a conference held by the conservative American Enterprise Institute at Sea Island off the coast of Georgia over the weekend, where one of the topics reportedly discussed was stopping Trump from securing the Republican nomination. The conference was attended by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and other key Republican congressmen.\n\n\"I know all these people,\" Trump told Hannity. \"These are people that are taking advantage of our country. They don't want to have strong borders. They want stuff flowing across the borders. They don't want to have taxation when countries treat us unfairly because they benefit from that.\"\n\nTrump also accused politicians of prioritizing the interests of their donors over the country's needs. \"Politicians will do what's right for the people that gave them the money, not what's right for the country,\" Trump added later in the interview.\n\nFormer GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush is also reportedly meeting with Trump's rivals on Thursday ahead of a GOP debate in Florida, fueling speculation that he may be preparing to endorse a candidate challenging Trump. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, meanwhile, has denied reports that he is considering dropping out of the race before next week's Florida primary.\n\nRubio told Megyn Kelly of Fox News that he has never discussed dropping out with anyone on his team or anyone else. \"I'm the only one who can beat Donald Trump in Florida,\" Rubio said. A poll released Wednesday showed Rubio trailing Trump by 23 percentage points among likely Republican voters in Florida.\n\nRubio also dismissed the possibility of forming a so-called \"unity\" Republican ticket with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump's closest challenger in the delegate race. \"At some point we're all going to be on the same team,\" Rubio said. \"We're all going to be on the same team, I hope.\"\n\nCruz, for his part, walked back his earlier opposition to a possible convention fight between himself and Trump if neither man reaches the required 1,237 delegates during the primaries. \"Look, Reagan and President Gerald Ford battled it out at a contested convention [in 1976],\" Cruz said. \"That's what conventions are for.\" However, Cruz restated his opposition to a so-called brokered convention, calling it \"a fever dream of the D.C. establishment\" and warning of \"an open revolt\" among Republican voters if it came to pass.\n\nCruz also took aim at Trump and Rubio over immigration reform and the so-called \"Gang of Eight\" bill in 2013. \"When Marco Rubio stood with Barack Obama and [Sen.] Chuck Schumer and [then-Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid... I stood with millions of Americans,\" Cruz told Kelly. \"Not only was Donald Trump nowhere to be found, he was funding the Gang of Eight. He gave $50,000 to five of its members.\"\n\nCruz also accused Rubio of lowering the tone of the campaign, saying, \"I have no views whatsoever on any part of Donald Trump's anatomy.\" Rubio, for his part, told Kelly that he regretted a remark he made about Trump's hands during a campaign stop in Virginia.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich, who has staked his campaign's future on victory in next Tuesday's Ohio primary, told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren that he would \"probably not\" pick up enough delegates in other contests to overtake Trump, but noted that voters had only \"picked about half the delegates [so far] this year... anything is possible.\" A poll released Wednesday showed Kasich leading Trump by five percentage points among likely Republican voters in the Buckeye State.\n\n\"We're going to win Ohio,\" Kasich told Van Susteren. \"That's not even a question for me. It's about what we do after that and all the places we have to go. But we're not taking it for granted.\"\n\nThe Republican race remains tight, with Trump leading Cruz by 99 delegates following Tuesday's contests. Cruz has 359 delegates, while Trump has 458. Rubio is a distant third with 151 delegates, and Kasich has 54. The next primary is in Florida on Tuesday, March 15.",
    " Title: Boston Marathon Bombing Suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Pleads Not Guilty to 30 Charges\n\nA federal court in Boston saw the first public appearance of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the main suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing, since his arrest on April 19. Tsarnaev, 19, pleaded not guilty to 30 charges stemming from the bombing, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nTsarnaev, who appeared disheveled and fidgety, entered the courtroom wearing a partially unbuttoned orange jumpsuit and a black t-shirt. He looked over his right shoulder several times, displaying a crooked smile to two sisters in Muslim garb seated in the courtroom. The arraignment was his first public appearance since his arrest.\n\nJudge Marianne Bowler presided over the hearing, with 30 victims of the bombing and their family members present. Tsarnaev's public defender, Judy Clarke, attempted to enter a single \"not guilty\" plea on Tsarnaev's behalf for all counts in the indictment. However, Bowler asked that Tsarnaev speak for himself and that all the charges be read aloud.\n\nFlanked by his two attorneys, Tsarnaev repeated the words \"not guilty\" seven times as prosecutors read the charges against him. Each of the 30 counts could bring a life-in-prison sentence, with 17 being eligible for the death penalty if the government decides to seek capital punishment.\n\nTsarnaev's brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed in a shootout with police following a massive manhunt three days after the bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured the next day, wounded and bloodied from the shootout, after a Watertown homeowner noticed blood on his dry-docked boat. Police found the suspect hiding inside.\n\nAuthorities say the brothers were inspired by al-Qaeda publications and that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev left a confession in the boat justifying the bombings as payback for U.S. military action in Muslim countries. He wrote that the U.S. government was \"killing our innocent civilians.\"\n\n\"I don't like killing innocent people,\" he said, but also wrote, \"I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished... We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.\"\n\nTsarnaev's arrest stunned those who knew him as a likable high school athlete in Cambridge, Mass., where he lived with his older brother after his parents left for Russia. The indictment also said that, sometime before the bombings, Tsarnaev downloaded Internet material from Islamic extremists that advocated violence against the perceived enemies of Islam.\n\nThree people\u2014Martin Richard, 8, Krystle Marie Campbell, 29, and Lingzi Lu, 23\u2014were killed by the bombs, which were improvised from pressure cookers. Authorities say the Tsarnaevs also killed Massachusetts Institute of Technology officer Sean Collier days later while they were on the run.",
    " Title: House Democrats Prepare for Potential Showdown with Trump Administration as New Majority Takes Office\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the new Democratic majority takes office, House Democrats are gearing up for a potential confrontation with the Trump administration, with a list of at least 85 potential investigation and subpoena targets compiled by Representative Zach Basu. The incoming House Intelligence chairman, Adam Schiff, has indicated that the president is expected to resist the committees' requests, leading to potential legal battles that could reach the Supreme Court.\n\nThe power struggle between the presidency, Congress, and the Supreme Court will be tested in the coming months, as top Democrats plan to explore possible grounds for impeachment, with a public report by Robert Mueller serving as a catalyst. Tom Steyer, a liberal activist who spent over $100 million during the campaign to build support for impeachment, has stated that establishment leaders who are delaying impeachment discussions are the \"outliers.\"\n\nTwo of the most powerful incoming chairs, Adam Schiff and Nita Lowey, have outlined their plans for investigations that extend beyond Russian interference in the 2016 elections. Schiff, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, aims to release transcripts of interviews conducted during the committee's own Russia probe, which contain possible contradictions with other testimony and facts, potentially placing witnesses in legal jeopardy.\n\nSchiff stated, \"I want to make sure that Bob Mueller has the advantage of the evidence that we've been able to gather. But equally important: that Bob Mueller is in a position to determine whether people knowingly committed perjury before our committee.\" Real questions about contradictions between the testimony of Roger Stone, a close ally of the Trump campaign, and emails that have surfaced since then, have been raised by Schiff.\n\nSchiff also expressed a desire to investigate potential leverage the Russians may have over the president. \"We're going to want to look at what leverage the Russians may have over the president of the United States,\" he said.\n\nIncoming House Appropriations Chair Nita Lowey of New York has also signaled her readiness for investigations, including probes of James Comey's firing, Attorney General Jeff Sessions' ouster, the Muslim travel ban, family separation policy at the border, discussions of classified information at Mar-a-Lago, administration dealings with North Korea and Saudi Arabia, and more.\n\nTrump has already signaled confrontation, stating at his post-election news conference that if Democrats investigate him, the result will be \"a warlike posture.\" When asked if he would investigate the Democrats, Trump replied, \"Oh, yeah. Better than them.\"\n\nFor 225+ years, federal courts have upheld the Constitution's mandate of Congress as an equal branch of government, providing checks and balances on the executive. As House Democrats assume power, they have a high hand in enforcing these checks and balances.",
    " Title: GOP Candidates Tap into Narrative of Victimhood Among Social Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the race for the Republican presidential nomination, several candidates are tapping into a narrative of victimhood and oppression that has become prevalent among social conservatives. This narrative portrays the forces of secularism as a threat to religious freedom and Christianity, with candidates warning of a potential criminalization of Christianity in the United States.\n\nIn a speech at Jerry Falwell's Liberty University, Jeb Bush stated, \"There are consequences when you do not genuflect to the latest secular dogmas.\" Bobby Jindal has claimed that the left wants to \"essentially outlaw firmly held religious beliefs that they do not agree with.\" Marco Rubio has warned that opposing same-sex marriage could lead to the argument that the teachings of mainstream Christianity are hate speech. Mike Huckabee has gone so far as to say, \"We are moving rapidly toward the criminalization of Christianity.\"\n\nWhile it may seem extreme to suggest that the United States, a majority-Christian country with a strong tradition of religious freedom, is on the verge of rounding up Christians and imprisoning them for their beliefs, many on the religious right view this as a real possibility. This perception is fueled by the rapid change in public opinion and laws on gay rights, as well as the secularization of American society over the past several decades.\n\nAccording to data from the Pew Research Center, in 2014, Christians made up 70.6 percent of the American population, down 8 points from just seven years before. Meanwhile, the population of the \"unaffiliated\" - atheists, agnostics, and people who do not identify with any religion in particular - has grown to 23 percent of the public. The trend is particularly pronounced among millennials, with only 56 percent identifying as Christian and 35 percent being unaffiliated.\n\nThe narrative of victimhood and oppression provides social conservatives with a sense of nobility and heroism, as they see themselves as courageous revolutionaries fighting for their principles and God's desires. This narrative may become louder as social progress continues, particularly if the Supreme Court rules in favor of gay marriage in the coming weeks. While liberals may dismiss this rhetoric, it is a sincere belief held by many conservative Christians, and its impact on the political landscape remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Lugar Center Releases Bipartisan Index, Highlights Rising Political Polarization in Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Lugar Center, a bipartisan think tank founded by former Indiana Senator Richard Lugar and Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy, has released its inaugural Bipartisan Index, revealing a significant increase in political polarization in the last two sessions of Congress.\n\nThe index ranks members of Congress based on their collaboration across party lines, using data from bill sponsorships and co-sponsorships during the last two Congresses. The rankings are designed to provide an objective measure of bipartisan cooperation in policy-making.\n\nAccording to a press release from the Lugar Center, as reported by Real Clear Politics, Lugar stated, \"The Bipartisan Index offers the public an objective way to measure how frequently their members of Congress are cooperating with the other party on matters of policy.\" He further added, \"We hope this ranking will incentivize members of Congress to be more bipartisan when writing legislation and making co-sponsorship decisions.\"\n\nThe Lugar Center, which focuses on issues such as nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, global food security, foreign assistance effectiveness, global development, energy security, and enhancing bipartisan governance, plans to release lifetime rankings of each member of Congress dating back to 1993 later this year.\n\nHowever, the 112th and 113th Congresses were the most partisan since 1993, according to the Lugar Center. In an interview with USA Today, Lugar expressed concern, stating, \"This is not a situation to be celebrated, it's one to be turned around.\"\n\nThe Lugar Center's analysis compared lawmakers in the last Congress to a historical average to determine whether they ranked above or below average in bipartisanship. Only a little over one-third of those serving from 2013-2014 were ranked as bipartisan, according to USA Today. Top scorers in the Senate included Republican Susan Collins of Maine and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia, while those ranked as least bipartisan included Republicans Ted Cruz of Texas and Tim Scott of South Carolina.\n\nIn the House, GOP Reps. Christopher Gibson and Peter King of New York ranked most bipartisan, while Reps. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., and Donna Edwards, D-Md., were least bipartisan.\n\nThe scores of presidential candidates in the Senate were all in the bottom half of the index, according to Real Clear Politics, including Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, Cruz, and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nLugar told USA Today, \"Right now, most citizens are unhappy with the lack of progress in Congress, the lack of legislation moving forward or \u2014 worse still \u2014 such tie-ups that the government may shut down or be threatened with being shut down from time to time.\"\n\nThe trend of increasing political polarization has been noted before. CQ Roll Call has found that partisanship and polarization are driving legislative behavior more than in any other period since at least the start of the Eisenhower administration, according to USA Today. The Washington Post, reporting last month, showed that starting in the 1990s, \"the parties began pulling apart from each other, like a single cell dividing into two,\" and that \"in the 2000s, there are hardly any links between the parties at all.\"",
    " Title: Alabama Senate Race: Roy Moore's Loyal Base Remains Steadfast Amidst Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. \u2013 Despite the recent allegations of sexual misconduct, Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for Alabama's Senate seat, continues to maintain a loyal base of supporters. These supporters, who have long backed Moore in statewide races for chief justice, governor, and senator for two decades, are standing by him.\n\nJohnny Williams, a 77-year-old retired bus charter company owner, expressed his unwavering support for Moore. \"I've seen him fighting at those fires, and I just believe in him,\" Williams said in an interview.\n\nThe allegations against Moore have led to a loss of support from some conservatives in recent weeks. However, Moore's famously loyal supporters, like 68-year-old Ann Eubanks of Birmingham, are not abandoning him. Eubanks, who leads a tea party group, stated, \"I am a policy voter. I refuse to send a far-left liberal Democrat to Congress. There's too much at stake in this country at this point with the balance of the Senate at critical mass.\"\n\nEubanks cited future Supreme Court nominations, repealing Obamacare, building the wall, and immigration proposals as issues that President Trump will need every vote he can muster in the Senate. \"It's way bigger than Roy Moore,\" Eubanks said. \"It is the direction of our country.\"\n\nHowever, Moore is facing challenges in winning over the support of other Alabama voters who typically vote Republican. In a Waffle House in Birmingham, 66-year-old Richard Barnett, the general manager of a metals and welding company, expressed his disapproval of Moore. \"The last Democrat I voted for is Jimmy Carter,\" Barnett said, stating he would likely write-in Sen. Luther Strange, who lost to Moore in the primary, instead.\n\nBarnett expressed no faith in Moore's ability to represent the majority of people and noted the lack of public support for Moore in his community. \"You see no Roy Moore signs. You see some for Doug Jones. It's very, very unusual,\" Barnett said.\n\nAt another table in the diner, a mother from Alabaster, who identified herself as Sandra, was having breakfast with her husband. She expressed her support for President Trump but was undecided about her vote on Tuesday. \"Deep down, I wish Luther Strange had been the candidate,\" she said.\n\nWinning over these undecided voters could be the key to Moore's victory. Aware of this, Moore's campaign was jubilant after President Trump held a rally Friday night just 25 miles away from the Alabama state line in Pensacola, Florida, to encourage people to vote for Moore.\n\nHowever, not everyone is enthused about the election. At the Waffle House, one waitress, named Nona, expressed her disinterest in the election. As she cleared plates of hashbrowns and eggs, Nona said she couldn't bring herself to vote for any of the candidates on Tuesday. She stated the behavior Moore has been accused of is \"not Christian.\"",
    " Title: Commemorating Martin Luther King Jr.'s Dream: A Call to Action on the 50th Anniversary of His Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Saturday, tens of thousands of people gathered at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial and the National Mall in Washington D.C., marking the 50th anniversary of King's iconic \"I Have a Dream\" speech. The event was a poignant tribute to a generation of activists who endured hardships to fight for African American equality, but also a call to action, emphasizing that the struggle for justice is far from over.\n\nMartin Luther King III, the eldest son of the civil rights leader, underscored the importance of continued progress, stating, \"This is not the time for nostalgic commemoration. Nor is this the time for self-congratulatory celebration. The task is not done. The journey is not complete. We can and we must do more.\"\n\nEric Holder, the nation's first black attorney general, highlighted the significant impact of the marchers, stating that without them, he would not have held his position, nor would President Barack Obama have been in office. Holder emphasized that the dream of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. still remains unfulfilled for gays, Latinos, women, and the disabled.\n\nRep. John Lewis, the only surviving speaker from the 1963 March on Washington, spoke passionately against a recent Supreme Court decision that weakened the Voting Rights Act. Lewis, who was a leader of the 1965 march that ended in violence, urged the crowd to stand up for voting rights, stating, \"I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, Ala. for the right to vote. I am not going to stand by and let the Supreme Court take the right to vote away from us.\"\n\nOrganizers anticipated approximately 100,000 participants in the event, a precursor to the actual anniversary of the Aug. 28, 1963, march that drew some 250,000 to the National Mall. Speakers frequently addressed issues such as high unemployment among blacks, the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, and the importance of addressing climate change.\n\nThe event took place in a post-9/11 Washington that was significantly different from the one civil rights leaders visited in 1963. Security measures, such as metal barriers and police presence, were in place to ensure the safety of the attendees. President Barack Obama, former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, and churches and groups will join him on the anniversary day to speak from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nJoseph Lowery, who co-founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King, urged the crowd to continue working towards King's ideals, stating, \"We've come to Washington to commemorate, and we're going home to agitate.\" The event served as a powerful reminder that the struggle for equality and justice is a continuous journey, and that the dream of Martin Luther King Jr. remains a guiding light for future generations.",
    " Title: Senate Judiciary Committee Advances Gun Trafficking Bill, Debates Assault Weapons Ban and Background Checks\n\nIn a significant move towards gun control legislation, the Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced a bill making gun trafficking a federal crime, marking the first key vote on gun laws since the tragic shootings at a Connecticut elementary school in December.\n\nThe committee is currently debating four pieces of legislation, including bills banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines, requiring background checks for nearly all gun purchases, and providing more funding for schools to buy video cameras and other safety equipment.\n\nThe trafficking bill, known as the \"Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act,\" was approved by a 11-7 vote, with Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa being the only Republican to support the measure.\n\nThe committee is expected to vote in favor of all four bills, which would then be considered by the full Senate. However, the bills' prospects after that are uncertain, with the Senate and House being controlled by different parties.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled committee is considering the \"assault weapons ban of 2013,\" sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the \"stop illegal trafficking in firearms act,\" put forward by Committee Chairman Pat Leahy (D-Vt.), Sen. Charles Schumer's (D-N.Y.) \"Protecting Responsible Gun Sellers Act of 2013,\" which would expand background checks for gun buyers, and the \"School Safety Enhancements Act of 2013\" from Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.).\n\nGiven the political dynamics, gun-control supporters are focusing on one element of President Obama's package they see as low-hanging fruit: an expansion of the criminal background check system for gun purchases. The bills would also face uphill battles in the Republican-controlled House.\n\nWe will update with news about the committee votes as they happen.",
    " Title: New Polls Suggest Close Race as Obama and Romney Prepare for First Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. (CNN) - As the first presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney approaches, a new poll indicates that the race remains tight, with most Americans viewing the GOP challenger as the underdog in the upcoming showdown.\n\nAccording to a poll conducted by ABC News and The Washington Post, 55% of likely voters believe President Obama will win the debate, while 31% believe Romney will emerge victorious. This finding aligns with a CNN/ORC International poll conducted after the Democratic convention earlier this month, where 59% of likely voters said Obama would do a better job in the October debates, compared to 34% who favored Romney.\n\nThe new survey's findings on the debate question are consistent with the current state of the election, as a CNN Poll of Polls, which averages all three surveys, puts Obama at 49% and Romney at 46% among likely voters. A new poll by Politico and George Washington University also released Monday shows 49% support for Obama and 47% for Romney among likely voters nationwide.\n\nThe two new surveys follow a Fox News poll released last week, which indicated a five-point advantage for the president. The ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted from September 26-29, with 1,001 adults nationwide, including 929 registered voters and 813 likely voters, questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error for likely voters is plus or minus 4 percentage points. The Politico/George Washington University Battleground poll was conducted from September 24-27, with 1,000 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nAs the candidates prepare for Wednesday's debate in Denver, Colorado, Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Romney's running mate, will face off once in the vice presidential debate.\n\nMeanwhile, both candidates are campaigning ahead of the debate. Ann Romney is set to rally in Colorado, while President Obama is preparing for the debate across town. In a recent development, Romney criticized Obama's foreign policy in his weekly podcast.\n\nThe first of three debates between Obama and Romney will take place on Wednesday, with the remaining debates scheduled for October 16 in Hempstead, New York, and October 22 in Boca Raton, Florida. The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 11 in Danville, Kentucky. The election will take place on November 6.",
    " Title: Centrist Strategy Propels Gay Rights Movement to Mainstream Success\n\nArticle:\n\nJohn Avlon, a CNN political analyst, asserts that the success of the gay rights movement, particularly the push for same-sex marriage, is a historic achievement. In an interview with CNN, Avlon highlights the strategic shift in the movement, which has skillfully positioned itself as a bipartisan and centrist issue.\n\nAvlon argues that the progress on gay rights serves as a model for reaching consensus on other contentious issues. He points out that while the Supreme Court has yet to deliver its decision on same-sex marriage, the sea change in public opinion over the past decade is undeniable.\n\nIn recent weeks, prominent figures like Hillary Clinton, Jon Huntsman, and Rob Portman have publicly declared their support for marriage equality. While more Democrats than Republicans support same-sex marriage, the divide is increasingly generational rather than partisan. A majority of Republicans under the age of 50 now support marriage equality, including over 60% of evangelicals under 30.\n\nAvlon credits activists like Evan Wolfson and Andrew Sullivan, as well as former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, for their early advocacy. The movement to encourage gays and lesbians to come out has also played a significant role in breaking down barriers and fostering greater compassion and recognition of civil rights.\n\nHowever, the mainstreaming of marriage equality also reflects a strategic shift. Instead of relying on street theater tactics that often alienate more people than they attract, the movement has focused on building bridges beyond the base. This means outreach to Republicans and making counter-intuitively conservative arguments for same-sex marriage.\n\nTed Olson, the former Bush administration solicitor general, is a prime example of this strategic shift. Olson teamed up with David Boies, his opponent in the Bush v Gore Supreme Court case, to argue that California's Proposition 8 banning same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. Their partnership represents an understanding of the vital center as a dynamic way of solving problems and creating new coalitions.\n\nThe ads run in favor of marriage equality, such as those by the Respect for Marriage coalition, emphasize the essentially conservative institution of marriage, leading to societal stability and reduced dependence on the government. The 131 Republicans who signed on to the amicus brief in support of the freedom to marry, including prominent members of the Bush administration and the Romney campaign, also reflect this shift.\n\nAvlon concludes that the shift in public opinion overturns centuries of established thought about marriage influenced by culture and religion. The rapid change is a reflection of the durability and flexibility of our democracy. He suggests that the centrist model used by the gay rights movement can be replicated as we try to call a ceasefire in the culture wars and actually start to solve problems through the process of addition rather than division.",
    " Title: Trump Legal Team Prepares Answers for Mueller's Special Counsel Inquiry on 2016 Election Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK - President Donald Trump's legal team is reportedly preparing responses to questions from the U.S. special counsel, Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This development, first reported by CNN, indicates progress in the ongoing talks between Mueller's team and Trump's legal team regarding the president's potential answers in the investigation.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the matter, the question of a potential interview has not been definitively settled. However, the source told the news outlet that Mueller is willing to accept written answers to questions without a commitment from Trump's lawyers over what comes next.\n\nTrump attorney Rudy Giuliani had stated last month that Mueller wanted the president to commit to a follow-up interview to any written questions, a position that Trump's legal team was resisting. In an interview on Tuesday, Giuliani told the same news outlet, \"We are not prepared to agree to more questions until the first group of questions are asked, answered, and somebody can explain to us why that isn't enough.\"\n\nGiuliani reiterated that Trump would be willing to answer questions on whether his campaign had colluded with Moscow to influence the 2016 election, but not whether he had acted to obstruct the Russia probe. In an NBC News interview last year, Trump tied his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey to the investigation into Russian election meddling. At the time of his firing, Comey was leading the probe.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election to try to tip it toward Trump and away from his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton. Moscow has denied any interference, while Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and any obstruction of justice.",
    " Title: Biden and Obama Continue Push for Assault Weapons Ban Despite Senate Setback\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of a seemingly stalled assault weapons ban in the Senate, Vice President Joe Biden and President Obama are persisting in their efforts to have the legislation passed. Despite Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's statement that he does not have the 40 votes necessary for the ban to pass as a standalone bill, Biden remains optimistic.\n\nIn an interview, Biden expressed his determination to see the ban pass, citing the success of the first assault weapons ban in 1994, which was attached to the Biden Crime bill. He emphasized that the ban had initially been declared dead several times before its eventual passage.\n\nBiden, who was instrumental in the passage of the 1994 ban, along with Senator Dianne Feinstein and others, believes that the process may not unfold in a single step. He pointed to the history of the ban's inclusion in the Biden Crime Bill, which initially had 100,000 provisions removed, only to be reinstated and eventually separated as the Brady Bill for background checks.\n\nBiden's confidence stems from his past experience with the issue, and he expressed his belief that the will of the people will eventually prevail. He urged continued vigilance, suggesting that the Department of Justice, ATF, and other regulatory agencies will play a key role in the ongoing fight for gun safety regulations.\n\nVice President Biden was in New York today, attending an event with NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who also called for more gun control measures, despite Senator Feinstein's inability to garner Democratic support for her assault weapons legislation. The fight for gun control regulations continues.",
    " Title: Political Campaigns Adjust Schedules, Tone in Response to Colorado Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, which left at least 12 people dead and numerous others injured during a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises, both major U.S. presidential campaigns have revised their schedules and adopted a more somber tone.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, who had planned to hold Florida campaign rallies in Fort Myers and Orlando, canceled the Orlando event and transformed the Fort Myers appearance into a brief, solemn gathering. The president, addressing the crowd, emphasized the need for prayer, reflection, and unity in the face of such a devastating event.\n\n\"There are going to be other days for politics. This is a day for prayer and reflection,\" Obama said, urging the audience to observe a moment of silence for the victims and their families. The president underscored the importance of cherishing life and focusing on love and compassion in the face of adversity.\n\nMitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, also adjusted his campaign schedule. Speaking at what was initially planned as a campaign event in Bow, New Hampshire, Romney expressed his condolences and called for unity and compassion in the wake of the tragedy.\n\n\"Today is a moment to grieve and remember, and to reach out and to help, to appreciate our blessings in life,\" Romney said. \"Each one of us will hold our kids a little closer, linger a bit longer with a colleague or a neighbor, reach out to a family member or friend.\"\n\nBoth the Obama and Romney campaigns temporarily suspended their political ads in Colorado out of respect for the victims and to avoid any appearance of insensitivity in a crucial battleground state. The issue of gun control, which has not been a significant campaign topic, is now likely to emerge in the national discourse.\n\nNew York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, in response to the shootings, called on both candidates to outline their plans for combating gun violence in the United States. The political landscape, for the time being, has shifted from campaign rhetoric to a call for unity, compassion, and reflection.",
    " Title: Trust Deficit: Ebola Crisis in the U.S. and the Questionable Information from Government Officials\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Ebola crisis unfolds within the United States, a growing sense of distrust towards the government has emerged. The American people, who traditionally have a general faith in their government, are questioning the credibility of the information provided by federal officials regarding the Ebola outbreak.\n\nOn Sept. 16, President Obama held a news conference about Ebola at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta. After the president stated, \"We have to act fast. We can't dawdle on this one,\" he declared the Ebola situation in West Africa as \"spiraling out of control\" and then assured the public that the chances of Ebola coming to America were \"extremely low.\" However, on Sept. 20, Liberian Ebola carrier Thomas Eric Duncan arrived in the United States, just four days after the president's comments that it would likely not happen.\n\nThe honesty and transparency expected from government officials include admitting when there may be potential problems in the future. President Obama's refusal to suspend flights into the United States from Ebola-infected countries likely contributed to the virus' arrival in the country.\n\nThe CDC's reassurances about Ebola, often delivered by Director Tom Frieden, were finally exposed on CNN. During a discussion with CNN's Sanjay Gupta, Dr. Frieden was asked to reassure viewers that Ebola was not \"highly contagious.\" Dr. Frieden complied, stating, \"It's not like the flu, not like the common cold, it requires direct physical contact.\" However, when a news anchor mentioned that if someone with Ebola sneezes on you, it's a different story, Dr. Frieden was compelled to admit that existing CDC guidelines warn that standing within a three-foot radius of someone with Ebola poses a risk of infection.\n\nThe CDC's misleading information about Ebola's contagion, usually delivered by Dr. Frieden, was finally exposed on live TV, showing federal officials not being completely honest with the public. This incident, along with other instances of misinformation, has led to a growing distrust of government officials and the mainstream media.\n\nThe American people have faced numerous life-threatening crises throughout history, from world wars to debilitating viruses, and have always come together, faced reality, and defeated the enemy. However, politicians have a different reason to keep information from the public: each failure of the system exposes their incompetence. The many scandals of the Obama presidency could benefit from a healthy dose of light brought by curious reporters who are still interested in investigating and finding the truth, regardless of which politicians it exposes.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Backlash Against Rep. Ilhan Omar's Remarks on Israel and AIPAC\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., found herself at the center of a controversy Sunday evening as members from both parties criticized her for suggesting that a prominent lobbying group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), pays members of Congress to support Israel.\n\nOmar, who made history as the first Somali-American woman elected to Congress in November, responded to a Twitter post by journalist Glenn Greenwald criticizing House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., for threatening to take action against Omar and another freshman lawmaker, Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., over allegedly anti-Semitic remarks.\n\nMcCarthy had told reporters on Friday, \"I think when they stay silent, they are just as guilty... I think this will not be the end of this, and if they do not take action then I think you will see action from myself. It\u2019s unacceptable in this country, especially when you sit back and think about and listen to what this country went through in World War II.\"\n\nGreenwald accused McCarthy of targeting Omar and Tlaib for their numerous criticisms of Israel, to which Omar responded, \"It's all about the Benjamins, baby,\" quoting a 1997 rap song by Puff Daddy. She then doubled down when challenged by Batya Ungar-Sargon, the opinion editor of The Forward newspaper.\n\n\"Would love to know who @IlhanMN thinks is paying American politicians to be pro-Israel, though I think I can guess,\" Ungar-Sargon tweeted. \"Bad form, Congresswoman. That's the second anti-Semitic trope you've tweeted.\"\n\nIn response, Omar tweeted \"AIPAC!\" referring to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which has been accused by progressives of agitating for a conflict with Iran.\n\nAIPAC responded Sunday evening, tweeting, \"We are proud that we are engaged in the democratic process to strengthen the US-Israel relationship. Our bipartisan efforts are reflective of American values and interests. We will not be deterred in any way by ill-informed and illegitimate attacks on this important work.\"\n\nAnother freshman Democrat, Max Rose of New York, tweeted that Omar's statements \"are deeply hurtful to Jews, including myself.\"\n\n\"When someone uses hateful and offensive tropes and words against people of my faith, I will not be silent,\" Rose said in a statement. \"... At a time when anti-Semitic attacks are on the rise, our leaders should not be invoking hurtful stereotypes and caricatures of Jewish people to dismiss those who support Israel. In the Democratic Party - and in the United States of America - we celebrate the diversity of our people, and the Gods we pray to, as a strength. The congresswoman's statements do not live up to that cherished ideal.\"\n\nJewish groups have also condemned Rep. Rashida Tlaib over her ties to radical pro-Hezbollah, anti-Israel activists.\n\nHouse GOP conference chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., slammed Omar's remarks and called for House Democrat leaders to remove Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nZudhi Jasser, a physician and President of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, took Cheney\u2019s call a step further, arguing that removing Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee would be a \u201cgood first step, followed by a swift sanction against @IlhanMN for bigotry unfit for the US Congress with removal from all committees. Ignoring this would bring the \u201cbigotry of low expectations\u201d to a new low for Muslims.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Jewish Coalition called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to take action against Omar and asked rhetorically if other House Democrats would \u201ccare to comment on the outrageous anti-Semitism being spewed by one of your f\u00eated members?\u201d\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., has yet to comment on the matter.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who repeatedly accused the global body of anti-Israel bias during her tenure, tweeted that Omar's statements \"CAN NOT be tolerated in our own Congress by anyone of either party. In a time of increased anti-Semitism, we all must be held to account. No excuses.\"\n\nChelsea Clinton tweeted, \"We should expect all elected officials, regardless of party, and all public figures to not traffic in anti-Semitism.\"\n\nMeghan McCain, daughter of late Arizona Senator John McCain, lauded Clinton for calling out anti-Semitism \"on all sides, in all spaces, no matter how uncomfortable.\"\n\nLeft-wing historian and Politico Magazine contributing editor Joshua Zeitz tweeted, \"I'm one of those American Jews who opposes the occupation [of the West Bank and Gaza Strip] and laments Israel's anti-democratic drift, and does not regard the country as especially central to my Jewish identity. And I knew exactly what the congresswoman meant. She might as well call us hook-nosed.\"\n\nClinton later promised that she would \"reach out\" to Omar on Monday after another user said she was \"disappointed\" that Clinton was \"piling on.\"\n\n\"I would be happy to talk,\" Omar tweeted at Clinton in response. \"We must call out smears from the GOP and their allies. And I believe we can do that without criticizing people for their faith. I look forward to building an inclusive movement for justice with you.\"\n\nSunday marked the latest in a long line of statements by Omar that critics have slammed as anti-Semitic. In 2012, she tweeted that \"Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. # Gaza # Palestine # Israel.\" She did not apologize for posting the tweet until last month.\n\nIn January, Omar argued in a Yahoo! News interview that Israel could not be considered a democracy and compared it to the Islamic theocracy in Iran.\n\n\"When I see Israel institute laws that recognize it as a Jewish state and does not recognize the other religions that are living in it, and we still uphold it as a democracy in the Middle East I almost chuckle because I know that if we see that any other society we would criticize it, call it out,\" she said. \"We do that to Iran, we do that to any other place that sort of upholds its religion. And I see that now happening with Saudi Arabia and so I am aggravated, truly, in those contradictions.\"",
    " Title: Jeb Bush Clarifies Immigration Stance Amidst 2016 Presidential Speculation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of Sunday talk show appearances, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has vigorously denied allegations that he has shifted his views on immigration reform, as other potential 2016 Republican candidates maneuver their positions on the contentious issue.\n\nDuring his interviews, Bush reaffirmed his support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, aligning himself with a bipartisan group of senators working on a bill. However, his new book, \"Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution,\" suggests a path to residency rather than citizenship for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country.\n\nOn \"Fox News Sunday,\" Bush stated, \"I support a path to citizenship, so long as the path for people that have been waiting patiently is easier and costs less, the legal entrance to our country, than illegal entrance.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, a member of the \"Gang of Eight,\" had previously criticized Bush's stance, stating it \"undercuts\" their efforts. But Bush clarified that he had discussed the issue with Graham and that they share the same views, despite earlier support for a pathway to citizenship in his career.\n\nThe immigration debate is a delicate issue for the Republicans, as they strive to distance themselves from President Obama's policies while avoiding alienating Latino voters. Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky, both potential 2016 nominees, have criticized a leaked framework for immigration reform that included a path to citizenship. Rubio, whose parents emigrated from Cuba, supports a pathway to citizenship for those currently in the country illegally, a stance Bush said he aligns with.\n\nBush dismissed suggestions that his recent statements and book are part of political maneuvering for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, stating, \"That's the Washington world, the world of everything has to have a personal political ambition, motive. That's not the case.\" The book, he explained, was written last year when the immigration debate's tone was significantly different.\n\nThe ongoing immigration debate continues to be a significant issue in American politics, with both parties seeking to address the complex and contentious matter in a manner that balances legal immigration, border security, and the status of undocumented immigrants already residing in the United States.",
    " Title: Colorado Lawmakers Advance Firearm Restrictions Amidst Intense Debate and Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly charged atmosphere, Colorado lawmakers have advanced firearm restrictions, as the debate over the proposed measures intensified on Monday. Hundreds of gun rights supporters, who filled the state Capitol and circled the building with car horns blaring, called for the preservation of Second Amendment rights. Inside, the husband of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, and victims of mass shootings in Connecticut and a suburban Denver movie theater, pleaded for more gun controls.\n\nThe state, known for its politically moderate stance, is at the center of the national debate on gun violence in the wake of recent mass shootings, including the attack at a suburban Denver movie theater last summer, which evoked memories of the Columbine High School shooting of 1999 for many in the state and across the nation.\n\nLawmakers are considering a package of gun control measures, including plans that would limit ammunition magazines to 15 rounds and expand background checks to include private sales and online purchases. Both measures cleared Democratic-controlled committees on 3-2 party-line votes but still need approval from the full Senate, which could debate the bills as soon as this week.\n\nRetired astronaut and Navy captain Mark Kelly, the husband of Gabrielle Giffords, told lawmakers that he and his wife support the Second Amendment, but he said the right to bear arms should not extend to criminals and the mentally ill. Kelly compared the different background check requirements for private and retail sales to having two different lines at the airport, one with security and one without.\n\n\"Which one do you think the terrorist is going to choose?\" he asked.\n\nGiffords, a former Democratic congresswoman from Tucson, Ariz., was severely wounded in a mass shooting in January 2011 while meeting with constituents.\n\nGun control opponents argue that the proposals will not reduce violence. They suggest lawmakers should focus on strengthening access to mental health services for people who could be dangerous to communities.\n\nThe bill hearings were at times testy, and included some outbursts from the audience. After one bill passed, someone leaving the committee yelled \"That sucks!\" to lawmakers.\n\n\"I've never seen such unprofessional behavior,\" Democratic Sen. Irene Aguilar told the audience at one point.\n\nMeanwhile, gun rights advocates complained that lawmakers limited testimony time, and many did not have a chance to speak on proposals.\n\nThe commotion at the Capitol underscored the attention the debate has generated nationally from gun rights groups, such as the National Rifle Association, to victims' families and White House officials.\n\nSeveral bills before state senators have already cleared the House. With Democrats controlling both chambers of the state Legislature, some of the proposals have a strong chance of passing.\n\nOther measures that picked up initial Senate approval would place new restrictions on gun ownership by people convicted in domestic violence cases, and another requires gun buyers to pay for their own background checks.\n\nThe state's Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, supports magazine limits and expanded background checks. He has not indicated where he stands on other measures, including whether he supports a proposal that would hold sellers and owners of assault weapons liable for shootings by such firearms.\n\nGun rights supporters walked the Capitol halls wearing stickers that read, \"I Vote Pro-Gun.\" Several dozen people outside the Capitol waved American flags as light snow fell, and a small plane flew overhead carrying a banner with a message for the governor, \"HICK: DO NOT TAKE OUR GUNS!\"\n\nOne of the nation's largest producers of ammunition magazines, Colorado-based Magpul, has threatened to leave the state if lawmakers restrict the size of its products. Its founder said smaller magazines can be easily connected to each other, and the company fears it would legally liable if people were to do that.\n\nAbout 20 Colorado sheriffs opposed the expanded background checks and the magazine limits. Standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of lawmakers in committee, they said that both bills were unenforceable.\n\n\"This bill just doesn't make any sense from our perspective,\" Pueblo Sheriff Kirk Taylor said about the bill to limit magazine sizes.\n\nVictims who have lost relatives to gun violence say it's time for legislators to take action. Tom Sullivan, whose son Alex was among the 12 killed in the Aurora, Colo., theater shooting, was among the people urging lawmakers to pass magazine restrictions.\n\n\"He was enjoying the movie one second, and then the next second he was dead,\" Tom Sullivan said.\n\nJane Dougherty, whose sister, Mary Sherlach, was a psychologist killed in the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., has been lobbying Colorado lawmakers to pass new gun laws. She said she does not understand gun owners who worry the bills are putting a burden on their rights.\n\nShe said the Connecticut shooter used \"the same type of weapon that we use in war\" to \"slaughter these babies\" and asked lawmakers for stricter gun laws.\n\n\"We can not wait for yet another massacre to transpire,\" Dougherty said.",
    " Title: Biden Reverses Stance on Abortion Funding Amidst Intensifying Criticism from Democratic Rivals\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift of position, former Vice President Joe Biden has reversed his long-standing support for the Hyde Amendment, a law that restricts federal funding for abortions. The change comes amid mounting criticism from his fellow 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nAt a Democratic gala on Thursday, Mr. Biden denounced the Hyde Amendment, stating his belief that healthcare is a fundamental right. He added that he made \"no apologies\" for his previous stance but emphasized that his current views are incompatible with the amendment's implications.\n\nThe Hyde Amendment, passed in 1976, prohibits the use of federal funds for most abortions, particularly for women receiving federal assistance through Medicaid. This amendment has been a contentious issue, as it effectively blocks a significant number of low-income women from accessing abortion services, which can often cost several hundred dollars.\n\nSenators Elizabeth Warren and Beto O'Rourke were among those who had recently criticized Biden's stance. In response, Biden, speaking at a Democratic National Committee gala in Atlanta, stated, \"If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone's ZIP code.\"\n\nBiden is a practicing Roman Catholic who has previously stated his personal opposition to abortion but believes his religious beliefs should not be imposed on others. This policy change, while drawing criticism and support, may not necessarily be a political liability, given that Biden's support comes from more moderate Democrats and independents.\n\nThis shift in stance comes amid a wave of conservative state legislatures enacting restrictions on abortion or outright bans, as seen in Alabama's recent ban on almost all abortions. Biden cited these restrictions as one of the reasons for his policy change.\n\nThe Hyde Amendment has been a topic of debate among the 24 candidates running for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Several candidates, including Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and Jay Inslee, have expressed support for repealing the law this week.\n\nIn response to Biden's change in stance, both O'Rourke and Warren directly criticized his viewpoint. Warren felt that the amendment was discriminatory, stating, \"It's just discrimination against poorer women.\" O'Rourke, on the other hand, called Biden's viewpoint \"absolutely wrong,\" adding, \"Perhaps he does not understand who the Hyde Amendment hurts the most, lower income communities, communities of color.\"\n\nThe four female senators running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination - Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar - have co-sponsored a measure to revoke the Hyde Amendment. They also tweeted criticisms of the law this week, but did not name Biden.\n\nThis policy change could potentially impact Biden's electability, as his support stems largely from the perception that he is a winning candidate who can stand up to and defeat Donald Trump. However, too many fumbles could strip away this veneer of electability.",
    " Title: Iran Protests Escalate as Tensions Rise in Region Following Downed Ukrainian Plane, Arrest of British Ambassador\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane last week, Iranian leaders' apologies have failed to quell the growing anti-government protests that have swept across the country. The airliner disaster occurred hours after Iran launched missile attacks on Iraqi military bases housing U.S. troops, in retaliation for a drone strike at Baghdad airport that killed Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani.\n\nOn Sunday, eight Katyusha rockets hit Iraq's Balad Air Base, north of Baghdad, wounding four Iraqi air force officers, according to an Iraqi military statement. No American or coalition forces were at the base when the rockets struck, a U.S. military official told CNN.\n\nIn Iran, demonstrators are calling for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down and for those responsible for downing the plane to be prosecuted. Protests have now spread to other cities, including Shiraz, Esfahan, Hamedan, and Orumiyeh, according to Reuters.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump tweeted his support for the demonstrators, saying his administration will \"continue to stand by you.\" Likewise, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced his support for the protesters and called on European powers to increase pressure on the Iranian regime.\n\nIran previously denied U.S. claims that the country had shot down the plane before admitting the mistake on Saturday. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said his country \"deeply regrets this disastrous mistake\" and his \"thoughts and prayers go to all the mourning families.\" Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif blamed the disaster on \"human error\" and \"US adventurism.\"\n\nThe protests came as Iran faces fresh criticism abroad for the temporary arrest Saturday of British Ambassador Rob Macaire. On Sunday, Macaire was summoned to the Iranian foreign ministry. According to the semi-official Tasnim news agency, Macaire was arrested while in the middle of a crowd of protesters in front of Tehran's Amir Kabir University. He was accused of instigating and directing radical and destructive demonstrations, and later released.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called Macaire's arrest a \"flagrant violation of international law\" -- a sentiment echoed by the German and French foreign ministries. Iranian officials said Macaire was released as soon as his identity was confirmed.\n\nThe downed plane's victims included 57 Canadians, and the country's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a press conference Saturday that, \"what Iran has admitted to is very serious.\" \"Canada will not rest until we get the accountability, justice, and closure that the families deserve,\" Trudeau said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted that Iran's admission was a \"step in the right direction.\" Iranian authorities are in possession of the two flight data recorders, also known as black boxes, which Ukrainian investigators got access to on Friday. They have yet to start examining the information, but have said it included communications between the pilot and Tehran flight control.",
    " Title: President Trump Prepares for Tulsa Rally Amidst Anticipated Protests and Safety Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tweet on Friday, President Donald Trump signaled a tougher approach towards protesters and \"anarchists\" in Tulsa, Oklahoma, ahead of his comeback rally this weekend. The President's tweet comes as a preemptive measure against individuals who may stir up unrest in the deep-red city, contrasting with the response in Democratic-led cities across the country.\n\nThe tweet did not distinguish between protesters advocating for racial justice and those who have caused property damage or disrupted cities following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany later clarified that the President's reference to \"anarchists\" and looters pertained to those who engage in violent activities.\n\nTulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum, a Republican, agreed not to impose a previously ordered curfew on rally attendees, as per the President's tweet. The Oklahoma Supreme Court also denied a local attempt to block the rally, stating that the petitioners did not establish a \"clear legal right\" to cancel the event.\n\nThe Trump campaign anticipates tens of thousands of people to attend the rally at the Bank of Oklahoma (BOK) Center, with the campaign implementing safety measures such as temperature checks, hand sanitizer, and masks at the entrance. However, wearing masks is optional.\n\nMs. McEnany stated she does not plan to wear a mask at the rally, citing her regular testing. The President is aiming to rejuvenate the economy post-lockdown and overhaul policing in the wake of George Floyd's death, while also positioning himself as a \"law and order\" candidate who will not tolerate violent protests.\n\nHowever, the President continues to face criticism over his actions during the June 1 clearing of mostly peaceful protesters from Lafayette Park near the White House. It remains uncertain whether similar incidents will occur in Tulsa. Community organizers plan to observe the Juneteenth holiday in the historic Greenwood district, which was once known as Black Wall Street before a 1921 massacre.\n\nRoss Baker, a political professor at Rutgers University, commented on the President's actions, stating, \"This is all about his own morale, which has been flagging since the Lafayette Square episode.\" Baker added, \"The president has been rattling his cage. He is desperate to break out of the physical confines of the White House and draw energy from an adoring crowd, which he is certain to get in Tulsa where there is little chance of large counter-demonstrations.\"",
    " Title: Man Armed with Rifle Dies in Shootout with Police at Washington Immigration Detention Center\n\nA 69-year-old man identified as Willem Van Spronsen, a resident of Vashon Island, was killed in a shootout with police early Saturday morning at the Tacoma Northwest Detention Center in Washington state. The privately run facility, operated by the GEO Group, houses migrants pending deportation proceedings and has previously held individuals separated from their families under the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy.\n\nAccording to the Tacoma Police Department, the incident occurred at approximately 4 a.m. when Van Spronsen set a vehicle on fire, attempted to ignite a large propane tank, and set buildings ablaze. Police found him armed with a rifle, a satchel, and flares.\n\nUpon arrival, four police officers called out to Van Spronsen, and shots were fired. Loretta Cool, a police spokesperson, stated that all four officers discharged their weapons, but she did not provide specific details of the incident. The officers were not wearing body cameras, but the area is covered by surveillance cameras from the detention center. It is unclear whether Van Spronsen fired at the officers.\n\nAfter the gunfire, officers took cover, contained the area, and set up medical aid a short distance away. Officers then located Van Spronsen and determined he had been shot and was dead at the scene. No law enforcement officers were injured.\n\nAuthorities are still investigating the incident, and questions remain about the motives behind Van Spronsen's actions. Deb Bartley, a friend of Van Spronsen, told the Seattle Times that she believes he intended to provoke a fatal conflict and that his attack on the detention center was a suicide mission.\n\nVan Spronsen had a history of activism and was previously accused of assaulting a police officer during a protest outside the detention center in 2018. He pleaded guilty to obstructing police and was given a deferred sentence.\n\nThe GEO Group, which runs the detention center, released a statement expressing gratitude for the quick action by the Tacoma Police Department and stating that baseless accusations about the treatment of detainees at its facilities have led to dangerous situations for employees. The company also emphasized the modern amenities available at the Tacoma facility, including air conditioning, recreational activities, a bed for every individual, and medical care available at all hours.\n\nLast year, a federal judge ruled that Washington state could pursue a lawsuit seeking to force the GEO Group to pay minimum wage for work done by detainees at the detention center. In November, a Russian asylum-seeker who conducted a hunger strike to protest the conditions at the detention center died by suicide.\n\nThe investigation into the incident is ongoing, and more information is expected to be released in the coming days.",
    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Community Defends ISIS Assessment Amidst Political Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a memo to staff obtained by Fox News, the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, praised his analysts for their work in monitoring and assessing the Islamic State (ISIS) over the past two years. This praise comes amidst a heated debate following President Obama's comments on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" over the weekend, where he suggested that the intelligence community may have underestimated the threat posed by ISIS.\n\nThe ensuing controversy has led to a round of finger-pointing, with the White House walking back President Obama's comments, stating that he did not intend to blame the intelligence community. However, the White House is disputing accusations from Republican lawmakers and intelligence officials that Obama ignored ISIS warnings for months.\n\nRep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) told Fox News that lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee, of which she is a member, had been warning the administration for years about the seriousness of the ISIS threat.\n\nClapper's memo to staff, sent on Tuesday, highlights the intelligence community's efforts to monitor and assess ISIS over the past two years. He wrote, \"I'm proud of the [intelligence community's] efforts over the past two years to monitor, assess and call attention to the expansion of ISIL, and I know the president has found that work to be critical to developing his strategy.\"\n\nClapper noted that both he and President Obama were in agreement about the difficulty in predicting the \"will\" of Iraqi security forces to fight. He wrote, \"Despite all we understood about the capabilities of ISIL and the Iraqi Security Forces, we have no intelligence tool that could have predicted the ISF's sudden collapse in northern Iraq and the resultant ease with which ISIL forces captured territory.\"\n\nClapper's claims about the intelligence community's diligence in assessing the ISIS threat could fuel concerns that the White House was not taking those assessments seriously enough. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) has faulted \"policy makers\" for not confronting the threat.\n\nWhen asked about Clapper's role on Wednesday, Rogers suggested that President Obama may have missed key intelligence briefings. \"James Clapper has a tough job overseeing 16 intel agencies. I am more concerned about the president and the missed intel briefings,\" Rogers told Fox News.\n\nIntelligence officials have told Fox News and other outlets that they were drawing attention to the ISIS threat for months but were ignored by the White House. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest pointed to Clapper's memo to rebut one anonymous quote to that effect in The New York Times.\n\n\"He put out a message to the intelligence community that directly contradicts the anonymous individual who's quoted in the New York Times,\" Earnest said, reading passages from Clapper's memo and saying the memo was \"consistent\" with Obama's comments on \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nClapper previously admitted that U.S. analysts both underestimated the Islamic State and \"overestimated\" the ability of the Iraqi army to fight them. However, the memo on Tuesday did not acknowledge underestimating ISIS, as Obama said on \"60 Minutes.\"",
    " Title: Obama to Address United Nations, Warns Iran on Nuclear Ambitions and Pays Tribute to Ambassador Chris Stevens\n\nIn a significant address to the United Nations General Assembly today, President Barack Obama will issue a stern warning to Iran regarding its nuclear program, emphasizing the United States' resolve to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\nAccording to excerpts released by the White House, President Obama will say, \"America wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy, and we believe that there is still time and space to do so. But that time is not unlimited.\" He will further state, \"Make no mistake: a nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained. It would threaten the elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations, and the stability of the global economy.\"\n\nThe President's address comes in the wake of the September 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, where Ambassador Chris Stevens lost his life. In his speech, Obama is expected to pay tribute to Ambassador Stevens.\n\nPresident Obama's address is one of many speeches scheduled this week, as world leaders gather for the annual opening of the United Nations General Assembly. The U.N. webcasts its proceedings, and updates will be posted as the President and other leaders address the assembly.\n\nThe President's speech, of course, takes place amidst the ongoing U.S. presidential campaign. Republican candidate Mitt Romney, in a statement on Monday, criticized President Obama's foreign affairs leadership, particularly in reference to the killing of the U.S. ambassador in Libya and the ongoing crisis in Syria.\n\nBoth Obama and Romney are also scheduled to address the Clinton Global Initiative today. The week ahead promises to be a busy one for diplomacy, with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu among the other leaders who will be speaking.",
    " Title: International Community Rallies to Aid in Search for Abducted Nigerian Schoolgirls as Boko Haram Expands Terror Tactics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the mass abduction of hundreds of schoolgirls by the militant group Boko Haram, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has vowed that the group's actions will be the terror group's undoing. The abduction, which occurred on April 14 from an all-girls school in rural northeastern Nigeria, has sparked international outrage and a concerted effort to locate the missing girls.\n\nAccording to U.S. Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, U.S. intelligence believes the 276 girls have been split up, making the search for them more challenging. This sentiment is echoed by former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the U.N.'s special envoy for global education, who emphasizes the importance of finding the girls before they are dispersed across Africa.\n\nThe girls have not been seen since their abduction from the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok. Another kidnapping occurred on Sunday night, with villagers in Warabe accusing Boko Haram militants of taking at least eight girls between the ages of 12 and 15.\n\nShehu Sani, a former negotiator between Boko Haram and the government, believes the group targeted the girls to force concessions from the Nigerian government. Sani suggests that the group may be seeking the release of its followers from prisons.\n\nThe Nigerian government has been under fire for its response to the abduction, with critics claiming that government officials failed to take action in the hours and days following the girls' disappearance. President Jonathan, who waited three weeks before speaking to the nation on the matter, and his security ministers have defended the response, stating that efforts were underway but could not be disclosed publicly.\n\nIn response to the crisis, the United States, United Kingdom, China, and France have offered assistance in the search for the girls. The United States is sending a team of law enforcement experts and military advisers, while France will send a \"specialized team\" to help. The British government is also sending a small team, and China has promised to provide any intelligence gathered by its satellite network.\n\nSeven members of the U.S. military are scheduled to arrive in Nigeria on Friday to join a team of advisers supporting the Nigerian efforts to rescue the girls. There are currently no plans to send U.S. combat troops, according to Rear Adm. Kirby.\n\nNigerian security chiefs have appealed to the public for help in locating the missing girls. The chief of defense, Air Marshal Alex S. Badeh, called on members of the immediate community to provide security agencies with useful information that will lead to the rescue of the girls.\n\nBoko Haram, which translates to \"Western education is sin\" in the local Hausa language, has been known to kill Muslim clerics who dare criticize them. The United States has branded Boko Haram a terror organization and has put a $7 million bounty on its leader, Abubakar Shekau.\n\nThe Nigerian government has offered a reward of about $310,000 for information leading to the girls' rescue. The search for the missing girls must expand to neighboring countries, including Niger, Cameroon, and Chad, according to Gordon Brown. The international community remains hopeful that the girls will be found and returned to their families.",
    " Title: U.S. Government Shutdown Enters 12th Day as Trump and Congressional Leaders Fail to Reach Agreement on Border Wall Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A meeting between U.S. congressional leaders and President Donald Trump on Wednesday failed to produce an agreement to end the partial government shutdown now in its 12th day, as the president continued to demand $5 billion in funding for a border wall with Mexico, a demand fiercely opposed by Democrats.\n\nCongressional leaders are expected to return to the White House on Friday to resume talks, signaling the shutdown will likely stretch into the weekend. The White House convened the meeting to try to convince Democrats that funding a wall on the southern border was a pressing security need. Instead, Democratic leaders cut off Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's presentation and tried, unsuccessfully, to press Trump to accept their offer.\n\n\"It just was not a credible presentation,\" Senator Dick Durbin said of the briefing. He added that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to be elected House speaker on Thursday, insisted the conversation focus instead on the shutdown.\n\nPelosi said the House would proceed with plans to hold votes on Thursday, when they formally take control of the chamber from Trump's fellow Republicans, on legislation that would end the shutdown without providing the wall money sought by Trump.\n\n\"We're asking the president to open up government,\" Pelosi told reporters outside the White House after the meeting.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said afterward on the Senate floor that the chamber would not vote on the legislation, calling it a \"political sideshow\" and \"total nonstarter.\"\n\nDemocrats say they want to fund most of the government through September, but allow for another month to negotiate wall funding by only partially funding the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for the wall. Schumer said Trump conceded that Republicans would lose leverage if they allowed the rest of the government to be funded.\n\n\"We asked him to give us one good reason... why you should continue your shutdown of the eight Cabinet departments while we are debating our differences on homeland security. He could not give a good answer,\" Schumer told reporters after the meeting.\n\nIn a tweet on Wednesday evening, Trump called the meeting \"important\" and said he would continue talks with Democrats \"to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe.\"\n\nTrump's demand for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border triggered the shutdown affecting about a quarter of the federal government and 800,000 federal workers. Before meeting with lawmakers, Trump said the shutdown would last for \"as long as it takes\" as he pushes for wall money as part of any legislation to reopen agencies shuttered when their funding lapsed on Dec. 22.\n\n\"It could be a long time, or it could be quickly,\" Trump told reporters on Wednesday during a Cabinet meeting. \"We know that we have a challenge along the border. We want to solve that issue. We want to make sure we open this government up. And I think at the end of the day, the president, listening to him, he wants to solve this as well.\"\n\nPelosi noted that the legislation being presented in the House had previously won backing in the Senate, which will remain in Republican hands in the new 2019-2020 Congress that convenes on Thursday.\n\nBut McConnell said previously that Senate Republicans would not approve a spending measure Trump does not support.\n\nTrump made the border wall a key part of his presidential campaign. Before meeting with the Democrats, Trump called the border a \"sieve,\" rebutted Pelosi's complaint that a wall was immoral, provided an estimate of the U.S. illegal immigrant population far higher than the figures most experts cite and made disputed comments about progress toward building a wall.\n\nThe visit by Pelosi and Schumer was their first to the White House since their sharp exchange with Trump in the Oval Office on Dec. 11 during which the president told them he would be \"proud to shut down the government for border security.\"\n\nThe $5 billion Trump is seeking would cover only a portion of the money needed for a border wall, a project estimated to cost about $23 billion. Trump had said Mexico would pay for the wall, but Mexico has refused.",
    " Title: West Point Graduation Ceremony Held Amidst COVID-19 Outbreak, 1.5% of Graduating Class Tests Positive\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and concern, the United States Military Academy at West Point held an in-person graduation ceremony on June 13, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The event, which was attended by President Donald Trump, resulted in 1.5% of the graduating class testing positive for the virus.\n\nArmy spokesperson Emanuel L. Ortiz confirmed the positive cases in an emailed statement, stating that none of the affected students were symptomatic, and no cadet contracted the virus through person-to-person contact while under the Army's care.\n\nThe decision to hold an in-person ceremony was met with criticism, as many believed it was unnecessary and potentially dangerous. In March, as West Point leaders discussed whether to return students currently on spring break to campus, President Trump announced his intention to attend the ceremony, a move that reportedly took academy officials by surprise and required them to improvise their plans.\n\nSecretary of Defense Mark Esper addressed Naval Academy graduates virtually last month, and even the Air Force Academy, which kept seniors on campus during the outbreak, welcomed Vice President Mike Pence for a commencement event with social distancing protocols in place and no spectators. However, Trump's insistence on a more traditional ceremony, with the potential for a larger audience, has been a point of contention.\n\nLt. Gen. Darryl Williams, the academy's superintendent, stated that returning cadets would be \"segregated the entire time\" into five cohorts, with no cohort intermingling for 14 days. \"They'll eat separately, they'll live separately,\" he said.\n\nThe Army has struggled to justify Trump's decision, which required hundreds of future soldiers to return to a region of the country that has been hit especially hard by the coronavirus. Ryan McCarthy, the Army's top civilian leader, stated that cadets would have needed to return to campus anyway \"to begin the process of the physicals they need, to take all of their clearance procedures, to clear barracks, get their personal items.\" However, this process could have been spaced out in a way that would have ensured greater safety for cadets.\n\nThe decision has caused an uproar on the West Point Parents Facebook group, with many expressing concern over the potential risks associated with the ceremony. \"PLEASE PLEASE do NOT let your children go back for graduation. It's not worth their health or yours,\" one person wrote. Others have contextualized Trump's mandate by comparing it to typical orders from a commander in chief, including those that send cadets off to war.\n\nThe West Point graduation ceremony has become a contentious issue, with some viewing it as a necessary part of the military tradition, while others see it as a potential health risk in the midst of a global pandemic. As the United States continues to grapple with COVID-19, the decision to hold an in-person ceremony at West Point will likely remain a topic of debate.",
    " Title: Reddit Faces Allegations of Censorship After Quarantining 'European' Subreddit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and accusations of censorship, administrators at the popular online forum Reddit have quarantined a subreddit titled 'European.' The subreddit, which is a community dedicated to specific topics, was set to private on May 12, 2016, with a note stating, \"You must be a moderator or approved submitter to visit.\" The note also urged visitors to continue their discussions on Voat, another online forum.\n\nThe allegation of censorship comes amidst recent debates about bias in social media. This accusation followed anonymous claims that contractors at Facebook deliberately suppressed conservative news on the site's Trending Topics section. Facebook has since denied any political bias, stating there is \"no evidence\" of the alleged activity.\n\nReddit, in response to FoxNews.com's inquiry, stated that the 'European' subreddit violated the forum's content policy. The statement explained, \"Quarantines on Reddit are rare - there are thousands of vibrant conversations flourishing on the site every day.\" It added, \"Subreddits are quarantined only when the content is clearly offensive to the broader Reddit community.\"\n\nThe quarantine aims to prevent the content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not wish to do so. \"A subreddit is quarantined when there are concerns that its content is extreme and could be offensive to people outside of that community,\" explained Reddit. \"The quarantine process doesn\u2019t end the conversation; it adds an opt-in measure so that people have the choice to join the conversation,\" it added.\n\nRestrictions on a quarantined subreddit include requiring an explicit opt-in, requiring an account with a verified email address, no use of custom images, and the removal of revenue generation.\n\nThe 'European' subreddit quarantine has prompted a mixed reaction elsewhere on Reddit. Some users claim that racist views were expressed on the subreddit, while others argue that it hosted a range of opinions and emphasize the importance of open dialogue.\n\nWith over 277 million unique visitors last month, Reddit uses teams of volunteers to moderate subreddits. The forum updated its content policy last year, consolidating multiple rules and policies into a single set of guidelines.\n\nRecently, a blogger, who uses the name Curious Gnu, analyzed a Reddit dataset of 4.6 million comments and noted that 78 percent of Reddit threads with over 1,000 comments mention Nazis or Hitler. The blogger found that around 2.6 percent of comments in the 'European' subreddit mentioned Nazis or Hitler, a slightly higher percentage compared to the 'AskHistorians' and 'history' subreddits.\n\nThis incident, along with the ongoing debate about bias in social media, highlights the challenges of maintaining a balance between free speech and offensive content on these platforms.",
    " Title: Justice Department Increases Investigations into Classified Information Leaks by 27 Ongoing Probes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Justice Department has revealed that it is currently conducting 27 open investigations into leaks of classified information with a \"political motive.\" This number is three times higher than the number of such investigations in the three years prior, as stated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions during his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday.\n\nSessions, in his testimony, described the current state of leaks as reaching \"epidemic proportions.\" He explained that these investigations include cases where the leaks occurred before President Trump took office and cases that occurred after.\n\nRep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) questioned Sessions about accountability for leaking information against the Trump administration with a political motive. Sessions responded by referring to the case of former National Security Agency contractor Reality Winner, who leaked a classified intelligence report containing \"Top Secret Level\" information.\n\nSessions stated, \"It can not be allowed to continue and we will do our best effort to ensure it does not continue.\"\n\nThe increased investigations come amid pressure from the White House, with President Trump criticizing Sessions in July for being \"weak\" on such issues. Following the president's comments, Sessions held a press conference with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, calling for an end to the leaks.\n\nIn July, a report from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee revealed that the Trump administration was facing an \"alarming\" and \"unprecedented\" cascade of media leaks that posed a potential danger to national security. The report estimated that the administration has dealt with roughly one leak per day.\n\nThe report also stated that leaks flowed about \"seven times faster\" under the Trump administration than during the first 126 days of both Obama's and George W. Bush's presidencies.\n\nIn July, the Senate report also revealed that Reality Winner, the accused leaker, had expressed a desire to \"resist\" the Trump administration. Winner was an avid supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign.",
    " Title: US Designates North Korea as State Sponsor of Terrorism, Escalating Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that escalates tensions between the United States and North Korea, President Donald Trump has designated North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. The announcement was made during a Cabinet meeting on Monday, with Trump stating, \"Should have happened a long time ago.\" The administration will unveil new sanctions against North Korea on Tuesday.\n\nThe designation places North Korea alongside Iran, Sudan, and Syria as the only countries on the state sponsors of terrorism list. This classification bars them from receiving US development assistance, bans defense sales to them, restricts exports of items that could potentially be used for military purposes, and imposes tougher financial restrictions.\n\nThe decision comes as part of Trump's \"maximum pressure campaign\" to punish and isolate North Korea for its continued development of missiles capable of reaching the US mainland with a nuclear weapon. However, the actual support for terrorism, the primary reason for a country to be placed on the list, is debatable.\n\nAdministration lawyers noted that North Korea had to commit more than one act of terrorism to warrant placement on the list. The Trump administration officials assert that the February assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's estranged half-brother in Malaysia was an act of terrorism. However, there is no agreement as to whether the brutal death of Otto Warmbier, a 23-year-old US citizen released by North Korea this summer who returned home in a coma, constituted terrorism.\n\nNorth Korea was previously on the state sponsor of terror list, but was removed during talks aimed at getting the country to halt its nuclear program under President George W. Bush. The move is unlikely to stop North Korea's nuclear program, as the country has shown no interest in giving up its nuclear arsenal and continues to improve its missile and nuclear programs despite heavy sanctions.\n\nThe designation is unlikely to change North Korea's behavior in any meaningful way, as the country has no interest in giving up its nuclear program and is already heavily sanctioned by the US, China, and Europe. The move may inflict further financial pain on North Korea, but it is unlikely to achieve Trump's ultimate goal of stopping North Korea's nuclear program.",
    " Title: Candidates' Post-Election Actions and Calls for Electoral System Reforms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, Green Party candidate Jill Stein has raised over $4 million in three days for a recount in three critical Rust Belt states, citing a \"hack-riddled election.\" Meanwhile, Republican Governor Pat McCrory of North Carolina, who trails his opponent, Attorney General Roy Cooper, by more than 7,000 votes, has alleged fraudulent votes in the election.\n\nStein's recount efforts are focused on Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, where Trump's victory margin remains narrow. A team of researchers, including J. Alex Halderman, director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society, found discrepancies in some key Wisconsin counties won by Trump. However, election experts, such as Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight, have suggested that the results are better explained by demographics rather than hacking.\n\nIn North Carolina, Governor McCrory's allegations of fraud have faced pushback. Preliminary analyses suggest that a list of supposedly fraudulent voters was largely inaccurate, with most of the names listed as ineligible found to be valid voters. County election boards, run by Republicans, have also found little evidence of voter wrongdoing.\n\nThe actions of Stein and McCrory, despite being on opposite sides of the political spectrum, highlight the divisiveness of the 2016 election and the need for increased public confidence in the electoral system. Some election experts argue that regular audits of voting machines would provide safeguards against hackers and improve voter peace of mind.\n\nJ. Alex Halderman, in a Medium post, wrote that examining the physical evidence in these states, even if it finds nothing amiss, will help allay doubt and give voters justified confidence that the results are accurate. Halderman has demonstrated that some American voting machines can be hacked.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has remained silent on Stein's recount gambit, with some suggesting that the hacking complaints are ironic given the Democrats' condemnation of Trump's claims of a \"rigged\" election. The Clinton campaign's silence has led some to view Stein's protest as a way to channel liberal anger towards a hopeless goal and feed into a narrative that American democracy is fragile.\n\nHowever, others argue that statistical audits of electronic voting results in key states should be a routine safeguard, not just an emergency measure. Andy Greenberg, writing in Wired, suggests that such audits would help ease serious, lingering doubts about America's much-maligned electoral security.\n\nIn North Carolina, Governor McCrory's allegations of fraud have faced pushback, with some accusing him of trying to steal the election by invoking a state law that allows the legislature to anoint a governor in a \"contested\" election and bars anyone from suing in state courts over such a decision.\n\nThe willingness to invoke the potential of fraud has, to some extent, dovetailed with emerging cyberthreats to ring fresh alarm bells about the US voting system. At the very least, recent hacks of the Democratic Party and state voter registration systems suggest that those keen to disrupt the US system are probing its defenses.\n\nReforms suggested to improve the electoral system include bolder safeguards against insider wrongdoing, more federal funding to upgrade aging voting machines, and, critically, automatic paper-trail audits. About 70 percent of US voting machines leave a paper trail, but randomized checks are done only upon request.\n\n\"It is vital that we protect voters from the real threats to the integrity of elections,\" Myrna Perez, a law professor at the New York University School of Law, wrote in a Brennan Center report from earlier this year. \"Fortunately, it is possible to protect election integrity without disenfranchising eligible voters.\"",
    " Title: Trump and Pence Seek Momentum Shift Ahead of Second Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the second presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton approaches, Mike Pence, the Republican vice presidential nominee, is under pressure to deliver a strong performance in an attempt to build on the momentum created by his vice presidential debate victory over Tim Kaine.\n\nPence's performance at the vice presidential debate on Tuesday was widely seen as a success, with the Indiana governor outperforming his Democratic counterpart. This victory comes at a crucial time for the Trump campaign, which has been struggling in recent weeks due to an ineffective debate performance, a feud with a former Miss Universe, damaging tax revelations, and a steady slide in opinion polls.\n\nAt a rally in Henderson, Nevada, on Wednesday, Trump praised Pence, saying, \"Mike Pence did an incredible job. I'm getting a lot of credit because that's really my first so-called choice; that's really my first hire, as we would say in Las Vegas.\"\n\nThe stakes are high for Trump as he prepares to face Clinton in St. Louis on October 9. Tobe Berkovitz, a Boston University professor who specializes in political communications, said, \"How many times have all the pundits been interviewed saying, 'Trump is finally finished'? That must have happened 10 times. The problem now is the clock is running down. We'll be at four weeks, three weeks, two weeks. Can he pull the rabbit out of the hat one more time?\"\n\nWith the second debate now of increased importance, there are reports that the Trump team is taking a more focused approach to debate preparations. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, an early Trump supporter and skilled debater, is reportedly involved in the debate preparations.\n\nHowever, some Republicans are skeptical about how much ground Trump can make up at this stage. GOP strategist and Hill contributor Matt Mackowiak said, \"Now it's up to him. It's like coaching versus playing. Coaches can prepare you and they can have the right play calls. But at the end of the day, the player on the field has to go do it. So far, Trump has fallen short. He really needs to win decisively on Sunday.\"\n\nNumerous recent polls show the scale of the challenge Trump faces. A new poll from Monmouth University shows him trailing Clinton by 2 percentage points in Ohio, a state that has been one of the most favorable battleground states for the GOP nominee. Another new survey, from WRAL-TV and Survey USA, shows Trump trailing in North Carolina by 2 points. A national poll from Reuters/IPSOS gives Clinton a 6-point edge.\n\nThe data forecasting site FiveThirtyEight gives Clinton a 76.2 percent chance of prevailing in its \"poll-only\" forecast as of Wednesday evening, her highest rating by that measure since late August. However, the polls of the race have swung wildly before.\n\nClinton has twice led the RealClearPolitics national polling average by more than 6 points\u2014in mid-June and early August\u2014only to have Trump narrow those leads down to virtually nothing. Some Clinton critics maintain that she could yet be pushed off track by an external event, such as an unforced error or damaging disclosures from an organization such as WikiLeaks, which published embarrassing emails between Democratic National Committee staffers as the party's convention began this summer in Philadelphia.\n\nHowever, a WikiLeaks news conference earlier this week failed to live up to the hype that surrounded it, casting doubt on whether the organization can follow through on its threats. Republicans also warn that Trump and his supporters can't depend on a lucky break. The nominee himself, they say, needs to wrest back the initiative from Clinton.\n\n\"Hope is not a strategy,\" said Mackowiak. \"More of the same is not going to change the trajectory of the race. He needs to demonstrate at this next debate that he is prepared to be president\u2014and that he can force Hillary Clinton back on defense.\"\n\nIn 2012, President Obama gave a lackluster performance at his opening clash with GOP nominee Mitt Romney and fell sharply in the polls afterward. However, Vice President Biden acquitted himself well against Romney's running mate, future Speaker Paul Ryan, and Obama was much improved when he met Romney a second and third time.\n\nSunday's debate will be in a town-hall format, but there is no consensus among insiders as to whether that helps or hinders Trump. Some backers suggest it will make it easier for Trump to feed off the energy of the crowd. Skeptics counter that televised town halls are technically challenging, in terms of tone and body language, and that a small, mostly quiet audience creates a very different atmosphere from the rambunctious rallies where Trump thrives.\n\nBut what if Trump surpasses expectations and reels in Clinton's lead one more time? \"He would be the turnaround master of the decade if he pulls that off,\" said Berkovitz.",
    " Title: Trump's Military Pardons Spark Controversy Over War Crimes and Military Discipline\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of controversial moves, President Donald Trump granted clemency to three military figures accused of war crimes on November 15, arguing that the decisions would give troops the confidence to fight without worrying about potential legal overreach. However, Defense Secretary Mark Esper fired the Navy's top official, Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, on Sunday, alleging that Spencer proposed a deal with the White House behind his back to resolve the case of Eddie Gallagher, one of the military figures pardoned.\n\nThe pardons have sparked criticism from both sides, with critics arguing that they undermine military discipline and send a message that U.S. forces will be allowed to get away with anything.\n\n\"War crimes are not difficult to discern... The actions these men were accused of most definitely qualify as war crimes,\" said one critic, citing instances of killing civilians and prisoners. \"By sanctioning illegal behavior, the president has not strengthened our armed forces. By undercutting a military justice system that enforces those guiding principles, the president has not strengthened our armed forces. Instead, he endangers the safety of our troops, giving our adversaries a green light to similarly mistreat men and women who serve honorably in our military,\" the critic added.\n\nTrump's actions have been criticized for undermining principles that have long served as a bedrock for the armed forces, and for damaging the nation's moral compass. \"A nation has to know that military action being taken in its name follows morally defensible rules - that soldiers do not, for instance, kill unarmed civilians or prisoners,\" said another critic. \"To excuse men who have so flagrantly violated those rules - to treat them as heroes, even - is to cast the idea of just war to the winds.\"\n\nThe president's interventions in these cases and those of two other service members undercut military leadership and dishonor the men and women who serve their country while upholding - not abandoning - its values. The SEAL team, in particular, has been shaken by a series of scandals in recent years, prompting Navy officials to take a tougher stance on ethical issues. Restoring to service someone who was turned in by members of his unit who wouldn't tolerate his behavior sends precisely the wrong message.\n\nThe damage was compounded on Sunday with news that Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer was being forced out. The commander in chief's corrupting influence is ever widening. Through these pardons, and his earlier unprecedented interventions as these cases were making their way through the justice system, the president has undermined principles that long have served as a bedrock for our armed forces.\n\nThe president may feel like he's righting a wrong, but he's damaging the nation's moral compass. The president has the undisputed power to pardon. Indeed, he should use it more often in cases where guilt or a fair trial are in genuine doubt. But that power can not be exercised without a cost, in this case injury to the morality of a nation that once held its own to account.\n\nTraditionally, presidents do not micromanage military personnel decisions at this level. It's bad for morale and can prove disruptive to the chain of command. The SEALs are the best judge of who should or shouldn't be counted in their ranks. We should leave them to conduct their business in accordance with the rules.",
    " Title: Republican Senators Oppose Motion to Dismiss Impeachment Charges Against Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - Republican members of the U.S. Senate have expressed opposition to any attempt to dismiss the impeachment charges against President Donald Trump without a trial. The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives is expected to formally send the charges to the Senate this week, where Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to help acquit his fellow Republican.\n\nTrump appeared to reverse his position on how the Senate should proceed, writing on Twitter that a full trial would give the Democrats who pursued impeachment undeserved credibility and signaling support for dismissal of the charges with no trial. However, Republican senators have shown little interest in a motion to dismiss the House charges.\n\n\"There is almost no interest\" among Republican senators for a motion to dismiss the House charges, Republican Senator Roy Blunt told reporters on Monday. Republican Senator Mitt Romney also stated that he will not be supporting a motion to dismiss, and that the allegations made against Trump are serious and deserve consideration.\n\nSenator Susan Collins, among a handful of Republicans whom Democrats hope to persuade to back their call for witness testimony, told reporters that she and a small group of colleagues were discussing a trial format that would allow lawmakers to vote on whether to include witnesses after hearing from each side and having the opportunity to pose questions.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi delayed sending the two articles of impeachment passed by the House on Dec. 18 to the Republican-led Senate, preventing McConnell from holding a quick trial right away that cleared the president. The House charged Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The impeachment charges stem from Trump's request that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the Nov. 3 presidential election.\n\nHouse Democrats will discuss on Tuesday morning how to move forward, with the chamber possibly voting to send the charges to the Senate later that day. Pelosi said the delay was meant to convince the U.S. public of the need to call witnesses in the Senate trial after Trump's administration blocked some current and former officials from cooperating in the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nMcConnell has yet to say definitively how the Senate will conduct the trial. He has not committed to allowing any witnesses or new documents in the proceedings and instead could steer the process toward a quick acquittal. McConnell has left open the possibility of deciding on witness testimony later in the trial. He has said he sees no chance of the Senate convicting Trump.\n\nThe Senate, which could open a trial rapidly after receiving the charges from the House, plans to meet daily except on Sundays each week to conduct the proceedings, likely beginning each day at noon EST (1700 GMT) and working until either 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. EST (2200 or 2300 GMT), according to congressional aides. The Senate is expected to vote to acquit Trump, even though some moderate Republicans have bristled over McConnell's reflexive support for the president. Conviction and removal of Trump would require a two-thirds majority of those present in the 100-member chamber.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Addresses Election Loss, Media Coverage, and Future Plans in Commencement Speech at Wellesley\n\nIn a candid and reflective speech at the Wellesley College commencement ceremony, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acknowledged her role in her 2016 presidential campaign's missteps while attributing her election loss to factors largely beyond her control.\n\n\"I take responsibility for every decision I made, but that's not why I lost,\" Clinton stated.\n\nThe former first lady criticized the media coverage of her campaign as \"unprecedented\" and pointed to \"weaponized information\" from fake news sites as significant factors in her unsuccessful bid for the presidency. Clinton recounted instances where her warnings about Russian interference in the election were dismissed, and the media failed to cover the issue adequately.\n\n\"Over the summer, we went and told anyone we could find that the Russians were messing with the election, and we were basically shooed away,\" Clinton said. \"We couldn't get the press to cover it.\"\n\nClinton also addressed the media's coverage of her private email scandal, stating, \"They covered it like it was Pearl Harbor.\" She emphasized that the email controversy was one of the primary issues that affected her campaign, but she had no control over Russian interference.\n\nClinton further criticized social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, stating that they have been \"victimized by deliberate efforts to shape the conversation and push it towards conspiracies, lies, false information.\"\n\nIn her speech, Clinton admitted her imperfections as a candidate, stating, \"I never said I was a perfect candidate, and I certainly have never said I ran perfect campaigns\u2014but I do not know who is, or did.\" She acknowledged that there were things her campaign could have done differently but suggested that such reflections could be applied to any campaign.\n\nLooking ahead, Clinton revealed that she is getting involved with political action organizations, including \"Onward Together,\" which she founded this month. \"I'm not going anywhere,\" she said. \"I have a big stake in what's happening to this country.\"\n\nClinton's speech provided a rare glimpse into her thoughts on her election loss and her plans for the future, offering insights into the former secretary of state's reflections on her political career and her continued engagement in American politics.",
    " Title: Google's Algorithm Prioritizes Relevance and Quality Over Political Ideology, but Inequalities in Media Resources Remain\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, Google has emphasized its commitment to optimizing search results based on relevance and high-quality content, rather than political ideology. However, the question arises: what if relevance and quality are not evenly distributed across the media landscape?\n\nTo illustrate this point, let's consider some markers of relevance (timeliness, impact, keyword density) and quality (originality, sourcing, depth). Applying a ranking algorithm to the work of mainstream media, which includes major networks, newspapers, and digital sites that adhere to traditional journalistic values, would result in these outlets ranking higher due to their larger staffs, better-trained journalists, and deeper roots in the field.\n\nFor instance, The New York Times and The Washington Post, with their combined thousands of journalists, generated over a billion dollars in subscription revenue last year. In contrast, many right-wing outlets are embedded within advocacy groups, such as The Daily Signal from the Heritage Foundation, or are small blogs lacking the human resources for original reporting. Outlets like HotAir, which was cited by Bolyard, have only four editors (one of whom is pseudonymous), while The Blaze, another outlet mentioned by Bolyard, is reportedly down to fewer than 50 employees. The Weekly Standard, another right-wing media organization, appears to have an editorial staff of only 35.\n\nLeft-leaning outlets like Salon and DailyKos should not expect to compete with The New York Times in Google placement for similar reasons. Furthermore, some right-wing media organizations do not adhere to the standards of journalism as recognized by the mainstream media, peddling conspiracy theories or engaging in ethically questionable reporting practices.\n\nGoogle's concept of relevance is caught in a loop between what people want and what they think it provides. Google sees pages as relevant if people engage with them, but people trust Google to serve up relevant content, so they engage with what Google shows them. Defining quality among journalism experts is challenging, and while some indicators of credibility have been laid out, Google has had a difficult time defining what journalistic value means in machine-readable terms.\n\nWhile some things can be measured (e.g., the number of fresh quotes in a story from new sources, the number of links to other high-quality sites, the amount of time readers spend with a story, or the variety of readers engaging with a story), none of these indicators are foolproof measures of quality. The algorithm will rank many great stories poorly, and the system can, to a limited extent, be gamed. It's far from perfect.\n\nIn conclusion, while Google's commitment to prioritizing relevant and high-quality content is commendable, the inequalities in media resources and the challenges in defining and measuring quality remain significant issues in the digital age.",
    " Title: Empowering Local Communities: A Guide to Investigating Local Police Departments and Advocating for Change\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of ongoing protests against racism and police violence, many individuals are seeking ways to effect change in their local communities. While the focus is often on large cities, it's crucial to remember that every resident, regardless of location, can contribute to the cause. Here's a guide on how to investigate your local police department, educate yourself, and advocate for change.\n\nBefore diving in, it's essential to collaborate with local black-led activist groups. Avoid duplicating efforts and instead, learn about their initiatives and find out how you can support them.\n\nIf you aim to abolish, defund, or reform the police, gathering information and building support is crucial. An essential part of this process is shedding light on the actions of the police in your community.\n\nInvestigative reporter Andrew Ford, from ProPublica, offers insights into this process. While you don't need a job at a media outlet to start asking questions and making public records requests, Ford emphasizes the importance of understanding the laws and policies that govern police operations in your area.\n\nTo begin, ask your department for their policies on practices of concern, such as restraining suspects, the use of pepper spray, or Tasers. You may also need to request rules set by a county or state authority. Request written copies, and if necessary, file a formal public records request. If there is no existing written policy, this might be worth questioning.\n\nAnother crucial policy to investigate is the records retention policy. This information includes what records must be kept, and for how long. These may include police reports, use-of-force reports, 911 call recordings, and body camera footage.\n\nThe Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press provides a clickable map with body camera policies for many cities, and a list of state laws on 911 call recordings, to help you get started.\n\nThese tools will help you understand the actions of the police in your area. Don't forget to also check with your local government\u2014the town council, perhaps\u2014for information about how they spend their budget and how much of it goes toward policing. Then, gather with other residents, make a plan, and work together to make your town safer.\n\nFor those seeking ways to advocate for black lives, here's a list of resources to guide your efforts.",
    " Title: U.S. Deploys F-22 Stealth Fighters to South Korea Amidst North Korea's War Threats\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has sent two F-22 stealth fighter jets to South Korea to participate in joint military exercises, following North Korea's declaration that the Korean Peninsula is in a \"state of war.\" The Pentagon confirmed to Fox News that the F-22 Raptors were deployed to Osan Air Base in South Korea from Japan on Sunday, supporting ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills.\n\nAccording to Pentagon spokesman George Little, the exercise, known as Foal Eagle, is part of the air component of the ongoing drills. The Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea, led by Kim Jong Un, held its annual spring parliamentary session on Monday, following a ruling party declaration that nuclear bomb building and a stronger economy are the nation's top priorities.\n\nNorth Korea's recent threats, including vows of nuclear strikes on South Korea and the U.S., have been a recurring theme in the lead-up to the session. In a statement released Sunday, U.S. military in South Korea urged North Korea to exercise restraint. \"North Korea will achieve nothing by threats or provocations, which will only further isolate North Korea and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in Northeast Asia,\" the statement said.\n\nOn Saturday, North Korea stated that its armed forces would strike U.S. bases in its mainland, as well as in Hawaii and Guam. Kim Jong Un also threatened to shut down the border factory complex, the last major symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAnalysts believe that North Korea's threats are part of an effort to provoke the new government in Seoul to change its policies toward Pyongyang and to secure diplomatic talks with Washington in order to receive more aid. The White House has stated that the U.S. is taking North Korea's threats seriously, but has also noted Pyongyang's history of \"bellicose rhetoric.\"\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. military officials revealed that two B-2 stealth bombers dropped dummy munitions on an uninhabited South Korean island as part of annual defense drills that Pyongyang sees as rehearsals for invasion. Hours later, Kim ordered his generals to put rockets on standby and threatened to strike American targets if provoked.\n\nMilitary analysts have stated that a full-scale conflict between North and South Korea is extremely unlikely, as the Korean Peninsula has remained in a technical state of war for 60 years. However, the North's continued threats toward South Korea and the United States have raised concerns that a misjudgment between the sides could lead to a clash.\n\nIn addition to the military exercise, the U.S. will strengthen its defenses against a potential North Korean missile attack by adding more than a dozen missile interceptors to the 26 already in place at Fort Greely, Alaska. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel made the announcement.",
    " Title: Apple Unveils Apple Pay, Apple Watch, and HealthKit Amid Privacy Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to redefine the market for 'wearables', Apple has launched new products focused on mobile payments and health and fitness, with an emphasis on security and privacy. The tech giant unveiled Apple Pay, a mobile payment system, and the long-awaited Apple Watch, which comes with a set of sensors for fitness tracking and heart rate monitoring.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook introduced Apple Pay, a system that could potentially disrupt the credit card industry. The system allows users to complete transactions by holding their phone up to a retail sensor and using the Touch ID to authenticate the payment. Apple Pay uses Near Field Communications technology and Touch ID fingerprint identification to ensure secure transactions.\n\nFollowing the introduction of Apple Pay, the company unveiled the Apple Watch, which comes in three styles and various colors. The device can detect heartbeats, set fitness goals, and reward users for achieving fitness milestones. Jony Ive, Apple's lead designer, said, \"You can share something as personal as your own heartbeat.\"\n\nThe Apple Watch is part of Apple's strategy to redefine the market for 'wearables', devices that people use to track their fitness and health. The company sees potential for these devices to become an integral and profitable part of the U.S. health care system.\n\nHowever, the introduction of Apple Watch and HealthKit, an application framework open to third-party developers, raises privacy concerns. With the HealthKit app, consumers can wear their health and fitness information on their sleeves with the new Apple Watch. Apple has implemented strict guidelines to address these concerns, including a ban on storing information in iCloud and a promise not to sell data to data brokers.\n\nThe launch of these new products comes a week after a website published nude celebrity photos from Apple phones, sparking concerns about privacy and security. Apple contends that its iCloud was not hacked, but rather thieves individually hacked victims' personal ID passwords.\n\nApple's focus on security and privacy is a response to growing consumer concerns about retail hacks and breaches. The company emphasizes that it does not store credit card numbers, collect any retail transaction information, or share data with anyone. Apple Pay is estimated to make about $12 billion a day and more than $4 trillion a year.\n\nIn the mHealth space, Apple is not the first player, but the company is aiming to be better than most. Morgan Reed, executive director of the Association for Competitive Technology, said, \"eHealth is going to be huge; $2.7 trillion of the American economy is spent on health care and hundreds of billions on health IT, and Apple wants a piece of that.\"",

Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III also voiced his criticism of the state's response, stating, \"Unfortunately, as the unrest grew and further assistance was needed, the National Guard was not deployed in enough time to save all of our businesses.\"\n\nAccording to police reports, there were 21 fires in and around Ferguson by Tuesday afternoon, at least 150 gunshots, and damage to 10 police cruisers. In some instances, firefighters were forced to retreat from battling fires due to gunfire and objects being thrown.\n\nThe law enforcement's response has been questioned, with some criticizing their approach as too tame, while others defend it as an attempt to allow protesters to demonstrate peacefully. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar and other officials defended their response, stating that they took steps to de-escalate the situation but that the magnitude of the violence was beyond their control.\n\nChief Belmar explained that the initial, hands-off tactics by the police were intended to allow protesters to demonstrate peacefully, but he admitted that the situation ultimately grew so unstable that it required a more forceful approach. He also acknowledged that despite months of preparation and training, and a buildup of manpower, equipment, and technology, he had not foreseen the chaos that ultimately unfolded.\n\nAmong the more than 60 people arrested on various charges including second-degree burglary and arson, most were Missouri residents, a shift, some here said, from the unrest of the summer. The ongoing investigation is expected to provide more insights into the causes and motivations behind the violence.",

The tech companies are accused of using their market dominance to protect their market share or to expand into adjacent markets.\n\nFTC Chairman Joe Simons declined to rule out an enforcement action based on the results of the study, stating, \"All options are on the table.\" The tech giants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe agency asked for information about deals that were done between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2019. The orders require each company to identify transactions that were too small to report to the FTC and the Department of Justice, which assess mergers to ensure they comply with antitrust law.\n\n\"The commission plans to use the information obtained in this study to examine trends in acquisitions and the structure of deals, including whether acquisitions not subject to (antitrust) notification might have raised competitive concerns,\" the statement said.\n\nThe tech industry has faced criticism from both political sides, with Republicans expressing concerns about the alleged suppression of conservative voices on social media and Democrats expressing concerns about increasing consolidation.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, a presidential candidate, has explicitly called for federal regulators to undo \"ant-competitive mergers,\" including Amazon's purchases of Whole Foods and Zappos, Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google's acquisitions of Waze, Nest, and DoubleClick.\n\nAlphabet spent $1 billion on an unspecified number of small acquisitions in 2019, according to securities filings. Many of these acquisitions were companies working on artificial intelligence research and cloud computing services, areas in which Google is trying to innovate quickly and has sought to bolster hiring.\n\nApple has mostly made small deals valued at less than $500 million over the past decade, acquiring small companies working on key technologies such as augmented reality displays, camera sensors, and artificial intelligence software.\n\nIn fiscal 2019, Microsoft made 19 small acquisitions for a total of $1.6 billion, mostly in cash. Microsoft has sought to consolidate its position in the business software market, with major acquisitions such as the LinkedIn social network for business professionals and the code repository site GitHub. Since acquiring LinkedIn - which also fielded rival offers from Microsoft's competitor Salesforce Inc - Microsoft has begun integrating LinkedIn's social network data with Microsoft products such as its Outlook email program.",

Addressing Nato allies, Pence stated, \"An attack on one of us is an attack on us all.\"\n\nThe remarks were made amidst growing tensions between the United States and Russia, following Moscow's decision to reduce the number of US diplomatic staff in retaliation for new US sanctions against Russia. The Baltic states - Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia - have grown increasingly wary of Russia since it annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014.\n\nPence's visit to Estonia follows President Donald Trump's reassurance of the US's commitment to the key Nato principle of mutual defense, which had been a subject of doubt after Trump did not mention it during his visit to Nato's Brussels headquarters in May. However, Trump re-committed the US to it during a Washington press conference in June and more symbolically at a speech in Poland in early July.\n\nAfter meeting the presidents of all three Baltic states, Mr. Pence said, \"The message of President Donald Trump to them was: 'We are with you.'\" He further added, \"Under President Donald Trump, the United States stands firmly behind our Article 5 pledge of mutual defense.\"\n\nRussia is preparing to hold large-scale military exercises with its ally Belarus in the next month. The US Vice President's visit to the region comes as Moscow announced that 755 staff must leave US diplomatic missions in Russia, in retaliation over new sanctions imposed for Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Russian interference in the US election.\n\nReacting to the move, Mr. Pence said, \"We hope for better days, for better relations with Russia.\" He continued, \"Recent diplomatic action taken by Moscow will not deter the commitment of the United States of America to our security, the security of our allies.\"\n\nThe US is currently holding its biggest ever joint military exercises with Georgia, a country which fought a war with Russia in 2008 and seeks to join Nato. Mr. Pence is scheduled to attend the drills in Georgia on Tuesday and will later go to Montenegro, Nato's newest member.\n\nIn Estonia, the US vice-president also warned that Moscow continued to \"seek to redraw international borders by force, undermine democracies of sovereign nations and divide the free nations of Europe, one against another.\"",

However, police suspect that the actor may have paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the incident. The brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, are reportedly cooperating with the investigation.\n\nThe brothers, who are both acquainted with Smollett, were held for nearly 48 hours after they returned to the US last week. They were released without charges, but their testimony is said to have \"shifted the trajectory of the investigation.\"\n\nA lawyer for the brothers, Gloria Schmidt, stated, \"They manned up and said: 'You know what? We're going to correct this.'\"\n\nOn Wednesday, CBS Chicago obtained footage that appeared to show two individuals purchasing materials, including ski masks, that were allegedly used by Smollett's attackers.\n\nSmollett turned himself in to Chicago police early on Thursday and is currently in custody. He faces felony charges for disorderly conduct and filing a false police report.\n\nIf found guilty, Smollett could face up to three years in prison and may be required to reimburse the police for the cost of their three-week-long investigation.\n\nIn a statement, Smollett's legal team said, \"Like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked.\"\n\nSmollett had initially claimed that he was attacked late at night in downtown Chicago by two white men who hurled racial and homophobic insults at him. They allegedly assaulted him, poured a chemical substance on him, and put a rope around his neck. The attackers also reportedly said, \"This is Maga country,\" apparently referring to President Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan.\n\nThe actor, who is gay, said he had been \"forever changed\" by the alleged incident. An outpouring of support followed, including from Oscar winner Viola Davis and supermodel Naomi Campbell.",

The coordinated effort was led by the Boston Globe, with participants ranging from large publications like the New York Times to small local newspapers with circulations as low as 4,000.\n\nThe Boston Globe's editorial board wrote, \"The principle of a free press has protected journalists at home and served as a model for free nations abroad. Today it is under serious threat.\" The board cited a recent poll showing that 48 percent of Republicans and 29 percent of Americans overall agreed with President Trump that the news media is the enemy of the people. Forty-three percent of Republicans and 26 percent of Americans said the president should be able to close news outlets for bad behavior.\n\nThe Globe's editorial board went on to say, \"To label the press 'the enemy of the people' is as un-American as it is dangerous to the civic compact we have shared for more than two centuries.\" The board emphasized the role of a free press in holding the powerful accountable and ensuring accurate information for citizens.\n\nNewspapers across the country added their own perspectives to the discussion. The Chicago Tribune wrote, \"A free press is the foundation of our democracy. It is the guardian of the people's right to know, the watchdog of the powerful, the voice of the voiceless and the conscience of the nation.\" The Dallas Morning News stated, \"A free press is the cornerstone of our democracy, a beacon of truth in a world too often shrouded in darkness.\"\n\nPresident Trump responded to the editorials on Twitter Thursday morning, stating, \"The Fake News Media is the Opposition Party. It is very bad for our Great Country.... BUT WE ARE WINNING!\" He also tweeted, \"The Boston Globe, which was sold to the Failing New York Times for 1.3 BILLION DOLLARS (plus 800 million dollars in losses & investment), or 2.1 BILLION DOLLARS, was then sold by the Times for 1 DOLLAR. Now the Globe is in COLLUSION with other papers on free press. PROVE IT!\"\n\nThe coordinated editorials serve as a reminder of the crucial role of a free press in a democratic society and the importance of upholding the principles of truth, transparency, and accountability.",
    " Title: Americans Divided on Political Discourse, with Majority Viewing Trump as Negative Influence\n\nArticle:\n\nA new survey has shed light on Americans' attitudes towards the tone and nature of political debate in the United States, with large majorities agreeing that the discourse has become more negative, less respectful, less fact-based, and less focused on issues. The survey, conducted this spring, found that 85% of U.S. adults believe political debate has become more negative and less respectful, while 76% say it has become less fact-based and 60% say it has become less focused on issues.\n\nThe survey also found that President Donald Trump is a major factor in people's views about the state of the nation's political discourse. A majority (55%) say Trump has changed the tone and nature of political debate for the worse, while fewer than half as many (24%) say he has changed it for the better. One-in-five Americans say he has had little impact.\n\nThe survey also found that Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents overwhelmingly (84%) say Trump has changed political discourse for the worse, while about half of Republicans and Republican leaners (49%) say he has changed it for the better. The survey also found that eight-in-ten or more Democrats say Trump's comments often or sometimes make them feel concerned, confused, embarrassed, exhausted, angry, insulted, and frightened. While Republicans are considerably less likely to report these negative reactions to Trump's rhetoric, about six-in-ten (59%) say they are at least sometimes concerned by his comments, while about half say they are at least sometimes confused (47%) or embarrassed (53%).\n\nThe survey also found that most Americans have strong feelings about what is acceptable for elected officials to say in political debate. Most agree that it is fine for an elected official to say their opponent is uninformed on the issues. However, 41% say it is never acceptable to say their opponent is anti-American, and another 31% say this is rarely acceptable. Among Republicans, just 25% say it is never acceptable to accuse an opponent of being anti-American, while 53% of Democrats say this is out of bounds.\n\nThe survey also found that Americans broadly agree that elected officials should avoid using heated language because it could encourage violence. Nearly three-quarters of Americans (73%) say this, while just a quarter believe that elected officials \"should be able to use heated language to express themselves without worrying about whether some people may act on what they say.\"\n\nThe survey also found that while majorities in both parties say officials should avoid heated language, this view is more widely held among Democrats (83%) than Republicans (61%). Republicans believe that the national climate for political discourse is more hospitable to Democrats than for the GOP. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (64%) think that \"Democrats in this country are very comfortable to freely and openly express their political views,\" but only about a quarter (26%) think Republicans around the nation experience that same level of comfort.\n\nThe survey also found that most Americans say there is not consensus in the public on what constitutes racist or sexist language. About six-in-ten Americans (61%) say people generally don't agree about what is considered to be racist language, while 38% believe that people do agree on this. Views about agreement over sexist language are roughly the same.\n\nThe survey also found that about two-thirds (65%) of Republicans and Republican leaners say people generally do not agree over the definition of racist language; 58% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say the same. Black people are somewhat more likely than whites and Hispanics to say people agree about what is considered racist language, although blacks, whites, and Hispanics are all more likely to say people do not agree on what kind of language is racist than to say that there is broad agreement.",
    " Title: Trump's Trade War Escalation: A Closer Look at the Economic Impact and Misinformation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn escalating his trade war, President Donald Trump persists in his argument that tariffs are a pure win for the U.S. and a loss for China. However, a new study by economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Columbia University, and Princeton University reveals that the costs of tariffs are being borne by Americans.\n\nTrump has vowed to impose a blanket tariff of 25% on everything Americans buy from China. This would mean raising tariffs from 10% on $200 billion worth of goods by the end of the week and hitting an additional $325 billion in Chinese products with the same penalty \"shortly.\"\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday, Trump stated, \"For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA of 25% on 50 Billion Dollars of High Tech, and 10% on 200 Billion Dollars of other goods. These payments are partially responsible for our great economic results.\"\n\nHowever, this notion of a transfer of wealth from China to the U.S. isn't happening. The burden of Trump's tariffs on imports from China and other countries falls entirely on U.S. consumers and businesses that buy imports. By the end of last year, the study found, the public and U.S. companies were paying $3 billion a month in higher taxes and absorbing $1.4 billion a month in lost efficiency.\n\nMoney from tariffs is going into the federal treasury, but it's mostly, if not entirely, coming from U.S. businesses and consumers, not China. It's not a driver of economic growth but rather a risk to it. That's why the stock market dropped Monday.\n\nA coalition of U.S. trade organizations representing retail businesses, tech, manufacturing, and agriculture sharply disputed Trump's statement. \"For 10 months, Americans have been paying the full cost of the trade war, not China,\" it said. \"To be clear, tariffs are taxes that Americans pay, and this sudden increase with little notice will only punish U.S. farmers, businesses, and consumers.\"\n\nTrump invariably describes the U.S. trade deficit as money \"lost\" to other countries, an equation that ignores the value to Americans of what they've bought. He's now making the converse case that a tax on imports, paid by Americans, somehow enriches them.\n\nIn another tweet on Monday, Trump claimed, \"Puerto Rico has been given more money by Congress for Hurricane Disaster Relief, 91 Billion Dollars, than any State in the history of the U.S.\" However, this statement is not true. The money that Congress has allocated to Puerto Rico for hurricane relief so far is nowhere close to $91 billion.\n\nAccording to the White House, Trump's $91 billion estimate includes about $50 billion in expected future disaster disbursements that could span decades, along with $41 billion already approved. Actual aid to Puerto Rico has flowed more slowly from federal coffers, about $11 billion so far. The expected $50 billion in additional money is speculative, based on Puerto Rico's eligibility for federal emergency disaster funds for years ahead, involving calamities that haven't happened.\n\nThe White House's $91 billion figure for Puerto Rico, even if correct, would not be the most ever provided for hurricane rebuilding efforts. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 cost the U.S. government more than $120 billion\u2014the bulk of it going to Louisiana.",
    " Title: Christie Vows Cooperation in State of the State Address Amid Ongoing Scandal Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his annual State of the State address, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie pledged cooperation with all inquiries into the ongoing scandal surrounding the alleged political retribution involving the George Washington Bridge controversy. The speech, which usually receives little attention outside the state, took on national interest due to the ongoing investigations into the use of Superstorm Sandy relief funds and the alleged orchestration of traffic gridlock near the country's busiest bridge.\n\nFor a governor known for his assertive leadership style, Christie adopted a conciliatory tone in his speech, emphasizing bipartisan efforts and working together. He sought to refocus the political focus away from the bridge controversy by citing the successes of his first term and calling for cooperation from the Democratic-led state Assembly and Senate.\n\nChristie acknowledged the controversy in his opening remarks, accepting ultimate responsibility while reiterating that he was unaware of the alleged actions. \"Mistakes were clearly made, and as a result, we let down the people we are entrusted to serve,\" Christie told state legislators gathered in Trenton for the speech.\n\nThe governor's administration will cooperate \"with all appropriate inquiries\" into the controversy to \"ensure this breach of trust does not happen again,\" Christie said. He then shifted the focus away from the issue, stating that the scandal \"does not define us or our state\" and will not delay \"the work that needs to be done to improve the people's lives in New Jersey.\"\n\nInstead, Christie emphasized economic successes of his first term and called for cooperation from the Democratic-led state Assembly and Senate. In a span of 10 paragraphs, he used the word \"we\" 17 times in describing specific achievements such as job creation and economic growth.\n\nOutlining a conservative agenda of no additional taxes and more law enforcement, the recently re-elected governor also proposed education reforms and programs to help drug offenders rejoin society. The most emotional moment came when Christie told the story of Craig Hanlon, a former drug addict from his hometown now working as a practicing attorney. Hanlon, who was seated near the front, stood up and hugged the governor to a lengthy ovation.\n\nBy tradition, legislators stood and applauded when Christie arrived, and he received repeated ovations when citing accomplishments of his first term and outlining new proposals. However, the bridge controversy remains prominent for the early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.\n\nLast week, the New Jersey State Assembly committee investigating the matter made public more than 2,000 pages of documents suggesting politics was behind the unannounced lane closures on the New Jersey side of the bridge last September that caused traffic gridlock in Fort Lee. The documents suggest that top Christie aides orchestrated the traffic mess to punish that town's mayor for not endorsing their boss, and that they allegedly tried to stonewall media inquiries into the matter.\n\nChristie has fired one top adviser for her apparent role in the scandal, and other key advisers have left their jobs. He has repeatedly apologized for being \"blindsided\" by what his aides and appointees were doing.\n\nAfter Christie's reference to the controversy in Tuesday's speech, a top Democrat in the New Jersey legislature who heads an investigating panel rejected the governor's insistence he knew nothing about the lane closures. \"I find that a little hard to believe,\" Assemblyman John Wisniewski told CNN.\n\nWisniewski described relations between New Jersey Democrats and Christie as \"very difficult,\" saying the governor \"set lines in the sand\" and \"said it's my way or the highway.\" \"Bipartisan means both sides give. That's not how this governor operates,\" Wisniewski said.\n\nMeanwhile, the assembly's GOP leader said he believed that Christie knew nothing about what happened. \"If a governor lies about what he knows, that's troublesome. That did not happen here,\" Jon Bramnick said.\n\nFederal officials are also looking at whether Christie improperly used Superstorm Sandy relief funds to produce tourism ads promoting the Jersey shore's recovery that starred him and his family. In the new inquiry, federal auditors will examine New Jersey's use of $25 million of the funds for the marketing campaign, New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone told CNN.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Christie's office said the \"Stronger than the Storm\" campaign was part of an \"action plan\" approved by the Obama administration and developed with the goal of showing that the New Jersey shore was open for business just several months after the storm that devastated parts of the mid-Atlantic in October 2012.\n\nA separate statement Tuesday by the federal Housing and Urban Development agency described the probe as a routine audit \"and not an investigation of the procurement process.\" While political observers say the bridge scandal is not good for Christie, the Sandy investigation has the potential to be much more damaging to his national image since it was his signature achievement following the storm.\n\nOn Tuesday, Christie did not specifically mention that audit by the HUD inspector general, a watchdog over federal spending. In what might have been an ironic reference to Sandy funding, Christie praised the cooperative spirit in the state that helped its recovery from the storm, seeming to describe his own challenges now. \"Let that spirit of Sandy be a powerful lesson to all of us, that when times are most difficult, cooperation and progress are possible,\" Christie said. \"Indeed, I tell you, they're necessary.\"",
    " Title: North Korea's Kim Jong Un Emerges from Seclusion, Sparks New Mystery over Cane Use\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reappeared in public after a six-week absence, quelling rumors of his ill health, deposition, or worse. However, a new enigma has surfaced: the reason for the cane.\n\nIn images released by state media on Tuesday, Kim, last seen at a Sept. 3 concert, was seen smiling broadly and leaning on a walking stick while touring the newly built Wisong Scientists Residential District and another new institute in Pyongyang, part of his regular \"field guidance\" tours. The North did not disclose the exact date of the visit or address Kim's health.\n\nThe appearance of Kim allows the country's extensive propaganda machinery to continue its primary function\u2014glorifying the third generation of Kim family rule. It also temporarily suppresses rumors of a coup and serious health issues.\n\nBefore Tuesday, Kim missed several significant events he typically attends, and he was described in an official documentary last month as experiencing \"discomfort.\" Archive footage from August showed him overweight and limping, leading South Korean media to speculate that he underwent ankle surgery. Some experts suggested he was suffering from gout or diabetes.\n\nA South Korean analyst stated that Kim likely broke his media silence to dispel external speculation about his control and to evoke sympathy from the domestic audience by portraying a leader who works through pain. The appearance may be a form of \"emotional politics meant to appeal to the North Korean people's sympathy,\" said Cheong Seong-chang, at the private Sejong Institute in South Korea.\n\nIt is the first time a North Korean leader has been seen relying on a cane or crutch, South Korean officials said. Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, who reportedly suffered a stroke in 2008 before dying of a heart attack in late 2011, was seen limping but never with a walking stick, nor was the country's founder and Kim Jong Un's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, said Lim Byeong Cheol, a spokesman from Seoul's Unification Ministry.\n\nCheong noted that Kim appeared in the recently released images to have lost about 22 pounds compared to pictures from May. He speculated that since Kim was holding a cane on his left side, he may have had surgery on his left ankle.\n\nKim \"appears to want to show people that he's doing fine, though he's indeed still having some discomfort,\" Cheong said. The South Korean government has consistently seen no indications of major problems.\n\nIn deciding to resume his public activity before fully recovering from his condition, Kim aimed to swiftly quell rumors that his health problems were severe enough to jeopardize his position as North Korean leader, said Lim, the government spokesman.\n\n\"The cane aside, he looked to be in good health,\" Lim said.\n\nBruce Cumings, an expert on Korea at the University of Chicago, stated in an email that Kim's recent absence was, in part, \"probably an attention-getting device\u2014and it certainly works.\"\n\n\"The North has been on a diplomatic offensive in Europe and elsewhere, it feels isolated\u2014and is, if we're talking about relations with Washington\u2014all this puts them back on the front page,\" Cumings wrote.",
    " Title: Romney Proposes \"Choose-Your-Own-Deduction\" Tax Reform Plan Ahead of First Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the run-up to the first presidential debate between Mitt Romney and President Obama, the Republican nominee has begun to outline specifics for his tax reform plan, which he describes as a \"choose-your-own-deduction\" approach. In an interview with Fox Denver affiliate KDVR, Romney detailed his plan, aiming to counter the Obama campaign's argument that he is withholding details of his tax-cutting strategy while maintaining deficit neutrality.\n\nRomney suggested that taxpayers could select the deductions they wish to claim, with a $17,000 cap on the total amount. He explained, \"As an option, you could say everybody's going to get up to a $17,000 deduction; and you could use your charitable deduction, your home mortgage deduction, or others\u2014your health care deduction, and you can fill that bucket, if you will, that $17,000 bucket that way.\"\n\nRomney added that higher-income individuals might have a lower cap. A Romney campaign aide later clarified that the $17,000 cap could change, and that the tax rate cut could be offset by imposing a dollar cap on personal exemptions and reducing health care tax preferences.\n\nThe exact cost of the 20% tax rate cut remains undisclosed by the Romney campaign, but a source familiar with deficit-reduction discussions on Capitol Hill suggested it could amount to up to $1.7 trillion over ten years. A Romney campaign aide described this figure as \"possible.\"\n\nRomney spokesman Kevin Madden stated that the ideas for offsetting the tax rate cut are merely suggestions that may be considered during negotiations with Congress. Romney may present his \"bucket\" list proposal during Wednesday night's debate in Denver.\n\nThe Obama campaign has criticized Romney for withholding details of his tax-cutting plan, stating, \"Romney has never explained how he would pay for his massive new tax cut for the wealthiest.\" Stephanie Cutter, Obama's deputy campaign manager, released a memo Wednesday morning, asserting, \"Romney won't name which deductions he'll eliminate, asking voters to trust that he'll work it out with Congress after the election.\"\n\nBoth campaigns have managed expectations for the debate, with Obama's advisers claiming Romney has practice from the primary season, while Romney's advisers note that Obama is the only one on stage with general election debate experience.\n\nThe debate, one of three this month, is a significant opportunity for both candidates, as a well-phrased response could boost their standing in the polls, while an awkward moment could have the opposite effect. Romney, who is competitive with Obama in national polls but has been slipping in key battleground states, may particularly benefit from the debate.\n\nCutter attempted to preempt several potential arguments by Romney in her lengthy memo Wednesday morning. \"For the next four years, President Obama has laid out real and achievable goals, and a specific path to get there, restoring middle-class security and creating jobs and long-term economic growth,\" she wrote. \"Mitt Romney comes to this debate in a different position. He does not have any specific plans to move us forward\u2014only tired repeats that will take us back.\"\n\nThe debate, which will be broadcast at 9 p.m. EDT, is expected to offer a blend of choreography and spontaneity, with both candidates having spent hours rehearsing with proxy opponents while knowing to expect the unexpected. The debate will cover topics related to the economy, health care, the role of government, and governing. The next debates are scheduled for October 16 and October 22, with the lone vice presidential debate taking place on October 11.",
    " Title: Facebook Announces Overhaul of Privacy Tools in Response to Criticism and New Regulations\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook, the social media giant, has announced a significant overhaul of its privacy tools in response to intense criticism following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal and in compliance with new EU regulations. The revamp aims to make it easier for users to find and edit the personal information the company holds.\n\nIn a blog post, Facebook's chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, acknowledged the damage caused by the Cambridge Analytica revelations and emphasized the need for improved privacy settings and user understanding of how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data.\n\nThe changes include a \"simplified\" settings menu, a new privacy shortcuts menu, and revised data download and edit tools. The new settings menu aims to make it clearer what each control involves by regrouping the controls and adding descriptions. The privacy shortcuts menu consolidates the most critical controls into a single place, making it faster for users to review their posts, limit ad targeting, and other actions.\n\nThe revised data download and edit tools offer a new page called \"Access Your Information,\" allowing users to review past interactions with the site, including \"likes\" and comments, with the option to make deletions. Users will also be able to download specific categories of data, such as photos, from a selected time range, rather than a single large file.\n\nAlthough not mentioned in the blog, the BBC understands Facebook also intends to make the link to fully delete an account more prominent. The changes are set to take effect before the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force on 25 May, tightening data handling requirements and imposing harsher penalties for breaches.\n\nFacebook insists the move to give people greater visibility of their privacy settings and an easier way to delete data has been in the works for months, but the company acknowledges the urgency of the situation. \"Facebook recognizes it's clearly lost people's trust and it needs to get to work on regaining that,\" said Stephen Deadman, Facebook's global deputy chief privacy officer.\n\nHowever, the question remains whether Facebook should be more proactive in warning users about the data they are sharing, such as sending alerts to those who are likely unaware that their phone contacts are still being uploaded to the company. The revamped system, while a step towards greater transparency and control, may still require more nudging for busy users to take back control of their privacy settings.\n\nThe announcement comes amidst a fresh dispute with New Zealand's privacy watchdog, which has accused Facebook of being in breach of local laws. The social media company has been criticized for refusing to provide data about a dispute involving one of its citizens, prompting the privacy commissioner's statement. Facebook has responded, expressing disappointment with the commissioner's request for access to private data belonging to several people and criticizing the privacy commissioner for criticizing the company's efforts to protect user privacy.",
    " Title: U.S. Supreme Court Upholds Texas Abortion Restrictions, Sparking Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 5-4 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to block controversial Texas abortion restrictions, allowing key parts of the law to remain in effect while a lawsuit challenging the restrictions moves forward. The decision has led a dozen abortion clinics in Texas to cease performing the procedure.\n\nThe four liberal justices who voted in favor of a request by Planned Parenthood to block the ruling by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals expressed their dissent, stating they would have overturned the appeals court's Oct. 31 ruling that allowed the law to take effect.\n\nThe Texas abortion law, which has been deemed some of the strictest in the country, includes provisions requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. This requirement, according to the appeals court, may increase the cost of accessing an abortion provider and decrease the number of physicians available to perform abortions.\n\nHowever, the appeals court panel maintained that the U.S. Supreme Court has held that having \"the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion can not be enough to invalidate\" a law that serves a valid purpose, one not designed to strike at the right itself.\n\nThe Texas Attorney General's Office expressed satisfaction with the Supreme Court's ruling, stating that the regulations further the state's interest in protecting the health and safety of Texas women. Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry also expressed approval, stating that the decision would better protect women from \"shoddy abortion providers operating in dangerous conditions.\"\n\nThe appeals court panel left in place a portion of a previous judge's order that prevents the state from enforcing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration protocol for abortion-inducing drugs in cases where the woman is between 50 and 63 days into her pregnancy. The appeals court's order is temporary until it can hold a complete hearing, likely in January.\n\nThe restrictions gained notoriety when Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis launched a nearly 13-hour filibuster against them in June. The law also bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and beginning in October 2014 requires doctors to perform all abortions in surgical facilities.\n\nDuring the trial, officials for one chain of abortion clinics testified that they've tried to obtain admitting privileges for their doctors at 32 hospitals, but so far only 15 accepted applications and none have announced a decision. Hospitals with religious affiliations and those fearing protests are among those that have declined to grant privileges. Many have requirements that doctors live within a certain radius of the facility or perform a minimum number of surgeries a year that must be performed in a hospital.\n\nFox News' Shannon Bream and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
    " Title: China's COVID-19 Statistics: A Closer Look at Transparency and Accuracy\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the global COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, the number of confirmed cases in China, the epicenter of the outbreak, has significantly decreased. However, the official figures reported by the Chinese government have been met with skepticism due to the country's history of secrecy and cover-ups.\n\nThe National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, responsible for tracking statistics during the crisis, has been publishing daily updates since late January. Initially, the number of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus skyrocketed, with the commission reporting 1,287 cases on January 25, which increased to 17,205 in just over a week. At that point, the commission reported that 189,583 people had been identified as having had close contact with infected patients.\n\nThe commission also acknowledged on January 26 that \"More than 5 million people have left Wuhan due to the Spring Festival and epidemic.\" Given the timing and the scale of the annual festival, which typically generates nearly 3 billion trips, the \"epidemic\" was poised to sweep the nation of 1.3 billion people.\n\nHowever, against all odds, the National Health Commission of China reported no new domestically acquired cases, attributing every new case as \"imported\" by those returning to China. Over the last half of March, despite the massive dispersion of Chinese citizens from the epicenter of the virus, Wuhan, the commission has reported barely one new domestically acquired case per day.\n\nDespite compelling reasons for incredulity at China's official figures, the United Nations published an article titled \"China shows COVID-19 Coronavirus can be \u2018 stopped in its tracks.' \" The article is based on an interview with a \"WHO Representative in the country, Dr. Gauden Galea.\"\n\nDr. Galea has been in Beijing during the course of China's battle with COVID-19, except for a quick trip to Wuhan on January 21-22 before the city was even locked down, and the outbreak was still muted. The U.N. article goes on to say, \"At the time, there was no overwhelming demand on the health services, though the situation had changed when Chinese and international health experts conducted a joint mission a month later.\"\n\nVarious media organizations have similarly relied on China's numbers for some pretty dramatic headlines. On March 18, The New York Times declared, \"China Hits a Coronavirus Milestone: No New Local Infections.\" While the article notes in passing that Chinese \"officials initially concealed and mismanaged the outbreak,\" it goes on to flatly assert that \"Beijing\u2019s sledgehammer approach... worked to quickly lower the number of infections.\"\n\nEight days later, the Times, again based on China's \"confirmed\" numbers, told the world that, \"The U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases.\" While the article says that \"The Times is engaged in a comprehensive effort to track the details of every confirmed case in the United States, collecting information from federal, state, and local officials,\" apparently, the Times applied considerably less rigor to acquire information on China.\n\nOn Monday, however, came news that China's numbers have indeed been incomplete. The Wall Street Journal reported that \"China said more than 1,500 people who were infected with the virus but haven\u2019t shown symptoms weren\u2019t included in its national tally of confirmed cases.\" This change so late in China's experience with the virus raises further questions about China's transparency, especially in light of some of the drastic measures the Communist government took early on to hush up the extent and seriousness of the epidemic.\n\nIn light of these developments, it is crucial for the media and international health authorities to view any data coming out of China with a more skeptical eye, as the past indicates that the Chinese government will continue to hide the true consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak in that country as best it can.",
    " Title: Four U.S. Governors Express Opposition to Recreational Marijuana Legalization\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a discussion on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, four governors - two Republicans and two Democrats - expressed their opposition to the legalization of recreational marijuana, stating that their respective states would not be following the examples set by Colorado and Washington.\n\nTexas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican who is considering a 2016 presidential bid, was the first to voice his opposition, stating a firm \"no.\" Perry, who has previously advocated for lowering penalties for marijuana use, believes that current policies in Texas have helped decrease the state's prison population.\n\n\"The idea that a kid has one marijuana cigarette and you send him to prison, where they can learn to really be a hardened criminal, is not thoughtful public policy,\" Perry told CNN's chief political correspondent, Candy Crowley.\n\nIndiana Governor Mike Pence, another potential White House candidate, also expressed his opposition to legalization. Pence, a Republican who took office last year, stated, \"That's been my position for a long time and will continue to be.\"\n\nDemocratic Governor Dan Malloy of Connecticut said his state has decriminalized small amounts of marijuana and has moved forward with medical marijuana, but he believes that this is the extent of their marijuana policy. \"They are two distinct issues,\" Malloy said. \"Let's not be enticed on that road because of money. It just does not make sense.\"\n\nColorado has seen a surge in tax revenues from marijuana sales, but Malloy cautioned against using taxes as an incentive for legalization.\n\nMissouri Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, also indicated that his state was not heading towards pot legalization but acknowledged that some in his state are starting to open up about medical marijuana. \"I think our legislature might consider that, but I think to move beyond that at this point is a bridge too far,\" Nixon said. \"That bridge has not yet been built.\"\n\nThe discussion on marijuana legalization is ongoing, and the positions of these governors highlight the complexities and nuances of the issue as it continues to evolve in the United States.",
    " Title: Obama's Off-Record Remarks on Hispanic Vote and Grand Bargain Promises Spark Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Barack Obama's off-the-cuff remarks during a previously off-record interview with the Des Moines Register's editorial board have stirred controversy, with the President suggesting that his re-election chances hinge on the Republican Party's perceived alienation of the Hispanic community.\n\nDuring a 30-minute conversation, Obama made two pledges for a second term, expressing confidence that Washington could strike a \"grand bargain\" on deficit reduction and immigration reform in the coming year. He also took a swing at the Republican Party on the latter issue, stating that the Republican nominee and the party have \"alienated\" the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community.\n\nThe Romney campaign responded by casting doubt on the President's editorial board comments, pointing to Obama's failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform despite promises made in 2008. Spokesman Alberto Martinez stated, \"It's a fascinating glimpse into how President Obama has taken the Hispanic community for granted for the past four years.\"\n\nThe rest of the Des Moines Register interview focused on policy matters, with Obama discussing his plans for the economy, education, and energy development, while vigorously defending his term to date. The President also defended the health care bill as a measure aimed at treating the economy.\n\nThe transcript of the interview was published after editor Rick Green revealed that the White House had demanded the conversation be kept off the record. Green stated that the White House did not provide a reason for the \"unusual condition\" of the call. Following the complaint, campaign officials released a transcript to the newspaper, which it then published.\n\nCampaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki offered a brief explanation for the move, stating that the call was meant to be a personal check-in with the publisher and editor, and that the specifics of the conversation could not be shared because it was off the record.\n\nGreen had written that, after the off-record conditions were initially made, the newspaper \"immediately lobbied his campaign staff in Des Moines for a formal, on-the-record call,\" but was told the decision \"came from the White House.\"\n\nGreen noted that Mitt Romney met with the editorial board \"literally\" in a barn in Iowa on Oct. 9, and the audio from that conversation was posted online. Green stated that the initial snub would not impact the newspaper's decision on an endorsement, writing, \"That would be petty and ridiculous. We take far too seriously what's at stake this election and what our endorsement should say.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Job Growth Slows in May, Suggesting Labor Market Losing Momentum\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - The U.S. job market showed signs of slowing down in May, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 138,000, according to the latest Labor Department report. The employment gains in the prior two months were revised down, indicating a potential weakening of the labor market despite the unemployment rate falling to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent.\n\nThe report revealed that the manufacturing, government, and retail sectors lost jobs last month. The economy created 66,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in March and April. The job gains for May could still be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting, as the economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.\n\nEconomists at JPMorgan and California State University Channel Islands suggested that the labor market is tightening and the Federal Reserve will likely continue to raise interest rates. However, the details of the employment report were weak, with 429,000 people dropping out of the labor force and a drop in employment in the household survey.\n\nAverage hourly earnings rose 4 cents or 0.2 percent in May, leaving the year-on-year increase in wages at 2.5 percent. Job growth has decelerated from the 181,000 monthly average over the past 12 months as the labor market nears full employment.\n\nEconomists believe that companies might be holding off hiring due to political uncertainty in Washington, as the probability that President Donald Trump's economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending, could be imperiled by political scandals.\n\nThe modest payrolls gain could temper expectations of a sharp acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter after gross domestic product increased at a tepid 1.2 percent annualized rate at the start of the year. While consumer spending picked up in April, the trade deficit widened 5.2 percent to $47.6 billion.\n\nThere was some good news in the employment report, with a broad measure of unemployment falling two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.4 percent, the lowest since November 2007. The spread between the jobless rate and this broad unemployment gauge was the smallest since early 2008. However, the labor force participation rate fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent.\n\nManufacturing employment fell by 1,000 jobs last month, with payrolls in the automobile sector dropping 1,500 amid declining sales. Construction payrolls rose 11,000 last month after decreasing by 1,000 jobs in April. Retail employment fell 6,100, declining for a fourth straight month, with department stores shedding 3,700 jobs. Nonstore retailers, including online merchants, hired 2,900 workers last month. Government employment decreased 9,000 last month, with state and local governments accounting for all the decrease.",
    " Title: Indiana Primary: A Crucial Test for Ted Cruz as Trump Aims for Victory\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing race for the Republican presidential nomination, Tuesday's Indiana primary presents a significant challenge for Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who is seeking to halt Donald Trump's relentless march towards the nomination. With Indiana being one of the last opportunities for Cruz to alter the course of the race, his campaign has intensified its efforts in the state, securing the support of the state's governor and announcing retired technology executive Carly Fiorina as his running mate.\n\nDespite these efforts, Cruz's aides have expressed pessimism ahead of Tuesday's voting, anticipating a less-than-stellar performance. However, Cruz remains resolute, stating, \"I am in for the distance, as long as we have a viable path to victory.\"\n\nTrump, on the other hand, has devoted more time to campaigning in Indiana than in most other states, underscoring his eagerness to put Cruz away and focus on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. While Trump cannot clinch the nomination with a big win in Indiana, a strong showing would make his path to the nomination significantly easier.\n\n\"Indiana is very important, because if I win that's the end of it. It would be over,\" Trump said during a campaign stop in Indianapolis.\n\nThe Republican primary race has defied expectations, with Trump, initially dismissed as little more than an entertainer, securing victories in every region of the country. This includes a string of six straight wins on the East Coast.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Democratic primary, Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders faced off in Indiana's primary on Tuesday. While the stakes are lower in the Democratic race, Clinton holds a commanding lead over Sanders, having secured 91 percent of the delegates she needs to win the nomination. This means she can still win the nomination even if she loses every remaining contest.\n\nSanders, who faces a difficult path to overtake Clinton, is focusing on convincing superdelegates to back him over the former secretary of state. Superdelegates are Democratic Party insiders who can support the candidate of their choice, regardless of how their states vote. They favor Clinton by a nearly 18-1 margin.\n\nNeither Clinton nor Sanders planned to spend Tuesday in Indiana. Sanders was making stops in Kentucky, which holds a primary in mid-May, while Clinton moved on to Ohio, a key general election battleground.\n\nAs the race heats up, both Clinton's and Trump's teams are gearing up for the general election. Clinton's team has started deploying staff to states that will be crucial in November and is also raising money for the fall campaign. Trump, on the other hand, lags behind Clinton in general election preparations, despite hiring more staff to round out his slim team.\n\nA showdown between Clinton and Trump would pit one of Democrats' most popular and highly-regarded figures against a first-time political candidate who is deeply divisive within his own party. Cruz and other Republicans have argued that Trump would be roundly defeated in the general election, denying their party the White House for a third straight term.\n\nHowever, Trump is the only Republican left in the race who can secure the 1,237 delegates needed for the nomination through regular primary voting. Cruz, as well as Ohio Governor John Kasich, who trails significantly in the delegate count, must try to block Trump in Indiana and the handful of other remaining states to push the race toward a contested convention.\n\nIn an abrupt strategy shift, Cruz and Kasich announced an alliance of sorts in Indiana. The Ohio governor agreed to stop spending money in Indiana to give Cruz a chance to compete head-to-head with Trump. Cruz has pledged to do the same for Kasich in Oregon and New Mexico, which vote in the coming weeks.\n\nHowever, this strategy, which appeared to unravel even as it was announced, may have backfired. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll found that nearly 6 in 10 Indiana primary voters disapproved of the Cruz-Kasich alliance.\n\n\"After they made the alliance, their numbers tanked,\" Trump said Monday. \"That's what happens when politicians make deals.\"",
    " Title: Dueling Reports on Benghazi Attacks Released Amidst Partisan Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe release of two competing and contradictory reports on the 2012 attacks on a diplomatic outpost and CIA annex in Benghazi, Libya, has added to the ongoing controversy surrounding the incident. The attacks, which resulted in the death of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, have been the subject of a two-year investigation by members of the House from both political parties.\n\nThe primary objective of the investigation has been to examine the actions of senior U.S. military and civilian officials, including then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to determine if more could have been done to prevent the loss of life. The panel's five Democrats released their report on Monday, preceding the majority Republicans' findings, which were released on Tuesday.\n\nIn the Democratic report, the U.S. military and the former secretary of state are cleared of any wrongdoing. The report states that the U.S. military could not have done anything differently on the night of the attacks to save the lives of the four Americans who perished. The report also notes that the State Department's security measures were \"woefully inadequate,\" but that Mrs. Clinton never personally turned down a request for additional security.\n\nIn contrast, the Republican report, led by House panel chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, states that the U.S. was slow to send help to the Americans in Benghazi \"because of an obsession with hurting the Libyans' feelings.\" The report also accuses the Obama administration of \"misleading the public over the incident and failing to protect U.S. personnel.\"\n\nThe Republican report, obtained by The Topeka Capital-Journal, labels Benghazi as the \"wild east\" and criticizes Clinton for her role in the incident. The report also questions whether street protests precipitated the attacks, stating that a number of eyewitnesses remained in constant contact with Washington during the attack, but none of them mentioned a protest.\n\nThe reports could have political repercussions for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Clinton, as the Benghazi investigation has already uncovered her use of a private email server to conduct government business, now the subject of an FBI investigation.\n\nThe White House and the investigating panel are also at odds regarding whether President Obama should answer questions already submitted by the panel for the president's consideration. The Democrats' report states that the cause of the attacks \"remains unclear to this day,\" quoting testimony by David Petraeus, the former CIA director, who says, \"To be candid with you, I am not sure that the amount of scrutiny spent on this has been in the least bit worth it.\"",
    " Title: Obama Administration Issues Directive on Transgender Students' Bathroom Access in Schools\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, the Obama administration has issued a directive to public schools across the nation, clarifying the rights of transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their chosen gender identity. The directive, formulated by leaders in the Education and Justice Departments, is a clear indication of the administration's stance that gender identity is a civil rights issue.\n\nThe directive, which is in line with Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance, requires schools to allow transgender students to use facilities that match their chosen gender identity, regardless of any discrepancies in their education records or identity documents.\n\n\"There is no room in our schools for discrimination of any kind, including discrimination against transgender students on the basis of their sex,\" said Attorney General Loretta Lynch in a statement accompanying the directive.\n\nThe directive does not require students to present a medical diagnosis for the change in gender identity. Schools are obligated to treat students according to their chosen gender identity.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign, a civil rights organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals, commended the move. \"This is a truly significant moment not only for transgender young people but for all young people, sending a message that every student deserves to be treated fairly and supported by their teachers and schools,\" said HRC President Chad Griffin in a statement.\n\nThe directive comes at a time when the definition of gender identity is a topic of societal debate, with some conservatives viewing gender as purely biological and set at birth, while many in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community see gender identity as more fluid and personal. This debate has reached a peak this week in North Carolina, where the state is embroiled in a legal battle with the federal government over its so-called bathroom bill.\n\nOn Monday, the Justice Department sued North Carolina over its bathroom law, HB2, or the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, stating that the legislation is discriminatory. HB2 includes measures that prohibit public school students from using school facilities consistent with their chosen gender identity. The lawsuit advises the state to confirm it will not be moving ahead with the legislation.\n\n\"This action is about a great deal more than bathrooms, this is about the dignity and respect that we accord our fellow citizens,\" said Attorney General Lynch when announcing the federal lawsuit.\n\nNorth Carolina responded with a countersuit, claiming that the state was given an unrealistic amount of time to comply with the federally-imposed compliance deadline.",
    " Title: Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli Challenges Court Ruling on Virginia's Anti-Sodomy Law, Sparking Debate on Protecting Minors\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked debate and raised questions about the protection of minors, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli has challenged a recent court ruling that found Virginia's \"Crimes Against Nature\" statute, which banned oral and anal sex, unconstitutional. The case in question involves a 47-year-old man, William Scott MacDonald, who was convicted of soliciting a minor to commit a felony.\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled on March 12 that the statute violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. One judge dissented, agreeing with a lower court that the Supreme Court's ruling in Lawrence v. Texas on sodomy laws applied only to consenting adults.\n\nCuccinelli's office has filed a petition asking for the full 15-judge court to reconsider the panel's decision. LGBT advocates have expressed disappointment, saying the law is unconstitutional and anti-gay. However, Cuccinelli's spokeswoman, Caroline Gibson, stated that the case is not about sexual orientation but about protecting a 17-year-old girl from a 47-year-old sexual predator.\n\nCuccinelli's position in the case has been criticized by his opponent, former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe, who is running against Cuccinelli for the gubernatorial seat. McAuliffe's campaign has accused Cuccinelli of focusing on divisive issues rather than the economy.\n\nVirginia's unemployment rate is 5.6 percent, and the state enjoys a substantial budget surplus thanks to the stewardship of Virginia's current governor, Bob McDonnell. McAuliffe and Virginia Democrats hope voters will ignore McDonnell's successful record of governance, which is why they are eager to harp on the culture wars, even when there is no basis for doing so.\n\nThe Cuccinelli campaign has responded to McAuliffe's criticisms, stating that the case is about prosecuting a 47-year-old man who solicited sexual acts from a 17-year-old girl. The campaign also noted that Cuccinelli was elected by Virginia's voters to be the chief law enforcement officer in the state and that his job entails duties, one of which is doing what it takes to protect high school girls from much older sexual suitors.\n\nThe debate over Cuccinelli's position in the case has sparked a national conversation about the protection of minors and the interpretation of sodomy laws. As the gubernatorial race heats up, it remains to be seen how the issue will impact the election and the public's perception of Cuccinelli's stance on social and criminal justice issues.",
    " Title: President Obama Urges Optimism, Calls for Dialogue on Race Relations and Gun Violence in Wake of Dallas Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press conference held in Warsaw, Poland, President Barack Obama called for optimism and dialogue on race relations in the United States following the fatal shootings of two black males by police and the subsequent shooting of five Dallas law-enforcement officials by a black Army veteran. The president emphasized that the actions of a few should not define the entire nation and that race relations have not regressed to the levels of the 1960s.\n\nObama reiterated his commitment to addressing the issue of race relations, stating that he has revived the task force formed after the shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, two years ago. The task force will include police officers, community and civil rights activists, and others who will discuss next steps.\n\nThe president acknowledged the decrease in violent crime in the U.S. over the past five, ten, and fifteen years, but also emphasized the need to address gun violence. He called for stricter gun control measures, stating that it is important to make it harder for people to carry out their anger with weapons.\n\nObama also addressed the Dallas sniper, Micah Johnson, stating that he was a \"demented individual\" and that his actions do not represent the values of the American people. He declined to label the attack as a hate crime, stating that it is difficult to interpret the motives of mass shooters.\n\nThe president expressed sympathy for police officers in gun-filled communities, acknowledging the challenges they face in engaging with potentially armed individuals. He also emphasized the need to address the issue of gun violence in order to ensure the safety of both police officers and civilians.\n\nIn addition to discussing race relations and gun violence, Obama also addressed other global issues, including Brexit, ISIS, NATO, and the European Union. He called for a sensible and orderly process for Britain's exit from the EU and emphasized the importance of maintaining close friendships and commercial partnerships with both the UK and the EU.\n\nOverall, President Obama's message was one of optimism, urging Americans to work together to address the challenges facing the nation, particularly in the areas of race relations and gun violence. He emphasized the need for dialogue and cooperation in order to build a better future for all Americans.",
    " Title: Romney Outraises Obama in May Fundraising, Collecting $76.8 Million vs. $60 Million for Obama\n\nIn a significant development for the upcoming presidential election, Mitt Romney's campaign has surpassed President Barack Obama's fundraising efforts in May, collecting a total of $76.8 million, according to a statement from the Romney campaign. This figure represents a nearly $17 million advantage over Obama's $60 million, as announced by the president's campaign on Thursday.\n\nThe Republican fundraising haul, the first full month that Mr. Romney and the Republican National Committee were in partnership, nearly doubled the amount collected in the prior month. This substantial increase was followed by the Republican National Committee linking its operations and fundraising efforts with the Romney campaign.\n\n\"It is clear that people aren't willing to buy into 'hope & change' again,\" said Spencer Zwick, Mr. Romney's national finance chairman. \"Voters are making an investment because they believe that it will benefit the country.\"\n\nThe Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee ended May with $107 million in cash, according to the Romney campaign's statement. The Democrats' joint fundraising operation had raised $43.6 million in April, about the same amount as Mitt Romney raised that month.\n\nAides to Mr. Obama said they were not overly concerned about the fundraising gap, stating that some Republican donors likely gave the maximum they could in May and will not be able to give again in the coming months. However, the financial comparisons underscore the concern that Mr. Obama's campaign has expressed to supporters over the past several months about the need for stepped-up financial contributions.\n\nDemocrats have warned that despite the president's fundraising prowess, he could be outspent during the upcoming months as Mr. Romney's spending is supplemented by historic levels of fundraising by outside political groups, particularly \"super PACs.\"\n\nThe Obama campaign's announcement comes two days after Republicans succeeded in beating back the recall of Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, who had a significant lead over his opponent in campaign cash. Mr. Obama held a fundraiser with Hollywood celebrities, including George Clooney, in early May, just after he announced his support for same-sex marriage. The event reportedly raised $15 million for Mr. Obama's campaign.\n\nThe average donation for the Obama campaign was just over $50, according to the campaign's announcement. The $60 million includes money raised directly by his campaign and by the Democratic National Committee.",
    " Title: Low Gas Prices: A Boon for Consumers, but a Potential Threat to Economic Stability\n\nIn recent weeks, gasoline prices have been on a steady decline, dropping to an average of approximately $3 per gallon. This downward trend has contributed to a minimal increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), with the index barely inching up 0.1 percent last month and a 12-month CPI rise of 1.7 percent.\n\nHowever, some economists express concern that persistently low energy prices could lead to deflation, a phenomenon last seen during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Deflation, considered the nightmare scenario by economists, is characterized by a prolonged and severe fall in the general price level of goods and services.\n\nTo illustrate the potential consequences of deflation, imagine a factory owner who must purchase parts and raw materials, pay workers a certain wage, and repay loans. If prices start falling, the factory owner may struggle to afford loan repayments, meet contractual obligations with workers, or sell products at a profit, even as competitors slash their prices. This downward pressure creates a vicious cycle that can lead to a broad decline in the value of businesses, homes, and other investments.\n\nThe root cause of the current downward price pressure can be traced back to weak economic growth in both Europe and China. As consumers and companies in these regions cut their energy and goods purchases, global prices fall. Central bankers and policymakers worldwide are taking measures to stimulate growth and prevent further price declines.\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve, which sets interest rates, aims to maintain a 2 percent inflation rate. Given the deflationary winds blowing from Europe, the Fed is likely to hold off on raising interest rates until the CPI shows a significant increase.\n\nFor most Americans, the current economic situation means that wages and prices are stagnant, while interest rates remain low. While the danger of deflation looms, the drop in energy prices has been a boon for consumers, who can now afford cheaper car loans and gasoline. This increased purchasing power could potentially stimulate the economy by boosting travel and consumer spending.\n\nMany Americans are already reaping the benefits of lower gas prices. Macy Gould, a resident of Lexington, Kentucky, who graduated from college in May, was thrilled to refuel for about $2.83 a gallon over the weekend. \"Spending less on gas is a real help to me,\" she said, expressing her relief at the lower costs.\n\nIn conclusion, while low gas prices have provided immediate relief for consumers, the potential threat of deflation remains a concern for economists. The Federal Reserve and policymakers worldwide are taking steps to prevent further price declines and maintain economic stability. For now, consumers can enjoy the benefits of lower gas prices, but it is essential to remain vigilant and adapt to the evolving economic landscape.",
    " Title: President Obama Stands Firm on Debt Ceiling, Gun Control, and Cabinet Appointments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press conference on Monday, President Barack Obama reiterated his stance on the debt ceiling, gun control, and his cabinet appointments. The event, marking the end of his first term, focused primarily on these three key issues.\n\nRegarding the debt ceiling, President Obama emphasized the necessity of increasing the limit to meet the country's financial obligations. He stated, \"The issue here is whether Washington will pay its bills.\" He underscored the importance of upholding the nation's financial responsibility, stating, \"We are not a deadbeat nation.\"\n\nOn the gun control issue, the president reaffirmed his commitment to curbing gun violence in the wake of the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. He pledged, \"If there is a step we can take that will save even one child from what happened in Newtown, we should take that step.\"\n\nPresident Obama also addressed the ongoing debate about his cabinet appointments, particularly the criticism of his decision to appoint only men to his second-term cabinet. He responded, \"Wait until my selections are complete before they rush to judgment.\"\n\nThe president's comments on the debt ceiling were met with contrasting views from Republican leaders. House Speaker John Boehner stated, \"The American people do not support raising the debt ceiling without reducing government spending at the same time.\"\n\nThe debt limit debate, sequester, and a budget resolution are set to be revisited when Congress reconvenes later this month. These discussions are a result of the failure of Washington to reach a long-term solution to the country's debt and deficit issues following the November elections.\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell urged Obama and his allies to address spending issues, stating, \"The debt limit debate is the perfect time for it.\" McConnell also described the country's debt and deficit as a \"huge, huge problem.\"\n\nThe president argued that he has already reduced federal spending by $1.2 trillion over the past two years and is open to further discussions about cuts, including potential reductions in Medicare. However, he maintained that raising the debt ceiling does not authorize more spending, but rather pays for bills that have already been incurred.\n\nThe debate over the debt ceiling, gun control, and cabinet appointments will continue to shape the political landscape in the coming weeks as the new Congress and administration work to address these critical issues.",
    " Title: The Controversial Exclusion of CNN's Jim Acosta: A First Amendment Battle and a Symbiotic Relationship\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, CNN reporter Jim Acosta, who has been a frequent target of criticism from President Donald Trump and White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, has been barred from White House grounds. This move, however, raises questions about the long-standing relationship between Acosta and the White House, as the two have regularly engaged in heated exchanges during press conferences over the past 22 months.\n\nIf Acosta's behavior was indeed offensive to the White House, one would expect Sanders and Trump to avoid calling on him during press conferences. Instead, they routinely sought his presence, counting on his tendency to speak extensively and dominate the microphone during question-and-answer sessions. The White House's apparent enjoyment of Acosta's theatrical style, despite their public displays of exasperation, suggests a symbiotic relationship, with Acosta serving as a public platform for their anti-press narrative and the White House using him as a punching bag.\n\nThe dramatic exchanges between Acosta and the White House have been beneficial for both parties. For those who appreciate reporters who lecture rather than ask questions and view White House briefings as a bloodsport, the Acosta-Trump clashes provide an engaging spectacle, making CNN a preferred cable news destination.\n\nAcosta's forced exile and the subsequent lawsuit filed by CNN demanding the return of his \"hard pass\" have cast him as a free speech martyr. In the lawsuit, lawyer Theodore J. Boutrous, a prominent figure in the First Amendment bar, cites case law that appears to prevent the White House from arbitrarily banning reporters from White House press facilities \"for less than compelling reasons.\" Even Fox News Channel's legal analyst Andrew Napolitano predicts a quick resolution in CNN's favor.\n\nThe initial reason given for Acosta's ban, that he had placed his hands on a White House intern during a press conference, has been disputed. Today, Sanders shifted her argument, accusing Acosta of not surrendering the microphone when approached by the intern. However, Sanders acknowledges that Acosta's resistance to yielding the floor was not a unique occurrence, leading to questions about the fairness of his sudden exclusion without a prior warning.\n\nThe daily White House briefings, under Trump's management, have become more about political theater than genuine news generation. The constant bickering between Sanders and the press corps and her obfuscations have overshadowed the journalistic purpose of the briefings. While they can provide valuable connections to hard-to-find facts and secure administration on-the-record statements, real news often requires relying on reporters like Maggie Haberman who spend little time in the daily briefings, waiting for news to emerge.\n\nLike many episodes of The Trump Show, the martyrdom of Jim Acosta provides an entertaining sideshow. While Acosta may be more of a nuisance than a true newshawk, his return to the White House briefing room can be advocated for in good conscience, as being a nuisance is often part of the job. Moreover, Sanders and Trump seem to miss his presence.",
    " Title: Fourth GOP Senator Opposes Trump's Nomination of Herman Cain for Federal Reserve, Potentially Jeopardizing Confirmation\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - The expected nomination of former pizza chain executive Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve appears to be in jeopardy after a fourth Republican senator voiced opposition, potentially denying Cain the support needed for confirmation in the post.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Senator Kevin Cramer stated, \"If I had to vote today, I would vote no.\" If all of the Senate's Democrats and the two independents aligned with them were to vote against Cain, he would fall short of the majority support he needs.\n\nAccording to ABC News, citing sources familiar with the matter, Cain is expected to withdraw his name from consideration in the coming days. Cain declined comment on the report.\n\nSenators Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, and Cory Gardner, all Republicans, have each reportedly said they would vote against Cain if he is nominated. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell withheld comment on Thursday on whether he would support Cain, saying he would wait to see \"who is actually nominated.\"\n\nEconomists and critics have expressed concerns about loyalists of President Donald Trump serving on the traditionally nonpartisan central bank. Cain has been a public advocate of many of Trump's policies, as has Stephen Moore, another person Trump has said he wants to nominate. Neither nomination has been formally sent to the Senate.\n\nOn Facebook earlier this week, Cain said the reason he was under attack as a nominee was because he is a conservative. Cain's bid for president in 2012 was derailed by accusations of sexual harassment that he has repeatedly denied.\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said earlier on Thursday that Trump intended to proceed with his plan to name Cain to the Fed's board of governors.\n\n\"I like Herman Cain,\" Trump told reporters on Wednesday. \"As to how he's doing in the process, that I don't know... Herman is a great guy, and I hope he does well.\"\n\nThe president nominates members to the Fed's seven-member board of governors. He elevated Jerome Powell to chairman a year ago but has frequently criticized him for the Fed's interest rate increases. The nominations must be approved by the Senate. The central bank's other top policymakers head the Fed's 12 regional banks and are chosen by local boards of directors, not the president.\n\nRelated Coverage:\n- U.S. Senate leader McConnell notes Republican worries over Cain serving on Fed\n- Trump has slammed the central bank's 2018 rate hikes for thwarting economic growth and publicly pressed policymakers to change course.\n- Central bank independence from short-term politics is seen as important to prevent influence that could lead to runaway debt, hyperinflation, and financial instability. The issue is a topic of conversation at the meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington this week.\n- \"Undermining central bank independence would be dangerous,\" Tobias Adrian, director of the International Monetary Fund's monetary and capital markets department, said in an interview on Wednesday with Bloomberg News.",
    " Title: Secretary of State John Kerry Advocates for Peaceful Resolution on Korean Peninsula, Amidst Escalating Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry arrived in Tokyo today, concluding the final leg of his Asia trip, with a focus on finding a peaceful resolution to the ongoing tensions on the Korean peninsula. The U.S. diplomat met with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, reiterating the Obama administration's commitment to a diplomatic approach, while expressing concerns about North Korean provocations in the region.\n\nDuring the meeting, Kerry stated that the U.S. would not rule out direct talks with North Korea, but only under the condition that Pyongyang takes steps towards denuclearization and agrees to negotiate in a responsible manner. Kerry emphasized the potential for peace, stating, \"We can find a way to resolve these differences at the negotiating table.\"\n\nThe visit to Japan comes as North Korea has increased its rhetoric towards Tokyo, with the regime singling out Japan as the potential first target in the event of a war on the Korean peninsula. In response, Japanese Foreign Minister Kishida stated that Japan is prepared for such contingencies, including potential missile launches, but will continue to pursue a \"dialogue and pressure\" policy.\n\nKerry's visit follows meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, during which both parties reaffirmed their commitment to working towards the denuclearization of North Korea. In a joint statement, Kerry and Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi expressed concern over the current situation and agreed on the need for China to pressure North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and calm tensions on the peninsula.\n\nIn North Korea, celebrations for the 101st birthday of founder Kim Il Sung continued, with Pyongyang hosting an international marathon. However, the government has not ceased its threats towards the outside world, denouncing South Korean President Park Geun-hye's offer of dialogue as a \"cunning ploy\" and an \"empty shell.\"\n\nThe ongoing U.S.-South Korea military exercises and the recent shutdown of the Kaesong Industrial Complex have further escalated tensions in the region. Analysts have speculated that North Korea may launch a mid-range Musudan missile before the April 15 celebration, while the whereabouts of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have raised further concerns.\n\nIn an effort to defuse tensions, South Korean President Park Geun-hye offered peace through dialogue, a move welcomed by Kerry, who has repeatedly expressed his support for bilateral talks. Kerry stated, \"I think she's shown great courage in her willingness to take [talks] in that direction, provided she has a willing partner.\"\n\nAs the situation on the Korean peninsula remains volatile, the international community continues to watch closely as diplomatic efforts are made to find a peaceful resolution to the ongoing tensions.",
    " Title: U.S. Delegation to Sochi Winter Olympics Includes Openly Gay Athletes, High-Ranking Officials Absent\n\nThe United States will send a delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympics in Russia, but it will not include any members of President Barack Obama's family or active Cabinet secretaries. Instead, the delegation will feature openly gay athletes, including tennis legend Billie Jean King and figure skater Brian Boitano, who will attend the games' opening ceremonies on February 7.\n\nThe White House announced Tuesday that the delegation will also include former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, White House aide Rob Nabors, and the U.S. ambassador to Russia. Speed skaters Bonnie Blair and Eric Heiden, as well as openly gay hockey player Caitlin Cahow, will also attend the games.\n\nThe selection of this delegation is intended to send a message that the United States is a diverse nation, according to White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. This is the first time in more than a decade that the President, vice president, first lady, or former president has not attended an Olympic opening or closing ceremony.\n\nThe absence of high-ranking U.S. officials amounts to a snub to Russia, whose relationship with the United States has fractured over the past year. The admission of NSA leaker Edward Snowden, wanted on espionage charges in the United States, was granted temporary asylum in Moscow, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has used Russia's veto on the United Nations Security Council to block action in Syria.\n\nObama canceled a meeting with Putin that was scheduled for September, though the two met as part of a larger group of world leaders at the Group of 20 conference in St. Petersburg. Fueling the rift between the nations are new laws in Russia banning gay \"propaganda\" -- a law critics say is so vague that anyone can be prosecuted for wearing a rainbow T-shirt or holding hands in public with someone of the same sex.\n\nCarney noted on Wednesday that the selection of gay athletes was not the first time Obama had voiced concern over the Russian policy. \"That's not a message we would wait to send through this manner,\" Carney said. \"We have been very clear -- the President has been very clear that he finds it offensive, the anti-LGBT legislation in Russia.\"\n\nObama told Jay Leno in August that he had \"no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgender persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them,\" and during his visit to Russia earlier this year, Obama met with the leaders of Russian social activist groups.",
    " Title: Governors Grapple with Health Care Decisions as Supreme Court Ruling Leaves Questions Unanswered\n\nArticle:\n\nAs governors from across the nation convened in Williamsburg, Virginia, this weekend, health care was a primary focus of their discussions. With the Supreme Court's recent decision on the federal health law, states now have new options regarding the expansion of their Medicaid programs.\n\nRepublican governors, in particular, expressed surprise by the Supreme Court's ruling, which declared the health law constitutional but allowed states to opt out of significantly expanding their Medicaid programs for individuals earning more than approximately $15,000 per year.\n\n\"A lot of us, certainly on the Republican side, believed it would be found unconstitutional,\" said Utah Gov. Gary Herbert. \"So I think it's just added more confusion to the issue rather than settling the issue.\" He added that the November election would likely provide more clarity on the implications moving forward.\n\nVirginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, the meeting's host, declined to reveal his state's plans for Medicaid expansion, citing the need for more information. \"I don't think it's responsible for my state to make a decision now because there's still more information we need,\" he said.\n\nDemocratic governors, on the other hand, generally favor Medicaid expansion. Delaware's Jack Markell, the incoming chairman of the National Governors Association, argued that the decision is a financial analysis rather than a political one. \"This is not political. This is a financial analysis of what does it mean to cover, in our case, an additional 30,000 people,\" he said, emphasizing that the expansion would be a good deal for Delaware taxpayers.\n\nWhile Republicans view the Supreme Court decision as adding confusion, Democrats, like Maryland's Martin O'Malley, believe it should have ended the debate. \"I think most governors understand that the Supreme Court's decision was a final and clear ruling,\" O'Malley said.\n\nSome Democratic governors were more critical of their Republican counterparts, with Vermont's Peter Shumlin accusing some of them of being disingenuous by calling for the repeal of the health law while declining to state whether they would accept the federal Medicaid funding that results from it.\n\nO'Malley of Maryland anticipates that many Republican governors will eventually accept the federal funding for economic, if not political, reasons. \"Once the posturing of the election is past, I think that a lot of these governors are going to have a hard time going home to their doctors, nurses, hospitals, and explaining to them why they are passing up an opportunity to transform these dollars into better economic uses for job creation in their states,\" he said.\n\nHowever, for Republican governors like Nebraska's Dave Heineman, the issue is about more than just state-specific interests. \"They all say it's free federal money. No, it's not. That's our tax dollars,\" Heineman said. \"It's costing every one of us.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, governors seemed to agree on one point: there are still many questions they need the federal government to answer as the health law's implementation progresses.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Hear Landmark Digital Privacy Case Involving Microsoft and Overseas Emails\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court has agreed to hear a significant case on digital privacy, pitting the federal government against tech giant Microsoft in a dispute over emails stored overseas. The justices are already set to consider whether law enforcement can access, without a warrant, cellphone location data held by wireless service providers, making this term a crucial one for the intersection of technology and the law.\n\nThe Microsoft case stems from a 2013 incident where U.S. prosecutors demanded Microsoft turn over emails linked to a drug-trafficking case, which were stored only on Microsoft servers in Ireland. Microsoft complied with information it had stored in the United States but sued to block the warrant, arguing that U.S. law enforcement could not seize evidence held in another country.\n\nIn 2014, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ordered Microsoft to hand over the emails. However, last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York reversed the decision and ruled in Microsoft's favor.\n\nBy agreeing to hear the case, the justices are taking on an issue they could have left alone, as there is no split among federal appeals courts. This is also true in the cellphone location data case.\n\nCongress is currently considering legislation that would clarify some aspects left unaddressed by the Stored Communications Act of 1986, which did not address communications held overseas. Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith argued that the court should have waited for Congress to act, stating, \"The current laws were written for the era of the floppy disk, not the world of the cloud.\"\n\nThe Trump administration urged the high court to take on the case, arguing that the appeals court decision \"is interfering with the ability of state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute crime in their jurisdictions.\" Thirty-three states supported this argument, stating that the appeals court decision \"is interfering with the ability of state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute crime in their jurisdictions.\"\n\nMicrosoft, on the other hand, argued that Congress is the appropriate forum to address the issue, noting that the Justice Department proposed a legislative fix before appealing the lower court ruling to the Supreme Court. The company warned that the nation's technology sector would be harmed \"if it becomes the conduit through which U.S. law enforcement can seize the private communications of every U.S. service provider\u2019s customers, no matter where in the world those customers are located or their data is stored.\"",
    " Title: Texas Governor Rick Perry Joins Other Republican Governors in Refusing to Expand Medicaid under ACA\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision last month that the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is optional, several Republican governors have pledged to opt out. On Monday, Texas Governor Rick Perry joined the ranks, stating that Texas will not participate in Medicaid expansion.\n\nPerry's decision aligns with other GOP state executives who have declined to offer Medicaid to individuals with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level. This year, that equates to approximately $15,000 for an individual or $25,000 for a family of three.\n\nDuring an interview on Fox News, Perry stated, \"We're not going to participate in any exchanges. We're not going to expand Medicaid. We're just not going to be a part of, again, socializing health care in the state of Texas. And going in direct conflict with our Founding Fathers' wishes and freedom, for that matter.\"\n\nPerry and his colleagues argue that they are rejecting the health law for primarily ideological reasons. The states' reluctance stems from the fact that, when it comes to Medicaid, the states do not appear to be on the hook for significant financial contributions.\n\nAccording to Jeff Goldsmith, a health policy analyst who teaches public health at the University of Virginia, the ACA provides 100% coverage for people newly eligible for Medicaid by the federal government in the initial years, and 90% in subsequent years. This compares to the rest of the Medicaid program, where the federal government pays an average of just under 60%.\n\nHowever, states' concerns extend beyond the newly eligible population. Dennis Smith, secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and former head of the federal Medicaid program under President George W. Bush, notes that this year, his state put over a billion dollars into its existing Medicaid program. \"And that took up literally almost the entire new revenues available to the state\u2014meaning revenues not just for health care, but also intended for education, transportation, law enforcement, and everything else,\" he says.\n\nEven with enhanced federal match rates, Wisconsin faced a $600 million budget shortfall. \"So states just don't have the dollars, even with those enhanced federal match rates,\" Smith says.\n\nAnother concern for many state leaders is the so-called \"woodwork effect.\" When major parts of the health law go into effect in 2014, they worry it will bring out of the woodwork the millions of people who are already eligible for Medicaid but are not currently enrolled.\n\nWhen some people look to see if they can get health insurance through one of the health exchanges, they may discover a cheaper option. \"They will find out that they're actually eligible for Medicaid,\" says Bruce Lesley, president of First Focus, an advocacy group for children and families.\n\nHowever, many of those people signing up for Medicaid will not be part of the newly eligible expansion group, whose bills will be largely paid by the federal government. They'll be regular old Medicaid beneficiaries, and states will have to pay up to half their costs.\n\nGoldsmith says what has state officials most worried is how easy it will be for these currently eligible but unenrolled Medicaid recipients to sign up. \"It won't be an in-person visit, it won't be a 'bring six forms of ID,'\" he says. \"There will be an expedited\u2014lubricated, if you will\u2014process to get people onto the rolls, and I think that's the part that's giving state budget officers serious indigestion at this point.\"\n\nGoldsmith says state officials he's talked to worry that Medicaid, already the largest piece of almost every state budget, could end up dwarfing everything else. \"The health and human services secretary of Louisiana told me that at full implementation, 48% of the citizens of his state would be on Medicaid,\" he says. \"And I strongly suspect that [as] you go across the Southern tier of the United States, you'll see a lot of those states in the 30s. A third of their citizens eligible for or potentially enrolled in Medicaid.\"\n\nThis has some states looking at cutting back their Medicaid programs even now. Wisconsin's Dennis Smith, who used to run the federal Medicaid program, says he reads the Supreme Court decision as allowing that.\n\nHowever, the Obama administration disagrees. Last night, it sent a letter to all the nation's governors, noting that \"the Court's decision did not affect other provisions of the law.\" An administration official confirmed that included the requirement that states maintain current eligibility levels until the year 2014.\n\nHealth advocate Lesley, a former Capitol Hill staffer, agrees with the administration. \"Our reading of the Supreme Court ruling is [that] the opinion by Justice Roberts...cites basically a specific section of the law and basically changed the idea that the Medicaid expansion can no longer be a mandatory thing, but now is optional,\" Lesley says. \"However, what it did not touch on was this idea of requiring states to maintain coverage. So we believe that that is absolutely still in place.\"",
    " Title: \"Negotiations with Iran Remain Tough as Deadline Approaches: Kerry and Zarif Discuss New Approaches, but Agreement Remains Elusive\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the deadline for the nuclear talks between Iran and the P5+1 nations approaches, Secretary of State John Kerry has expressed concerns about the possibility of reaching an agreement. In a news conference on Monday night, Kerry stated, \"Is it possible in the end we won't reach an agreement? Yes, it is.\"\n\nKerry acknowledged the complexity of the negotiations, stating, \"These talks are not going to get easier just because we extend them. They are tough, they've been tough, and they are going to stay tough.\"\n\nOfficials have been tight-lipped about the new approaches being explored with Iran, only indicating that experts from the Energy Department's national laboratories will be studying them to determine if they, in combination with other steps, would provide at least a year's warning if Iran were to pursue a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe potential steps could involve Iran committing to ship some of its nuclear stockpile to Russia, disconnecting some of the country's centrifuges in a way that would take considerable time to reverse, and imposing limits on output that can be verified by international inspectors. A European diplomat involved in the discussions described the process as having \"a lot of moving parts,\" and the question is what it adds up to.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stated late Monday that the new ideas do not represent a proposal by either side but rather a compilation of ideas exchanged between the two parties. Zarif reiterated his commitment to maintaining the secrecy of the negotiating room and expressed concern about leaks emerging from the discussions, which have been numerous and have made it difficult to reach a deal.\n\nKerry praised Zarif, describing him as a creative diplomat who must navigate Iran's complex political landscape and is uncertain about how far the country's supreme leader will allow him to go. The Iranian leaders came to power promising an end to sanctions that have reduced Iran's oil revenue by approximately 60 percent, devalued its currency, and made overseas financial transactions nearly impossible.",
    " Title: Republican Senators Urge White House to Reject Union's Call for ObamaCare Subsidy Extension for Employer-Covered Workers\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of thirty-one Republican senators have penned a letter to President Obama, urging the rejection of union demands to extend ObamaCare subsidies to workers who already have coverage through their jobs. The senators' letter, sent on Thursday, follows a report in a major newspaper that unions are seeking access to federal subsidies due to concerns that other provisions of the health care law could increase the cost of their health care plans.\n\nThe senators' letter comes in response to a statement by a Treasury official that the issue is \"the subject of pending regulations.\" However, the senators argue that this statement disregards the clear language of the law.\n\n\"We respectfully, but strongly, disagree,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"The statement made by Treasury simply ignores the letter of the law.\"\n\nThe senators point out that several provisions in the health care law could potentially increase the cost of coverage, such as the elimination of caps on benefits. Unions, like many employers across the country, have expressed concern that the increase in up-front coverage costs could lead to the dropping of health coverage by unionized employers.\n\nHowever, the senators argue that workers with an employer-based plan are not eligible, under the law, to receive subsidies intended for those who do not have insurance through their jobs.\n\n\"The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) is not ambiguous, in fact it is explicit, on this point,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Any consideration of expanding access to subsidies therefore is not subject to regulation, but a change in the law.\"\n\nThe senators cite a Congressional Research Service report that states that employer-sponsored coverage would \"generally\" make an employee \"ineligible to receive a premium subsidy.\"\n\nThe subsidies, along with most major provisions of the health care law, are set to go into effect next year. According to the report, 20 million people are covered in plans run by unions and employers.\n\nThe letter to Obama was signed by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo.\n\n\"Concerns about rising premiums are driven by policies in (the health care law),\" they wrote. \"Rather than considering a diversion of subsidies not remotely contemplated in the statute, perhaps the concerns being raised by union plans should be cause to revisit the taxes, fees and other policies that drive premium increases.\"",
    " Title: Baltimore's Ongoing Protests: A Look at Police Brutality and the Human Toll\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Baltimore, protests have been ongoing, sparked by the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African-American man who sustained severe spinal injuries while in police custody. While the city's Mayor and a diverse city council have been in place, the issue of police brutality remains unresolved.\n\nAccording to a report by The Baltimore Sun, the city paid out $5.7 million to victims of police brutality between 2011 and 2014. However, the more startling figure is that over the past four years, more than 100 people have won court judgments or settlements related to allegations of brutality and civil-rights violations.\n\nThe victims of police brutality in Baltimore are not just young men; they include a 15-year-old boy riding a dirt bike, a 26-year-old pregnant accountant who had witnessed a beating, a 50-year-old woman selling church raffle tickets, a 65-year-old church deacon rolling a cigarette, and an 87-year-old grandmother aiding her wounded grandson.\n\nOne such victim is Venus Green, a former teacher with two college degrees who spent her retirement years as a foster parent for needy children. On one day, her grandson ran up to her crying for an ambulance. When paramedics and police responded to the emergency call, a white officer became hostile. Green's grandson was accused of lying, and the officer refused to help him. Green, with no criminal record, pleaded with the officer, but he became violent, shoving her against the wall, handcuffing her, and throwing her to the ground.\n\nThe officer, who is not identified in the lawsuit, wanted to go into the basement, but Green demanded a warrant. Her grandson kept two dogs downstairs, and she feared they would attack. The officer unhooked the lock, but Green latched it. He shoved Green against the wall, she hit the wooden floor, and he continued to assault her.\n\nAfter pulling Green to her feet, the officer told her she was under arrest. Green complained of pain, but the handcuffs remained. An African-American officer then walked in the house, saw her sobbing, and asked that the handcuffs be removed since Green wasn't violent. The cuffs came off, and Green didn't face any charges. But a broken shoulder tormented her for months.\n\nThe city paid Green $95,000 in a settlement. This case is just one of the many that highlight the human toll of police brutality in Baltimore. The full article, which includes the stories of other victims, can be found here.",
    " Title: Obama Advocates for Direct Peace Talks Between Israelis and Palestinians, Urges Flexibility and Trust-Building\n\nArticle:\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank \u2014 In a joint appearance with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Thursday, President Barack Obama emphasized the need for direct negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders, without preconditions, to push through obstacles to peace.\n\nDuring his first trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories as president, Obama reiterated that the resolution to the conflict requires both parties to work through the process, even in the presence of \"irritants\" on both sides.\n\nIn what may have been a signal to Abbas to be more flexible, Obama cited the complex politics in Israel as part of the reason finding a resolution to the conflict is difficult.\n\nObama outlined the American role going forward as one of helping \"build confidence, rebuild a sense of trust.\" The meeting between the two leaders was preceded by a morning launch of rockets from the Hamas-controlled Gaza, two of which landed in southern Israel. The issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the end to violence were central topics during the meeting.\n\nObama discussed the issue of settlements at length during his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, the first day of his trip. The president opposed settlement-building and reiterated that America's position is that continued settlement activity is not constructive or appropriate.\n\nHowever, Obama kept his distance from Abbas' position that ending settlements should be a precondition for peace talks, and was more restrained on the topic than in 2009, when he stated that America \"does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements.\"\n\nObama also addressed Israel's security concerns, referencing them on several occasions and using the Thursday morning attack as an example. He emphasized the need for both parties to work towards a peaceful resolution, while acknowledging the complexities and challenges that come with the conflict.",
    " Title: Bob Costas Clarifies Anti-Gun Remarks, Sparks Debate on American Gun Culture\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on the O'Reilly Factor, NBC sportscaster Bob Costas attempted to clarify his controversial anti-gun comments made during a Sunday Night Football broadcast. The comments, which were met with heavy criticism, were made in response to the tragic shooting incident involving NFL player Jovan Belcher.\n\nDuring the interview, Costas, who has been accused of shifting focus and making excuses, emphasized that his comments were not his own but were a paraphrase from a column by Jason Whitlock. However, Costas's attempt to distance himself from the comments was met with skepticism, as he had explicitly stated during the broadcast that he was quoting Whitlock.\n\nCostas also faced criticism for his comments being perceived as an attack on gun rights. He attempted to argue that his comments were not about gun control, but this claim was met with disbelief, as Costas's statement that \"we have too many guns\" was widely interpreted as a call for stricter gun control measures.\n\nCostas also drew criticism for using the shooting in Aurora, Colorado, as an example to support his argument. He suggested that if the theater had allowed patrons to carry guns, the tragedy could have been prevented. However, both Costas and O'Reilly failed to mention that the theater was a gun-free zone, and the shooter had a history of mental health issues that authorities had failed to address.\n\nCostas's comments also sparked debate about the two distinct gun cultures in America. He argued that America has a deep-rooted gun culture that is rooted in American history and the Second Amendment, with the majority of gun owners using firearms for collection, personal protection, hunting, and sport. However, Costas's comments were met with criticism for oversimplifying the complex issue of gun culture in America.\n\nIn conclusion, the interview sparked a heated debate about gun culture in America, with many criticizing Costas for his lack of understanding of the issue and his attempt to use the Aurora shooting to score political points. Many also criticized Costas for his failure to acknowledge the complexities of gun culture in America and the need for a nuanced approach to the issue. It remains to be seen whether Costas will continue to address the issue in the future.",
    " Title: Senate Approves Funding Bill, Shifts Money for Slaughterhouse Inspections but Rejects White House Tours Restoration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant bipartisan move, the U.S. Senate voted on Wednesday to fund the government through the remainder of the fiscal year, averting a potential government shutdown. The bill, which now returns to the House for final approval, includes a provision to maintain full-time slaughterhouse inspectors, but it does not restore funding for White House tours.\n\nThe 73-26 vote reflects a growing consensus in Congress that the government shutdown showdowns of the past two years have not benefited either party. The bill, which funds basic operations through September 30, does not reverse the level of sequester cuts but does reallocate funds to restore military tuition assistance programs and food inspections.\n\nWithout additional funding, federal inspectors would have been furloughed, potentially causing a significant disruption in U.S. meat production. Industry officials had predicted that a furlough would result in a 2 billion pound decrease in beef and pork production and a 3 billion pound decrease in poultry production.\n\nSenators unanimously approved the addition of funds for food inspections, with Sen. Christopher A. Coons (Delaware Democrat) stating, \"It was important that Congress act to prevent a potential crisis from developing in our nation's food supply.\"\n\nIn a separate vote, senators declined to undo President Obama's decision to cancel White House tours, which was one of the casualties of the budget sequesters. Sen. Tom Coburn (Oklahoma Republican) proposed an amendment to restore White House tours by cutting $8 million from spending on national heritage areas in the National Park Service budget. However, the amendment was defeated in a 54-45 vote, with nearly every Republican voting to reopen the White House and almost all Democrats voting to support President Obama's decision.\n\nSen. Jack Reed (Rhode Island Democrat) led the opposition, arguing that the amendment would hurt economic development in their home states. The debate over the amendment highlighted a partisan divide, with Sen. Tom Coburn accusing his colleagues of focusing on the wrong issues due to election-year politics.\n\nWith the 2013 spending bill now cleared, the Senate will turn its attention to the 2014 budget. The House has already begun debating the 2014 budget, with Republicans defeating three Democratic alternatives on Wednesday. The main Democratic substitute was rejected in a 253-165 vote, with even 28 Democrats balking at the tax and spending increases. The final vote on the conservative plan was 132-104, with 14 Democrats and 118 Republicans voting against it, and just 104 Republicans voting for it.",
    " Title: Congressional Response to the Khashoggi Incident: A Delicate Balance of Power and Diplomacy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe suspected death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi has sparked a wave of criticism towards Saudi Arabia on Capitol Hill, with lawmakers from both parties expressing their concern over the incident. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that there will likely be a response, but the nature and timing of any action remain uncertain.\n\nThe U.S. and Saudi Arabia have a long-standing, complex relationship, with shared interests in the Middle East. However, the Khashoggi incident has led to calls for action from senators such as Lindsey Graham, who has urged the U.S. to impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia, and Patrick Leahy, who has criticized the U.S.'s perceived deference to the Saudis.\n\nThe immediate future of U.S.-Saudi relations may be uncertain, as both houses of Congress are currently in recess until November 13. The midterm elections are likely to delay any action, as volume of criticism does not always equate to proportional action in Congress.\n\nOne potential tool at Congress's disposal is the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which allows for the imposition of sanctions on foreign powers responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, or detention. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker and the committee's top Democrat, Bob Menendez, have called on the Trump Administration to launch an investigation and make a determination under the Magnitsky Act.\n\nIf the Administration finds evidence of human rights abuses, the U.S. can impose sanctions. However, the four-month investigation period may extend into the new Congress, which will likely tackle any potential discipline for Saudi Arabia in 2019.\n\nThe Khashoggi affair has also raised questions about the Trump Administration's stance on violence against journalists, as President Trump has been criticized for making light of physical violence against the press. The complexities of the U.S.-Saudi relationship and the upcoming midterm elections may delay any significant action on the Khashoggi front for months.\n\nThe Khashoggi incident has sparked impassioned conversations on Capitol Hill, but the language and potential action would be more intense if Congress were in session now. The new Congress will grapple with this issue after January 3, 2019. By then, it is quite possible that lawmakers may have moved on to address the next international crisis.",
    " Title: The Gun Control Debate: A Closer Look at the Landscape and the Parkland Students' Demands\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing battle to reshape America's gun control laws is a complex and contentious issue, with the aftermath of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school shooting serving as a catalyst for change. The students who survived the tragic event are spearheading a movement to redefine the gun control debate, with their message resonating across the nation.\n\nEmma Gonz\u00e1lez, a senior at the school, addressed politicians on Sunday, stating, \"You're either with us or against us.\" In a powerful speech to gun control advocates the day before, she vowed, \"We are going to be the last mass shooting.\"\n\nOften perceived as a stalemate dominated by the National Rifle Association (NRA), the American gun control debate is not as one-sided as it may seem. There has been more action and more gun violence prevention victories than many realize. Here is the landscape the Parkland students face as they demand new congressional action on gun control laws:\n\n- Approximately 55-75 million Americans own guns, but the NRA only claims 5 million members, representing less than 10% of America's total gun owners.\n- Three percent of American adults own half the country's guns, with most gun owners having just one or two. However, a small group of super-owners, who collectively own half of the country's 256 million guns, own an average of 17 each.\n- Seventy-two percent of American adults have shot a gun, even though only 20-30% personally own a firearm. In contrast, 44% of American adults say they personally know someone who has been shot, either accidentally or intentionally.\n- Twenty-nine percent of gun owners say the NRA has too much influence over gun laws, according to a recent Pew survey. However, overall, 55% of American adults say that the NRA has the \"right amount\" of power or even \"too little\" power over American gun laws.\n- Most gun control legislation being debated now is compatible with the Second Amendment. The Supreme Court's 2008 Heller decision, a pro-gun-rights ruling, made it unconstitutional to completely ban Americans from keeping handguns in their homes for self-defense.\n- Completely banning military-style rifles would not significantly reduce the number of gun violence victims, as most are killed with ordinary handguns. According to the best available data from the FBI, only 3.55% of gun murders were committed with any kind of rifle from 2010 to 2014.\n- Most American gun control groups agree that fighting for universal background checks on gun sales is the law that would do the most good. They have shifted their focus away from banning assault weapons to closing the loopholes in the federal background check system, which currently allows private sales between individuals with no background check.\n- Many gun control advocates worry the current movement is too moderate, and that it needs a more radical left flank. The NRA is often pushed to more extreme positions by smaller groups with even more hardline second-amendment views.\n- There are dramatic racial, economic, and geographic disparities in American gun violence. Black children 17 and under are 10 times more likely to be murdered with a gun than white children. About half of America's gun murder victims each year are black. The census tracts that saw the worst gun violence in 2015 represented about 1.5% of the country's total population, but 26% of the total gun homicides.\n\nThe Parkland students' demands for gun control reform are a testament to their resilience and determination. As the landscape of the gun control debate continues to evolve, it is essential to approach the issue with a nuanced understanding of the facts and the complexities involved.",
    " Title: Analysis: RealClearPolitics Poll Average Suggests Donald Trump May Have Reached Polling Ceiling\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent analysis, Kevin Drum of Mother Jones suggests that the RealClearPolitics poll average indicates that Donald Trump may have reached his ceiling in the Republican primary race. According to Drum, Trump's poll numbers peaked at 24.3 percent on August 5 and have since plateaued and fallen to 22.0 percent.\n\nDrum's analysis is supported by a chart accompanying his piece, which shows a clear flattening of Trump's poll numbers since August 5. However, the trend lines at Pollster, the poll aggregator now run by The Huffington Post, do not show the same level of flattening, but do suggest that Trump's momentum has slowed significantly.\n\nThe difference between the trend lines can be attributed to the inclusion of several polls by Pollster that RealClearPolitics does not, including online polls that give Trump a lead as high as 32 percent. Additionally, there seem to be some differences in how the poll averages themselves are calculated.\n\nDespite these differences, the trends are generally identical, and they do suggest that while Donald Trump continues to lead the Republican field, his numbers are at least flattening. This trend is likely to continue for the next several weeks before the next Republican debate, due to the slow end-of-summer news cycle and the fact that we're unlikely to see any real movement in the polls before the next debate unless one of the candidates stumbles significantly or we start seeing major ad buys.\n\nDrum predicts that 25 percent will end up being the peak of Trump's support, but he admits that he's risking an egg-on-your-face moment if he turns out to be wrong. However, even if Drum is right, that doesn't mean that Trump will be fading from the scene any time soon. In a field this large, poll numbers in the range of 20-25 percent still make you a frontrunner, and therefore the focus of the race.\n\nIf these numbers were to continue for the next six months or more, then 20-25 percent would mean winning primaries and caucuses, which obviously won't mean as much in the early stages of the race when delegates are being apportioned on a proportional basis rather than winner-take-all. Additionally, with a virtually unlimited personal fortune, Trump can stay in the race as long as he wants to, and he is largely immune from many of the pressures that would otherwise force a candidate from a race. That, combined with fairly decent poll numbers, puts Trump in a position that most candidates would love to be in.\n\nRepublicans may not like to hear it, but Donald Trump is going to be around for a while.",
    " Title: \"5 Key Points to Observe in Obama's Final State of the Union Address: Legacy, Bipartisanship, and a Boost for Clinton's Campaign\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final State of the Union address of his presidency, President Barack Obama will deliver a thematic and future-oriented speech on Tuesday night, aiming to leave a lasting impression on the American public. Here are five things to watch for in the address:\n\n1. A Shift in Tone and Focus:\nThe White House has promised that this speech will differ from Obama's past State of the Union addresses, focusing on thematic, future-oriented ideas rather than a laundry list of legislative proposals. The president has emphasized that the speech will focus on the \"big things that will guarantee an even stronger, better, more prosperous America for our kids.\"\n\n2. Prioritizing Legislation:\nWhile major legislative achievements may be challenging with a hostile Congress, the president is expected to reiterate his calls for a minimum wage hike and tax reform to free up funds for infrastructure investment. However, more realistic goals include the approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and a criminal justice system overhaul.\n\n3. Legacy Shaping:\nThis valedictory speech will allow Obama to frame his accomplishments in the most positive light. He will highlight the recovery of the auto industry, improving employment, his initiatives on climate change, gun background checks, and the reopening of relations with Cuba. The guests joining First Lady Michelle Obama in the House chamber have been selected to represent the arc of Obama's presidency.\n\n4. Aiding Clinton's Campaign:\nIn his last State of the Union address, Obama framed the election in terms of economic debate, focusing on inclusive growth. This economic focus aligns with Hillary Clinton's campaign, and the president is expected to emphasize this in his speech. Additionally, expect to hear Obama touch on hot-button issues that resonate with the Democratic base, such as climate change, gun control, immigration reform, or gay rights.\n\n5. Bipartisan Olive Branches:\nThe president will likely extend olive branches to the Republicans on potentially bipartisan issues like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and criminal justice system overhaul. This is an attempt to foster bipartisanship and leave a positive legacy.\n\nThe State of the Union address often has a short shelf life, but a well-received speech can deliver a political boost. President Obama is hoping this speech will help improve his approval ratings, which have been in the mid-40s for months, and potentially aid Hillary Clinton's campaign and his own legacy.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking the Clinton-Kaine Theory on the Causes of the Great Recession\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent vice-presidential debate, Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, reiterated a new economic theory put forth by Hillary Clinton in the first presidential debate: that the Bush tax cuts of 2003 contributed to the Great Recession. This argument, however, lacks support from mainstream economic theories and empirical evidence.\n\nNeither Clinton nor Kaine mentioned traditional explanations for the Great Recession, such as government-subsidized housing or excessive financial leverage on Wall Street. Their argument is novel, and it requires fact-checking.\n\nMainstream economic theories, including Keynesian, classical, and monetarist, do not support the view that tax relief can cause recessions in the short-run. The Keynesian view argues that deficit-financed tax cuts, such as those passed in 2003 under Bush, should provide stimulus to the economy by encouraging spending. Tax cuts provide stimulus through boosting post-tax incomes, thus giving people more money to spend, which creates more economic activity and income for others.\n\nMany economists argue that tax cuts which benefit the poor and middle-class deliver a bigger jolt to the economy, as such individuals tend to spend a higher fraction of their incomes. The Bush tax cuts of 2003 reduced rates for all tax brackets, but even if they had been geared solely to the rich, Keynesian theory would suggest that they would produce a stimulative impact on the economy, although a significantly diminished one.\n\nThe classical and monetarist views argue that only permanent reductions in taxes have a positive impact on wealth in the long-run. The Bush tax cuts expired after eight years, so classical and monetarist economists could debate whether they count as a temporary fiscal shock or not. But neither school believes that tax cuts have a negative effect on economic activity.\n\nThe only plausible economic theory that could support the Kaine-Clinton argument is that deficit-financed tax cuts create recessions by expanding public debt to the point of fiscal insolvency, as happened in Greece. However, that's not what happened in the Great Recession of 2008\u20132009.\n\nEmpirical work on the impact of tax cuts in isolation suggests that they almost always boost consumption and economic activity to varying degrees. University of Michigan economist Matthew Shapiro has found that over the last decade, tax cuts ranging from the initial tax-rate reductions enacted in 2001 under President Bush to the 2009 payroll-tax cuts under President Obama boosted economic activity to varying degrees.\n\nIt's important to note that income and wealth inequality are a separate matter. Few argue (and rightly so) that any of these tax cuts are self-financing. Quite the opposite: The continuing trend whereby the government takes in less than it spends has led to perennial deficits for 15 years. Perhaps such deficits could create fiscal drag on growth in the future, but that will only come in the form of higher taxes and lower growth, which again goes to show that tax cuts do not directly spur recessions.\n\nThe Clinton campaign's flawed theory of the Great Recession bears many resemblances to the false argument spouted by Bernie Sanders in the primaries: that the repeal of Glass-Steagall created the financial crisis. Both theories propagate a lie, in Sanders' case, the debunked idea that reinstating Glass-Steagall would have broken up the investment banks or commercial lenders that nearly brought down the system.\n\nWhile Sanders could ultimately be dismissed as a radical with no shot at power, Hillary Clinton may very well be our next president. When she argues that tax cuts cause recessions, her argument can't be allowed to stand.

    " Title: Federal Judge Overturns Trump's Attempt to Open Arctic and Atlantic Oceans to Oil and Gas Leasing\n\nA federal judge in Alaska has overturned U.S. President Donald Trump's attempt to open vast areas of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to oil and gas leasing. The decision, issued late Friday by U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason, leaves intact President Barack Obama's policies that put the Arctic's Chukchi Sea, part of the Arctic's Beaufort Sea, and a large swath of the Atlantic Ocean off the U.S. East Coast off-limits to oil leasing.\n\nTrump's attempt to undo Obama's protections was \"unlawful\" and a violation of the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, Gleason ruled. Presidents have the power under that law to withdraw areas from the national oil and gas leasing program, as Obama did, but only Congress has the power to add areas to the leasing program, she said.\n\nThe Obama-imposed leasing prohibitions \"will remain in full force and effect unless and until revoked by Congress,\" Gleason said in her ruling. Trump's move to put offshore Arctic and Atlantic areas back into play for oil development came in a 2017 executive order that was part of his \"energy dominance\" agenda. The order was among a series of actions that jettisoned Obama administration environmental and climate-change initiatives.\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed a vastly expanded offshore oil leasing program to start this year. The five-year Trump leasing program would offer two lease sales a year in Arctic waters and at least two lease sales a year in the Atlantic. The Trump plan also calls for several lease sales in remote marine areas off Alaska, like the southern Bering Sea, that are considered to hold negligible potential for oil.\n\nObama had pulled much of the Arctic off the auction block following a troubled offshore Arctic exploration program pursued by Royal Dutch Shell. Shell spent at least $7 billion trying to explore the Chukchi and part of the Beaufort. The company wrecked one of its drill ships in a grounding and managed to complete only one well to depth. It abandoned the program in 2015 and relinquished its leases.\n\nIn a separate case, Gleason delivered another decision on Friday that blocks the Trump administration's effort to overturn an Obama-era environmental decision. Gleason struck down a land trade intended to clear the way for a road to be built through sensitive wetlands in Alaska's Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. The Obama administration, after a four-year environmental impact statement process, determined that the land trade and road would cause too much harm to the refuge to be justified. Trump's then Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke broke the law when he summarily reversed the Obama policy without addressing the facts found in the previous administration's study of the issue, Gleason ruled.",
    " Title: Georgia Special Election Highlights Nationalized Local Elections and the Power of Party Affiliation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Georgia special election taking place on Tuesday, in a word, is extraordinary. The contest to determine the 435th in seniority in Congress' lower chamber has garnered an unprecedented amount of media coverage, visits from major political figures, and over $50 million, making it the most expensive House race in American history. However, the outcome of this election will not significantly impact the fate of either the Republican or Democratic parties, either this year, next year, or in 2020.\n\nThe Georgia special election serves as a microcosm of what we can expect in 2018 and 2020: the nationalized local election. Despite the fact that there are not hundreds of other races happening simultaneously (though there is also a special election in South Carolina, which has received minimal attention), the closeness of the contest and the district's significance has drawn national attention and resources.\n\nThe candidates, Jon Ossoff (Democrat) and Karen Handel (Republican), have not been eager to portray the election as a referendum on President Trump or the national parties. However, the reality is that a vote for Handel is a vote for the GOP agenda, while a vote for Ossoff is a vote for the Democratic agenda.\n\nThe two candidates have focused on local issues, but their party affiliations are the most significant factors determining their legislative priorities. Ossoff, if elected, will be a reliable Democratic vote, while Handel, if elected, will be a reliable Republican vote. This is not to say that the candidates will not represent the interests of their district, but rather that their ability to influence federal policy will be limited.\n\nIn conclusion, the Georgia special election serves as a reminder that voters are not just choosing a representative for their district, but also for their party. As Americans head to the polls in the coming years, they will likely treat local elections as referendums on the national parties, their agendas, and the President. This is an appropriate response, as the outcome of these elections will have national implications.",
    " Title: Republican Leaders Gather to Discuss Immigration Reform Strategy as Bipartisan Bill Faces Opposition in House\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to address the ongoing immigration reform debate, Republican leaders will convene on Wednesday afternoon to strategize with their members. However, the prospects for comprehensive immigration reform in the House appear dim, with many top Republicans predicting a slow, drawn-out demise for the issue.\n\nThe Republican Party, determined to rectify their 2012 mishap with the Hispanic community, now face the possibility of exacerbating the situation. The reality, according to these Republicans, is that most House members are white conservatives representing predominantly white districts, whose constituents show little interest in the immigration reform advocated by figures like Marco Rubio, Bill O'Reilly, and Karl Rove.\n\nThe House plans to adopt a piecemeal approach, with a border-security bill slated for this month, followed by one or two reform items per month in the fall. However, after numerous listening sessions, it is clear that even smaller, popular pieces of reform will be a tough sell.\n\nRep. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) recently held a town meeting where immigration was a topic of discussion. Out of 100 attendees, 25 spoke out, and every one of them advocated for avoiding any immigration reform resembling the Senate-passed bill.\n\n\"Our constituents don't trust our government,\" Cotton said, expressing his reluctance to pass even necessary reforms like a better tracking system for people in the country on visas, due to concerns they could become a \"Trojan horse in a conference committee for a package that puts legalization first and enforcement later.\"\n\nTop Republican and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill are increasingly pessimistic about reaching a deal this Congress. The Senate-passed bill, which was supported by only 13 of Rubio's fellow Republican senators, has faced criticism from conservative publications like the National Review and Weekly Standard, and private GOP headcounts show only a small fraction of House Republicans would ever vote for anything approximating the Senate deal.\n\nRep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a prominent member of the House's anti-immigration reform caucus, held a well-attended meeting on Monday to argue against the bipartisan bill. King contends that the Senate's immigration plan would benefit \"elites who want cheap labor, Democratic power brokers, and those who hire illegal labor.\"\n\n\"It would hurt Republicans, and I don't think you can make an argument otherwise,\" King said. \"Two out of every three of the new citizens would be Democrats.\" While some may dismiss King's views as extreme, they represent a mainstream perspective among House Republicans.",
    " Title: The Conservative Dilemma: Rebuilding Family and Community Beyond Government Intervention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2018 midterm elections, the Republican Party faces a significant challenge: the need to re-engage Americans in family and civic institutions outside of government. The Democrats' sweeping victories in the House, their near-minimum Senate losses, and their success in down-ballot races suggest a shift in the political landscape that may challenge the optimism of some Republican pundits.\n\nThis shift has led some Republicans to advocate for a new, policy-based form of Trumpism, one that recognizes the bifurcation of opportunity based on education and the breakdown of the nuclear family. Ross Douthat, now of the New York Times, and Reihan Salam, now of \u2588\u2588\u2588, have been at the forefront of this movement, arguing that strong families and communities are crucial for the prosperity and upward mobility of working-class Americans.\n\nTheir arguments have been echoed by Oren Cass of the Manhattan Institute, author of the new bestseller \"The Once and Future Worker.\" Cass argues for a focus on a labor market in which workers can support strong families and communities, which he believes is the central determinant of long-term prosperity.\n\nHowever, a fundamental question arises: is government intervention truly likely to lead to the revitalization of family and community? Do families and communities rebuild themselves on the basis of economic policy, or must the preconditions for economic thriving be in place first? When those preconditions are undermined, does prosperity naturally fade away?\n\nThese questions go to the heart of our politics and raise another serious question: can political conservatism survive the growth of government-led intervention designed to shore up fundamental institutions? When it comes to government intervention, what is the limiting principle? If we believe government can rebuild the labor market according to Cass's prescriptions, or rebuild families according to Douthat's and Salam's, where is the line drawn?\n\nConstitutional philosophy suggests that Douthat, Salam, and Cass are correct when it comes to the world they seek to build: safe, stable, culturally solid, community-oriented. However, constitutional philosophy also suggests that the institutions that hold up such a world cannot be created by government. Churches do not thrive because government subsidizes them; families do not thrive because government subsidizes them.\n\nThis means that conservatism's fundamental challenge these days is extra-governmental: convincing Americans to re-engage with family and civic associations outside of government, which cannot effectuate such re-engagement itself. Conservatives can focus on removing governmental disincentives toward family and community and work. They can also focus on removing cultural disincentives toward institution-building. This is where the culture war matters: fighting the Left's constant focus on breaking down family structure, disdain for stay-at-home mothers, disparagement of religious Americans, and distaste for American cultural solidarity.\n\nHowever, the moment conservatives try to build Trumpism around a policy of government do-gooderism, they run into the problem they seek to alleviate. Americans value family and community because they have values, not because family and community must be made more economically valuable. If we rely on material incentives to prop up our most vital social institutions, those institutions are likely to continue disintegrating\u2014and to take the economic freedom we hope to promote in the end with them.",
    " Title: Harvey Weinstein Arraigned, Charged with Rape and Sexual Assault, Faces up to 25 Years in Prison\n\nArticle:\n\n-Start of Article-\n\nDisgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein was released on a $1 million bail following his arraignment on Friday, after being charged with rape, criminal sex act, and other sex crimes stemming from encounters with two women. The charges were announced in Manhattan court.\n\nWeinstein, who has been accused by more than 80 women of sexual misconduct, surrendered to the New York Police Department and the Manhattan District Attorney's office on Friday morning. At the arraignment, Weinstein agreed to wear an electronic monitoring device, paid for at his own expense. He is only allowed to travel in New York state and Connecticut, and must seek permission to travel to other states.\n\nWeinstein has received a grand jury notice and will have until May 30 to decide whether to testify or not. The victim has received an order of protection and will remain anonymous.\n\nWeinstein turned himself in at NYPD's 1st Precinct around 7:30 a.m. ET, carrying books including Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein's Broadway Revolution and Elia Kazan about the stage and film director. Weinstein was noticeably struggling to walk, and left the station before 9 a.m. in handcuffs, headed to court for his arraignment.\n\nAs Weinstein headed into the courthouse, he was questioned by the crowd. \"You sorry, Harvey?\" someone shouted. \"What can you say?\" was also raised. In reply, Weinstein softly shook his head and answered \"No.\"\n\nWeinstein has consistently denied any allegations of non-consensual sex. His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said Friday that he would fight to get the charges dismissed, saying they are factually unsupported and constitutionally flawed.\n\nBrafman issued a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 following Friday's proceedings, reiterating his client's stance. \"Mr. Weinstein has always maintained that he has never engaged in non-consensual sexual behavior with anyone. Nothing about today's proceedings changes Mr. Weinstein's position. He has entered a plea of not guilty and fully expects to be exonerated.\"\n\nPolice expressed their gratitude to Weinstein's accusers. \"The NYPD thanks these brave survivors for their courage to come forward and seek justice,\" a statement read. \"The arrest and ensuing charges are the result of a joint investigation between the NYPD and the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office.\"\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. also thanked Weinstein's claimants for their courage in a statement shared to Twitter on Friday. \"Thank you to the brave survivors who have come forward, our office\u2019s tireless prosecutors, and our dedicated partners at @NYPDNews,\" he shared before urging those with additional accounts or information to reach out.\n\nWhen discussing the accusations facing his client, Brafman reminded reporters Friday his job isn't \"to defend behavior; my job is to defend something that is criminal behavior.\"\n\n\"Mr. Weinstein did not invent the casting couch in Hollywood,\" he declared, \"and to the extent that there is bad behavior in that industry, that is not what this is about. Bad behavior is not on trial in this case; it\u2019s only if you intentionally committed a criminal act, and Mr. Weinstein vigorously denies that.\"\n\nFriday's events come nearly eight months after The New York Times exposed three decades of alleged sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to rape from accusers including Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan, Salma Hayek, Lupita Nyong'o, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Weinstein decamped to Arizona to seek treatment soon afterward.\n\nWeinstein has been under investigation for months in New York, Los Angeles, and London.\n\nSeveral of the actresses who have made allegations against Weinstein, including McGowan and Annabella Sciorra, applauded his impending arrest on social media.\n\n\"The justice system has been something very elusive,\" McGowan said. \"I hope in this case it works. Because it\u2019s all true. None of this was consensual.\"\n\nWeinstein became a larger-than-life figure in Hollywood as co-founder of the \"mini-major\" studios Miramax (started in 1979) and The Weinstein Company (2005), producing and distributing awards-friendly films such as Oscar best-picture winners The Artist and The King's Speech.\n\nThe domineering studio head amassed tremendous influence with his strong personality, his ability to identify and champion artistic projects, and his track record of Oscar success\u2014the latter cemented when Weinstein's Shakespeare in Love was a shock best-picture winner over Steven Spielberg's heavily favored Saving Private Ryan in 1999.\n\nThe Weinstein scandal has triggered a cascade of accusations against Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K., Louis C.K., Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer, and Morgan Freeman, among others.\n\n-End of Article-",
    " Title: Mike Huckabee Affirms Independent Presidential Bid, Dismisses Notion of Bowing Out for Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who previously expressed consideration for stepping aside from a potential 2016 presidential run if his friend Jeb Bush entered the race, has now stated unequivocally that he will not withdraw his candidacy for any contender, including Bush or Mitt Romney.\n\nHuckabee, who finished second to John McCain in the 2008 Republican presidential nomination race, winning the Iowa caucus and several Southern primaries, expressed his intentions for the 2022 presidential race this spring. He announced his departure from his political talk show \"Huckabee\" on the Fox News Channel in early March to focus on another presidential run.\n\nThe former governor, who is part of a crowded field of potential GOP contenders, including Bush and 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, pushed back against those who have discouraged Romney from another White House bid, arguing that Romney's loss to President Obama in 2012 did not necessarily indicate an inability to connect with voters.\n\n\"It's wide open. Anyone could be a contender,\" said Huckabee. \"One of the things about politics, when you're actually there, you realize that you are on a high wire and there is no net under you. On any given day, your campaign can implode for something that happens inadvertently or intentionally.\"\n\nHuckabee continued, \"So you never say that someone is not a contender, that they can't make it. I hear that all the time about a lot of different people. Nobody knows. Voters will make that decision, and that's the way it ought to be.\"",
    " Title: Police Accountability and Reform: A Look at the Challenges and Solutions in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the death of George Floyd, a black man who died while being arrested, the issue of police brutality and accountability has once again taken center stage in the United States. The events unfolding on the streets, marked by tear gas, mass arrests, and curfews, echo similar confrontations that occurred nearly six years ago in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting of Michael Brown.\n\nAt \u2588\u2588\u2588, we have been reporting on the complexities of police reform since our inception in 2014, and the stories we have covered remain relevant in the face of ongoing challenges. This article aims to provide context and shed light on the intricacies of police accountability, reform, and the role of the military in policing.\n\nWhen a police officer is accused of misconduct or brutality, the process varies depending on the jurisdiction. In more than a dozen states, police officers enjoy their own Bill of Rights, which can mean that an officer under investigation does not have to answer questions for up to 10 days, and the department is still required to pay salary and benefits. This blurred line becomes even more apparent in joint task forces, where federal agencies like the U.S. Marshals recruit local police departments to track down fugitives or fight terrorism. In such cases, the local officers assigned to these task forces may not be bound by their own department's rules, such as wearing a body camera.\n\nReforming troubled police departments is a complex issue with a long history. A deep dive into the Kerner Commission Report, published in the aftermath of the race riots of the 1960s, reveals the shortcomings of federal attempts at police reform. More recently, we have explored the U.S. Department of Justice's tactic of suing local police departments to enact change through consent decrees, a strategy that has been largely set aside under recent Republican administrations. Alternatively, a local department can voluntarily adopt federally recommended reforms. However, the results often fall short, as evidenced by the experiences of residents in low-income and middle-class neighborhoods in Cincinnati, a city once celebrated for its successful federal intervention.\n\nTo better understand the root causes of police violence, we have spoken to a range of individuals who have immersed themselves in the issue. David Simon, creator of the acclaimed television series \"The Wire,\" highlighted the role of the drug war in transforming policing in cities like Baltimore, where Freddie Gray was killed in police custody, sparking mass protests. Bryan Stevenson, author of \"Just Mercy\" and founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, delved into the historic role of the police in enforcing white supremacy in America. We have also spoken to individuals with searing personal encounters, such as Erica Garner, whose father, Eric Garner, died in Staten Island after a New York Police Department officer put him in a chokehold.\n\nAnother contributing factor to excessive use of force by police is the increasing militarization of many police departments. For decades, the Defense Department has been transferring surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies, often for free and with little scrutiny. This equipment includes grenade launchers, machetes, and bayonets, many of which were deployed in Ferguson, where police used weapons of war against protesters. The Obama administration banned the program following the waves of protest sparked by police tactics in Ferguson; President Donald Trump reinstated it.\n\nIn addition to the equipment, the militarization of police is not just a matter of hardware; in fact, as a Marshall Project story showed, nearly one-fifth of police officers have served in the military, where their training and experience can distort their relationships with the communities they serve.\n\nAs the nation grapples with the ongoing issue of police brutality and accountability, it is essential to stay informed and engaged.

    " Title: NBC's Chuck Todd Addresses Media Bias Perceptions in Interview with Breitbart\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with conservative news site Breitbart, NBC's \"Meet the Press\" host Chuck Todd took a veiled shot at media executives with political backgrounds, including Fox News chief Roger Ailes, ABC's George Stephanopoulos, and potentially himself.\n\nDuring the interview, Todd expressed his view that political operatives involved in news executive roles can contribute to perceptions of media bias. He specifically referred to Fox News chief Roger Ailes, who was a media consultant for Republican presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush. However, Todd himself served as a staffer on Democratic Senator Tom Harkin's 1992 presidential bid, and ABC's George Stephanopoulos, the host of \"This Week\" and Todd's direct competitor on Sunday mornings, was a senior advisor to Democratic president Bill Clinton.\n\nIn the Breitbart interview, John Nolte stated that conservatives view the media as a whole as a branch of the Democratic Party aiming to undermine them. Todd responded, \"That's a mindset I can't do anything about. There are some practitioners in the media that view things as a campaign. Look, it doesn't help when any former political operative is involved as a news executive in any form. It's all winning and losing.\"\n\nTodd's decision to speak to Breitbart, an aggressively conservative news and opinion site, reflects an effort to broaden the show's outreach. \"This is a step in the rehabilitation of my business,\" Todd said at the top of the interview. \"Talk to the critics. Talk to the skeptics.\"\n\nTodd's predecessor, David Gregory, had not been as eager to engage with conservative critics. In an interview with The Huffington Post earlier this year, he stated, \"I just made a decision... There are haters out there. I'm not going to engage those people, because they're not looking to have a dialogue with me over Twitter.\"\n\nChuck Todd's ratings have been declining since he took over, with a drop each week. It remains to be seen whether his efforts to engage with conservative media will help improve his show's performance.",
    " Title: Debate on Tax Reform: A Look at the Proposed Revenue Sources for Democrats\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent tax proposal by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has ignited a debate among Democrats regarding the source of new revenue for the government. With the federal budget deficit projected to surpass $1 trillion in 2019 and expected to rise in the coming years, the need for additional revenue is undeniable.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, the young and outspoken Democratic representative from the Bronx, has sparked headlines with her suggestion of tax rates as high as 70 percent to finance a \"Green New Deal.\" However, it's crucial to clarify that Ocasio-Cortez did not propose taking 70 percent of anyone's income. Instead, she suggested applying the rate only to earnings beyond $10 million, meaning those affected would pay a much lower share of their income overall.\n\nHistorically, the top tax rate exceeded 90 percent during the 1950s. However, due to deductions and tax avoidance, \"taxes on the rich were not that much higher\" then, according to the conservative Tax Foundation. The top rate remained 70 percent as late as 1981, the first year of Ronald Reagan's presidency. Despite this, the most affluent 1 percent paid a far lower average rate of 30.5 percent, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential campaign, self-described socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed a 54.2 percent tax for incomes above $10 million, while Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton suggested 43.6 percent for those earning above $5 million.\n\nWith little prospect of success under President Donald Trump, the new House Democratic majority has avoided the issue in its initial legislative agenda. However, the party's growing field of 2020 presidential candidates won't have that luxury.\n\nThe only formally declared Democratic candidate, former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, wants to finance infrastructure projects by raising the recently enacted 21 percent top corporate rate to 25 percent. Sen. Kamala Harris of California has proposed curbing income inequality by rolling back all the Trump tax cuts in favor of expanded tax credits for modest earners.\n\n\"You've got to ask, 'What constitutes a fair share in this economy?'\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren told me in a recent interview. She declined to specify what she favors, but other proposals include eliminating the \"step-up\" valuation that lets some inherited assets avoid capital gains taxes, and capping tax deductions for the wealthy.\n\nThe amount of revenue Democrats need depends on the new programs they ultimately pursue. Analysts have priced Sen. Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" plan at $32 trillion, while Sen. Sherrod Brown backs a far less expensive Medicare \"buy-in\" for 55 and over.\n\nRepublican resistance casts doubts on the prospects for new taxes in any event. Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan warns a 70 percent top income tax rate would prove a \"terrible mistake\" by dampening economic activity. As the party of limited government, the GOP opposes most new programs however they're paid for.\n\nWith the demographic tidal wave of baby boomer retirements, the 2019 deficit will exceed the entire Medicare budget, and the government projects the number of Americans 65 and older will jump 50 percent to 77 million in 15 years. This underscores the need for both parties to address the issue of revenue generation, according to Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who advised President George W. Bush. He prefers taxing consumption instead of income on economic grounds, though any new taxes will strain America's polarized political system.\n\n\"We will need all the economic growth we can get, we need to control spending, and we need to raise revenue,\" Holtz-Eakin said, recounting advice he recently gave House Republicans. \"It's going to be ugly.\"",
    " Title: Texas-led Coalition Grows to 26 States in Challenge to President Obama's Executive Amnesty\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced on Monday that Nevada and Tennessee have joined the state's legal challenge of President Barack Obama's executive amnesty, bringing the total number of states involved in the lawsuit to 26.\n\nIn a statement, Attorney General Paxton expressed pride in leading a coalition that now represents a majority of the United States. He stated, \"The momentum against the President's lawlessness continues to build with Tennessee and Nevada joining the effort to protect our states from the economic and public safety implications of illegal amnesty.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, which was first filed in December, argues that Obama's amnesty would create a new wave of illegal immigration that would burden state governments. During a hearing on January 15th, Texas attorney Andrew Oldham told the presiding judge, Andrew Hanen, \"This is the second time they\u2019ve done it in two years. Maybe they\u2019ll do it again in 2016.\"\n\nThe Obama administration's lawyer, Kathleen Hartnett, disputed this claim, insisting that new arrivals will not come \"on the expectation of receiving deferred action because they will be turned away.\" However, Judge Hanen, who presided over a 2013 case, is not likely to accept this argument. In the 2013 case, Hanen predicted that Obama's lax border enforcement policies would lead to a wave of illegal immigration.\n\nThe states are asking Judge Hanen to issue an injunction that would stop Obama from granting work permits before the program begins in May. If the amnesty does stand, it is estimated to cost taxpayers billions in tax credits every year.\n\nThe full list of 26 states suing Obama over his executive amnesty includes Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Texas.",
    " Title: Cancellation of Freedom Rally in San Francisco: Joey Gibson Accuses City Leaders of Hypocrisy Over Violence Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Joey Gibson, leader of the Patriot Prayer group, cancelled his planned peaceful rally in San Francisco's Crissy Field on Saturday, citing concerns over potential violence from antifa and By Any Means Necessary activists. The rally, which was set to feature a diverse array of speakers, was intended to be a day of freedom, spirituality, unity, peace, and patriotism.\n\nDuring a press conference on Facebook Live, Mr. Gibson expressed his belief that the event would have resulted in a \"huge riot,\" stating, \"That's a fact. A bunch of supporters, a bunch of antifa communists, normal liberals would have all been mixed together. It would have been a huge riot, and it would have been a disaster.\"\n\nThe cancellation of the Freedom Rally follows the cancellation of a separate right-of-center event in Berkeley, titled \"No to Marxism in America,\" which was also called off due to fears of violence. In response, thousands of residents attended a \"unite against hate\" march at Civic Center Plaza, carrying anti-Trump signs and a large rainbow banner that read, \"Rise and Resist!\"\n\nSan Francisco Mayor Ed Lee applauded the counterprotesters during a Saturday press conference, stating, \"The people of San Francisco have demonstrated our determination to protect the freedom of peaceful expression as well as public safety.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi had called on the National Park Service to reconsider Patriot Prayer's permit, describing the event as a \"white supremacist rally.\" In response, Ms. Pelosi stated, \"Reason has prevailed because the people of San Francisco have demonstrated our determination to protect the freedom of peaceful expression as well as public safety.\"\n\nHowever, Mr. Gibson accused Ms. Pelosi and Mayor Lee of stoking unrest by labeling the event as a white supremacy rally, despite most of the scheduled speakers not being white and Mr. Gibson himself being half-Asian. He also accused Democrats of hypocrisy on protester violence, stating, \"You have a mayor who says that we\u2019re hateful, we\u2019re violent, he doesn\u2019t bring up any specific examples, but he doesn\u2019t mention one word about antifa. Not one word.\"\n\nThroughout the day, Mr. Gibson claimed he was menaced by antifa and By Any Means Necessary activists who followed the Patriot Prayer organizers and used Twitter to announce their whereabouts. He described these activists as individuals who \"dress like ninjas, who run around, they want to burn stuff down, they want to commit violence, they want to use bike locks, they want to use clubs with nails through them.\"\n\nMr. Gibson, who started Patriot Prayer earlier this year to support President Trump, has since focused on fighting extremism on the left and the right to promote peace and unity. His rallies in Portland and Seattle have attracted members of white-nationalist groups like Identity Evropa, which Mr. Gibson said he has tried to discourage.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, which does not list Patriot Prayer as a hate group, has criticized the rallies for drawing the \"alt-right\" while crediting Mr. Gibson for speaking out against white supremacists and neo-Nazis. Mr. Gibson concluded, \"At the end of the day, I just want a small government, and then there will be no tyrants. And we will be free people in a free society who can respect one another.\"",
    " Title: Harvard's Admissions Practices Under Scrutiny for Alleged Discrimination Against Asian Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, one of the most prestigious educational institutions in the United States, Harvard University, is facing allegations of racial discrimination against Asian American students. The target group this time is not blacks or Jews, as it was in past years, but Asian Americans.\n\nAfter years of legal battles, millions of dollars in legal fees, millions of records examined, and hundreds of hours of depositions and testimony, Harvard's once opaque admissions policies have been laid bare. The revelations are far from flattering.\n\nHarvard's admissions process evaluates student applicants in three main areas: academic performance, extra-curricular achievements, and \"personal qualities.\" While these criteria might seem fair on the surface, they are not applied equally.\n\nAsian American applicants consistently outperform white students, Latinos, and African Americans in the first two criteria - academics and extra-curricular activities, which can be objectively assessed. However, Harvard justifies its lower acceptance rates for Asian American students with the help of the third criterion - \"personal qualities,\" which include subjective factors like \"likability,\" \"maturity,\" \"integrity,\" and \"effervescence.\"\n\nAccording to Harvard's own internal reports, Asian American applicants are systematically marked lower on this personality scale by Harvard admissions officers who rarely meet or interview applicants. However, the personality ratings given to Asian students by Harvard's own alumni interviewers, who actually meet the applicants in person, are significantly higher.\n\nIn other words, Harvard artificially and fraudulently downgrades Asians on \"personal qualities\" to achieve the desired number of admissions. Economist Peter Arcidiacono of Duke University concluded that with the same application profile in terms of test scores, extracurricular activities, and personality factors, an Asian American male applicant would only have a 25% chance of admission - versus 32% if white, 77% if Hispanic, and 95% if black.\n\nIn 2013, Asian Americans made up 19% of the incoming freshmen class. According to Harvard's own Office of Institutional Research, if the personality factors had not been rigged, that percentage would have been 43%.\n\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 guarantees that \"No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, or be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.\"\n\nEach year, Harvard takes hundreds of millions of dollars from the federal government. In the landmark case Grutter v. Bollinger, the Supreme Court upheld the University of Michigan Law School's affirmative action policies, deciding that race could be used as a \"plus factor\" to achieve diversity, but never as a quota. Yet, by placing strict limits on the percentage of Asian American applicants it will admit, racial quotas are exactly what Harvard is using.\n\nOne strongly suspects this quota system is not limited to Harvard. In the last ten years, Asian American students have been limited to an 18-22% presence across the Ivy League. Or maybe that's just a coincidence.\n\nWriting for the majority in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that the Court \"expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.\" With less than a decade to go, the Ivy League shows no indication that it's giving up on those racial preferences. Instead, these colleges have doubled down. Objective standards regarding admissions continue to be increasingly disfavored as the illegal goal of racial balancing is advanced.\n\nThis racial balancing is justified by the left's desire to achieve \"racial diversity\" - its insistence on seeing every person only through the prism of race, as if the most important thing any of us has to offer is the color of our skin.\n\nNot long ago, that was called \"racism.\" It's still called racism. It needs to end, once and for all - for the sake of deserving Asian American students, for the sake of Harvard's own integrity, and for the sake of the American principle that the rules must be the same for everyone.\n\nChief Justice of the Supreme Court John Roberts said it best: \"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\" It's time we did just that.

    " Title: A Second Look at Mitt Romney's 2016 Presidential Prospects: A Retrospective Analysis of the 2012 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 presidential election, many have written off Mitt Romney as a potential candidate for 2016. However, one analyst offers a different perspective, arguing that Romney could potentially mount a successful campaign if he learns from past mistakes and adapts to the current political climate.\n\nThe analyst points to three key moments during the 2012 election that, in their view, could have significantly altered the outcome. The first is the response to Hurricane Sandy, where the analyst suggests that Romney should have visited affected areas on the East Coast, surveying the damage, and delivering a major policy speech on rebuilding the nation's infrastructure. This, they argue, would have shown Romney's leadership and empathy, as well as created jobs and stimulated the economy.\n\nThe second moment is the second presidential debate, where Romney was criticized for his response to the Benghazi attack. The analyst contends that Romney missed an opportunity to go on the offensive and challenge the administration's handling of the situation, instead of appearing defensive.\n\nThe third moment is the GOP's perceived tone-deafness on cultural issues, such as global warming, the environment, and alternative energy. The analyst argues that Romney, if advised correctly, could position himself as a modern, forward-thinking candidate who is in touch with the concerns of younger voters and the media.\n\nIn conclusion, the analyst suggests that Romney, with the right advice and a willingness to embrace the cultural issues of the day, could mount a successful campaign in 2016. They argue that Romney has the potential to be a Reagan-like figure, galvanizing the nation and winning over voters who may have been turned off by the GOP in the past. However, it is important to note that this is just one perspective, and the outcome of a potential 2016 campaign would depend on a multitude of factors, including the candidate's personal appeal, the state of the economy, and the political climate of the time.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker Proposes Alternative to ObamaCare, Seeks Federal Approval\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to address the perceived issues with the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare), Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has proposed a plan that would allow the state's poor and uninsured to purchase health coverage directly from insurers, bypassing the online exchange established by the Affordable Care Act. This proposal, which has garnered bipartisan support in the Wisconsin state house, is now awaiting approval from the Obama administration.\n\nWalker's plan, if implemented, would continue to channel federal subsidies to Wisconsin's uninsured population, but would provide them with the flexibility to choose their insurance providers. The governor argues that this approach is about accessibility and affordability, and not about the government playing a heavier role in health care decisions.\n\nHowever, the proposal faces opposition from the Obama administration, with President Obama stating that Republicans often criticize the Affordable Care Act but fail to offer viable alternatives. In a White House speech on Dec. 3, the President claimed that Republicans have yet to present a credible alternative to the current health care system.\n\nDespite this criticism, several Republican politicians have proposed alternatives to the Affordable Care Act. These proposals, according to Ed Haislmaier of The Heritage Group, a conservative think tank, are consumer-driven, with individuals making their own health care choices rather than relying on a government-driven plan that caters to their needs.\n\nSupporters of the Affordable Care Act argue that Republican counter-proposals lack the reach of the current system, with economist Jonathan Gruber stating that he has yet to hear a Republican alternative that covers as many uninsured individuals or offers evidence-based solutions to the health care cost crisis.\n\nThe debate continues as both sides strive to find a solution that addresses the needs of the uninsured and the concerns of the American people.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee to Vote on Subpoenas for Mueller Report and Witnesses' Testimony\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is set to vote on subpoenas this week, seeking the full, unredacted Russia report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as the Justice Department appears to be missing the April 2 deadline for the report's release. The Judiciary panel plans to vote on subpoenas on Wednesday, a day after the deadline.\n\nChairmen of several House committees requested the full, unredacted report last week, following Attorney General William Barr's release of a four-page summary outlining the report's principal conclusions. Barr stated in a letter to the House and Senate Judiciary committees on Friday that a redacted version of the full 300-page report would be released by mid-April, \"if not sooner.\"\n\nThe planned committee vote, announced Monday morning, would not automatically issue subpoenas but authorize House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) to send them if he decides to do so.\n\n\"As I have made clear, Congress requires the full and complete special counsel report, without redactions, as well as access to the underlying evidence,\" Nadler said in a statement. \"Attorney General Barr has thus far indicated he will not meet the April 2 deadline set by myself and five other committee chairs, and refused to work with us to provide the full report, without redactions, to Congress.\"\n\nThe vote comes as Democrats are escalating their battle with the Justice Department over the amount of the report they will be able to see\u2014a fight that could potentially end up in court. Democrats have stated they will not accept redactions and will likely be unhappy with the amount of information provided by Barr when the department releases the report in the coming weeks.\n\nIn addition to the Mueller report, the panel will also vote Wednesday to authorize subpoenas related to a number of President Donald Trump's former top advisers, including strategist Steve Bannon, Communications Director Hope Hicks, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, White House Counsel Donald McGahn, and counsel Ann Donaldson. Donaldson served as McGahn's chief of staff before both left the administration.\n\nThe five were key witnesses in Mueller's probe of possible obstruction of justice, and were sent document requests by the Judiciary panel last month. Nadler expressed concern about reports that documents relevant to Mueller's investigation \"were sent outside the White House,\" potentially waiving executive privilege rights that would block document production.\n\n\"To this end, I have asked the committee to authorize me to issue subpoenas, if necessary, to compel the production of documents and testimony,\" Nadler said.\n\nNadler sent requests to 81 people connected to Trump's political and personal dealings as he launched a wide-ranging investigation into possible obstruction of justice, public corruption, and abuses of power.\n\nBarr stated in the letter on Friday that he is scrubbing the report to avoid disclosing any grand jury information or classified material, in addition to portions of the report that pertain to ongoing investigations or that \"would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.\"\n\nDemocrats say they want all of that information, even if some of it cannot be disclosed to the public. They are citing precedents from previous investigations involving presidents and information disclosed about the Russia investigation to Republicans last year when they held the House majority.\n\nIf the committee does issue subpoenas, the path forward is uncertain. If the administration decides to fight, lawmakers could ask federal courts to step in and enforce a subpoena\u2014a fight that could, in theory, reach the Supreme Court. Generally, such disputes are instead resolved through negotiations.\n\nThe Democrats could also formally ask Mueller to send the Judiciary committee evidence that could be used in possible impeachment proceedings against Trump. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, backed by the majority of her caucus, has said she is not currently supportive of impeachment.\n\nBarr wrote in his summary that the special counsel did not find that Trump's campaign \"conspired or coordinated\" with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election. He said Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed the federal investigation, instead setting out \"evidence on both sides\" of the question.\n\nBarr himself went further than Mueller in his summary letter, declaring that Mueller's evidence was insufficient to prove in court that Trump had committed obstruction of justice to hamper the probe.\n\nDemocrats say they want to know much more about both conclusions and they want to see the evidence unfiltered by Barr.\n\n\"Judiciary Democrats have escalated from setting arbitrary deadlines to demanding unredacted material that Congress does not, in truth, require and that the law does not allow to be shared outside the Justice Department,\" said Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary committee.",
    " Title: Major Republican Presidential Candidates Gather for Debate in New Hampshire\n\nArticle:\n\nThe next Republican presidential debate is set to take place tonight at St. Anselm's College Institute of Politics in Manchester, New Hampshire, and will be broadcast on ABC. The debate coverage is scheduled to begin at 8 pm Eastern, although it remains uncertain if the debate will commence immediately or slightly later. Viewers can watch a live stream of the event online at ABCNews.go.com.\n\nAfter skipping the last GOP debate and losing the Iowa caucuses, Donald Trump has confirmed his attendance at this debate. Joining him will be Iowa caucus winner Ted Cruz and Iowa \"media winner\" Marco Rubio, whose strong performance in the caucuses has boosted his chances of securing the nomination in the eyes of political elites. Ben Carson, who finished fourth in Iowa and whose campaign has been in decline for months, will also be present, although his campaign appears to be nearing its end.\n\nIn addition to these candidates, there are three others\u2014Jeb Bush, John Kasich, and Chris Christie\u2014who are hoping for a strong showing in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary to keep their campaigns alive. Bush, Kasich, and Christie, who are all establishment-friendly candidates, are considered rivals to Rubio, who performed significantly better in Iowa. Expect these candidates to make a final effort to undermine Rubio during tonight's debate.\n\nOn the other hand, the debate offers Rubio a significant opportunity to outshine his establishment rivals before the New Hampshire primary. If Rubio outperforms Bush, Kasich, and Christie in the Granite State, they are likely to exit the race soon, paving the way for Rubio to emerge as the mainstream Republican alternative to Trump and Cruz. If Rubio falters in New Hampshire, however, the race may remain uncertain for a while longer.\n\nSince the GOP field has narrowed, there will be no undercard debate for candidates who are not polling as well this time around. Unfortunately, Carly Fiorina missed ABC's polling cutoff to qualify for this debate, making her and former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore the two remaining candidates who will be excluded.",
    " Title: The Influence of Individual Voting in the American Electoral College: A Neutral Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the heated 2016 presidential race, an intriguing conversation unfolded between a libertarian-leaning American and a journalist. Despite the American's support for Hillary Clinton, the journalist expressed his intention to vote for the Libertarian Party's candidates, Gary Johnson and William Weld. The American responded, \"Opportunity cost is Trump gets elected.\"\n\nThis conversation highlights the unique nature of the American Electoral College system, where an individual's vote, even in states with a significant influence, may not determine the outcome of the presidential race. In South Carolina, where the journalist resides, a vote for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump would not tip the scale in their favor, as the outcome would have already been decided in other states.\n\nThe Electoral College system makes it highly improbable for a single vote to sway a state's electoral outcome. In the closest state presidential election of the last half-century\u2014New Mexico in 2000\u2014the final margin for Al Gore was 366 votes, and even that did not determine the national winner.\n\nAssuming that one lives in a red or blue state, their vote becomes insignificant in determining the election's outcome. According to the prediction site FiveThirtyEight, states like Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin have a combined estimated 44.8% chance to decide the election. When other swing states such as North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, Minnesota, Georgia, Nevada, and Iowa are accounted for, the states with as much as a 2% chance to determine the outcome are eliminated, leaving 67% of the U.S. population in a \"safe harbor.\"\n\nIn this context, Americans cast their presidential endorsements with less research and consideration than they would for choosing a smartphone data plan or their next Pokemon Go venue. This phenomenon is known as \"rational ignorance.\"\n\nHowever, the Electoral College system allows Americans to exercise their judgment worry-free, as their vote will not change the nation's fate. Voting for third-party candidates, in this sense, can be seen as a guilt-free option.\n\nMoreover, voting for minor parties can help put the system on notice that the Big Two political party choices are being rejected. The classic example is the Socialist Party, which garnered a mere 2% of the total votes in the 1932 election but influenced the New Deal's policies in the following decade.\n\nIn the 2016 campaign, the journalist, living in a non-swing state, is insulated from liability by the Electoral College. With two major party candidates deemed undesirable, voting for the Libertarians, who have an exceedingly slim chance of victory, will be the least complicated choice. This choice will allow the journalist to indulge their conscience without the burden of determining the nation's fate.",
    " Title: Trump and Pence Unveiled as Republican Ticket in New York City\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a whirlwind 48 hours that saw a leaked vice presidential pick and late-night calls from Donald Trump in search of an escape hatch, the presumptive Republican nominee and Indiana Governor Mike Pence shared the limelight on Saturday in a joint appearance at the Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan.\n\nThe event, which was initially scheduled for a rollout of Trump's vice presidential pick but was ultimately unceremoniously announced on Twitter, took place at the same location where Ronald Reagan announced his 1980 presidential bid, with all the pomp and circumstance of a long-awaited union.\n\nTrump, in a 30-minute address, focused on bashing his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and weighed in on recent global conflicts, including the attempted military coup in Turkey. He praised the Turks, expressing hope that the situation would improve.\n\n\"Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice,\" Trump said, despite reported struggles to choose between an establishment-pleasing pick and two men with whom he had better rapport. The rollout, which was accompanied by a website redesign to include Pence's face and a new logo, sounded like any other Trump address.\n\nPence, a disciplined, conservative Republican with close-cropped white hair and a strong mandible, represented a stark contrast to Trump. He read from prepared remarks with designated moments for applause, addressing policy differences and on-the-fence Republicans who may have struggled to accept a former reality television star as their party's standard-bearer.\n\nPence told the crowd that Trump had called him with the decision on Wednesday night, countering the narrative Trump presented to the media on Thursday, during which time he claimed he hadn't made his \"final, final decision.\"\n\n\"These are good people,\" Pence said of Trump and his family. \"And Trump will make a great president of the United States of America.\"\n\nThe two men's policy differences have played out on social media, with Pence tweeting his support of the Trans Pacific Partnership in 2014, something that Trump is adamantly against. In December 2015, Pence tweeted that calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. were offensive and unconstitutional, in response to an initial proposal from Trump. However, during his first interview as Trump's vice presidential pick, Pence expressed support for Trump's call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represent a threat to the United States.\n\nBefore the two men appear together once again at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland next week, the governor is returning to Zionsville, Indiana on Saturday for what is billed as a \"Welcome Home Rally\" according to the Trump campaign. Trump will not be in attendance.\n\nRoger Stone, a one-time adviser for Trump, praised the event, texting The \u2588\u2588\u2588 after the event, \"It was strong. A winning ticket!\" Michael Caputo, an adviser who resigned from Trump's campaign last month, echoed Stone's remarks, stating, \"Pence's speech was solid, exceptionally well written and delivered expertly. I think he made perfectly clear what he can do for this ticket. His speech was a rousing call to arms for Republicans and a full volume defense of Donald Trump. Mission accomplished.\"",
    " Title: House Republicans Vote to Cancel Obama's Deportation Amnesties: A Constitutional and Political Battle\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly charged and symbolic move, the House of Representatives voted Thursday to repeal President Obama's executive actions on deportation, which granted temporary legal status and work permits to over 4 million undocumented immigrants. The vote, which was met with strenuous opposition from Democrats, was framed by House Speaker John A. Boehner as an attempt to uphold the rule of law and the Constitution.\n\nDuring the debate, Boehner read 22 quotes from President Obama denying he had the power to act unilaterally on immigration matters. The president had exercised this power last year when he announced the amnesty for more than 4 million illegal immigrants and a smaller amnesty for Dreamers, or young adults brought to the U.S. as children.\n\n\"We do not take this action lightly, but there is simply no alternative,\" Boehner said from the House floor. \"This is not a dispute between parties, or even branches of government. The president's overreach is an affront to the rule of law and the Constitution itself.\"\n\nDemocrats, in turn, accused Republicans of mean-spiritedness, with Representative Linda T. Sanchez of California, chairwoman of the House Hispanic Caucus, saying, \"As a country, we're better than this. Shame on you.\"\n\nThe vote to repeal the November amnesty was 237-190, with seven Republicans joining Democrats in opposition. The vote to repeal the amnesty for Dreamers was less popular, passing on a 218-209 vote with 26 Republicans joining all Democrats in opposition.\n\nWhite House officials and immigrant rights advocates fear the votes could send illegal immigrants back into the shadows. However, Cecilia Munoz, Mr. Obama's domestic policy director, said the White House will make it clear to illegal immigrants that the president will not be deterred.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we are confident we are going to be implementing these executive actions,\" she said.\n\nThe courts could have the final say, as several challenges have been filed, including one in Texas, where 25 states have sued, arguing that they will have to fund billions of dollars worth of services to illegal immigrants if the president's plans are allowed to stand. A judge will hold a hearing Thursday on the states' request for an injunction.\n\nWednesday's fight was part of the debate on a bill to fund the Homeland Security Department and its immigration enforcement mission through the end of the fiscal year. That bill cleared the House on a 236-191 vote.\n\nPresident Obama has vowed to veto the bill because it includes provisions repealing his amnesties, and Senate Democratic leaders said they will lead a filibuster to prevent the bill from reaching the president's desk. This would leave homeland security funding in limbo, with a Feb. 27 deadline looming.\n\nRank-and-file House Republicans acknowledged Wednesday that they aren't sure about the next step. \"I don't know that there is a Plan B,\" said Rep. Peter T. King, a New York Republican who voted for the amendment to repeal the November amnesty but against the plan to scrap the Dreamer amnesty. \"It's a work in progress.\"\n\nMr. King said there are six weeks to go before the deadline, which gives all sides a chance to work out an agreement. House and Senate Republicans will gather Thursday and Friday in Pennsylvania for a policy retreat, where immigration is bound to take up much of the discussion.\n\nRep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican who opposed both amnesty amendments, said the effort was a waste because Republicans don't have the votes to override a presidential veto.\n\n\"I wish that wasn't the case. I wish President Obama was not in the White House,\" he said.\n\nAll sides said Wednesday's votes were momentous political statements and served as a signal of how much the immigration debate has changed over the past year. House Republicans entered their annual policy retreat last year with Mr. Boehner announcing principles for tackling immigration, including legalizing the Dreamers and figuring out a solution for the rest of the illegal immigrant population. This year, Mr. Boehner led the charge to repeal the amnesty for Dreamers and to step up enforcement of immigration laws.\n\nRepublicans said the moves should be seen as statements on the Constitution and separation of powers, not as attacks on immigrants. Democrats, however, said Hispanic voters won't see it that way.\n\nRep. Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who has been a staunch advocate for legalizing illegal immigrants, chided Republicans for backtracking on Mr. Boehner's stance to legalize Dreamers.\n\n\"One year later, you want to take away from 600,000 Dreamers their right to live in this country. What happened? What happened?\" Mr. Gutierrez said.\n\nHe vowed to make sure Hispanic voters punish Republicans for the votes: \"The fruits of your action today will ultimately anger and outrage and [ mobilize ] the immigrant community throughout this nation.\"\n\nDemocrats pointed to missives from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the AFL-CIO, and Hispanic rights groups who all blasted the amendments. The bishops said deporting illegal immigrants would fracture families, and labor unions said the moves were \"anti-immigrant.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Job Market Shows Modest Growth in August, Unemployment Rate Decreases\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. job market showed a slowdown in August, with the economy adding 96,000 jobs, down from 141,000 jobs in July, according to the Department of Labor's report released on Friday. The unemployment rate also decreased to 8.1%, from 8.3% in July.\n\nEconomists polled by CNNMoney had expected 120,000 jobs to be added in August, and the unemployment rate to remain unchanged. The unemployment rate fell largely because 368,000 people stopped looking for work, many of them young people. Just 63.5% of the working-age population was either employed or actively looking for work, a 30-year low.\n\n\"These numbers are not very strong,\" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank. \"The job market is improving, but only gradually.\" At least 150,000 jobs need to be created each month to simply keep pace with the growing population.\n\nIn addition to the large number of people leaving the workforce, LaVorgna said two other disappointing signs were that the number of hours people worked remained flat and wages were stagnant. The Labor Department also revised down the job numbers for the two previous months, resulting in 41,000 fewer jobs created than originally reported.\n\n\"Clearly, it's disappointing, but it's not horrible,\" said Scott Brown, chief economist at the investment management firm Raymond James. \"We're not losing jobs.\"\n\nEmployment in restaurants and bars increased by 28,000, a sign that people may have more disposable income. Professional and technical service jobs rose by 27,000, and the health care industry added 17,000 jobs. In August, manufacturing was particularly hard hit, shedding 15,000 jobs. The government continued to shed jobs, losing another 7,000 positions.\n\nThe weak numbers could also increase the chances that the Federal Reserve will take more action to boost the struggling economy. The overall job market still has a long way to go to recover from the financial crisis. Three years after the recession ended, roughly 12.5 million Americans remain unemployed, and 40% of them have been so for six months or more.",
    " Title: NLRB's Position on Micro-Unions Threatens U.S. Manufacturing Jobs, Critics Argue\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has raised concerns among critics, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has stated that employers' concerns about the proliferation of small bargaining units being detrimental to their operations are \"irrelevant\" under U.S. labor law. This position was put forward by Acting General Counsel Lafe Solomon in a brief to the Fourth Circuit, defending the Obama-era Board's controversial decision, Specialty Healthcare, which changed 76 years of Board law.\n\nThe decision, made in 2011, authorized unions in all industries to represent bargaining units of as few as two or more employees doing the same job in the same location. The Board's decision threatens an undue proliferation of bargaining units, a concern that Congress, state labor boards, and other nations have warned about for years.\n\nSince its inception in 1936, the NLRB has recognized that an undue proliferation of bargaining units causes unnecessary work stoppages and is inconsistent with the long-term goals of collective bargaining. The Board has favored larger units and sought to avoid a multiplicity of smaller units.\n\nDuring Senate debate in 1974 on extending the Board's jurisdiction to cover non-profit health care institutions, Senator Harrison A. Williams (D-NJ) recognized this fact. He applauded the NLRB and said that, as a rule, it has \"generally tended to avoid the unnecessary proliferation of bargaining units.\"\n\nIn 1989, the NLRB proposed adopting a rule that would make a single facility unit presumptively appropriate. In its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the NLRB stated that the employees' desire for a single facility unit (as opposed to the employer's desire for a multi-facility unit) \"might be outweighed by concerns over disproportionate, unjustified costs and undue proliferation of units.\"\n\nCongress has consistently taken a position against undue proliferation. During the debates over expanding the Board's jurisdiction to include non-profit health care institutions, Congress expressly cautioned the NLRB against an undue proliferation of bargaining units that would cause unnecessary work stoppages and threaten patient care.\n\nThe Board's brief, however, draws from this caution the preposterous conclusion that a multiplicity of bargaining units in all other industries is an \"irrelevant\" consideration under U.S. labor law.\n\nCritics argue that the Board's position threatens American manufacturing jobs, as the proliferation of small bargaining units can lead to unnecessary work stoppages, increased costs, and labor instability. The Board's actions have been criticized for contributing to a chill on job creation and undermining the long-term goals of collective bargaining.\n\nThe political leadership at the NLRB reflects the priorities of the President who appointed it. The same Acting General Counsel whose office authored this brief filed suit to stop The Boeing Company from building new Dreamliner aircraft in the $1 billion plant Boeing built for that purpose in South Carolina. The same NLRB that authorized micro-unions has issued decision after decision that have radically changed Board law to benefit unions without regard for their impact on workers and businesses.",
    " Title: President Obama Remains Optimistic on Obamacare Popularity Despite Public Disapproval\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, President Barack Obama expressed his belief that the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, will gain public approval as it is implemented. Despite polls indicating that the majority of Americans dislike the health care law, Obama maintains that once individuals are required to purchase health insurance or face a penalty, they will come to appreciate the law.\n\nHowever, the President acknowledged the challenges in changing public opinion, stating, \"Until we're getting outspent four to one and people are just uncertain about what all this means for them, we're going to continue to have some polls like that.\" He further explained that more speeches explaining the law would not be enough to change public sentiment, and instead, the success of the law would be the deciding factor in its popularity.\n\nDespite the President's optimism, it appears that a new PR campaign may not be enough to sway public opinion. Obama stated, \"Over the course of six months to a year, as people sign up, and it works, and lo and behold, the people who already have health insurance are not being impacted at all other than the fact that their insurance is more secure and they are getting free preventive care, and all the nightmare scenarios and the train wrecks and the'sky is falling' predictions that come from the other side do not happen, then health care will become more popular.\"\n\nHowever, critics argue that Americans are well-informed about the potential implications of Obamacare and that the penalty may not be worth it for many. The President's optimism seems to be based on the assumption that the law will function as intended and that the negative predictions about its implementation will not come to pass.",
    " Title: ObamaCare Enrollment Data Suggests High Number of Previously Insured Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nA significant number of the more than 2 million Americans who signed up for health insurance under ObamaCare by the end of December were already enrolled in employer-sponsored plans or had previously bought their own coverage, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal on Friday.\n\nEarly data from insurers, brokers, and consultants indicate that the marketplaces are popular with consumers who were previously covered elsewhere, raising questions about the Affordable Care Act's intent to expand coverage to millions of uninsured Americans.\n\nA survey by management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. found that only 11 percent of consumers who purchased new coverage under ObamaCare were previously uninsured. The survey was based on a sampling of 4,563 consumers between November and January.\n\nHealthMarkets Inc., an insurance agency that signed up about 7,500 people in exchange plans, reported that 65 of its enrollees had prior coverage. Fifteen percent of enrollees had their individual plans canceled, and 40 percent switched over from previous individual plans.\n\nDavid M. Cordani, chief executive of insurer Cigna, told The Wall Street Journal that one of the objectives of the law was to address the uninsured problem in the country. However, some insurers said the early data on newly insured consumers is falling short of expectations.\n\nInsurers in Michigan expected 400,000 of the state's 1.2 million uninsured people to join private plans this year, according to an analysis provided by Michigan-based Priority Health. As of the end of December, only 76,000 people had signed up, many of whom were previously covered, according to the report.\n\nGeoff Bartsh, vice president for policy at Minneapolis-based Medica Health Plans, told The Journal, \"I don't know we're growing the number of people with insurance here, so much as we're just adding complexity.\"\n\nFederal health officials told The Journal they do not yet know the number of people who have signed up for coverage through the exchanges who had insurance when they enrolled. Consumers have until the end of March 31 to purchase plans under ObamaCare.\n\nAaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said, \"We are in the middle of a sustained six-month open-enrollment period, and we have seen a strong interest in the product overall across the range of demographics so far.\"\n\nAccording to the report, adults ages 55-64 were the most heavily represented in the signups, accounting for 33 percent of the total. Nationwide, the premiums paid by people in that demographic do not fully cover their medical expenses. Some are in the waiting room for Medicare, which starts at age 65.\n\nYoung adults from 18 to 34 are only 24 percent of total enrollment, the Obama administration said Monday in its first signup figures broken down for age, gender, and other details. Enrolling young and healthy people is important because they generally pay more into the system than they take out, subsidizing older adults.",
    " Title: Democratic Lawmakers Call for Gun Control Measures in Response to School Shootings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic school shootings in Connecticut, Democratic lawmakers and Independent Senator Joe Lieberman have called for a renewed discussion on gun control, including a ban on military-style assault weapons and a comprehensive review of the nation's approach to mental health care.\n\nFollowing the shooting that left 20 children aged 6 or 7 dead, several Democratic lawmakers and Senator Lieberman have emphasized the need for a deeper examination of the recent spate of mass shootings and potential preventive measures. The last significant gun control legislation, a 10-year ban on assault weapons, was enacted in the early 1990s, but since its expiration in 2004, stricter gun laws have not gained widespread support, with politicians expressing concerns about facing opposition from powerful gun-rights lobby groups.\n\nGun-rights advocates have remained largely silent on the issue since the shooting, with the exception of Senator Joe Manchin, a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association, who has called for a discussion on gun policy and a move towards gun regulation. Manchin, a conservative West Virginia Democrat, has expressed support for New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposal to ban the sale of assault weapons.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, during a Sunday night service in Newtown, Connecticut, did not specifically address gun control but vowed to engage citizens, including law enforcement, mental health professionals, parents, and educators in an effort to prevent future tragedies. He questioned whether the nation was prepared to accept such violence as the price of freedom and urged citizens to take action.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., suggested that the nation could be at a \"tipping point\" for gun control, with the potential for significant action on the issue. Schumer, along with other Democrats and Senator Lieberman, has proposed banning the sale of new assault weapons and making it more difficult for mentally ill individuals to obtain weapons. Lieberman has also suggested creating a new commission to examine gun laws, the mental health system, and the role of violence in media.\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has announced plans to introduce legislation next year to ban new assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. Feinstein expressed confidence in reinstating the ban despite strong opposition from the National Rifle Association and similar groups.\n\nMayor Bloomberg has suggested that President Obama could use executive powers to enforce existing gun laws and support legislation like Feinstein's. Bloomberg stated that it was time for the president to lead and outline the necessary steps to address gun violence.\n\nGun-rights activists have been largely absent from the Sunday talk shows, with only Representative Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, appearing to defend the sale of assault weapons and argue that violence is lower in cities with lax gun laws. However, gun-control advocates dispute this claim, citing studies that show states with the strongest gun laws have lower gun death rates.\n\nIn response to the shooting, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence has called for a renewed commitment to gun control and a reevaluation of the role of guns in society. The organization has emphasized the need for comprehensive solutions that address both gun control and mental health care.",
    " Title: Tragedy Strikes Chabad of Poway Synagogue: Community Mourns, Heroism Recounted, and Anti-Semitism Under Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The tranquility of Southern California was shattered this weekend with a deadly shooting at a synagogue near San Diego. On Sunday night, hundreds gathered for a vigil where Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, a survivor of the attack, recounted the harrowing events that unfolded.\n\n\"Unfathomable,\" said Rabbi Goldstein, \"I faced death face to face.\"\n\nThe attack at Chabad of Poway left one fatality, 60-year-old Laurie Kaye, and three injured, including Rabbi Goldstein himself. The youngest victim was eight-year-old Noya Duhan, who had recently moved from southern Israel where her village was subject to rocket attacks from Gaza.\n\nRabbi Goldstein believes the shooting would have been much worse had it not been for a \"miracle\" \u2013 the shooter's gun jammed. The rabbi also credits members of his congregation for risking their lives to stop the shooter, identified as 19-year-old John T. Earnest.\n\nOscar Stewart, an off-duty border patrol agent, described his actions in the aftermath of the shooting. \"He dropped his weapon and he ran out, and I chased him out of the sanctuary,\" Stewart said.\n\nPolice eventually arrested Earnest about a mile from the synagogue. In an open letter posted online under Earnest's same name, he expressed his desire to kill Jews and praised the gunmen accused in both the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and recent mosque attacks in New Zealand. Police say Earnest was also being investigated in connection to an arson attack at a California mosque.\n\nPresident Trump called Rabbi Goldstein to offer his condolences and also condemned the shooting at a weekend rally in Wisconsin. \"We forcefully condemn the evil of anti-Semitism and hate which must be defeated,\" said Trump.\n\nFollowing the shooting, the World Jewish Congress called out the New York Times for publishing a cartoon in its international edition showing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leading a blind President Trump. The World Jewish Congress tweeted, \"The @nytimes has crossed a red line today by publishing a cartoon infused with anti-Semitic tropes.\"\n\nFollowing fierce backlash, the New York Times retracted the cartoon and issued an apology.\n\nWith anti-Semitism on the rise in America and worldwide, Michael Rydelnik, an expert on anti-Semitism at the Moody Bible Institute, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News, \"It's like a contagious disease that always under the surface and sometimes it spurs up into epidemic proportions and then sometimes it recedes.\"\n\nEarnest has been charged with murder and will also likely face federal hate crime charges.",
    " Title: Pelosi-Trump Tensions Escalate as Shutdown and Security Concerns Collide\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of escalating events, the ongoing standoff between Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and President Donald Trump has taken a new turn, with the border security debate and security concerns for high-ranking officials at the center.\n\nDemocrats are grappling with the need to assert their stance on border security, acknowledging that they have, to some extent, allowed President Trump to dictate the narrative. Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, stated, \"People want to ensure that it's clear that the Democrats do stand for border security, and not allow the president to determine how we talk about it. We can't cave to his vision for a wall, because of everything that it represents, but we also want to show that we're for something.\"\n\nThe issue arose during a Democratic caucus meeting this week, as Pelosi briefed rank-and-file lawmakers about her latest criticism of Trump over the government shutdown. Her letter requesting a delay or cancellation of the State of the Union address this month due to the security measures required by federal workers working without pay, was met with Trump's response to prevent Pelosi from using a military plane for her trip.\n\nTrump's letter detailing this step also disclosed Pelosi's itinerary, which was kept confidential due to security reasons, particularly when it involves travel to war zones and high-ranking leaders like the speaker, who is second in line to the presidency.\n\nPelosi addressed reporters at the Capitol, stating, \"You never give advance notice of going into a battle area\u2014you just never do.\" She added, \"The people around him, though, should have known that. That's very dangerous.\"\n\nAfter rushing to salvage the trip by making alternative travel arrangements to fly commercial, Pelosi eventually canceled the trip due to a heightened State Department threat assessment and concerns about leaks compromising the safety of those involved.\n\nA White House official on Friday denied the charge, stating that there was no way for Pelosi to keep her trip a secret and that any suggestion of a leak \"is a flat-out lie.\"\n\nThe latest developments underscore the growing tensions between the two leaders, as they navigate the complexities of the government shutdown and security concerns for high-ranking officials.",
    " Title: Obama and Pena Nieto to Discuss Immigration and Security Issues at White House Meeting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to address the ongoing issue of illegal immigration and border security, President Barack Obama will meet with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the White House on Tuesday. The discussion will primarily focus on the implementation of Obama's immigration action and border security measures.\n\nAccording to a senior administration official, the leaders' agenda will include strategies to prevent a renewed surge of migrants this year and to minimize the number of people attempting the dangerous journey across the U.S.-Mexico border. The official also clarified that illegal immigrants already in the U.S. who aid their relatives in crossing the border will not be eligible for Obama's new deportation amnesty.\n\nMexican consulates are expected to play a significant role in informing Mexican immigrants about who qualifies and who does not qualify for the executive actions. The administration official stated that illegal immigrants from Mexico account for two-thirds of those who are eligible for deportation relief under Obama's action.\n\nThe official highlighted the progress made in strengthening the border with Mexico, attributing it to the cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico. The administration official also noted that the number of illegal immigrants entering the country is at a historical low, with the last such low recorded in the 1970s.\n\nIn addition to immigration and border security, the two leaders are expected to discuss other security issues, including the ongoing drug wars and the recent massacre of 43 students in Iguala. Human Rights Watch has urged President Obama to press his Mexican counterpart to investigate and prosecute abuses by Mexican security forces.\n\nThe White House stated that the meeting will emphasize the importance of expanding dialogue and cooperation between the United States and Mexico on economic, security, and social issues, as well as underscoring the deep cultural ties and friendship that exist between the two countries.",
    " Title: Obama Demonstrates Skillful Oratory in State of the Union Address, Yet Challenges Persist in Policy Implementation\n\nThe State of the Union address, a test of a president's political acumen, is not won by a strong hand or a weak one, but by the deftness of the player. This year, President Obama, facing a challenging political landscape, demonstrated a skilled performance in his fifth State of the Union address.\n\nThe president's hand was far from a powerhouse. Pre-speech coverage was dominated by low approval ratings and a dismal national mood. Despite improving macroeconomic indicators, the personal impact was minimal, and the \"right-direction-wrong-track\" poll question was decidedly pessimistic. The president's fifth year in office was marked by a series of setbacks, including the failure of gun control measures, the stalling of immigration reform, and the tumultuous rollout of Obamacare. On the foreign front, geopolitical challenges in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Egypt, and South Sudan overshadowed potential breakthroughs, such as the Iran nuclear talks.\n\nHowever, the president was not without cards to play. Congress, with an even lower public approval rating than the White House, bore the brunt of the public's disapproval following the federal government's partial shutdown in October. Polls showed strong public support for policies such as a higher minimum wage, extended benefits for the long-term unemployed, and new rules on immigration \u2013 precisely the policy fronts on which the president planned to press forward against strong Republican resistance.\n\nIn this downbeat context, and with the president's less-than-stellar public performances in recent months, expectations for this State of the Union were not high. Yet, the president, in his one-hour address to the nation, proved himself a skilled orator. He was brisk and confident, delivering a well-prepared speech that focused on \"inequality of opportunity\" rather than income inequality, as he had telegraphed.\n\nThe president also managed to avoid addressing several contentious issues, such as the National Security Agency scandal, the ongoing Obamacare rollout, and the immigration deportations that have angered immigrants' rights groups. Instead, he touched on various constituency buttons on issues such as climate change and environmental damage, and once again gave primacy to revamping the immigration laws.\n\nIn sum, the Obama who delivered the speech was a nimble and adaptable player. However, it is the tragedy of this presidency that, to date, he has not been nearly as adept at the less-dramatic business of actually dealing with Congress, the federal bureaucracy, the media, or any of other power centers \u2013 including foreign governments.\n\nIn recent weeks, the president has added new staff in critical positions, including senior adviser John Podesta, a veteran of Bill Clinton's later years in the White House, and new faces in the legislative affairs office. There is some cause for hope that these new players will help the president extend his talent for presentation to produce more successes in policymaking.",
    " Title: Dallas Court Finds Former Officer Amber Guyger Guilty of Murder in the Death of Botham Jean\n\nAmber Guyger, the former Dallas police officer who was charged with the killing of Botham Jean in his own apartment last year, was found guilty of murder on Tuesday, according to The Dallas Morning News. The verdict came after a trial that began on September 23, 2019.\n\nThe jury's decision followed a trial in which the facts of the case were largely uncontested, but the verdict hinged on the interpretation of the \"Castle Doctrine,\" a legal principle that allows for the use of deadly force when one is threatened in one's own home.\n\nOn the evening of September 6, 2018, Guyger, who was returning home after a long shift, mistakenly entered Jean's fourth-floor apartment, which was directly above her own. Finding the door unlocked, she shot the 26-year-old accountant, who was eating a bowl of ice cream, because she assumed he was an intruder.\n\nGuyger was initially arrested on a manslaughter charge, which was later upgraded to a murder charge after review by the district attorney's office. She testified as the first witness for the defense last Friday, expressing remorse for the incident.\n\nThe lead investigator on the case, Texas Ranger David Armstrong, testified that in interviewing 297 of the 349 residents at the South Side Flats apartment complex where Guyger and Jean lived, 46 had accidentally entered the wrong floor and attempted to unlock their doors. Of those 46, 38 were from the third and fourth floors.\n\nProsecutors argued that Guyger acted rashly in her use of deadly force by not calling for backup and that she missed several signs she was on the wrong floor because she was distracted by sexually explicit messages from a fellow police officer with whom she was having an extramarital affair.\n\nAfter the verdict was announced, attorneys for the Jean family held an impromptu press conference to praise the decision. Attorney Ben Crump said, \"This verdict is for Trayvon Martin, it's for Michael Brown, it's for Sandra Bland, it's for Tamir Rice, it's for Eric Garner, it's for Antwon Rose, it's for Jemel Roberson, for EJ Bradford, for Stephon Clark, for Jeffrey Dennis, Genevieve Dawes, for Pamela Turner.\"\n\nJean's mother rejoiced as cheers broke out outside the courtroom when the verdict was announced. \"God is good. Trust him,\" she said. Guyger remained standing until the jury left after announcing the decision, then fell into her chair.",
    " Title: Dallas Jury Convicts Former Police Officer Amber Guyger of Murder in High-Profile Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a landmark decision, a Dallas jury found former police officer Amber Guyger guilty of murder on October 1, 2019, for the shooting of Botham Jean in his own apartment. The verdict came after a trial that drew national attention and highlighted the complexities of police shootings and the application of self-defense laws.\n\nThe jury's verdict is significant, not only because it brings justice to the tragic death of Jean, but also because it may signal a shift in the interpretation of self-defense laws in cases involving police officers. The jury's decision came despite a controversial jury instruction that allowed Guyger to argue the \"Castle Doctrine,\" a Texas law that permits the use of force if another person is unlawfully and with force entering one's home. However, in this case, Guyger was the intruder, and Jean, the rightful occupant, had the legal right to use force against her.\n\nThe verdict is a potential turning point in the application of self-defense laws in police shooting cases. In many jurisdictions, officers are required to demonstrate that they used deadly force based on a \"reasonable\" belief that the suspect posed a threat of deadly force or serious bodily harm. However, in numerous cases, juries have applied an unwritten code that grants officers broad deference for their actions, often finding that any expression of fear by an officer justifies a shooting.\n\nThis unwritten code has led to questionable outcomes in cases such as the first trial of South Carolina officer Michael Slager, who shot an unarmed man fleeing, and the acquittal of the officer who shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop. In the Castile case, the officer's fear was partially based on the fact that Castile was smoking marijuana in the presence of a child, exposing him to secondhand smoke.\n\nIn the Guyger case, she argued the fear defense, claiming she felt \"pure fear\" upon entering Jean's apartment and believing he was going to kill her. However, her actions, which included immediately opening fire on an unarmed man, were not deemed reasonable by the jury.\n\nThe verdict in the Guyger trial is a crucial step towards ensuring that police officers are held accountable for their actions and that the law is applied equally to all individuals, regardless of their profession. It serves as a reminder that the use of force should be a last resort, not a first reaction, and that the fear of an individual, no matter their profession, should not be used to justify unreasonable actions.",
    " Title: Democratic Operative Arrested for Alleged Battery on Nevada GOP Campaign Manager\n\nArticle:\n\nA Democratic operative working for American Bridge 21st Century, a political action committee founded by David Brock and funded by liberal billionaire George Soros, was arrested Tuesday following an alleged battery incident involving the female campaign manager for Nevada GOP gubernatorial nominee Adam Laxalt.\n\nKristin Davison, the campaign manager for Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, claimed that the operative, Wilfred Michael Stark III, 50, grabbed and yanked her arm, refusing to let go, leaving her \"terrified and traumatized\" and with visible bruises on her neck and arms.\n\nAccording to the Laxalt campaign and local law enforcement, Stark was arrested by the Las Vegas City Marshals on Tuesday evening and is currently in custody at the Las Vegas city jail. The city marshal's office stated that the arrest was classified as a citizen's arrest, as the incident did not occur in the presence of the marshals.\n\nThe incident reportedly took place after a campaign event in East Las Vegas on Tuesday evening. Davison told reporters that a \"very large man,\" later identified as Stark, \"burst into the room\" where Laxalt and she were speaking with a camera.\n\nDavison alleged that Stark was physically aggressive, pushing her and members of her staff, screaming, and attempting to question Laxalt. Davison and her team left the room and entered an open one, but Stark reportedly followed and continued to be aggressive.\n\nDavison claimed that, in the private room, Stark grabbed her right arm, twisted it behind her back, and contorted it. She was scared and tried to pull away, but Stark allegedly grabbed tighter and pulled her closer to him. Stark also reportedly pulled her head into his chest, bruising her neck, and held her there for several minutes.\n\nDavison stated that she was screaming \"stop\u2014you're hurting me\" during the incident. The Laxalt campaign described the incident as a \"new low\" in Nevada politics and accused the left of encouraging violence.\n\nStark has a history of arrests, including an incident earlier this year when he was arrested for allegedly assaulting the female press secretary for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. The latest confrontation took place after a campaign event in East Las Vegas on Tuesday evening.\n\nAmerican Bridge, the political action committee Stark works for, did not respond to requests for comment regarding the incident. It is unclear whether Stark was on the job for American Bridge during the confrontation, but he lists himself as a reporter for the group on his LinkedIn page.\n\nStark also has a record of arrests while working for American Bridge. In 2017, he was arrested for disorderly conduct at an event in Virginia while covering then-GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie. He was found guilty of disorderly conduct in February of this year. The incident with Zinke's press secretary, Heather Swift, occurred in March at the Longworth House Office Building after a budget hearing before a House committee. Stark allegedly approached Swift and reportedly \"used his full body to push\" her as she tried to leave the room. Swift, who called the incident \"terrifying,\" told police that she decided to press charges to help obtain a \"stay-away order\" against him.\n\n\"It's shocking to me that anyone in this business, no matter which party or issue you're working on, would keep someone on their payroll who has been consistently arrested for violence,\" Davison told reporters. \"This is a terrifying incident.\"\n\nAmerican Bridge was founded in November 2010 by David Brock, who also founded liberal watchdog group Media Matters. The group's largest donor is liberal billionaire Soros, who donated more than $2 million between 2015 and 2016. Soros is still involved with the group, most recently donating $300,000 in February and $80,000 last year.",

Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now.\" He emphasized, however, that the allegations against him are \"far more serious than juvenile misbehavior.\"\n\nDr. Ford, in her prepared remarks, expressed her apprehension about coming forward, stating, \"I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified.\" She plans to testify that it is her civic duty to share her account of the incident involving Judge Kavanaugh during their high school years.\n\nIn a significant development, Dr. Ford will assert that their friend groups had intersected during her freshman and sophomore years of high school, and they had attended parties together. This statement appears to counter the defense strategy of Judge Kavanaugh and his Republican allies who have questioned Dr. Ford's memory of the assailant's identity.\n\nOther significant disclosures include the release of handwritten calendar notations from Judge Kavanaugh's high school days, affidavits from Dr. Ford's friends and husband, and a copy of the polygraph test administered in August. The polygraph test indicated no deception.\n\nAs the hearing approaches, supporters of both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh have prepared letters attesting to their integrity. Protesters have also organized rallies, and shadowy threats have been reported to key players involved in the drama. The hearing is set to take place on Thursday, September 27.",
    " Title: Fox News Anchor Shepard Smith Debunks Uranium One Allegations Against Hillary Clinton\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Fox News anchor Shepard Smith on Tuesday evening debunked the long-standing Uranium One allegations against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, sparking fury among some Fox viewers. The segment, which delved into the complexities of the Uranium One deal, involved a comprehensive unraveling of the accusations that Clinton, while serving as Secretary of State, smoothed a deal involving US uranium mining, Russia, and the Clinton Foundation.\n\nThe story resurfaced this week due to the pressure on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the old allegations. Sessions, during a congressional hearing on Tuesday, hinted that there was no basis to do so. However, Smith's detailed and fact-based segment, albeit from an anchor who has previously been critical of Fox News's tendency to stoke stories that bolster President Trump and weaken Clinton, has left many in Fox's conservative audience questioning the validity of the claims.\n\nOne outraged Fox viewer took to Twitter, stating, \"Get Shepard Smith off of Fox. He's arrogant and doing his own spin. Nobody knows how deep the left's conspiracy goes, and Shepherd Smith has ZERO inside info because nobody trusts him. OUT!\"\n\nIn a lengthy segment, Smith outlined the original accusations, made in a book by a journalist for right-wing news website Breitbart, and Trump's use of these accusations to boost support during the campaign. He then took apart the claims, starting with the allegation that Clinton approved the sale of a Canadian company with large uranium mining interests in Wyoming to the Russian nuclear agency, in exchange for $140 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation from nine people involved in the business deal.\n\nSmith explained that the deal required the approval of a committee formed from the heads of nine federal government agencies, and that President Obama, due to the national security implications of Russia holding any US uranium interests, under rules written during the Reagan administration, had the power to block the deal. Smith also pointed out that Clinton did not intervene to approve the deal and did not have the power to approve or block it.\n\nFurthermore, Smith noted that none of the uranium mined in Wyoming by the Canadian company was exported to Russia, and the vast bulk of the donations to the Clinton Foundation were made by a man who had already sold his stake in the uranium company in 2007, years before the Russian deal went through and about 18 months before Clinton became Secretary of State.\n\nAs the segment progressed, Smith appeared to stumble over his script several times, acknowledging the complexity of the story and the potential backlash from viewers with a different political perspective. Despite this, Smith's segment provided a detailed and factual account of the Uranium One deal, challenging the narrative that has been perpetuated by some media outlets and political figures.\n\nIn conclusion, Shepard Smith's segment on Fox News provided a comprehensive and factual account of the Uranium One deal, debunking the long-standing allegations against Hillary Clinton. The segment, while likely to be met with resistance from some viewers, offers a more nuanced and accurate portrayal of the deal's complexities and the role of the Clinton Foundation in the process.",
    " Title: Virginia Navigator Program Seeks $495,000 for Healthcare Market Outreach\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Virginia navigator program has requested a funding of $495,000, which represents approximately a third of the total navigator funds allocated for the state. This funding would cover the costs of seven and a half full-time navigators, necessary equipment, informational materials, marketing, and ongoing outreach events in five counties.\n\nThe federal government's allocation of funds for navigators in states operating their own insurance markets was not initially anticipated, resulting in a limited $54 million budget - transferred from a fund for public health prevention programs. The healthcare law had set aside significantly more money for states that built their own markets, assuming most would do so.\n\nTo address this funding gap, other organizations will also be involved in educating the uninsured and assisting with enrollment in health plans through the new markets. In total, about 1,200 community health centers nationwide, which provide medical care for the uninsured, have received a combined $150 million in federal funds for outreach and enrollment. Virginia's health centers received $2.5 million.\n\nIn addition to navigators, insurance agents or brokers, and insurance companies selling plans through the markets, will also play a role in the enrollment process. Northern Virginia Family Service plans to enlist a network of partner organizations, many of whom already work with the uninsured, to help with outreach and enrollment or provide space and other resources.\n\nChristine Barber, a senior policy analyst at Community Catalyst, a consumer advocacy group, stated, \"Other local groups may have funding or be in a position to get volunteers to do some of this work. Everyone is anxious to know who the navigators are so that other groups can partner with them, know who to refer people to, know how to flesh out their coalitions and their outreach.\"\n\nNavigators, who will also assist small businesses and their employees in learning about and enrolling in health plans offered through the new markets, are prohibited from recommending specific health plans or receiving compensation from an insurance company. They will receive at least 20 hours of training and must pass a certification test.",
    " Title: Shift in Strategy: Obama and Romney Focus on Mobilizing Core Voters in Tight Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final stretch of the 2012 presidential election, both candidates, President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, are focusing more on energizing their respective bases than on persuading undecided voters. This shift in strategy has led to a series of harsh exchanges between the candidates, with each accusing the other of divisive and negative campaigning.\n\nThe race has taken a more partisan turn, with the economy and qualifications giving way to ideology and personality. For months, Mr. Romney attempted to appeal to voters who were disappointed with President Obama but not necessarily angry at him. However, after a summer of attacks from the Democrats, Mr. Romney is now returning the scorching fire in an attempt to expand his support among Republicans who are eager to see President Obama out of office in November.\n\nAccording to strategists from both parties, the traditional balance between motivating core supporters without scaring off independent voters may be different in this election cycle. A series of recent polls in six swing states showed that only 5 percent of voters are undecided, and only about 1 in 10 likely voters who have chosen a candidate are open to switching.\n\nJoel Benenson, the chief pollster for President Obama's re-election campaign, stated, \"There is a smaller slice of undecided voters out there than usual.\" He added, \"Republicans may think that their only chance of winning this is by maximizing their base, but I don't believe this election is a base election.\"\n\nFor President Obama, there may be more opportunities to capture moderate voters who oppose the direction taken by Representative Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, and other House Republicans. However, Mr. Obama still needs to persuade some centrists that he can be trusted with the deficit and the economy and that he is not culturally out of step with them.\n\nThe strategic shifts by the candidates mirror a bigger change in the nature of the race. It is no longer solely a referendum on President Obama's economic record; rather, it is a choice between the future of Medicare, the popular health insurance program for retirees, and the role and scope of government.\n\nThe Romney campaign is testing whether it can expand the successful Republican coalition from 2010, when the party, on the basis of an anti-Obama and very conservative message, won control of the House and expanded its strength at all levels of government. It is not simply a base strategy, aides said, but a plan to capitalize on the rejection of President Obama's approach that they say is coursing through the country.\n\nNeil Newhouse, the pollster for Mr. Romney, stated, \"We're going to be able to make a very compelling argument to people in the middle that we need a change and Obama isn't the change they signed up for.\" He added, \"When you really probe, people are upset with spending, the deficit, and the debt. It goes beyond jobs and the economy, and there is a sense things are out of control.\"\n\nFor Mr. Romney, several benefits of selecting Representative Ryan as his running mate have already become clear. He has finally drawn praise from conservatives, including those who have long been tepid. And he has become a stronger and more confident campaigner with a partner at his side, advisers say, who has an easygoing style that could help improve Mr. Romney's connection to voters.\n\nThe Romney campaign is taking pains to track down and quash any criticism in Republican circles about any potential downsides of Representative Ryan on the ticket, including that the campaign debate over Medicare is fraught with risk for other candidates in the party.\n\nInterviews with nearly a dozen Republicans on Congressional and Senate campaigns said in near unison that they worried that the economic focus of the race had been overshadowed. It is a question that may not be answered until Election Day. Will a surge of conservative enthusiasm for the Republican ticket outweigh any potential falloff among voters who supported President Obama in 2008 and are open to changing their minds this year?",
    " Title: U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm Indicted for Alleged Tax Fraud and Employment of Undocumented Workers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, U.S. Representative Michael Grimm, a former FBI agent, has been indicted on over 20 charges, including wire fraud, perjury, and obstruction of justice. The charges stem from a health food restaurant, Healthalicious, that Grimm ran from 2007-2010.\n\nAt a press conference on Monday, Loretta Lynch, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, described the alleged conduct as \"breathtaking.\" She accused Rep. Grimm of \"succumbing to the allure of easy money and cheating his way to success.\"\n\nThe indictment alleges that Grimm paid some employees exclusively in cash and others partly in cash and partly through checks. This method allowed him to hide over $1 million in profits, thereby evading federal and state taxes, paying less for workers' compensation insurance, and hiring undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe indictment claims that Grimm concealed over $1.3 million in Healthalicious' gross receipts and employees' wages, fraudulently depriving the federal and New York State governments of sales, income, and payroll taxes.\n\nRep. Grimm is facing twenty criminal charges, all of which fall into the following nine categories: Obstructing and Impeding the Due Administration of the Internal Revenue Laws, Aiding and Assisting in the Preparation of False and Fraudulent Tax Returns (3-5). The indictment also accuses Grimm of lying under oath during a deposition for a lawsuit brought by former employees of Healthalicious who alleged they were being paid less than minimum wage.\n\nIn addition to the larger money-hiding scheme, Grimm \"knowingly hired and knowingly continued to employ workers who did not have legal residency status and accordingly did not have valid authorization to work inside the United States,\" the indictment concludes.\n\nRep. Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, has denied the allegations, accusing the government of a \"politically driven vendetta against Congressman Grimm and not an independent search for the truth.\"\n\nThe indictment threatens the political career of the sophomore lawmaker, who has faced a litany of ethics complaints and calls for his immediate resignation from watchdog groups like Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The indictment is a significant blow to Grimm's reputation as a key moderate voice in the House Republican conference.",
    " Title: Senate Fails to Repeal Obamacare, Leaving Healthcare Law in Place\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic early-morning showdown on the Senate floor, the seven-year Republican quest to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, came to a halt on Friday. The bill to repeal key elements of the healthcare law was defeated 51-49, with three Republican senators joining Democrats in opposition. The vote dealt President Donald Trump a significant political setback.\n\nSenator John McCain, the 80-year-old senator and 2008 Republican presidential nominee, cast the deciding vote. McCain, who is currently undergoing treatment for brain cancer, joined fellow Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski in voting against the legislation.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose reputation as a master strategist was diminished, said on the Senate floor after the vote, \"It's time to move on.\"\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan said fellow Republicans should not give up on healthcare, but cited other pressing issues that needed attention, including major tax-cut legislation sought by Trump.\n\nThe Senate's inability to repeal Obamacare raises questions about the Republican Party's ability to govern, as they control the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives. Trump has not had a major legislative victory after more than six months in office, and his administration is mired in investigations into contacts between his election campaign and Russia and high-level White House staff infighting.\n\nThe legislative agenda now includes spending bills for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 to avoid a government shutdown and raising the U.S. debt limit.\n\nTrump expressed dismay at the bill's failure, saying, \"I said from the beginning, let Obamacare implode and then do it (pass legislation). I turned out to be right. Let Obamacare implode.\"\n\nSome lawmakers are urging a bipartisan effort to buttress the existing healthcare system. With the partisan divide as wide as ever in Washington, it remains to be seen if a bipartisan approach can get off the ground.\n\nMcCain said the defeated bill did not offer meaningful reform and that its defeat presents \"an opportunity to start fresh\" on legislation crafted by lawmakers in both parties.\n\nTop congressional Democrats urged a bipartisan effort to fix problems in the Obamacare law without repealing it. \"Change it, improve it, but don't just take a knife and try to destroy it and put nothing in its place,\" top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said.\n\nDemocratic Senator Bill Nelson said he was working with Republican Collins on a bipartisan effort on healthcare.\n\nThe failure to repeal Obamacare leaves the healthcare law in place, which must be overseen by an administration that is hostile to it. This leaves health insurers unsure of how long the administration will continue to make billions of dollars in Obamacare payments that help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans.\n\nThe Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which represents insurers across the country, said it would work to ensure a smooth open enrollment period from Nov. 1-Dec. 15 and stabilize the individual insurance market under Obamacare for the long term.\n\nShares of health insurers, which had fought against the bill's proposed repeal of the mandate that Americans obtain insurance, were up. Aetna Inc rose 0.9 percent, Anthem Inc gained 2.3 percent, and Humana Inc edged up 0.2 percent.\n\nOn Wall Street, shares of hospitals were mostly higher because of the dwindling prospects for big cuts in the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled. Community Health Systems Inc rose 2.2 percent, HCA Healthcare Inc gained 0.6 percent, and Tenet Healthcare Corp edged up 0.1 percent. Republicans have long denounced Obamacare - which expanded Medicaid and created online marketplaces for individuals to obtain coverage - as an intrusion by government on people's healthcare decisions.\n\nVeteran House Republican Tom Cole said he thought there were \"a number\" of other Republican senators who were uncomfortable with the Senate's healthcare legislation but were able to vote \"yes\" knowing McCain's vote would kill it.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close friend of McCain, met on Friday with Trump to discuss Graham's proposal to take tax money raised by Obamacare and send it back to the states in the form of healthcare block grants, the senator's office said.",
    " Title: Shift in State Immigration Policies: A Cautious Approach Amid Changing Political Climate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe immigration debate in Washington may be heating up, but the fervor of two years ago has cooled in the states, where the push for broad \"omnibus\" immigration bills has given way to a more cautious approach due to shifting political currents and court decisions.\n\nImmigrant-rights groups are now taking the offensive, passing laws such as Colorado's recent bill granting in-state college tuition rates to illegal immigrants and Illinois' law allowing driver's licenses for illegal immigrants.\n\nArturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, commented, \"There has been a general reaction by folks to the impact that the Latino vote had in November\u2014that people are thinking twice about the actions they take. Most of these pieces of legislation had been supported by Republican legislators, and I think people are thinking twice about whether this is a strategy the party wants to pursue.\"\n\nTwo years ago, the momentum was on the opposite side. Congress was stalemated, leaving conservative states to push ahead with their own laws aimed at managing illegal immigration, which they claimed cost them hundreds of millions of dollars and potentially endangered safety.\n\nArizona, in 2007, pioneered a law requiring all businesses to use the government's voluntary electronic worker verification system, followed by the 2011 enactment of SB 1070, a law imposing state criminal penalties for illegal immigrants and mandating police to check the status of those suspected of being in the country illegally.\n\nSouth Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, and Indiana also passed similar laws. The Supreme Court upheld the worker verification law in 2011 and last year issued a significant ruling allowing the police checks to continue, though it struck down the state criminal penalties for illegal immigration. The court also warned it could revisit the police checks if the law is implemented in a discriminatory manner.\n\nNow, many states are waiting to see what the courts and Congress will do next. Ann Morse, who runs the National Conference of State Legislatures' immigrant policy project, stated, \"Interest in immigration is still high at the state level, but there are no longer the big omnibus bills.\"\n\nSome states are debating new verification requirements for state services or for voting. However, where there is clear momentum, it appears to be on the immigrant-advocacy side. Colorado's General Assembly passed a bill earlier this month granting illegal immigrants in-state tuition rates for state colleges, and lawmakers there introduced another bill to repeal a 2006 law requiring police to cooperate with federal immigration agents.\n\nOther states have moved to grant driver's licenses to the young adult illegal immigrants who received tentative legal status last year from President Obama. Several Republican attorneys general told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 last month that they consider immigration a national issue and want to see Washington take the lead.\n\nColorado Attorney General John W. Suthers said, \"We have to look to the federal government to take the charge on immigration reform. The Arizona case and others are kind of mapping out what the states can do and what the federal government has to do.\"\n\nHowever, Kris Kobach, the secretary of state in Kansas who was also a leading architect of Arizona's crackdown law, said he still sees an appetite to act. \"I don't think the atmosphere in the state legislatures has changed at all,\" he said. \"I think what we saw in 2011 and 2012 was the states that were the low-hanging fruit were already primed and ready to do something active. They've already taken steps, and are happy with those steps, and other states are moving to follow them.\"\n\nMr. Kobach argued that President Obama's move to grant legal status to illegal immigrant young adults last year created confusion for states, causing chaos about what other benefits they should be entitled to. \"The Obama administration, through its illegal executive amnesty, is trying to have it both ways. They recognize that they have no power to grant lawful immigration status to illegal aliens, yet at the same time they are trying to tell the states to go ahead and give these illegal aliens driver's licenses,\" said Mr. Kobach, the lead attorney on a lawsuit by federal immigration agents challenging the policy.\n\nHe added that given President Obama's moves and the debate in Congress, state lawmakers who want to see a crackdown realize that the states are their only avenues for action. \"The events since the start of the year have made it clear to state leaders that the only serious efforts to enforce the law are going to be at the state level,\" Mr. Kobach said. He also suggested that his home state of Kansas could repeal its in-state tuition rates for illegal immigrants.",
    " Title: Senate Reaches Bipartisan Agreement on Gun Control Measures Following 14-Hour Filibuster\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic move, the United States Senate has agreed to hold votes on tighter gun control measures following a 14-hour filibuster led by Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) on Thursday. The filibuster, which began on Wednesday, was a response to the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.\n\nSenator Murphy, who spearheaded the filibuster along with several colleagues, announced in the early hours of Thursday that a deal had been struck with Republican leaders to hold votes on key measures. These measures include expanding background checks and banning gun sales to individuals on the terror watchlist.\n\nSenator Murphy tweeted, \"I am proud to announce that after 14+ hours on the floor, we will have a vote on closing the terror gap & universal background checks.\" He further added, \"This is one step. The fight is far from over. But there are millions of voices calling for change. And we can not stop pushing #Enough.\"\n\nSenator Murphy had promised at the outset that he would remain on the Senate floor \"until we get some signal, some sign that we can come together\" on gun control. As the filibuster continued, updates and messages of support were posted on social media with the hashtags #enough and #holdthefloor.\n\nThe Connecticut senator evoked the Newtown school shooting in his state in 2012 in a plea that came as the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, said he would meet with the National Rifle Association (NRA) about the terror watchlist and gun purchases.\n\nThe election-year fight over gun control pits strong proponents of the second amendment right to bear arms against those arguing for greater restrictions on the ability to obtain weapons. The Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, was added to a government watchlist of individuals known or suspected of being involved in terrorist activities in 2013, but was removed from the database 10 months later.\n\nThe Senate has not made any significant changes to federal gun laws in nearly a decade. In April 2007, Congress passed a law to strengthen the instant background check system after a gunman at Virginia Tech who killed 32 people was able to purchase his weapons because his mental health history was not in the instant background check database.\n\nSenator Murphy is seeking a vote on legislation that would let the government bar sales of guns and explosives to people it suspects of being terrorists. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) offered a similar version of the amendment in December, but the Republican-run Senate rejected the proposal on a near party-line vote. Senator Murphy also wants a vote to expand background checks.\n\nSeparately, Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group backed by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, is working on a compromise with Senator Patrick Toomey (R-PA), a Republican in a tough re-election race this year who has sought compromise in the past on gun control measures. By the end of the day, Toomey had introduced legislation that would direct the attorney general to create a new list of suspected terrorists who could be barred from buying weapons. However, Democrats immediately rejected that idea, saying it would create too much of a backlog.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Exempts Keystone XL Pipeline from 'Buy American' Executive Order\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that balances business interests and infrastructure development, the Trump administration has decided to exempt the Keystone XL pipeline from the executive order requiring new pipelines to use American steel. The decision was made on the grounds that the pipeline is already under construction and, therefore, not covered by the executive order.\n\nSpeaking to reporters onboard Air Force One, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders explained, \"The Keystone XL Pipeline is currently in the process of being constructed, so it does not count as a new, retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipeline.\"\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline, first proposed in 2008, has been a contentious issue for over a decade. The Obama administration rejected the project, which would carry bitumen from the oilsands of Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast of the US, on environmental grounds in 2015. However, an executive order by Trump in January paved the way for construction on the pipeline to recommence.\n\nThe decision to allow the pipeline to proceed is seen as a triumph of business-friendly ideas over populist calls to \"buy American and hire American.\" Forbes contributor Tim Worstall, senior fellow at the Adam Smith Institute, wrote in an opinion piece, \"What we want is the pipeline that can be used at the least overall cost.\"\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline is expected to add $5.7 billion to the economies of Oklahoma and Texas while the southern leg of the pipeline was under construction, according to the Institute for Energy Research. The southern section of the pipeline, which does not cross an international border and so did not require State Department approval, is already operational.\n\nThe Trump administration's decision to exempt the Keystone XL pipeline from the 'Buy American' executive order may be a temporary demonstration of pragmatism rather than a shift in policy. The move has been welcomed by supporters, who see it as a win for business and good economics. However, American steel will be a feature of future pipelines, according to White House spokeswoman Sanders.\n\nThe Canadian government has also praised the decision, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office calling it a \"recognition that the integrated Canadian and US steel industries are mutually beneficial.\" The move may also potentially persuade TransCanada to drop a $15 billion NAFTA complaint against the US, which it brought after construction was suspended earlier this week.",
    " Title: Mass Layoffs Across U.S. Industries: A Look at the Impact of Regulatory Burdens and Economic Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent weeks, a series of mass layoffs have been announced across various U.S. industries, with employers citing regulatory burdens and economic policies as primary factors. Last Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 1,316 \"mass layoff actions\" (affecting 50 workers or more) in September, with over 122,000 workers affected overall.\n\nThe slowest period of earnings growth since the third quarter of 2009 has reportedly contributed to the recent layoff activity. Ohio-based auto parts manufacturer Dana Holding Corp. warned employees of potential layoffs due to economic concerns, with President and CEO Roger Wood specifically mentioning the burden of increased taxes on small businesses and the need to offset costs from new laws and regulations.\n\nOne such regulation is the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Dana Holding Corp., which employs some 24,500 workers, will incur approximately $24 million in additional U.S. health care expenses over the next six years due to Obamacare. The firm's Toledo area corporate offices recently laid off seven white-collar employees, with more expected.\n\nSimilarly, Consol Energy announced its intent to idle its Miller Creek surface operations near Naugatuck, W.Va., affecting 145 employees at the end of the year. The company attributes the impasse in permit approval process, primarily due to Obama's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as the cause for the layoffs.\n\nIn August, Robert E. Murray, founder and CEO of Murray Energy Corporation in Ohio, blasted the White House's anti-coal agenda for the layoffs and closure of his company's mine. Murray explained that the many regulations imposed by the Obama administration have closed 175 power plants.\n\nThe medical device industry has also been impacted by the impending 2.3 percent medical device excise tax. Companies such as Stryker, Covidien, Zoll Medical Corp., and Cook Medical Inc. have announced layoffs and plant closures due to the tax.\n\nThe heads of Koch Industries, Westgate Resorts, and ASG Software Solutions have also informed their employees of the negative impact of Obama's economic policies. Left-wing groups have criticized the executives for exercising their political free speech, but the White House has been accused of bribing federal defense contractors to delay federally mandated layoff disclosures before the election.\n\nThe administration's efforts to suppress truth and manipulate information have been a recurring theme, as seen in the past attempts to punish companies for disclosing the costs of Obamacare taxes on their bottom lines. The administration's bully tactics and economic policies continue to face criticism from various sectors of the U.S. economy.",
    " Title: Common Core Faces Increased Public Opposition as Supporters Vow to Revamp Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the Common Core standards have faced a significant setback as two national polls released this week indicate a decline in public support for the academic standards. The polls, conducted by Education Next and Phi Delta Kappa International, reveal a growing skepticism towards the Common Core, with a majority of respondents expressing opposition to its implementation in their local communities.\n\nThe Education Next poll, published by the conservative Hoover Institution, found a drop in support for the Common Core from 65% to 53% in the past year. The poll also showed that when the term \"Common Core\" was replaced with \"standards for reading and math that are the same across the states,\" support for the standards increased to 68%, demonstrating a significant shift in public perception.\n\nThe Phi Delta Kappa International poll, released Wednesday, found that 80% of Americans have heard about the Common Core, with nearly half stating they know a fair amount about the standards. However, the familiarity has led to distrust, with 60% of respondents opposing the use of the Common Core to guide instruction in their community.\n\nThe opposition to the Common Core is driven by concerns about local control and teacher flexibility in the classroom. Over three-quarters of naysayers cited local teachers' lack of support for the standards as a reason for their opposition, and a majority expressed concern about the standards limiting teachers' flexibility.\n\nIn response to the growing opposition, Common Core supporters have vowed to revamp their campaign. On Friday, they will unveil their first step, which involves Latino evangelical pastors from across the country rallying their congregations behind the Common Core. The guest speaker at this event will be former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who has previously criticized the Common Core as a symbol of top-down federal intrusion into local schools.\n\nDespite the challenges, Common Core backers have received some positive news from Louisiana, where a district judge recently rejected Governor Bobby Jindal's effort to repeal the standards by executive order. However, in Ohio, the Legislature is considering a bill to join the five other states that have repealed the standards in recent months.\n\nThe new polls highlight more than a year of high-profile opposition to the Common Core from various groups, including parent activists, tea party organizations, and politicians such as Jindal and Huckabee. The polls suggest that the public debate over the Common Core may be shifting, and Common Core supporters will need to address the concerns of the American public to regain support for the standards.",
    " Title: Trump-Putin Meeting: U.S. President Accepts Russia's Denial of Election Interference, Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a high-profile meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the U.S. President appeared to accept Putin's denials of any election interference, a move that has sparked controversy and raised concerns about the integrity of the U.S. election process.\n\nAccording to reports, Trump accepted Putin's denials at face value, despite the fact that the entire U.S. intelligence community believes the Kremlin mounted a sophisticated campaign to help Trump win the White House. This development is the most significant takeaway from the Trump-Putin meeting, as it gives the appearance that the Trump administration accepts that the Kremlin did not interfere in the election.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov revealed that Trump told Putin that some in the United States were \"exaggerating\" how much Russia affected the election's outcome, effectively dragging Moscow into Trump's partisan wars at home. The meeting took place amidst speculation about whether Congress would pass sanctions on Russia as punishment for its election meddling. Trump acknowledged the possibility of sanctions, but also expressed a desire to move past the issue.\n\nThe meeting's outcome was a win for Putin, as he got Trump to buy into his narrative on election interference and offer a weak endorsement of upcoming sanctions. The lack of preparation on Trump's part may have contributed to the outcome, as he reportedly had no notes or talking points, while Putin came prepared with notecards listing perceived American sins against Russia.\n\nThe meeting also resulted in a ceasefire in Syria's southwest, but it remains unclear what the ceasefire will achieve, as most of the fighting is in Syria's east and north. The ceasefire's effectiveness is also questionable, as much of the country's southwest has already been flattened.\n\nOverall, the meeting has raised concerns about the U.S. President's approach to Russia and the election meddling issue. Critics argue that Trump may have done more damage by meeting with Putin than he would have done by staying home. The meeting has also sparked a renewed debate about the U.S. relationship with Russia and the extent of Russian involvement in the 2016 U.S. election.",
    " Title: Whistleblower Lawyers Express Safety Concerns Amidst Calls for Identity Disclosure\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a letter sent to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, the lawyers for the intelligence official who filed a whistleblower complaint against President Trump have expressed \"serious concerns\" for their client's safety. The letter, signed by the whistleblower's lead attorney, Andrew Bakaj, and dated Saturday, was made public on Sunday.\n\nThe letter, as reported by NBC News, stated that recent events have heightened concerns that the whistleblower's identity will be disclosed publicly, potentially putting the individual in harm's way. The letter did not specify the events that led to this concern, but it is believed to be in response to President Trump's call for the person who provided the whistleblower with information to be identified.\n\nBakaj acknowledged that it was the unidentified whistleblower's source of information whom Trump's comment targeted. However, he wrote that the distinction does nothing to assuage their concerns for their client's safety. The lawyer also claimed that \"certain individuals\" had offered a $50,000 bounty for information about their client's identity.\n\nThe Washington Examiner, a conservative news outlet, reported last week that two right-wing activists had offered the sum for \"credible information corroborating\" the person's identity. On Sunday, the president suggested in a tweet that he wants the whistleblower to be outed.\n\nThe lawyers also called on lawmakers to speak out for whistleblower protections and insist that retaliation against the official\u2014whether direct or implied\u2014would not be tolerated, according to Business Insider. The letter stated that they expected the situation to worsen and become even more dangerous for their client and any other whistleblowers as Congress seeks to investigate this matter.\n\nCBS News has reported that the whistleblower, identified by the New York Times as a CIA officer, was already under federal protection. However, Mark Zaid, a lawyer from Compass Rose Legal, tweeted that CBS \"completely misinterpreted the contents of our letter,\" saying the legal team had not yet reached an agreement with Congress regarding contact with their client.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday that he expected the whistleblower to testify \"very soon\" once security measures were implemented to protect the person's identity. Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would launch a formal impeachment inquiry in light of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nA rough summary of the conversation revealed Trump's apparent efforts to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. On Thursday, the complaint by the whistleblower, who believed Trump was \"using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country\" in the 2020 election, was released to the public.\n\nThe intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, deemed the Aug. 12 complaint \"credible\" and of \"urgent concern\" and passed it on to Maguire, who testified before the House Intelligence Committee. Maguire said that both the whistleblower and the inspector general \"acted in good faith throughout\" and \"have done everything by the book and followed the law.\"",
    " Title: The Struggle for Identity: Kamala Harris' Exit and the Divide in the Democratic Party\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic Party is grappling with an identity crisis, as evidenced by the recent withdrawal of Senator Kamala Harris from the 2020 presidential race. For years, Harris was known as the \"female Obama,\" but her campaign faltered in the primary race, with critics pointing to her attempt to appeal to both progressive and centrist factions within the party.\n\nThe Democratic primary has crystallized into a contest between the party's two wings, with candidates aligning on either side of the ideological and attitudinal divide. Harris, in an attempt to bridge the gap, was dismissed as an impostor by both camps.\n\nThe first group, personified most intensely by former Vice President Joe Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, are the Adjusters. They believe that the world was a good place in October 2016, and that removing President Donald Trump from office represents a necessary course correction that will allow the country to proceed upon the path that Barack Obama had outlined during his presidency. \"We made a mistake,\" they say. \"Let's just fix it and get back to normal.\"\n\nThe other movement is led by the Revolutionaries, with Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders at the forefront. They see removing Trump from office as only the first step, which must be followed by sweeping, even radical change. Revolutionaries see Obama as an incrementalist and dismiss the Clintons as sellouts. They call for a much more dramatic overhaul, but one that unnerves risk-averse establishment Democrats who worry that such an ambitious agenda could drive centrist voters to Trump.\n\nIn addition to Biden and Buttigieg, the ranks of the Adjusters have recently been swelled by the addition of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick to the race. Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are part of this faction as well, as are the lower-tier candidates Michael Bennet, the Colorado senator, and John Delaney, a former Maryland congressman. All face a similar challenge of trying to excite primary voters with some variation of a more cautious agenda.\n\nThe rest of the primary candidates are Revolutionaries. Along with Warren and Sanders, nontraditional alternatives such as entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, and impeachment activist Tom Steyer occupy this space as well, along with fading options like former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and author Marianne Williamson. They might differ on the specifics of their policy prescriptions, but all advocate for a much more fundamental shift in the priorities of their party and the country.\n\nHarris was the only Democratic candidate who made a serious effort to talk to voters in both groups. Lacking the skills of Obama and the experience of Bill Clinton, she was unable to convince either Adjusters or the Revolutionaries that she was one of them. Rejected by both, she now returns to the Senate, where the upcoming impeachment trial gives her the opportunity to burnish her credentials for a spot on the ticket or a Cabinet post.\n\nThough Harris has left the race, the divide in her party remains. Just as in 2016, when many Sanders supporters stayed home instead of voting, or chose Trump or third-party candidates, a similar temptation will exist in 2020 if a moderate becomes the Democratic nominee. Conversely, the late Bloomberg and Patrick entries reflect growing worries in the party's centrist establishment wing about Democratic prospects in the general election.\n\nThe eventual nominee will not defeat Trump unless the Adjusters and Revolutionaries are able to put aside their differences. Harris' greatest contribution to her party this year may be to serve as a reminder of what could happen if that unity is not achieved.",
    " Title: Obama Cautions on Syria Chemical Weapons Use, Awaits Conclusive Proof Before Taking Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, President Barack Obama has expressed caution over the reported use of chemical weapons in Syria, emphasizing the need for conclusive evidence before taking any action. The Washington Post first reported on Tuesday that there were indications of small-scale chemical munitions use in Syria, a claim that the Assad regime has been known to possess.\n\nAt a press conference in Washington on Tuesday, President Obama stated, \"What we now have is evidence that chemical weapons have been used inside of Syria, but we don't know how they were used, when they were used, who used them; we don't have chain of custody that establishes what exactly happened.\"\n\nThe President reiterated his stance that before responding, he needs solid proof that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had deployed these weapons - a point he emphasized during the news conference. \"When I am making decisions about America's national security and the potential for taking additional action in response to chemical weapon use, I've got to make sure I've got the facts,\" Obama said.\n\nThe President also warned against rushing to judgment without solid evidence, stating, \"If we end up rushing to judgment without hard, effective evidence, then we can find ourselves in the position where we can't mobilize the international community to support what we do.\"\n\nDespite the lack of conclusive proof of chemical weapons use, officials have reported that the Pentagon has prepared a range of options for President Obama, including airstrikes, commando raids, and the enforcement of a no-fly zone over Syria. The administration is also reportedly looking for ways to increase aid to the rebels.\n\nPresident Obama has previously resisted calls to arm the rebels, including from David H. Petraeus, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. A proposal by Petraeus to provide arms to carefully vetted members of the opposition was shelved last fall, though several officials expect it to be revisited.",
    " Title: Iranian Cyberattacks: Iran's Advancing Capabilities and Potential Escalation in Cyber Warfare\n\nArticle:\n\nOver the past year, Iranian hackers have been targeting the presidential campaign of former U.S. President Donald Trump, telecom companies, infrastructure systems, and more than 200 oil, gas, and heavy machinery companies worldwide. According to James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, these hackers have developed the capability to disrupt critical infrastructure and have the ability to wipe data. The question now is what services, such as pipelines or dams, they may target next.\n\nIran is not yet at the top of the league of countries with the ability to cause widespread destruction via cyberattacks, Mr. Lewis and other experts said. However, Tehran has made significant strides since 2009, when a classified intelligence assessment concluded that it had the motivation but lacked the skills and resources to inflict harm.\n\nSince 2010, when an Iranian nuclear facility was the target of a joint American-Israeli cyberattack, Iran has embraced such attacks as part of its strategy of asymmetrical warfare. While the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps may never match the West in conventional warfare, its specialized teams have learned how much destruction they can cause to vulnerable systems, according to American intelligence assessments and private security researchers.\n\nOver the past five years, American officials and cybersecurity experts have tracked Iranian hackers as they have significantly advanced their capabilities beyond wiping data to sophisticated attacks on financial networks, internet infrastructure, energy companies, and critical infrastructure sites like the Bowman Dam in Westchester County and the Energy Department's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls.\n\n\"They now have the ability to do serious harm,\" Mr. Lewis said. \"As the conflict with the U.S. continues, they're going to be tempted. Expect to see a lot more testing of how far they can get into company networks, universities, federal networks, and smaller government networks in towns and cities.\"\n\nIn response to the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani in an overnight airstrike at the Baghdad airport, Iranian leaders issued strident calls for revenge against the United States on Friday. The potential for escalation in cyber warfare between the two nations remains a significant concern.",
    " Title: New Book Alleges Hunter Biden's Business Deals with Foreign Governments and Oligarchs\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a new book titled \"Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite,\" author Peter Schweizer alleges that Hunter Biden, son of the 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden, forged business deals with individuals and entities tied to the governments of Russia, China, and Kazakhstan, reportedly earning him hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe book, which has been reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588, details how Hunter Biden and his business partners, including Devon Archer, were deeply involved with an entity called the Burnham Financial Group. According to the book, Hunter and Archer used Burnham to make foreign deals with governments and oligarchs.\n\nOne of those oligarchs included Nurlan Abduov, the associate of another Kazakh oligarch, Kenges Rakishev. Rakishev is the son-in-law of the former vice prime minister of Kazakhstan, Imangali Tasmagambetov. Tasmagamvetov was also formerly the defense minister, and is now the Kazakh ambassador to Russia.\n\nThe book alleges that an account Hunter regularly received funds from showed money arriving from a firm run by Rakishev in 2014. Additionally, Archer is said to have acted as a backchannel between Kazakhstan and then-Secretary of State John Kerry, according to the book.\n\nFurthermore, the book claims that Burnham had business deals with two mysterious Chinese companies - Kirin Global Enterprises Limited and Harvest Global Investors. Kirin Global Enterprise Limited was an investment vehicle run by Xiangyao (or Yaojun) \"Larry\" Liu and Guo Jianfeng, according to Schweizer. Harvest Global Investors was a Chinese investment firm linked to the government in Beijing.\n\nBurnham also had a financial relationship with Russian Oligarch Yelena Baturina, a billionaire with extensive political connections in Moscow and links to Russian organized crime, according to Schweizer. Archer reportedly said Baturina invested $200 million into \"various investment funds\" with which he was involved.\n\nThe book also alleges that Burnham was involved in a $60 million fraudulent bond scheme to rip off union pension funds and the poorest Indian tribe in America, the Oglala Sioux. In May 2016, Archer was arrested in New York and charged with \"orchestrating a scheme to defraud investors and a Native American tribal entity of tens of millions of dollars.\"\n\nAlthough Hunter Biden was not charged, Schweizer writes, \"his fingerprints were all over Burnham.\" The legitimacy that his name and political status as the vice president's son lent to Burnham was brought up repeatedly during the trial, he writes.

The committee, established to investigate the events leading to the death of four Americans, has been criticized for its credibility, with fellow Republicans and others questioning its motives.\n\nThe central question that the committee should address is not what former special forces Americans were doing in Benghazi, but rather, what were the Americans doing in Benghazi in the first place? Consulates and embassy annexes are typically for diplomatic activities such as issuing visas and handling lost luggage. However, it is clear that this was not the purpose of the former special forces Americans in Benghazi.\n\nKey questions that the committee should focus on include: Who was Ambassador Stevens supposed to meet in Benghazi, and who was responsible for his security? Which Libyan militia groups were the U.S. partnering with, and who vetted them? The committee should delve into the events that transpired in the weeks leading up to the attack, particularly why Ambassador Stevens' repeated calls for more security were ignored.\n\nAnother question that has been circulating is whether the Benghazi attack was a gun-running operation to take Qaddafi's abandoned weapons and turn them over to Syrian rebels. If this is true, were the American contractors running guns? Were the U.S. working with and arming Libyan rebels who turned out to be Al Qaeda-type terrorists? If so, not only was this a questionable decision, it was potentially illegal.\n\nThe committee should also question why there was no rescue mission mounted while our men were under attack. Furthermore, they should ask who decided to lie about the events on September 11, 2012 being a planned terrorist attack and instead of using the lame excuse that they were the result of a YouTube video sparking a demonstration that got out of hand.\n\nThe committee has new evidence, including Ambassador Stevens' own emails, which may make it difficult for any witness to dodge the questions. The most fundamental question of all is whether the fiasco of the Libyan war was another example of the Obama administration's alleged love affair with moderately radical Islamists. Has the Obama administration been willfully blind to the dangers posed by all radical Islamists in Libya, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Iran?\n\nThe nation's business was put on hold for over a year during the Watergate scandal, and it is crucial for the committee to rise above politics and serve the nation's business. The integrity of the Watergate Committee members, both Republican and Democrat, played a significant role in the system working, and the same should be expected of the Benghazi Committee. The committee's findings will provide much-needed clarity on the events that transpired in Benghazi on September 11, 2012.",
    " Title: Norway Mosque Shooting: Suspect Charged with Terrorism and Murder\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, a 21-year-old Norwegian citizen, allegedly identified as Philip Manshaus, has been charged with terrorism and murder following a shooting at a mosque near Oslo on Saturday. The incident, which left one woman dead at his home and three men injured at the Al-Noor Islamic Center, has sent shockwaves through Norway and beyond.\n\nAccording to local police, Manshaus, who was reportedly wearing body armor and heavily armed, opened fire at the mosque after breaking through a glass door. A 65-year-old worshipper, who sustained injuries during the confrontation, managed to overpower the gunman. The shooting could have been more devastating if the suspect had arrived a few minutes earlier, as there were more than a dozen people inside the mosque just 10 minutes before the incident.\n\nAuthorities found the body of Manshaus' 17-year-old stepsister at his home in Baerum, west of Oslo. He has been charged with the murder of his stepsister and is facing an attempted murder charge for the mosque shooting.\n\nThe shooting is being investigated as a terrorist act due to the gunman's apparent intent to instill fear. However, authorities emphasize that there is no evidence linking Manshaus to a larger network. Reports suggest that the suspect held far-right views, including admiration for Vidkun Quisling, Norway's leader who collaborated with the Nazis during World War II.\n\nHours before the attack, a user with the same name as the alleged gunman posted on the 4chan messaging board, expressing admiration for the gunman who killed 51 people at two New Zealand mosques earlier this year. The post included a meme that described that gunman as a \"saint\" and praised the alleged El Paso, Texas, shooter for \"reclaiming his country.\"\n\nIn response to the attack, Prime Minister Erna Solberg stated, \"Norway should be safe. All places of worship shall be safe.\" As Muslims celebrated the beginning of Eid al-Adha on Sunday, many non-Muslims stood outside mosques in Oslo to stand guard.\n\nThis story has been updated with new information since its initial publication.",
    " Title: FBI Background Checks for Firearm Purchases Decline After Record High in December\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing a record-breaking high in December, the number of FBI background checks run through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) has decreased year-over-year for the first time since October 2011. The decline in checks, which serve as a proxy for gun sales, suggests a waning fervor for gun purchases following the Connecticut school shooting and subsequent government push for new gun control measures.\n\nIn June, 1.3 million checks were performed, a significant drop from the 2.7 million in December and a decrease of about 20,000 compared to the same month last year. This marks the first year-to-year drop in checks since October 2011.\n\nDavid Chipman, a former agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and an adviser to the gun control advocacy group Mayors Against Illegal Guns, attributes the decline to a saturation of gun purchases. \"It seems that those motivated by fear to purchase a firearm over the past several months have acquired all of the guns they desire or can afford,\" he said.\n\nNICS checks surged by nearly 500,000 in November compared to the previous year, reaching the 2 million mark for the first time. In December, they increased by over 900,000, hitting an all-time high of 2.7 million. John Hudak, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies gun issues, attributes the surge to a sense of threat and the need to satisfy that threat.\n\n\"People felt a threat. The need created by that threat was then satisfied. The shock and horror has died down in pretty dramatic fashion over the past few months,\" Mr. Hudak said.\n\nThe desire for guns, according to Mr. Hudak, fit into the psyche of the moment. \"At the same time, there was another type of fear or threat: The government would somehow stop gun sales,\" he said. \"An irrational fear, but a fear nonetheless.\"\n\nThe defeat of a gun control bill in the Senate in mid-April, despite months of administration lobbying and President Obama's extensive use of the public \"bully pulpit,\" supports this theory.\n\nNICS checks are not a one-to-one correlation to gun sales, as some checks are performed on active concealed carry permits and other nonsale actions. However, the number of checks is a fairly decent, though imperfect, proxy for the number of guns sold.\n\nThe National Sports Shooting Foundation, the trade group for the guns and ammunition industry, keeps its own adjusted tally every month to account for such checks that don't translate directly into sales. According to Mike Bazinet, a spokesman for the group, low numbers in the middle of the year aren't out of the ordinary.\n\nBy the group's metric, the adjusted June figure of 872,025 is actually an increase of 3 percent over June 2012 and the 37th straight month of year-over-year monthly increases. \"Our retailers are telling us that their firearms inventories are still lean (there are regional variations), although the ammunition shortage seems to be easing somewhat in many parts of the country,\" Mr. Bazinet wrote.\n\nJosh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, cautions against reading too much into any comparisons with figures from December, stating that December is always the biggest month. Year-over-year, he pointed out, the number of checks increased from January through May and were basically flat in June, adjusting for permit checks.\n\n\"Months always vary in a pattern. They vary in the same way,\" he said.\n\nThe decline in NICS checks might signal to some that the issue is fading from the public eye, but President Obama and groups like Mr. Horwitz's have vowed not to let that happen. Immediately after the Newtown shooting, Mr. Obama rolled out an ambitious gun control package that included bans on semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines and near-universal background checks. That package ultimately devolved into a compromise measure that would expand background checks to sales online and at gun shows. Even that measure failed to pass the Senate.\n\nMr. Obama and others, however, have reassured advocates that they will revisit the issue. \"The American people are there,\" Vice President Joseph R. Biden said last month. \"In the meantime, the president is going to continue to take every executive action within his power to make schools safer for our children, churches safe places to worship, and significantly work on reducing the number of gun deaths in America. No matter how long it takes, we're determined to do something about it.\"",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Chief of Staff and Communications Director Depart from Congressional Office Amid Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of departures from her Congressional office, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Chief of Staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, and Communications Director, Corbin Trent, are leaving their roles. Chakrabarti will step down by Friday, while Trent will remain as Congressional spokesman until the end of the month before transitioning to Ocasio-Cortez's 2020 campaign.\n\nChakrabarti will take on a new role as head of New Consensus, a nonprofit climate change group that promotes the Green New Deal. Trent, who has been a controversial figure due to his aggressive tactics, will continue his role in the 2020 campaign as a spokesperson.\n\nThe Intercept first reported the departures, which were later confirmed by The Washington Post. The aides' actions, particularly those of Chakrabarti and Trent, have been criticized for making life difficult for Ocasio-Cortez in Washington.\n\nChakrabarti's controversial remarks, such as his tweet likening moderate Democrats to \"new southern Democrats\" and his criticism of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have been widely criticized. He also drew criticism for his remarks about Rep. Sharice Davids, a Native American Democrat from a formerly red Kansas district, which were seen as racially charged.\n\nTrent's negative press stemmed from his use of profanity in a tweet in June, where he called out a potential Republican challenger. The tweet, which included the F-bomb, generated negative press for Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nBoth aides joined Ocasio-Cortez's team after working on her successful primary campaign, where they were leaders of the Justice Democrats, an insurgent group that aimed to replace Democratic incumbents with progressives. The finances surrounding Justice Democrats have also generated bad press, with three Federal Election Commission complaints filed by conservative groups.\n\nIn a statement, Trent painted a positive picture of his departure, saying, \"We are extraordinarily grateful for his service to advance a bold agenda and improve the lives of the people in NY-14.\" Ocasio-Cortez also expressed her gratitude, stating that Trent was \"shifting to our campaign side so we can work on some ambitious comms projects we've been looking forward to working on.\"",
    " Title: Honduras Signs \"Safe Third Country\" Agreement with U.S., Aiming to Redirect Migrants Seeking Asylum\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - Honduras has entered into a bilateral agreement with the U.S. government that could potentially redirect migrants crossing through the country towards the United States to seek asylum in their home countries or third countries, in the latest move to curb migration from Central America.\n\nThe agreement, announced on Wednesday, follows similar deals signed by El Salvador on September 20 and Guatemala on July 26. The specifics of the implementation of these agreements have yet to be disclosed by the respective governments. (For links to the El Salvador and Guatemala deals, please click on: tmsnrt.rs/2ldjzJI and tmsnrt.rs/2niarEz, respectively.)\n\nA senior U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official, speaking on condition of anonymity, stated that the Honduras deal aims to allow migrants to seek protection as close to their home as possible. The official declined to be named.\n\nThe Trump administration has implemented a rule, announced on July 16, that bars most migrants from gaining U.S. asylum if they did not seek safe haven in a country they transited through first. This rule, which shares similar objectives with the agreements, has faced legal challenges. A federal court initially blocked the rule from taking effect, but the U.S. Supreme Court, on September 11, allowed it to be implemented while the court challenges are ongoing.\n\nThe majority of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border are from the three northern triangle countries, and many present themselves to border officials to request asylum in the United States.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made reducing the growing number of asylum claims, which have led to lengthy backlogs in U.S. immigration courts, a top priority of his administration. The administration has implemented various measures to discourage migrants from applying.\n\nHowever, immigrant advocates argue that sending people seeking refuge back to the region from which they fled, even if not to their home country, violates international commitments intended to protect vulnerable migrants from being returned to danger. The three countries have limited asylum offices that may struggle to handle a large number of claims, they contend.\n\nHonduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez has faced scrutiny over a court filing document related to the upcoming drug trafficking trial in New York of his brother, Juan Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Hernandez. The president has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIn a speech on Wednesday before the UN General Assembly, Hernandez reaffirmed his political reputation, addressing what he called \"smears\" from \"criminals\" and others, without directly referring to the allegations against him.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Outcry Over Justice Department's AP Phone Records Investigation Raises Questions About Attorney General Eric Holder's Future\n\nArticle:\n\nSpeculation is mounting in Washington over whether the ongoing Justice Department investigation into Associated Press phone records could lead to the resignation or dismissal of Attorney General Eric Holder. In a series of comments, political analysts and journalists have suggested that the controversy could be the final straw for Holder, who has been embroiled in numerous controversies throughout his tenure.\n\nJill Lawrence of the National Journal wrote that Holder \"could be the one that finally convinces [President Obama] that it is time to go.\" Esquire blogger Charles Pierce added, \"He should be gone. This moment. Not only is this constitutionally abhorrent, it is politically moronic.\" Dan Kennedy, a journalism professor at Northeastern University, tweeted, \"It is 8:42. The AP phone story broke at 7:50. Why is Eric Holder still attorney general?\"\n\nThe political stakes for the White House are high, with the administration facing multiple controversies, including its handling of the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi and the IRS's investigation of conservative political organizations. \"The rule of three... means the president's credibility is truly on the line right now,\" NBC's First Read observed.\n\nThe controversy over the seizure of the AP's phone records is unique in that it has garnered bipartisan criticism. On Monday, the AP, a highly influential news cooperative that serves print, broadcast, and online news outlets, announced that the Justice Department had secretly obtained two months of phone records for reporters and editors in New York, Washington, and Hartford, Conn. The government seized records for more than 20 separate phone lines that were used by more than 100 reporters in April and May 2012.\n\nAP President and Chief Executive Officer Gary Pruitt wrote to Holder, calling the Justice Department operation a \"massive and unprecedented intrusion\" into how news organizations do their work. \"There can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of telephone communications,\" Mr. Pruitt said.\n\nAt a press conference Tuesday afternoon, Holder said he recused himself from the decision to subpoena the AP's phone records, and that the decision had been made by Deputy Attorney General Jim Cole, who is handling the case. Holder said he stepped aside because he had been interviewed in the investigation into who provided information for a May 7, 2012, AP story about a foiled terror plot that targeted the US. The attorney general said the leak his department was investigating \"put the American people at risk.\"\n\nThe Justice Department released a statement defending its actions, saying, \"We take seriously our obligations to follow all applicable laws, federal regulations, and Department of Justice policies when issuing subpoenas for phone records of media organizations.\u2026 Because we value the freedom of the press, we are always careful and deliberative in seeking to strike the right balance between the public interest in the free flow of information and the public interest in the fair and effective administration of our criminal laws.\"\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued a statement, saying, \"I am very troubled by these allegations and want to hear the government's explanation.\"\n\nOn Monday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney issued a statement distancing the White House from the investigation. \"We are not involved in decisions made in connection with criminal investigations, as those matters are handled independently by the Justice Department.\" On Tuesday, however, he offered Holder some support: \"The president has confidence in the attorney general.\"\n\nWhen Holder was asked about his future last month on the Tom Joyner Morning Show, he responded, \"I don't know,\" when asked if he would stay the full four years of Obama's second term. He added, \"I'm happy. I'm still enjoying what I'm doing and still want to be done. I'm still the president's wing man, and I'm here with my boy.\"",
    " Title: Ted Cruz Announces Carly Fiorina as Vice Presidential Running Mate Amidst 2016 Republican Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising move, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz announced former GOP primary rival Carly Fiorina as his choice for vice president on Wednesday, amidst the ongoing 2016 race. The announcement, made in the critical primary state of Indiana, was met with immediate skepticism from the Trump campaign, who labeled it as a sign of desperation.\n\nCruz, while acknowledging the early announcement as \"unusual,\" defended the decision, stating that \"nobody is getting to 1,237 delegates,\" the number needed to clinch the nomination, and voters should \"know what [they] will get.\"\n\n\"After a great deal of time and thought, after a great deal of consideration and prayer, I have come to the conclusion that if I am nominated to be president of the United States that I will run on a ticket with my vice presidential nominee, Carly Fiorina,\" Cruz said.\n\nThe potential pairing, if successful, would offer the possibility of electing the first Hispanic president and the first female vice president. Fiorina, in accepting Cruz's offer, expressed her readiness to \"fight.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve had tough fights all my life,\" Fiorina said. \"Tough fights don\u2019t worry me a bit.\"\n\nCruz's selection of a vice presidential candidate in April, while he is well behind in delegates, follows a pattern of somewhat unconventional campaigning, including an early embrace of Trump and kicking off his campaign without first forming an exploratory committee.\n\nFiorina, who began her career as a secretary and receptionist, quickly rose up the business ranks and was named in 1999 as the chief executive officer for Hewlett-Packard, becoming the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 company. Her tenure at HP, however, drew criticism for alleged deals with Iran and the laying off of 30,000 employees.\n\nFiorina's career as a political candidate began when she tried to unseat California Sen. Barbara Boxer during an unsuccessful 2010 bid. Boxer, in response to the pairing, mocked the suggestion, stating, \"The best way to describe that ticket is mean and meaner.\"\n\nWhile most presidential candidates wait until they have the nomination sewn up to announce a running mate, Cruz's selection of a vice presidential candidate in April, while he is well behind in delegates, follows a pattern of somewhat unconventional campaigning. The battle for the GOP nomination continues, with Trump leading Cruz in pledged delegates, 954-562. The Republican Convention is scheduled for July.",
    " Title: Education Secretary Arne Duncan Urges Action on Gun Violence, Calls for Restrictions on High-Powered Firearms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a poignant speech at Washington D.C.'s Neval Thomas Elementary School on Friday, Education Secretary Arne Duncan called for a united front among school leaders, politicians, Second Amendment advocates, and others to address the issue of gun violence in America.\n\n\"I ask, I beg, and I plead - let us make real and rapid progress on that front,\" Mr. Duncan said, emphasizing the need for personal involvement in the matter.\n\nMr. Duncan, a member of President Obama's task force on gun violence and mental health, spoke publicly for the first time since the tragic shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, last week. He highlighted the complex factors that led shooter Adam Lanza to take 26 lives at Sandy Hook Elementary School, but emphasized that limiting access to high-powered firearms remains the simplest and easiest solution.\n\n\"I can't help but wonder what he might have done, how this might have been different, if he didn't have access to those guns,\" Mr. Duncan reflected, recalling his experience with gun violence during his tenure as chief of Chicago public schools.\n\n\"Maybe he just would've been punching his pillow, and his mother would still be there...and there would be 26 families in Newtown, Connecticut, who would be celebrating the holidays instead of attending funerals. Unfortunately, it's too late for them, but it's not too late for America,\" he added.\n\nMr. Duncan's address coincided with the National Rifle Association's first press conference since the Newtown massacre, an anticipated event that will provide insights into the potential challenges for gun-control proponents in enacting stricter laws. Advocates now seek a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban, the closing of the so-called \"gun show loophole,\" and limits to high-capacity ammunition clips, similar to those used by Lanza at Sandy Hook.\n\n\"Reasonable people should be able to agree on these restrictions,\" Mr. Duncan concluded.",
    " Title: Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing: A Study in Contrasts and Hypocrisy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday was a complex and contradictory event, showcasing both progress and regression in the American political landscape. The hearing, which featured the testimonies of Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett Kavanaugh, highlighted the evolving roles of women in politics, as well as the enduring challenges they face.\n\nOn one hand, the Republican senators displayed a level of respect towards Dr. Ford, hiring a female prosecutor to question her and largely avoiding the derogatory language that marred Anita Hill's testimony in 1991. However, the hearing also felt strikingly outdated, with a woman's emotional testimony often overshadowed by the righteous indignation of a white man.\n\nDr. Ford came across as deferential, nervous, and deeply concerned with accuracy. Her testimony was specific and poignant, detailing the impact the alleged assault had on her life, including installing a second front door on her house due to her post-traumatic anxiety. Judge Kavanaugh, on the other hand, was portrayed as an angry and bullying figure, prone to yelling, weeping, and exploiting political anger.\n\nThe Republican senators' self-presentation was oddly tense, carefully avoiding the appearance of grilling Dr. Ford. They called her \"credible\" and even complimented her appearance, but showed little interest in her testimony. The hearing was, as Chairman Chuck Grassley put it, a mere courtesy.\n\nThe hollowness of the proceedings put a fine point on our new political reality. The norms have changed, and even the Republican party has realized it can't score points by personally attacking sexual assault victims. However, the party is still able to indulge in hypocrisy, pretending to respect Dr. Ford's words without acknowledging their impact on Kavanaugh's nomination.\n\nThe cracks in the right's approach are showing, though. The most telling moment came a day later, on Friday, when two sexual assault survivors emotionally confronted Senator Jeff Flake in an elevator. This raw and painful encounter revealed the real power of women's voices, and it prompted Flake to call for an FBI investigation.\n\nThe Kavanaugh affair is, as we all know, about much more than a US Supreme Court seat; it is a referendum on the political power of women. And as dark as the hearing was, Friday's turn of events offered a bracing reminder: The right knows it has a woman problem. It may not want to listen to the voices on its threshold, but they are only getting louder.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Alters U Visa Policy, Increasing Deportation Risk for Immigrants Cooperating with Criminal Investigations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has implemented a new policy regarding U visas, a class of visa granted to immigrants who cooperate with criminal investigations. The change allows for the potential deportation of immigrants while they are waiting for their U visas, a move that immigration attorneys argue will discourage immigrants from reporting serious crimes and reflects the administration's broader efforts to deport as many immigrants as possible from the United States.\n\nThe revised Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) directive, released on Aug. 2, allows ICE to grant permission for people to stay in the country as they await their U visas. However, it also permits ICE to deport pending U visa applicants at its discretion.\n\nApplications for U visas can take up to four years to process, and the government issues 10,000 per year, with no limit on the number of visas that can be issued to spouses and children of applicants or to parents of applicants who are themselves under 21. The directive reserves the right for ICE to \"review the totality of the circumstances, including any favorable or adverse factors, and any federal interest (s) implicated and decide whether a Stay of Removal or terminating proceedings is appropriate.\"\n\nICE states in the directive that it will \"exercise its discretion\" in determining whether to grant stay of removal requests, but cautions that the agency \"no longer exempts classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.\"\n\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588, an ICE spokesperson defended the change as necessary due to the volume of applications. \"As the number of U visa petitions submitted increased, this process became burdensome on both agencies and such determinations didn\u2019t reflect a qualitative assessment of any assistance provided to law enforcement,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nImmigration attorneys argue that the new directive will have a chilling effect on immigrants who are victims of crimes and are seeking protection. Eileen Blessinger, a Falls Church, Va.-based immigration attorney, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the new directive will make immigrants less likely to report crimes because \"by applying, you\u2019re essentially reporting yourself to ICE but now there\u2019s a risk that ICE might pick you up.\"\n\nCecelia Friedman Levin, senior policy counsel at ASISTA Immigration Assistance, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the new ICE policies impacting the U visa program contravene the purpose that Congress created these protections for. \"What we see here with new ICE policies that impact the U visa program is that some of these changes really contravene the purpose that Congress created these protections for,\" she said.\n\nKristian Ramos, communications director at the immigrant advocacy group Define American, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the change was indicative of the administration's general handling of long-standing immigration policy. \"This administration's reckless changing of long-standing laws has very human casualties,\" Ramos said.\n\nThe new policy has already had real-world consequences for some immigrants. Blessinger told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that her firm had a client who had been deported twice before whose daughter was a victim of child sexual abuse and who had cooperated with the investigation. The man was able to file for a U visa, which was eventually approved, and will be able to stay in the United States and continue to cooperate with the sexual abuse investigation. If he had applied for the U visa under the terms of the new ICE directive, however, he could have been deported.\n\nAnother of Blessinger's clients is a Salvadoran immigrant and victim of domestic violence who came to the U.S. in 2004 and has been detained in Caroline Detention Facility in Fort A.P. Hill, Va. after failing to appear in court in El Paso, Texas, after receiving a notice to appear that Blessinger said did not include her hearing's date or time. \"She missed the court hearing and got a deportation order and the motion to reopen was denied, but while it was pending we were able to get U visa certification signed off saying she was a victim of domestic violence and cooperated with the investigation,\" Blessinger told \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"She\u2019s not a criminal, she\u2019s someone that in the past would be released on an ankle bracelet.\"\n\nThe U visa was created in 2000 by a bipartisan majority in Congress with two important purposes: to be a tool for law enforcement to investigate or prosecute criminal activity, and to provide protection for immigrant survivors in coming forward and seeking protection. The new ICE directive, however, has raised concerns that it will make it more difficult for immigrants to seek protection and cooperate with law enforcement, potentially leading to an increase in unreported crimes and a decrease in the number of immigrants who are able to seek protection.",
    " Title: California Teacher Tenure Ruled Unconstitutional: Implications for Education Reform and Future Litigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a landmark ruling, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Rolfe Treu declared California's teacher tenure rules unconstitutional on Tuesday, citing the state's failure to provide equal education opportunities for all students. The ruling, which is subject to an inevitable appeal, could have far-reaching implications for education reform and potential litigation in other states.\n\nThe case, Vergara v California, centers around the employment protections afforded to K-12 teachers, often characterized as due process. These protections make it difficult for school officials to dismiss teachers based on performance, and compensation schemes are typically linked to seniority. The ruling, however, found that California's teacher tenure system violates constitutional equality guarantees, as it disproportionately affects minority students by housing ineffective teachers in heavily minority schools.\n\nTeachers unions, predictably, contest the ruling, with many liberals viewing the anti-tenure movement as a thinly-veiled union-busting tactic. Conversely, education reformers, who typically advocate for performance-based compensation and job security, view the ruling as a step towards a more equitable education system.\n\nThe legal logic behind the ruling is noteworthy, as it employs a disparate impact theory, a left-wing approach to anti-discrimination policy that is often met with skepticism by conservatives. The specifics of the case revolve around the difficulty of transitioning from the general idea of merit-based employment decisions to the need for specific operational rules.\n\nReformers favor using value-added models, which track student test scores and measure teacher performance based on student progress. Critics argue that these models are unstable and unreliable, and that test-based incentive programs may lead to cheating and \"teaching to the test.\" Proponents, however, point to the correlation between teacher performance and adult life outcomes, such as college attendance, socioeconomic status, and retirement savings.\n\nFor now, the ruling has no immediate consequences, as Treu issued a \"tentative decision\" in anticipation of appeal. The case will be appealed to the California Supreme Court, and if that court rules in favor of the plaintiffs, there will be significant changes in California education. If not, the status quo will remain.\n\nCalifornia is just one of 50 states, and the success of this lawsuit could encourage reform groups to file similar litigation in other states. Expect more education-related litigation in the near future.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney Reflects on His Presidential Campaign and the State of the Nation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, discussed his campaign, the state of the nation, and the differences between the America he saw in 2008 and the one he sees now.\n\nRomney, who is set to clinch the nomination on Tuesday in Texas, reflected on his campaign's upward momentum, attributing it to an increased sense among voters that the country is on the wrong path and a growing sense that he has proven himself. \"We went through those 37 or 38 contests and won the must-win states,\" Romney said. \"In some cases we started off 10 points behind. And we hustled, worked hard, and convinced the voters.\"\n\nThe economic downturn, which had not occurred during his 2008 primary, is now the central issue, with a \"much higher degree of anxiety\" among voters today, Romney said. He is struck by the number of people who are employed but in legitimate fear of being let go and by the number of people who have made investments for their retirement and seen them go down.\n\nBefore rallies and town meetings, Romney always tries to have private, off-the-record meetings with voters. He sits down with five or six couples or individuals and asks them to tell him about their lives. The stories he hears suggest a degree of anxiety that is not reflected in the statistics.\n\nRomney keeps a campaign journal on his iPad, writing every two or three days to remember what it was like and to capture \"the feelings\u2014the ups, the downs, the people I meet and the sense I have about what's going to happen.\" He writes to reflect on the campaign and to capture the feelings of the people he meets.\n\nWhen asked about his feelings towards politics, Romney said, \"What I love are the political rallies and town meetings. I love the interchange with individuals that are probing and pushing.\" He added, \"I like competition, and I think the game is like a sport for old guys. I mean, you know, I can't compete in competitive sports very well, but I can compete in politics, and there's the\u2014what was the old ABC 'Wide World of Sports' slogan? 'The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.' The only difference is victory is still a thrill, but I do not feel agony in loss.\"\n\nRomney was asked about his mood and whether he wakes up in a good mood or has to work his way into it. \"Depends on the day,\" he said. \"Depends on the issue.\" He added, \"The only time I'm unhappy is if I've done something that hurt the prospects for the success of our effort.\"\n\nWhen asked for an example of a mistake he regrets, Romney mentioned his \"I like to be able to fire people\" comment. He explained that he meant those, such as health-insurance companies, that provide inadequate services. \"I have to think not only about what I say in a full sentence but what I say in a phrase,\" he said. \"In the current media environment, you will be taken out of context, you'll be clipped, and you'll be battered with things you said.\"\n\nRomney believes we are in a unique time in American history, a \"different time than any other time before it.\" He believes the country is at an inflection point, where the course of the nation has changed, and that the outcome of the election will determine whether the country will continue on a path towards government dominance or return to economic vitality. \"I think America is going to decide whether we will put ourself on a path toward Europe\u2014whether we will become another nation dominated by government, where citizens are dependent on government for the things they want in life, where opportunity is sacrificed, where military strength is depleted to pay for government promises, where unemployment is chronically high and wage growth chronically low,\" Romney said. \"That, in my view, is the course the president has put us upon.\" If Barack Obama is re-elected, Romney believes it will be very difficult to get off that path. If he is elected, he promises \"a period of economic vitality\" that will leave the world \"surprised.\" Not only the world, but \"America is going to see a vitality we had not expected.\"",
    " Title: Inspector General Report Finds Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe Lacked Candor, Violated FBI Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a damning report released on Friday, the Justice Department's inspector general found that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had improperly leaked information to a reporter and lied to both his superior, then-Director James Comey, and to FBI agents investigating his behavior. The report could potentially harm McCabe's credibility and ongoing investigations.\n\nThe report, which had been circulating within the government for weeks, was used to justify McCabe's firing earlier this year, just days before he was set to retire and collect his pension. The inspector general's report concluded that McCabe lacked candor, including under oath, on multiple occasions in connection with describing his role in connection with a disclosure to the Wall Street Journal. This conduct, the report found, violated FBI Offense Codes 2.5 and 2.6.\n\nThe report also revealed that McCabe authorized leaks to a Wall Street Journal reporter while trying to shape the narrative surrounding his role in the investigation into Hillary Clinton's secret emails. The 2016 leak confirmed the existence of an investigation into the Clinton Foundation, a probe the FBI had avoided confirming. The leak was deemed inappropriate because it was done \"to advance his personal interests,\" the audit found.\n\nIn addition, McCabe lied to Mr. Comey, then to FBI agents and the inspector general in May and July 2017. In a follow-up interview late last year, he \"contradicted his prior statements,\" the audit concluded.\n\nThe report also delved into several other thorny issues of the 2016 campaign, including an Aug. 12, 2016, call to McCabe from a high-ranking Justice Department official who complained that the FBI's investigation into the Clinton Foundation was too \"overt,\" particularly in the middle of a presidential campaign.\n\nThe justice official, who was not named in the report, confirmed the general tenor of the call to investigators, but denied he was trying to pressure the FBI to stop the probe.\n\nThe report is likely to fuel President Trump's complaints about the FBI, the special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into his own behavior and that of his 2016 campaign, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing Mr. Mueller.\n\nThe new report is expected to fuel President Trump's ongoing disinformation campaign, according to Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. The report justifies McCabe's firing, according to Rep. Trey Gowdy, Republican South Carolina and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The report is also expected to fuel the House Judiciary Committee's ongoing investigation into the FBI's decisions related to the 2016 election.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, argued that McCabe's actions should be viewed in the context of him trying to defend himself and his wife \"against false press reports.\" She also criticized the timing of McCabe's firing, stating that it casts a \"tremendous shadow over the integrity of this process.\"\n\nNeither the FBI nor the Justice Department had a comment on the report.",
    " Title: Bloomberg News Imposes Restrictive Policy on Presidential Campaign Investigations Amidst Founder's Presidential Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and raised questions about journalistic independence, Bloomberg News, the global news service founded by Michael Bloomberg, has issued an edict to its staff, prohibiting investigations into the former New York mayor's presidential campaign and that of his Democratic competitors.\n\nThe policy, announced by editor-in-chief John Micklethwait, states that \"We will continue our tradition of not investigating Mike (and his family and foundation)\" and extends this prohibition to his Democratic rivals. This decision has been met with criticism, as it appears to favor Bloomberg while potentially disadvantaging his opponents, including Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and others.\n\nThe policy has been a point of contention within the organization, with some former employees expressing their dissatisfaction. Kathy Kiely, former political editor, resigned in 2016 due to the same policy when Bloomberg was considering a presidential run. She stated, \"I felt that we were not able to follow this story aggressively, and that I thought compromised us as an organization.\" Megan Murphy, Bloomberg's former Washington bureau chief, called the policy \"ridiculous\" and \"not journalism.\"\n\nThe policy also affects Bloomberg Opinion, with top editors Tim O'Brien and David Shipley taking leaves to join the Bloomberg campaign. The editorial board has been suspended, and the section will refuse to publish any outside op-ed on the 2020 campaign.\n\nDespite the restrictions, Bloomberg News has assigned a reporter to cover the campaign, writing about speeches, policies, and polls. The initial story on the launch described the candidate as offering a \"mix of moderate policy stances and experience in business, government, and philanthropy as the way to beat President Donald Trump.\"\n\nMicklethwait defends the policy, stating that he doesn't want to lay down too many rules, allowing for flexibility in changing circumstances. He also notes that if Bloomberg wins the nomination, they will reassess the situation.\n\nThis situation recalls the era of William Randolph Hearst using his newspapers to promote his 1904 presidential bid. However, Bloomberg's company dwarfs Hearst's early 20th-century enterprise.\n\nOther media companies examine their owners or corporate parents with little fuss, reporting on figures like Jeff Bezos and Amazon, Disney, and CNN's corporate ties. It remains to be seen how this short-sighted move will impact Bloomberg News' reputation for journalistic independence.",
    " Title: An Analysis of Political Tribalism: A Look at the Reinvention of Maxine Waters and the Ongoing Divide in American Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the complex world of American politics, two recent articles have shed light on the deep-rooted issue of political tribalism. The first, published by The Daily Beast, delves into the transformation of Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a figure once labeled as one of the nation's \"most corrupt.\" The second, a column by Dennis Prager titled \"Why Conservatives Still Attack Trump,\" attempts to unravel the reasons behind the persistent resistance from many Republicans towards President Trump.\n\nBeginning with Waters, the article highlights her recent standing ovations following her sharp attacks on Trump. This development not only exposes the hypocrisy of those who claim to resist Trump on constitutional and ethical grounds but also serves as a warning against aligning oneself with individuals who disregard the norms they claim to uphold.\n\nThe article further criticizes those who advocate for overturning the Citizens United ruling and allowing the state to ban political speech, arguing that they have little basis for lecturing about free expression. Similarly, it questions the integrity of those who, in the past, have proposed abandoning Fifth Amendment protections to confiscate guns or whose opposition to spying on American citizens is contingent on the sitting president.\n\nThe article then turns to the ongoing anti-Trump sentiment, suggesting that it reduces political discourse to a simple dichotomy of \"Never Trump\" versus \"Always Trump,\" which the author argues is detrimental to the democratic process. The author criticizes the hysterical response to Trump's actions, particularly in relation to the Paris Agreement, and argues that this response undermines the traditional checks and balances of American governance.\n\nIn the second article, Dennis Prager addresses the persisting resistance from conservatives towards Trump. Prager argues that this resistance stems from a lack of understanding that the survival of the United States hinges on a set of ideals and laws, not on the competence of the Trump administration. He encourages Republicans to \"please report for duty,\" urging them to support the president for the greater good, while acknowledging the president's flaws.\n\nPrager's column also addresses the issue of political tribalism, arguing that there are a few reasons why some conservatives remain anti-Trump. He suggests that the primary reason is the lack of recognition of the ongoing civil war in the United States, with the survival of the country at stake.\n\nHowever, the article questions Prager's assertion, suggesting that if the survival of the United States hinges on the Trump administration's competence, then the civil war is already lost. If, on the other hand, it hinges on a set of ideals and laws, then there is no obligation to follow any individual, even the president.\n\nIn conclusion, both articles highlight the deep-rooted issue of political tribalism in the United States, with each side presenting compelling arguments for their respective positions. The articles serve as a reminder of the importance of upholding the democratic process, respecting the Constitution, and recognizing the flaws in both political parties. It is a call for Americans to move beyond tribalism and work towards a more unified and functional political system.",
    " Title: Hong Kong International Airport Canceled Flights Amidst Ongoing Pro-Democracy Protests, Chinese Authorities Label Protests as \"Beginning to Show the Sprouts of Terrorism\"\n\nArticle:\n\nHong Kong International Airport, one of the world's busiest airports, suspended all flights on Monday following a large-scale demonstration by pro-democracy protesters occupying the main terminal. Chinese authorities have likened the protest to \"terrorism.\"\n\nAccording to an official statement, the protests \"seriously disrupted\" airport operations. Only flights that were already boarding or had been cleared for landing were allowed to use the airport's runways. All other flights were canceled.\n\nThe ongoing protests in Hong Kong, which have been ongoing for over two months, have called for democratic reforms and an investigation into police conduct. The city's government, which is supposed to operate independently from communist China's influence, introduced an extradition bill that critics argue would threaten the liberties granted to the city and allow for extradition to mainland China.\n\nThe bill was temporarily suspended following protests, but the demonstrations have evolved from a specific focus on the extradition proposal to a broader demand for greater freedoms and a check on the perceived use of excessive force by authorities.\n\nOn Monday, China used the strongest language yet to condemn the protesters, with the Cabinet's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office in Beijing stating that the protests are \"beginning to show the sprouts of terrorism\" and constitute an \"existential threat\" to the population of Hong Kong.\n\n\"One must take resolute action toward this violent criminality, showing no leniency or mercy,\" said a statement from spokesperson Yang Guang. \"Hong Kong has reached an inflection point where all those who are concerned about Hong Kong's future must say 'no,' to lawbreakers and 'no' to those engaged in violence.\"\n\nEarlier on Monday, Hong Kong police displayed water cannons that could potentially be used in future demonstrations. Amnesty International has warned that the misuse of these cannons within the densely-populated city's confined spaces could lead to serious injuries.\n\nHong Kong is a former British colony that has been part of China since 1997, but benefits from autonomy under a \"one country, two systems\" approach. This structure allows the city certain democratic rights that are not afforded to people on the mainland, but in recent years, some people have accused the Communist Party-ruled central government of gradually eroding their freedoms.\n\nPolitical scientist Ma Ngok at the Chinese University of Hong Kong told the South China Morning Post that heavy-handed tactics from police have alienated the population.\n\n\"They have lost confidence in the police enforcing the law fairly and would question the legitimacy of all their actions,\" he said. \"They no longer think it's reasonable to blindly obey the law when there is no punishment for the officers' wrongdoings.\"",
    " Title: Iowa's Democratic Primary: A Closer Look at the Competition Between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses, two prominent Democratic candidates, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have been garnering significant support at rallies held at the Iowa State Fair. Both candidates share similar progressive ideologies, advocating for universal healthcare, taking on Wall Street, and raising the minimum wage.\n\nHowever, the question on many voters' minds is whether the presence of two popular progressives could potentially split the vote on the left, benefiting a centrist candidate such as former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nSherma Mather, a 50-year-old visitor from Richmond, Virginia, expressed her concerns, stating, \"Of course it concerns me.\" Early opinion polls have consistently shown Biden in the lead, with either Sanders or Warren in second place.\n\nThe combined support for Sanders and Warren surpasses Biden's, which some progressives argue indicates a shift towards the left within the Democratic Party. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, an advocacy group that supports Warren, described the two as a \"1-2 punch\" with a \"gravitational pull\" on the rest of the field.\n\nTwenty-four Democrats are currently competing for the party's nomination, with the Iowa caucuses still six months away. Sanders and Warren have maintained that they are friends, not rivals, and have thus far avoided criticizing each other.\n\nRecent polls show Warren gaining ground in Iowa, with 21% of the vote in a Monmouth University poll, trailing Biden by just seven percentage points. Sanders, on the other hand, has dropped to 9% in the state, according to the same poll. Sanders' campaign advisers have criticized the poll's methodology, claiming that his supporters were undersampled.\n\nNationally, the situation is more favorable for Sanders, with the most recent \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll showing Sanders in second place by a wide margin over Warren.\n\nAlexis Johnson, a 33-year-old resident of Des Moines, expressed her support for Sanders, stating, \"It's going to Bernie or Biden, I feel like.\" However, Misty Cornelius, a 38-year-old Des Moines resident, expressed a preference for Warren, stating, \"Bernie has been stigmatized. Warren is a fresh face.\"\n\nDespite their similar ideologies, Warren and Sanders present distinct personas on the campaign trail. Warren, drawing upon her working-class roots, positions herself as a sort of prairie populist, while Sanders talks more in terms of leading a \"movement.\"\n\nPatrick Murray, the polling director at Monmouth, noted that while there is ideological overlap, Warren's recent surge has her pulling support away from virtually every other candidate, not just Sanders. Sanders' campaign, on the other hand, views Biden as their primary challenge, as both are courting the same working-class and union voters who gravitated towards Trump in 2016.\n\nBiden's status as a front-runner has been somewhat undermined by several gaffes, including a controversial remark about poor kids being just as bright and talented as white kids.\n\nU.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California ranks third in the state in the Monmouth poll with 11% support. After Iowa, Sanders and Warren will face off in New Hampshire, which holds the first Democratic primary later in February.\n\nBoth Sanders and Warren's campaigns are focused on convincing large swaths of voters that a progressive Democrat can win the election against Trump, according to the Progressive Change Campaign Committee's Green. \"Many'electability voters' are parked in Joe Biden's column,\" Green said, \"but that perception is changing.\"",
    " Title: Trump, Kudlow Dismiss Recession Concerns, Maintain Optimistic Outlook on Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of interviews over the weekend, President Donald Trump and his top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, expressed optimism about the U.S. economy, downplaying concerns of a potential recession. The comments come after a steep drop in the financial markets last week.\n\nPresident Trump told reporters as he returned to Washington from his New Jersey golf club that he does not believe the country is heading towards a recession. \"I don't think we're having a recession,\" Trump said. \"We're doing tremendously well. Our consumers are rich. I gave a tremendous tax cut and they're loaded up with money.\"\n\nKudlow, who also played down fears of a looming recession, predicted the economy will perform well in the second half of 2019. In Sunday television interviews, he said that consumers are seeing higher wages and are able to spend and save more. \"No, I don't see a recession,\" Kudlow said. \"We're doing pretty darn well in my judgment. Let's not be afraid of optimism.\"\n\nThe strong economy is crucial to Trump's reelection prospects. Consumer confidence has dropped 6.4% since July. The president has spent most of the week at his golf club in New Jersey, with much of his tweeting focused on talking up the economy.\n\nKudlow acknowledged a slowing energy sector, but said low interest rates will help housing, construction, and auto sales. He also defended the president's use of tariffs on goods coming from China. Before he joined the administration, Kudlow was known for opposing tariffs and promoting free trade during his career as an economic analyst. Kudlow said Trump has taught him and others that the \"China story has to be changed and reformed.\"\n\n\"We can not let China pursue these unfair and unreciprocal trading practices,\" Kudlow said.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke said the U.S. needed to work with allies to hold China accountable on trade. He expressed concerns that Trump's trade war could drive the global economy into a recession.\n\n\"This current trade war that the president has entered our country into is not working,\" O'Rourke said. \"It is hammering the hell out of farmers across this country.\"\n\nLast month, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark rate \u2013 which affects many loans for households and businesses \u2013 by a quarter-point to a range of 2% to 2.25%. It's the first rate cut since December 2008 during the depths of the Great Recession. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressed that the Fed was worried about the consequences of Trump's trade war and sluggish economies overseas.\n\n\"Weak global growth and trade tensions are having an effect on the U.S. economy,\" he said.\n\nBreaking with historical norms, Trump has been highly critical of Powell, placing blame for any economic weakness on the nation's central bank for raising interest rates too much over the past two years.\n\nPeter Navarro, who advises Trump on trade policy, shared that sentiment. \"The Federal Reserve chairman should look in the mirror and say, 'I raised rates too far, too fast, and I cost this economy a full percentage point of growth,'\" Navarro said.\n\nNavarro also said that U.S. consumers are not affected by the administration's trade war with China, though tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. importers, not by China, and are often passed along to U.S. businesses and consumers through higher prices. Kudlow himself told Fox in May that U.S. consumers and businesses ultimately end up paying the tariffs that the administration imposes on billions of dollars of Chinese goods.\n\nTrump acknowledged at least a potential impact when he paused a planned 10% tariff hike for many items coming from China, such as cellphones, laptops, video game consoles, some toys, computer monitors, shoes, and clothing. \"We're doing (it) just for the Christmas season, just in case some of the tariffs could have an impact,\" the president told reporters in New Jersey.\n\nNavarro would not go even that far, saying Sunday \"there's no evidence whatsoever that Americans consumers are bearing any of this.\"\n\nKudlow was interviewed on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and \"Fox News Sunday.\" O'Rourke spoke on NBC, and Navarro appeared on CNN's \"State of the Union\" and CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nTrump's trade war with China has been a target of criticism by Democrats vying to challenge him in 2020. \"There is clearly no strategy for dealing with the trade war in a way that will actually lead to results for American farmers or American consumers,\" said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, a Democratic presidential candidate. He said on CNN that it was \"a fool's errand\" to think tariff increases will compel China to change its economic approach.",
    " Title: Justice Department Seeks Stay of Court Order on Emergency Contraceptive Access for Minors\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, the Justice Department will appear before a federal judge on Tuesday, aiming to suspend a recent ruling that would make emergency contraceptives available to teenage girls without a prescription in the coming days.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Edward Korman of New York has set a new timeline for his order to make the morning-after pill Plan B One-Step available to all ages, with the implementation delayed until Friday, five days later than the initially cited Monday.\n\nIn a letter, Judge Korman has granted the plaintiffs until Monday to formally respond to the notice of appeal the Justice Department filed earlier this week. The ongoing debate over minors' access to the morning-after pill is testing the loyalty of groups traditionally among the biggest supporters of President Obama.\n\nIn 2011, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius decided to maintain age restrictions on the pill, a decision that women's rights groups have criticized. They argue that access to emergency contraception is suitable for all ages.\n\nPro-life groups, who typically criticize the Democratic president, have welcomed the decision to fight Judge Korman's ruling, although they are not entirely satisfied with the FDA's decision on Tuesday to allow girls as young as 15 to obtain the drug without a prescription, a change from the prior age limit of 17.\n\nThe Obama administration asserts that the FDA's lowering of the age is due to an application from the pill's maker, Teva Women's Health Inc., and is not related to the pending federal case. However, attorneys from Justice have noted the 15-year-old threshold now covers all the girls involved in the case, a move the plaintiffs' attorneys find suspicious.\n\nJudge Korman has indicated he will give the government two opportunities to halt his ruling's implementation. \"The parties are also advised that, in the event that I deny a stay pending appeal, I will grant a stay to allow the defendants to seek a stay from the Court of Appeals,\" his letter said."
