    " Title: Federal Judge Orders Hillary Clinton to Answer Written Questions About Email Server Use\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal judge has ruled that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton must answer written questions from the conservative legal group Judicial Watch regarding her use of a private email server while in office. The ruling comes as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit that Judicial Watch is pursuing against the State Department.\n\nJudge Emmet Sullivan wrote that Judicial Watch has failed to demonstrate that it cannot obtain the discovery it seeks through other means, such as interrogatories. He gave the group until October 14 to provide Clinton with the questions, and she has 30 days to answer them.\n\nJudicial Watch President Tom Fitton stated, \"We will move quickly to get these answers. The decision is a reminder that Hillary Clinton is not above the law.\"\n\nLast month, after completing his investigation of Clinton's private server, FBI Director James Comey recommended no charges against Clinton for mishandling classified information, despite reprimanding her for being \"extremely careless\" in using a private server.\n\nJudicial Watch, which has pursued Clinton and her husband in court for years, insists she has never answered why a private server was used in the first place. Last week, Judicial Watch released 44 previously undisclosed Clinton email exchanges that she failed to include among 30,000 private messages she turned over to the government last year.\n\nThese email exchanges cover Clinton's first three months as secretary of state in early 2009, a period for which Clinton did not turn over any emails to the State Department last year. The government found the newly disclosed messages during a search of agency computer files from her top aide, Huma Abedin.\n\nWhile Judicial Watch argued that only Clinton could testify about the reasons behind her decision to set up a private server, the judge said it is possible for Clinton to offer her \"unique, first-hand knowledge\" of the basis for the server in writing.\n\n\"Judicial Watch's argument that a deposition is preferable in this case because of the ability to ask follow-up questions is not persuasive,\" the judge wrote. \"Given the extensive public record related to the clintonemail.com system, a record which Judicial Watch has acknowledged, Judicial Watch will be able to anticipate many follow-up questions.\"",
    " Title: Vatican-Reviewed Journal Criticizes Evangelical and Catholic Allies of President Trump for \"Theocratic\" Worldview and \"Apocalyptic Geopolitics\"\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent article in the Vatican-reviewed journal La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica has criticized evangelical and Catholic allies of President Donald Trump for promoting a \"theocratic\" worldview and practicing \"apocalyptic geopolitics.\" The article, authored by two confidants of Pope Francis, accused these voters of coming together over a \"xenophobic and Islamophobic vision that wants walls and purifying deportations.\"\n\nThe authors of the article, who are close to Pope Francis, wrote that the \"panorama of threats to their understanding of the American way of life have included modernist spirits, the black civil rights movement, the hippy movement, communism, feminist movements, and so on.\" They further stated, \"And now in our day there are the migrants and the Muslims.\"\n\nSpecifically mentioned in the article was Trump's top White House strategist Steve Bannon, who the authors said wants a country where citizens submit to the Bible, which they called an idea \"that is no different from the one that inspires Islamic fundamentalism.\"\n\nThe authors contrasted Trump supporters' visions with that of Pope Francis, who they praised for spreading a peaceful worldview. \"Francis is carrying forward a systematic counter-narration with respect to the narrative of fear,\" the two wrote. \"Francis is courageous here and gives no theological-political legitimacy to terrorists, avoiding any reduction of Islam to Islamic terrorism,\" they continued. \"Nor does he give it to those who postulate and want a 'holy war' or to build barrier-fences crowned with barbed wire.\"\n\nThe \"barrier-fence\" reference seems a clear swipe at another Trump proposal to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Trump met with Pope Francis in May at the Vatican, where he presented Francis with first-edition copies of books written by Martin Luther King Jr. In February, Francis famously criticized Trump, appearing to say Trump was not a Christian due to his stance on the proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. \"To not respond to evil with evil. To defeat evil with good, the offense with forgiveness. A Christian would never say \u2018 you will pay for that. \u2019 Never,\" Francis said in February. \"That is not a Christian gesture,\" he added. \"An offense you overcome with forgiveness. To live in peace with everyone.\"",
    " Title: Pope Francis Named Time Magazine's Person of the Year: A Look at His Impact on the Church and the World\n\nArticle:\n\nPope Francis, whose real name is Jorge Mario Bergoglio, has been named Time Magazine's Person of the Year, further highlighting his significant impact on the Catholic Church and the world in a short span of nine months.\n\nOne of the iconic moments of Francis' historic papacy was when a boy walked onto the stage where he was speaking, hugged the pope, inspected his pectoral cross, and sat on the papal throne. This incident, among others, reveals the genuine character of Francis, who wants his church to serve, not strut.\n\nFrancis' public gestures, such as kissing disfigured visitors, lofting newborns, and washing the feet of prisoners, may have been staged, but they demonstrate the pope's desire for the church to focus on service rather than self-aggrandizement.\n\nThe pope's concern for the poor, a key aspect of his papacy given his Latin American origin, has been a source of misunderstanding. In his first solo papal exhortation, Evangelii Gaudium, Francis was quoted as criticizing capitalist economies. However, a closer reading reveals that his complaint is about the pursuit of wealth as a competing religion, a sentiment that many parents would likely share.\n\nBefore the exhortation, Francis caused a stir when he acknowledged that the Church, particularly the American Catholic Church, had overemphasized issues like abortion, homosexuality, and the ordination of women priests. This statement was misconstrued as an embrace of gay marriage, abortion on demand, and female priests, but Francis remains opposed to these practices.\n\nFrancis' beliefs can be summarized as a call for the church to focus on helping people, to care for the sick, disfigured, and war victims, and to challenge tradition when necessary. He encourages priests and bishops to walk among the people they are supposed to comfort, rather than remaining isolated in their limousines.\n\nFrancis' challenge to tradition and the entrenched bureaucracy within the church has been uncomfortable for some, but he has also been praised for speaking to people's better selves and calling them out when they fail to live up to their potential.\n\nIn Section 152 of Evangelii Gaudium, Francis recommended that Catholics worldwide, regardless of their wealth, education, or ethnicity, spend more time reading the Bible. It is lesser-known that Francis rises early to spend time alone, reading scripture, which provides the strength for his public persona to challenge tradition and rattle the entrenched bureaucracy around him.\n\nThe little girl who marched up to the altar in a parish may have embarrassed her mother, but Francis embodies an example that challenges and inspires. A few minutes of lost sleep, in the presence of divine wisdom, might benefit us all. Time's Person of the Year was probably awake before most of us today. Sleep on that.",
    " Title: U.S. Role in the World Shifts Focus from Military Strength to Economic and Soft Power\n\nArticle:\n\nThe first round of questions during Monday night's foreign policy debate between President Obama and former Gov. Mitt Romney is expected to focus on America's role in the world. The candidates' answers are likely to emphasize military readiness and anti-terrorism efforts, given the country's continuous involvement in overseas combat since the terrorist attacks of 2001.\n\nHowever, the U.S. role in the world encompasses more than just military might. Leadership is also defined by economic power and \"soft\" power, which refers to a country's ability to attract and persuade people to adopt its values, according to Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Nye's book \"Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power\" sparked discussions about the need to further develop economic and soft power. The ideas gained traction as the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, and many Americans were eager to explore new ways to lead in a post-Cold War era.\n\nAfter the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, the conversation shifted back to military strength, with drones and Humvees seeming more important than the attractive powers of Hollywood movies or mobile phones.\n\nNow, with the Iraq War over and U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan winding down, Nye suggests the focus may be shifting back to economic and cultural leadership. \"In the 21st century, the Iraq War caused a big drop in American soft power,\" Nye said. This was due to many people in other countries viewing the United States as being too aggressive.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. economic power declined after the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. Before the financial crisis, \"there was the idea that Americans really knew how to run an economic system,\" Nye said. After the crisis, that idea was no longer as prevalent.\n\nHowever, the wheel is turning again, as both China and Europe are struggling with economic growth. \"If you compare us with Europe's economic system, we're doing pretty well,\" Nye said. \"The dollar is still the safe haven.\"\n\nMoreover, U.S. college campuses are bolstering American soft power. \"Most Chinese leaders have a kid at a university in the United States,\" Nye said. At this point, America is again the soft-power global leader \"in everything from Hollywood to Harvard,\" he added.\n\nNariman Behravesh, chief economist of the forecasting firm IHS Global Insight and author of \"Spin-Free Economics: A No-Nonsense, Nonpartisan Guide to Today's Global Economic Debates,\" agrees with Nye that U.S. economic and soft power are coming back.\n\n\"We still have the largest economy in the world; we are still the No. 1 export destination; we still have lots of innovative companies, like Apple; we have the world's reserve currency; we have a dynamic economy, with oil and gas production increasing,\" Behravesh said.\n\n\"We have a lot going for us,\" he said. \"We've got our problems, but others have problems that are as bad or worse, and I include China in that. They have had a huge deceleration in their growth.\"\n\nHowever, going forward, America's role in the world will be largely shaped by how well Congress handles the budget deficit problems in coming months, Behravesh said. As other countries, especially in Europe, grapple with the problem of too much government debt, people around the world are looking to the United States for moral leadership.\n\nIf the United States shows that it's possible for democracies to discipline themselves and control their debts, then its economic and soft power may surge, Behravesh said. \"We need to tackle our domestic deficit problem,\" he said. \"If we deal with it in a constructive way, people will view us favorably.\"",
    " Title: RNC Chairman Urges Caution on Immigration Enforcement Discourse, Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has called for a more measured approach to discussing strict immigration enforcement policies, sparking controversy among outspoken conservatives. At the RNC's annual summer meeting in Boston, Priebus criticized the use of self-deportation policies during the 2016 election season, labeling such rhetoric as \"horrific\" and harmful to the party.\n\nPriebus's comments have raised questions about the party's stance on immigration enforcement, particularly in light of the ongoing debate over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The RNC chair has yet to clarify his position on self-deportation policies, and his remarks have been met with criticism from those who argue that such policies are a humane and reasonable response to illegal immigration.\n\nOne family that has been vocal in their opposition to the current immigration system is the Shaw family, whose 17-year-old son, Jamiel, was murdered in 2008 by an illegal alien Mexican gang member. Pedro Espinoza, the perpetrator, was smuggled into the U.S. illegally as a toddler, similar to many of the DREAMers often cited by open-borders advocates.\n\nAfter Espinoza was released from jail for serving time for assault with a deadly weapon, he was back on the streets and went on to shoot and kill Jamiel execution-style in the head. The federal government failed to deport Espinoza, and local authorities failed to detain him. The Shaw family has since become vocal advocates for repealing sanctuary laws, highlighting lapses in detention and deportation policy, and opposing amnesty proposals.\n\nIn response to Priebus's comments at the GOP event, Anita Shaw, Jamiel's mother, tweeted, \"How many Americans Have U Talked To Whose Kids were Killed by illegals?\" The Shaw family's activism has been met with little recognition from mainstream media outlets, despite their efforts to raise awareness about the dangers of illegal immigration.\n\nPriebus's comments have sparked a broader debate about the role of immigration enforcement in the Republican Party and the party's approach to outreach to minority communities. Some argue that the RNC's focus on minority outreach and diversity should not come at the expense of enforcing immigration laws, while others argue that a more measured approach is necessary to avoid alienating potential voters.\n\nThe Shaw family's story is a poignant reminder of the human toll of illegal immigration and the need for a comprehensive solution to the issue. As the debate over immigration policy continues, it is important to remember the real-world consequences of failed enforcement and the need for a system that prioritizes the safety and well-being of all Americans.",
    " Title: CNN Analyst Phil Mudd Warns of Government Actions Against President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nCNN counterterrorism analyst Phil Mudd, a former deputy director to FBI Director Robert Mueller, has warned that the U.S. government may take action against President Trump. During a Thursday interview with CNN anchor Jake Tapper on \"The Lead,\" Mudd stated, \"Government is going to kill this guy.\"\n\nMudd's statement was in response to Trump's defense of Russian President Vladimir Putin, which, according to Mudd, has led federal employees at the CIA, State Department, and FBI to attempt to undermine Trump. Mudd emphasized his point by referring to the recent FBI raid on the home of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.\n\n\"What did the Department of Justice say on Paul Manafort?\" Mudd asked. \"You can say what you want, a judge told us we had cause to search his home early in the morning because we don\u2019t trust the guy who was your campaign manager.\" He concluded, \"The government is going to kill this guy because he does not support them.\"\n\nLeaks from the White House and the intelligence community have been a regular occurrence since Trump took office. Last week, transcripts of Trump's phone calls with foreign leaders were leaked to The Washington Post, causing concern due to national security implications.\n\n\"This is beyond the pale and will have a chilling effect going forward on the ability of the commander in chief to have candid discussions with his counterparts,\" said Ned Price, a former National Security Council official under former President Obama. \"Granted, the White House contributed to this atmosphere by welcoming the free-for-all environment, where anonymous leaks are commonplace. But we must draw the line somewhere.\"\n\nMudd also cited Trump's recent announcement of a ban on transgender soldiers in the military as another reason for government opposition. \"We saw the same thing in his transgender comments. What is the military saying to him on transgender? 'Show us the policy.' You know what that means inside government? 'Ain\u2019t going to happen,'\" Mudd said.",
    " Title: Congressional Spending Bill Includes Various Provisions Affecting Education, Healthcare, and Environmental Regulations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to avoid a government shutdown, Democratic and Republican negotiators have unveiled a $1.1 trillion spending bill that includes a range of provisions affecting various sectors, from education to healthcare and environmental regulations.\n\nThe bill, which sets the annual budgets for programs ranging from the Justice Department to NASA to the Food and Drug Administration, also serves as a vehicle for numerous provisions that might otherwise be vetoed. These provisions, which touch everything from union pensions to defense procurement, have resulted in one of the most consequential bills to come before Congress this year.\n\nOne of the provisions that would bar the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from regulating methane emissions from livestock production has been included in the bill. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is released by livestock in their flatulence, accounting for about 10 percent of U.S. emissions, according to the EPA. On the other hand, any poultry processed in China that might have wound up in school lunches has been banned, with the Agriculture Department being prohibited from using it.\n\nThe bill also includes pension-related provisions sought by many unions, running more than 160 pages, thanks to the efforts of retiring Rep. George Miller, a close ally of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Banks have also secured a rollback of a section of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law related to derivatives trading.\n\nThe defense industry has secured new funding for F-35s fighters the Pentagon didn't even ask for, while anti-environmental groups have won provisions targeting the administration's climate change policies. States, meanwhile, would have the option to let schools skip out on rules requiring serving whole grains, a blow to the first lady's child nutrition efforts.\n\nThe bill's release has sparked controversy, with some lawmakers expressing frustration over the process. Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) questioned, \"Don't you think we ought to be able to read it? Shouldn't we know what we're voting on?\"\n\nDespite the inclusion of various goodies, it's still unclear whether lawmakers have the votes to pass the plan. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has blasted the changes to Dodd-Frank, stating, \"We all need to stand and fight this giveaway to the most powerful banks in this country.\" Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, has also announced his opposition to the plan due to changes that would allow the wealthy to donate up to $777,600, from the current $97,200, to the national party committees.\n\nThe administration, meanwhile, has stated it can abide by the school-lunch changes. Sam Kass, a senior adviser on nutrition, said in a statement, \"In light of the effects to roll back school nutrition standards, we consider the minor adjustments to the standards a real win for kids and parents.\"",
    " Title: Study Warns of Vulnerabilities in U.S. Nuclear Facility Security\n\nArticle:\n\nA study commissioned by the Pentagon and conducted by researchers at the University of Texas has raised concerns about the vulnerability of nuclear facilities in the United States to terrorist attacks. The report, released on Thursday, suggests that the theft of enough nuclear material to construct an improvised fission bomb is a real possibility.\n\nThe study stands in contrast to the assertions made by the nuclear industry regarding its own security measures. The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) claims that following the events of September 11, 2001, the industry undertook a comprehensive reassessment of its plant security and bolstered protections. According to the NEI, a typical plant features a fenced outer security perimeter heavily patrolled, an inner double fence topped with razor wire also heavily patrolled, and a third layer of protection surrounding vital equipment. The containment vessel itself is further protected with multiple layers of steel and concrete.\n\nHowever, one of the authors of the University of Texas report, Prof. Alan Kuperman, states that a study by the U.S. National Laboratory in 1982 produced different results. He explained that an impact of an airliner would breach the containment, potentially leading to a loss of coolant and, consequently, a meltdown, and a release of major levels of radiation.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) claims that its reactors could withstand such an impact. However, Prof. Kuperman notes that the industry lobbied against requiring such standards. \"So on the one hand, the industry says, 'Oh, our facilities can withstand an airplane impact,' but on the other hand, they say, 'no, no no, do not regulate and require us to be able to withstand that impact,'\" he said.\n\nThe new study acknowledges a history of widely divergent research about the likelihood of a terrorist attack on nuclear facilities. One expert puts the likelihood that a terrorist group will acquire a nuclear weapon at \"very substantially less than one in a million,\" while another researcher \"estimates a 50 percent chance of a nuclear terrorist attack on U.S. soil in the next decade.\"\n\nThe report also highlights significant variations in the level of security at different facilities and calls for greater uniformity of security at all nuclear facilities, whether they are power plants, places where nuclear weapons are stored, or where fissile material is stored.",
    " Title: Republican Lawmakers Express Concern Over Funding for President-elect Trump's Agenda Amid National Debt Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican lawmakers have expressed concern over potential obstacles in enacting President-elect Donald Trump's agenda due to the national debt. Trump's proposed $1 trillion infrastructure package, $5 trillion in tax cuts, increased military spending, and the repeal of Obamacare could cost more than $350 billion over 10 years, according to some estimates.\n\nHowever, Trump has promised not to touch Social Security or make cuts to Medicare. The cost of Trump's plans, combined with the lack of concrete details on how to pay for them, could pose challenges for congressional Republicans, particularly when they are faced with raising the nation's $20 trillion borrowing limit after March.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) expressed his concerns, stating, \"I was disappointed that it wasn't brought up in the campaign\u2014anybody's campaign really\u2014it really wasn't mentioned. So I'm very concerned about it. It's going to be tough to address if there's no push from outside of Congress.\"\n\nConservative groups share these concerns, emphasizing the importance of fiscal restraint as Republicans prepare to control the White House and Congress. Michael Sargent, a research associate at The Heritage Foundation, stated, \"We did not hear anything about entitlement reform from either of the candidates, and that's a serious issue. You can't address the growth in spending without addressing entitlement issues.\"\n\nCompounding the problem is the expected action by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which would increase the cost of the nation's debt. For every quarter point that interest rates rise, the federal government would have to spend an additional $50 billion annually to service the debt, according to Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over infrastructure.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump focused on issues such as immigration, trade, and economic renewal, while discussing infrastructure, immigration reform, and campaign finance reform. The media largely focused on the personal attacks the candidates leveled against each other.\n\nTrump advisers have suggested the new administration will be able to trigger massive private sector investments in infrastructure without a huge increase in spending. They propose federal expenditures in the form of tax credits could be enough to get projects underway.\n\nIn the absence of a specific plan, what has garnered more attention is the overall number attached to his infrastructure plan: $1 trillion. Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.) noted, \"Nobody really knows the details. As we talk about them, our conference will be very concerned about how they affect both the debt and the deficit.\"\n\nSargent, of the Heritage Foundation, has seen as many as four different iterations of Trump's infrastructure plan, all of which he says would raise the deficit. \"I've seen everything ranging from direct stimulus to a $1 trillion in tax credits, both of which would obviously raise the deficit. The tax credits, he claims, would pay for themselves. I do not see that at all. The assumptions that are built into it I think are wildly optimistic,\" he said.\n\nLawmakers spent months negotiating ways to pay for a six-year, $300 billion highway bill that passed last year. The lack of concrete details on how to pay for Trump's infrastructure plan has raised concerns among Republicans, who are skeptical that additional infrastructure spending will provide a significant boost to the economy.\n\nTrump could alleviate some of the concerns brewing in the Republican conference by pushing new proposals to curb spending. Already, he has modified his stance on Medicare, adopting language favored by Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that Democrats interpret as a sign Trump will embrace Ryan's vision for a dramatic overhaul of the entitlement program.\n\nThe transition website states the incoming administration will act to \"modernize Medicare so that it will be ready for the challenges of the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation\u2014and beyond.\" In addition, many Republicans believe that repealing Obamacare will have a positive fiscal impact beyond the 10-year window scored last year by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nSeveral Republicans said Trump's plan to replace Obamacare with healthcare reforms could open the door to overhauling Medicaid, which was expanded in 31 states under the healthcare law. \"One of the things Donald Trump emphasized in his campaign was the risks of a $20 trillion debt and at the same time he put forth proposals that would increase the debt by another $5 trillion,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \"Some changes are definitely going to have to be made. The good news is he's shown a willingness to do that,\" she added, noting that Trump downsized his tax proposal, which initially stood at $10 trillion.\n\nBoozman expressed hope that Trump will stimulate the economy through regulatory reform, which won't add to the deficit. \"The real excitement is in the regulatory phase, getting rid of some of the unnecessary regulation that's really putting a wet blanket on the economy,\" he said. \"That's going to save money.\"",
    " Title: Former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack's Tenure at the U.S. Department of Agriculture\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his final year at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack has left a significant mark on the department, particularly in the areas of farm policy, school nutrition, and biofuels.\n\nVilsack, who once harbored presidential aspirations, saw his 2008 bid for the White House falter, eventually endorsing Hillary Clinton. Despite his efforts to secure Iowa for Clinton, her campaign was overshadowed by Barack Obama's Iowa juggernaut.\n\nOne of Vilsack's most notable achievements at the USDA was the negotiation of the 2014 farm bill, a nearly $1 trillion measure that ended four years of partisan fighting over farm subsidies and support for the food stamp program for the poor. He also played a central role in the passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2010. This legislation mandated the use of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits in schools and required students to select at least one portion of fruits or vegetables at every lunch.\n\nVilsack has also advocated for the use of biofuels. In a recent development, he joined Ray Mabus, the Secretary of the Navy, to fill the guided-missile destroyer William P. Lawrence with biofuel made from beef fat. Vilsack described this as an \"extraordinary experience\" and an example of the \"series of partnerships that has extended the reach of the USDA.\"\n\nDespite being a low-key, soft-spoken individual, Vilsack's job overseeing the nation's farmers has largely kept him out of the spotlight. However, an early low point in his career came during his second year in the job, when he reacted to a video showing seemingly racist comments from Shirley Sherrod, an Agriculture Department official in Georgia. Vilsack quickly fired Sherrod, but was later forced to publicly apologize when it was revealed that the video had been heavily edited by the operators of a conservative website. The full video showed Sherrod offering a lesson in racial tolerance and compassion.",
    " Title: Three Rays of Hope for Bipartisanship and Compromise in U.S. Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - The United States appears to be in a state of deep division and political dysfunction, but journalist Michael Tomasky identifies three potential signs of hope for bipartisanship and compromise in the near future.\n\nFirst, Tomasky points to a significant demographic shift in the U.S., specifically the growth of the Latino population. This demographic change is transforming the electorate in key presidential states, such as Florida. The state's Latino population is no longer primarily Cuban-American, and the growth of the Puerto Rican population has led to a split between Cubans and Puerto Ricans, with the latter being predominantly Democratic. This shift could make Florida increasingly difficult for Republican presidential candidates to win, potentially forcing the Republican Party to address immigration reform, including a path to citizenship.\n\nSecond, the Republican Party is at a crossroads due to Donald Trump's influence. Regardless of whether Trump wins or loses, the party is deeply divided over him. If Trump wins, the divide may continue, but an anti-Trump faction could emerge to oppose his more extreme measures, potentially leading to a more moderate party over time. If Clinton wins, the Republicans would have lost three elections in a row, which historically has led the party to reassess and move toward the center.\n\nThird, Tomasky discusses the filibuster, a Congressional rule that allows a minority of senators to prevent the Senate from passing a piece of legislation. The filibuster has been a significant source of gridlock in Congress, as it requires 60 senators to agree on controversial legislation. Tomasky suggests that the Senate may change its rules in the near future, reducing the number of votes needed or limiting the frequency of filibusters, which would lead to more legislation being passed and increased cooperation between senators from both parties.\n\nTomasky acknowledges that there are reasons to be skeptical about these three developments, but he believes there is a decent chance they will occur. Even if they do, the political situation will not be perfect, but Tomasky suggests that it will be better, comparing the current state of U.S. politics to an egg that needs to learn to fly.",
    " Title: Senate Reaches Deal to Avert \"Nuclear Option\" on Filibuster Rules, Allows Nominations to Proceed\n\nArticle:\n\nSenators have reached a deal to avoid the \"nuclear option\" on filibuster rules regarding the confirmation of presidential nominees on Tuesday. Under the agreement, President Barack Obama will withdraw two nominees to the National Labor Relations Board, Sharon Block and Richard Griffin, and replace them with Nancy Schiffer and Kent Hirozawa.\n\nSchiffer is the associate general counsel at the AFL-CIO, while Hirozawa is the chief counsel to NLRB Chairman Mark Gaston Pearce and would be nominated to the seat on the board that expires in 2014. The nominations are expected to move swiftly, as without the two new members, the National Labor Relations Board would cease to function in August.\n\nThe agreement allows for votes on the other five nominees to proceed, including Gina McCarthy as EPA administrator and Thomas Perez as Labor secretary. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid stated that these five nominees will receive confirmation votes in the next two weeks.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell commented that the agreement is a step in the right direction, as the majority has chosen not to exercise the nuclear option. Both sides have achieved their desired outcomes: Democrats will have seven of Obama's nominees in place, and Republicans were able to prevent the recess-appointed Block and Griffin from the NLRB. Republicans will still be able to force procedural votes on executive nominees at a 60-vote threshold, and Democrats retain the right to change the rules if necessary.\n\nThe agreement was facilitated by the efforts of Sen. John McCain, who was central in crafting the deal, and Democratic sources. Sen. Chuck Schumer stated that the agreement was sparked by McCain's doggedness and Sen. Roger Wicker's request to get all senators in one room together on Monday. The deal was crystallized on Tuesday morning.\n\nIn the Senate Democratic caucus after the agreement, Sen. Barbara Mikulski told Democrats not to celebrate excessively, stating, \"No gloating, maximum dignity.\" Sen. Chuck Schumer stated that the nominations will have to go through the committee process but must be in place by the end of August, when the National Labor Relations Board will cease to function without Senate action.",
    " Title: Progressive Push for Equal Rights Amendment Sparks Debate on Gender Equality and Constitutional Change\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the United States enters a new decade, a resurgence of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is underway, with progressives aiming to ratify the constitutional amendment that had previously been considered a dead issue. If successful, the ERA could enshrine left-wing gender dogmas into the highest law of the land.\n\nThe ERA's language appears unobjectionable, stating, \"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.\" However, the amendment's broad language could potentially open the door to various constitutional claims that many Americans reject.\n\nAmerican women currently enjoy unprecedented freedom, prosperity, and opportunities. The Constitution protects their right to speak, worship, vote, bear arms, and more. Women hold the majority of wealth in the country and earn the lion's share of higher degrees. Women also make up the majority of voters in nearly every election.\n\nWhile sex discrimination is already forbidden under federal and state laws, as well as by the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, the ERA would not add to these protections but could be used to impose sex-sameness. The amendment's language could potentially be used to force women to be drafted into combat, disallow separate-sex bathrooms, or even pull government funding from women's shelters.\n\nIn some states, state-level ERAs have been interpreted as requiring government funding for abortion. The ERA could also threaten laws that don't explicitly distinguish between men and women but provide benefits to stay-at-home wives or young mothers. For example, a non-working spouse's ability to draw on Social Security or even grants encouraging girls' participation in scientific fields could be treated as barriers to \"equality.\"\n\nThe meaning of \"sex\" is far from clear, and in the hands of a liberal judge, the ERA could become another weapon against women-only spaces and religious liberty, if \"women\" is interpreted to include men who subjectively claim to be female.\n\nWhile many still view the ERA as a relic of history, the amendment will be a live issue going into 2020. ERA proponents claim that they can combine recent ratifications in Nevada and Illinois with those from the 1970s. If Virginia ratifies the ERA, proponents claim that they only need a bare majority in the House and Senate to undo the 1982 deadline set by Congress.\n\nCourts have ruled that amendments must be ratified in a reasonable time frame, but the 27th amendment was ratified more than two centuries after James Madison proposed it. The unusual process for amending the Constitution, as well as legal questions regarding rescinded or expired ratifications, remain unresolved.\n\nOpponents of the ERA argue that men and women are already equal under American law, but they are not the same.

    " Title: Former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford Wins Special House Election\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford, who once faced a political downfall due to a personal scandal, has made a remarkable comeback, winning the state's open House seat in a special election held on Tuesday. Sanford captured 54 percent of the vote, compared to his opponent, Elizabeth Colbert Busch's 45 percent.\n\nThe South Carolina seat became vacant after Governor Nikki Haley appointed Rep. Tim Scott to the Senate seat previously held by Jim DeMint, who left to join the conservative Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nThe race between Sanford and Colbert Busch, the sister of TV comedian and political satirist Stephen Colbert, was initially considered a close contest by political analysts. However, Sanford's victory was decisive.\n\nNational Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden of Oregon viewed the result as a sign of the unpopularity of President Barack Obama and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi among House Democrats in 2014.\n\n\"These results demonstrate just how devastating the policies of Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi are for House Democrats in 2014,\" Mr. Walden said in a prepared statement. \"Democrats spent more than $1 million trying to elect a candidate who was backed by the Democrat machine, but at the end of the day, running on the Obama-Pelosi ticket was just too toxic for Elizabeth Colbert Busch.\"\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel, on the other hand, praised Colbert Busch for making the race competitive in a Republican-dominated district, stating it was a \"testament to the strength of Elizabeth Colbert Busch as a candidate and the Republican habit of nominating flawed candidates.\"\n\nSanford, who has never lost a political race, faced controversy in 2009 when he disappeared, supposedly to \"hike the Appalachian Trail,\" but instead traveled to Argentina to visit his mistress. He completed his second term as governor in early 2011 and kept a low profile until his House campaign this year.\n\nRecent troubles for Sanford included a complaint filed by his ex-wife, Jenny, accusing him of trespassing on her property during the Super Bowl, and the withdrawal of financial support from the National Republican Congressional Committee, the fundraising arm of House Republicans, weeks before the election.\n\nHowever, Sanford gained momentum in the final days of the campaign with high-profile Republican endorsements, including those from Rep. Tim Scott, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a tea party favorite who is considering a 2016 presidential run.\n\nBy Sunday, a poll by Public Policy Polling showed the race as a tossup, with Sanford ahead 47 percent to 46 percent. Two weeks earlier, a PPP survey had Mr. Sanford trailing by 9 percentage points.\n\nSanford portrayed his opponent as an uncompromising liberal in lockstep with Pelosi and other national Democrats, a damaging charge in the staunchly Republican coastal Carolina district. Colbert Busch countered by positioning herself as an independent voice for the district.\n\nHowever, political forces may make it difficult for Sanford to repeat his victory in the 2014 election, as he has been shunned by much of the Republican Party establishment since his 2009 scandal. The Republican establishment is expected to support a formidable opponent in the 2014 GOP primary.\n\n\"House leaders will isolate him to make it clear he is not in any way a spokesperson for the House GOP,\" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.\n\nAs for the national political implications of Tuesday's special election, many political analysts say it has little significance. \"I don't think this one reflects anything. It's all about Mark Sanford,\" Mr. Sabato said. \"Does anyone believe that any other Republican wouldn't be winning this in a landslide? It's a one-party district.\"",
    " Title: Cable Reveals U.S. Awareness of Benghazi Dangers Before 2012 Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nA recently disclosed cable obtained by Fox News indicates that the U.S. Mission in Benghazi held an emergency meeting on Aug. 15, 2012, expressing concerns about the growing presence of al Qaeda and Islamist militias in the city. The cable, marked \"SECRET,\" suggests that the U.S. consulate in Benghazi could not withstand a coordinated attack due to limited manpower, security measures, weapons capabilities, host nation support, and the overall size of the compound.\n\nThe cable, addressed to the Office of the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, also mentions the presence of approximately ten Islamist militias and al Qaeda training camps within Benghazi. The cable further states that the Emergency Action Committee was briefed on these groups, which included the QRF Brigade, Ansar al-Sharia, and \"Takfirist thugs.\"\n\nThe details in the cable seem to foreshadow the deadly Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. compound, which was a coordinated, commando-style assault using direct and indirect fire. Al Qaeda in North Africa and Ansar al-Sharia, both mentioned in the cable, have since been implicated in the consulate attack.\n\nThe cable also states that the U.S. Mission in Benghazi would submit specific requests for additional physical security upgrades and staffing needs to the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli.\n\nThe cable's contents seem to contradict the administration's public statements suggesting that the attack came without warning. The cable provides a direct warning to the State Department that the Benghazi consulate was vulnerable to attack and could not be defended.\n\nIn a separate cable on Sept. 11, the day Stevens and the three other Americans were killed, Stevens wrote about \"growing problems with security\" in Benghazi and \"growing frustration\" with the security forces and Libyan police. The ambassador saw both as \"too weak to keep the country secure.\"",
    " Title: Protests and Lawsuits Emerge as Nation Faces Economic Impact of Shutdown Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nAcross the United States, protests and lawsuits are escalating as citizens take to the streets and business owners file legal actions in response to shutdown rules. The prolonged shutdown is causing job losses, bankruptcies, and a growing sense of infringement on individual rights.\n\nThe liberal media has labeled the protesters as virus deniers, but the protesters argue they are supported by science, the U.S. Constitution, and common sense. In a statement on Monday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo acknowledged, \"This is not a sustainable situation. Close down everything, close down the economy, lock yourself in the house.\"\n\nStarting with the science, data shows that almost all coronavirus fatalities are among the elderly and those with serious health problems. In Pennsylvania, 68% of deaths have been nursing-home residents, while in Rhode Island, it's 70%. Shutting down stores and restaurants did not save these high-risk individuals.\n\nA targeted lockdown focusing on protecting the highest-risk group, individuals 65 and over, instead of confining all age groups would slash deaths by half but at only half the economic cost of a total shutdown, according to new National Bureau of Economic Research findings.\n\nUnfortunately, social media platforms are censoring science that challenges the shutdown. YouTube's policy is to ban content that \"disputes the efficacy of local health authority recommended guidance.\"\n\nThe shutdown's initial goal was to \"flatten the curve,\" meaning buying time for hospitals to add beds and gather enough ventilators, masks, and other medical equipment. However, experts predict the virus will last another 18 months to two years, fading once most Americans have been exposed and developed immunity.\n\nAs Colorado lifted its shutdown last week, the governor explained it's a \"balance\" between keeping the virus \"at a level that won't overwhelm our hospital systems and allowing people to still try and earn a living.\"\n\nThe biggest divide in the country is about who is getting a paycheck. Some government officials, who are paid, show no respect for working people who aren't. For example, Governor Janet Mills of Maine barred hotels from taking reservations for the summer season, and Michigan's Governor Gretchen Whitmer attempted to close grass-mowing businesses, though the virus is seldom transmitted outdoors.\n\nWhen the shutdown was temporary and tied directly to hospital preparedness, lawsuits challenging it didn't stand a chance. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1905 that a state \"has the right to protect itself against an epidemic\" using reasonable regulations.\n\nHowever, shutdowns lose their reasonableness when they have no deadline or benchmark to meet. Their vagueness tramples on the public's rights, including the right to own property without the government making it worthless.\n\nOn Monday, Cuomo outlined a four-phase reopening plan. While not all of the benchmarks are wise, benchmarks pegged to hospital capacity are on the mark. He should also add nursing-home preparedness, as that's where deaths are occurring.\n\nThe public should shudder at Mayor Bill de Blasio's vague announcement that the city's reopening is \"a few months away at a minimum.\" This could reduce the city to a wasteland of boarded-up storefronts, abandoned commercial buildings, landlords defaulting on taxes, and soaring tax rates for the taxpayers still in the city.\n\nAs for when New York schools reopen, science indicates schools are not a source of transmission. If schools are kept closed in defiance of this fact, say goodbye to the middle class with kids. New York will be for the poor and uber-rich only.\n\nBetsy McCaughey, a former lieutenant governor of New York, is chairwoman of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths.",
    " Title: Scotland's Call for Independence and the Global Trend of Secessionism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Boris Johnson's \"Get Brexit Done\" campaign, the United Kingdom is facing a potential secession from the European Union. However, this move could lead to Scotland's secession from the United Kingdom, as warned by Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Northern Ireland, which voted to remain in the EU in 2016, could also follow Scotland, leaving the UK with \"Little England\" and Wales.\n\nJohnson's government has stated that they will not allow a second referendum on Scottish independence. However, the Scottish National Party won 48 of Scotland's 59 seats in Parliament, and Sturgeon argues that this is a mandate for a new vote to secede. She stated, \"If [Johnson] thinks... saying no is the end of the matter then he is going to find himself completely and utterly wrong... You can not hold Scotland in the union against its will.\"\n\nThe issue of Scotland's potential secession raises questions about the right to self-determination in a democratic nation. If a majority of Scots wish to secede, how can a democratic Great Britain indefinitely deny them this right? Some argue that Scotland could become for Britain what Catalonia is to Spain, a region seeking independence.\n\nThe phenomenon of secessionism is not a new one. The most recent population explosion of new nations began three decades ago, when 15 republics of the USSR became independent nations. Since then, several of these new nations have further unraveled, leading to the secession of Transnistria from Moldova, South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, and the Donbass from Ukraine.\n\nThe first great secessionist cause was the American Revolution, when the 13 American colonies declared and won independence from the British crown. The Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson, was not as egalitarian as it is often portrayed. Jefferson, a Virginia plantation owner, described Native Americans as \"merciless Indian Savages\" and referred to the British as \"brethren\" with whom they shared \"ties of a common kindred,\" but who were \"deaf to the voice of consanguinity.\"\n\nThe second secessionist movement in the United States created a second American nation, when Texans under Sam Houston seceded from Mexico. The third secessionist movement united 11 states that sought to create a new confederated nation outside the Union, as the revolutionary generation had created a new nation outside of Britain.\n\nIn the 19th century, a dozen new nations were created by Latin American secessionists of the Spanish and Portuguese empires who emulated the example of the Americans of 1776. After 1945, colonies of the British, French, Portuguese, and Belgian empires seceded to produce a baby boom of new nations, most of which receive foreign aid and have seats in the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nIf the secessionism epidemic is to someday expire, its causes will have to be addressed. Secessionism appears rooted principally in issues of national identity, such as ethnicity, religion, race, language, culture, and \"the mystic chords of memory.\" These issues of identity appear not to be receding but rising in various regions around the world, including the Caucasus, the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia.\n\nThe Kurds, the Palestinians, the Baluch, and many more seek their own nations. Taiwan's secession is not recognized by China, and the secession of Russian-speaking Donbass is not recognized by a U.S.-armed Ukraine or by the international community. As more and more people identify themselves by who they are, and are not, secessions of people from each other will continue.\n\nThe potential secession of Scotland and the ongoing secessionist movements around the world highlight the complex and evolving nature of national identity and the right to self-determination. The peace of the 21st century may depend upon our ability to accommodate this inexorable secessionist drive to some degree. In June of 1945, the U.N. had 50 members. It begins 2020 with 193. Last week, Bougainville, a South Pacific island cluster of Papua New Guinea, voted 98% for independence to become the world's newest nation.",
    " Title: FBI Director Christopher Wray Rallies Agents Amid Release of Controversial Memo\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the release of a controversial memo by a Republican-led House committee alleging surveillance abuses by the Justice Department and FBI, FBI Director Christopher Wray sought to rally agents and analysts with a memo of his own.\n\n\"Talk is cheap; the work you do is what will endure,\" FBI Chief Wray wrote in an internal message on Friday. \"We speak through our work. One case at a time. One decision at a time.\"\n\nThe release of the memo, which focuses on a 2016 surveillance warrant approved to monitor former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, has been a subject of controversy. The memo assails the bureau and Justice Department for relying on a dossier prepared by a British intelligence agent whose work was funded in part by Democrats.\n\nPresident Trump approved the release of the memo, prepared at the direction of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), over the objections of Wray and Justice Department leadership. In an unusual statement this week, the FBI issued a public statement expressing \"grave concerns\" about the accuracy of the memo.\n\nLate Friday, Wray urged the bureau to move on. \"We're going to keep doing that work because we know who and what we are and because we know our mission comes first,\" the director said. \"The American people come first.\"\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee voted to release the memo on Monday, and it has since been a topic of debate. The memo's release comes amid an ongoing investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential collusion with the Trump campaign.\n\nThe FBI was provided a limited opportunity to review the memo the day before the committee voted to release it, according to the bureau. \"As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo\u2019s accuracy,\" the FBI said earlier this week.",
    " Title: Record Number of Student Loans Utilize Income-Based Repayment Plans\n\nArticle:\n\nA record 24.7% of student loans backed by the U.S. government, totaling $452 billion, were enrolled in income-based repayment plans during the fourth-quarter of 2019, according to DBRS Morningstar. This figure represents an increase from 21.8% in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nThe Obama administration expanded income-based repayment options in 2009 for student borrowers in the Federal Family Educational Loan Program (FFELP) following the global financial crisis. The government offered a near 99% backstop on all principal and interest due on loans made under the program. The Obama administration ended FFELP in 2010, effectively cutting out private lenders.\n\nIncome-based repayment plans cap loan repayments at 10% to 15% of a qualifying borrower's discretionary income, with any remaining balance forgiven after 20 to 25 years. For lower-income students, this could mean no monthly payments at all, without causing borrower defaults or damaging their credit profile.\n\nThe initial expectation was that more than 1.6 million student loan borrowers would see reduced monthly loan payments, although the program does not offer a way for students to refinance debt and lock-in historically low rates.\n\nSince 2011, the popularity of income-based payment options has soared. Meanwhile, addressing the nation's record $1.5 trillion pile of student loan debt has been a hot topic among some Democratic presidential hopefuls. The Trump administration's former top Education Department official, A. Wayne Johnson, called for a cancellation of most of the country's student loans upon his resignation from the department in October.\n\nAccording to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, student debt has become the second-largest source of U.S. household debt behind mortgages. In the first quarter of 2010, the student loan total was only $760 billion, or roughly half its current total.\n\nThe New York Fed reported that 11.1% of all student loans were in default or seriously delinquent (more than 90 days past due) during the fourth-quarter. However, it is likely that this figure is actually twice as high, given that roughly half of student loans are in some form of deferment, grace period, or forbearance, and not counted as in \"repayment.\"\n\nDBRS Morningstar expects the combined utilization of deferment, forbearance, and income-based repayment to remain elevated for the foreseeable future.",
    " Title: Virginia Gubernatorial Election: Third-Party Candidate Robert Sarvis Challenges Established Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nOn November 5, Virginia will hold its gubernatorial election, with the potential for the game to air on Spike. The state's decision to hold gubernatorial elections in off years, without presidential or congressional races on the ballot, remains unclear.\n\nThe latest polls indicate a low level of voter enthusiasm for the two main candidates, Terry McAuliffe and Ken T. Cuccinelli II. McAuliffe, a political fundraiser with no prior elective office experience, is currently under federal investigation and has been involved in controversies regarding his business dealings and residency. Cuccinelli, a homegrown candidate, has faced criticism for his conservative stance on social issues and his monotone speaking style.\n\nA third candidate, Robert Sarvis, offers a different option for voters. Sarvis, a 37-year-old Libertarian, was born in Fairfax and holds degrees from Harvard, the University of Cambridge, NYU, and George Mason University. He left a legal career to found a software development business and has advocated for issues such as gay marriage, marijuana legalization, and personal autonomy.\n\nSarvis's campaign has gained some traction, with the latest poll putting him at 13%. He has suggested that a vote for a third-party candidate could lead to a landslide victory, as many voters may be voting against the other candidates rather than for them. A Gallup poll in October found that 60% of Americans believe a third major party is needed due to the poor representation of the two major parties.\n\nHowever, some argue that a vote for a third-party candidate may be considered futile and a waste of a vote, as Cuccinelli is considered the most qualified candidate in the field. The situation in Virginia has been compared to the conclusion reached by the Delta Tau Chi frat leaders in the movie \"Animal House,\" who decided to make a \"really futile and stupid gesture\" in a do-or-die situation.\n\nJoseph Curl, the editor of the Drudge Report and a former White House and politics reporter for The \u2588\u2588\u2588, can be reached at [email protected] and on Twitter @josephcurl.",
    " Title: U.S. Prisoner of War Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl Handed Over in Afghanistan in Authentic Video, Pentagon Says\n\nArticle:\n\nA video of the handover of American prisoner of war Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in Afghanistan was posted online early Wednesday, showing the moment a Black Hawk helicopter swooped in to pick him up in a valley in Afghanistan's Khost province, near Pakistan. The Pentagon is reviewing the video, with no reason to question its authenticity, according to a spokesman.\n\nThe video shows Bergdahl sitting in the back of a pickup truck, wearing white clothing. More than a dozen fighters are positioned around the valley. In the video, the Black Hawk helicopter lands with its side facing the area where Bergdahl and the Taliban fighters wait. As several people come out of the helicopter, the American is led toward them under a white flag.\n\nThe exchange is over in seconds, as the participants hold up their hands to one another. The men\u2014three from the helicopter and two from the Taliban force\u2014engage in quick handshakes, then they wave their farewells. The scene was being filmed, with the photographer featuring the figure of Bergdahl and the helicopter.\n\nThe exchange of Bergdahl for five Taliban prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has sparked a series of questions, ranging from the circumstances of the soldier's capture in Afghanistan to the legality of the prisoner exchange. Members of Congress say they were not given advance notice of the deal.\n\nPresident Obama says the White House had spoken \"for some time\" about a possible prisoner swap for Bergdahl; his administration says it had to act quickly to free him. A congressional hearing on the matter is slated for next week, with more expected to follow.\n\nYesterday, Secretary of the Army John McHugh said the service is happy to have Bergdahl back. He added that the Army will conduct \"a comprehensive, coordinated effort that will include speaking with Sgt.

    " Title: High Earners' Response to Tax Hikes: A Look at the U.K. and U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama has been advocating for an increase in taxes on the highest-earning Americans as part of a solution to the ongoing fiscal crisis. However, history suggests that such tax hikes may not significantly reduce the deficit as expected, and may lead to unintended consequences.\n\nA notable example can be found in then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's proposal in April 2010 to increase the marginal tax rate by 10 percent to 50 percent on residents earning over $1 million. This move resulted in a significant decrease in the number of people declaring such income or more, from 16,000 to 6,000 in the 2010-2011 tax year, according to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, the United Kingdom's tax collection agency.\n\nBefore Brown's proposal, Britain's wealthiest comprised approximately 9 percent of the country's tax pool. This percentage dropped by half\u2014to roughly 4.4 percent\u2014after the proposal. It is believed that wealthy Britons moved abroad or took steps to avoid paying the new levy by reducing their taxable incomes, according to a report in the London Telegraph.\n\nThe potential enactment of Obama's tax hike on high earners, raising the marginal rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent, in exchange for preserving existing Bush-era rates on Americans earning less than $250,000 annually, could have a similar effect.\n\nDaniel J. Mitchell, a fiscal policy expert at the Cato Institute, a Washington-based, libertarian think tank, stated, \"Obama's main goal in the fiscal cliff negotiations is to impose a class-warfare tax hike.\" He further explained, \"When you're trying to stick it to the 'rich,' you need to understand that they have tremendous control over the timing, level, and composition of their income. So unlike the rest of us, they can respond very easily when the government goes after them.\"\n\nOne option available to America's high earners to reduce taxable income in the face of any tax increases is to move their wealth into tax-free bonds, according to Mitchell.\n\nHowever, economist Kent Smetters, an economics and public policy professor at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, noted that existing tax laws make it difficult for high earners to avoid taxes. \"It is very hard to do after the Tax Reform Act of 1986,\" Smetters told FoxNews.com. \"You've basically got to figure out how to either reclassify the income as capital gains (to get a lower tax rate) or classify the money as earned outside of the United States. Both are nearly impossible, usually requiring tax shelters that the Treasury Department can deem as illegal.\"\n\nSmetters added, \"The reason why the rich already pay so much of the U.S. tax base is because they have a hard time avoiding it.\"",

The shooting resulted in the deaths of 22 people and left dozens injured after a white gunman targeted a Hispanic area at a Walmart in the border city on Saturday.\n\nDallas attorney Chris Ayres told The Associated Press that the call was made to the Allen Police Department. Ayres and fellow attorney R. Jack Ayres told CNN that the mother's concern was about an \"AK\"-type firearm her son owned. On Thursday, Chris Ayres confirmed the report to \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nThe attorneys stated that the mother's call was merely seeking information and was not motivated by a concern that her son was a threat to anyone. They also said the mother did not identify herself or her son in the call.\n\nThe lawyers told CNN the mother was concerned about her son's age, maturity level, and lack of experience. However, she was told by a public safety officer that her son, who is 21, was legally allowed to possess the weapon.\n\nA family statement sent by Chris Ayres to \u2588\u2588\u2588 stated that the suspected shooter acted outside the family's teachings and values. \"He was raised in a family that taught love, kindness, respect, and tolerance \u2013 rejecting all forms of racism, prejudice, hatred, and violence,\" the statement says. \"There will never be a moment for the rest of our lives when we will forget each and every victim of this senseless tragedy.\"\n\nSgt.

She maintained that there was no connection between the violence and celebrations on Monday for the opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem.\n\nNickolay Mladenov, the U.N. special coordinator for Middle East peace, addressed the council, finding fault with both Israel and Hamas. Mladenov stated, \"Israel has a responsibility to calibrate its use of force, to not use lethal force, except as a last resort, under imminent threat of death or serious injury.\" He added that Hamas \"must not use the protests as cover to attempt to place bombs at the fence and create provocations; its operatives must not hide among the demonstrators and risk the lives of civilians.\"\n\nThousands of Palestinian refugees rallied in southern Lebanon on Tuesday in commemoration of the \"Nakba\" and in solidarity with the Gaza demonstrations. Many were bused in from the longstanding refugee camps of Lebanon. Palestinians have a complex history with Lebanon.

When asked about the damning report on the FBI's procedures delivered by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, Comey stated, \"I'm responsible. I was wrong, I was overconfident on our procedures.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Comey also said he would say exactly what current FBI Director Christopher Wray has said about the IG report, \"We are going to get to the bottom of this.\" The most important thing, according to Comey, is to determine if the procedural errors are \"systemic.\"\n\nHost Chris Wallace challenged Comey on his previous statement that the unsubstantiated dossier put together by former British spy Christopher Steele, which was used to obtain a FISA warrant to surveil Trump campaign aide Carter Page, was merely part of the reason for the application. In his report, Horowitz called it a \"central\" component of the application. Comey responded, \"I'm not sure [Horowitz] and I are saying different things,\" adding, \"The FBI thought it was a close call... I don't think we're saying different things.\"\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray told The Associated Press last week that the report identified problems that are \"unacceptable and unrepresentative of who we are as an institution.\" The FBI is taking more than 40 steps to fix those problems, he said.\n\nIn his report, Horowitz rejected claims of vindication that Comey had made in an opinion piece earlier in the week. Comey said Sunday that he simply meant that the report had debunked some of the gravest allegations that Trump and his supporters had made.\n\nComey also criticized Attorney General William Barr for saying in a separate interview last week that the many errors by the FBI left open the possibility that agents may have acted in bad faith. \"The facts just aren't there,\" Comey said when asked whether Barr has a valid point. \"That doesn't make it any less consequential, any less important, but that's an irresponsible statement.\"\n\nMaterial from The Associated Press was used in this story.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Mandates Free Contraceptive Coverage for Women, New York Attorney General Proposes Expanded Coverage for Men\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration on Monday issued a mandate requiring all health insurers to provide women with free access to a range of contraceptive methods, including intrauterine devices (IUDs), the contraceptive patch, and the contraceptive pill. This move comes in response to reports that some insurance carriers were refusing to cover all types of contraceptives, leaving women to pay out-of-pocket costs.\n\nUnder the new rules, insurers must cover at least one brand of contraception in each of 18 different methods outlined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), such as one type of oral contraceptive pill, one version of the emergency contraceptive morning-after pill, and the vaginal ring. In New York, Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman has proposed legislation that would go even further, requiring insurance companies to pay for men's sterilization procedures.\n\nAt the federal level, the Health and Human Services Department stated that the move was aimed at clarifying the rules after complaints from women and members of Congress that some insurers were refusing to cover the specific contraceptives their doctors recommended. Insurers can still impose costs to encourage the use of generics rather than brand-name drugs under the new guidance, but if a doctor or hospital recommends a particular drug or contraceptive device out of medical necessity, the plans must cover them without additional cost.\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-WA) praised the move, stating, \"Today's announcement is an important step toward making it clear that all insurance companies should follow the rules and provide women with the health care they are entitled to.\" Insurers had sought more specifics about what was required under the Affordable Care Act and its contraceptive coverage provisions, which have been among the most controversial parts of the law.\n\nAccording to recent studies by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation and other groups, some insurers were refusing to fully cover all types of contraceptives, meaning women who wanted a particular form of birth control had to pay some or all of the costs. \"Insurance companies have been breaking the law, and today, the Obama administration underscored that it will not tolerate these violations,\" the National Women's Law Center said.\n\nThe contraceptive mandate has been controversial from the start, with most attention focused on the marathon court battle between the administration and employers who have religious objections to contraceptives. The Supreme Court last year ruled that closely held corporations do not have to insure types of birth control that violate their moral beliefs, and the Obama administration is expected to update its rules soon. Religious nonprofits are still pursuing their cases through the courts, arguing that the \"accommodation\" the administration designed for them still leaves them complicit in contraceptive coverage.\n\nThe contraception rules were released as part of broader guidance on women's health services, including free screenings for women susceptible to certain types of cancer and no extra charges for anesthesia services provided with preventive colonoscopies. The rewrite will apply to future plan years, with insurers able to argue they were using \"good faith\" in more narrowly interpreting the current rules.\n\nMeanwhile, New York's top lawman tried to tackle the issue on his own, proposing legislation that would write Obamacare's coverage requirement into state law while piling on extra consumer protections\u2014even for men. Mr. Schneiderman's bill would force every state-regulated health policy to cover all methods of FDA-approved contraceptives at no cost, akin to federal guidance, although consumers could also get a year's worth of contraception at a time. He also proposed that men's sterilization procedures should be covered without cost sharing. \"New Yorkers should not be penalized by their insurance companies for using the birth control method that they and their medical provider agree is most appropriate for them,\" Mr. Schneiderman said.",
    " Title: Trump's Cancellation of Taliban Summit: A Controversial Decision and Its Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to cancel a planned summit with Taliban leaders aimed at finalizing a peace deal for Afghanistan has sparked criticism from some Democrats, who view it as a misstep in foreign policy. However, the underlying reasons for the cancellation and the potential consequences of the peace deal have been a subject of debate.\n\nThe cancellation of the summit has led to criticism from some political figures, with Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar comparing Trump's foreign policy approach to a \"game show.\" However, the decision to cancel the summit has been defended on the grounds that negotiating with the Taliban, a group responsible for the deaths of nearly 2,000 American soldiers and countless Afghan civilians, is a complex and sensitive issue.\n\nThe United States' involvement in Afghanistan is not merely a matter of military intervention, but a matter of national security. The Taliban's history of harboring terrorist groups, such as al-Qaeda, before the 9/11 attacks, underscores the importance of ensuring that Afghanistan will not serve as a haven for terrorists in the future.\n\nFurthermore, the United States must avoid signing a deal that would betray the Afghan government or allow the Taliban to take over the country and return it to a state of medieval barbarity. The potential consequences of such a deal, including the abandonment of women and children to the mercy of Taliban murderers, are a matter of concern.\n\nWhether the United States can satisfy both of these concerns remains to be seen, but Trump should not be faulted for attempting to find a solution to a complex and long-standing conflict. Some Democrats have criticized Trump for using the recent car bomb attack that cost the life of a US soldier as an excuse for canceling the talks, but the Taliban's continued terrorist activities are a clear obstacle to any potential peace deal.\n\nThe criticism of Trump's decision-making process and theatrical style has been a recurring theme in the debate, but the underlying issue is the process itself, which may not be likely to accomplish anything but provide a diplomatic fig leaf to cover up a desire to withdraw from Afghanistan without a clear plan for the future.\n\nComparisons have been drawn between Trump's approach to foreign policy and that of former President Barack Obama, who was criticized for his handling of the Iran nuclear deal and the withdrawal from Iraq. However, Trump's decision to cancel the summit and reconsider the peace deal may indicate a recognition of the mistakes made in the past and a desire to avoid repeating them.\n\nJonathan Tobin, editor in chief of JNS.org and a contributor to National Review, has suggested that Trump's decision to cancel the summit may be a step towards wisdom, rather than a sign of undignified retreat. The pursuit of peace and the protection of American interests are complex and multifaceted, and a piece of paper signed at Camp David may not be enough to achieve these goals.",
    " Title: President Obama Endorses Hillary Clinton, Vice President Biden Also Expresses Support\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a video message posted on Thursday, President Barack Obama endorsed Hillary Clinton to succeed him in the White House. The video was released shortly after Obama met with Clinton's primary rival, Bernie Sanders, in the Oval Office.\n\nIn the video, Obama stated, \"I know how hard this job can be. That's why I know Hillary will be so good at it. In fact, I don't think there's ever been someone so qualified to hold this office.\"\n\nThe president made it clear that he would no longer stand on the sidelines, even as Vermont Sen. Sanders vows to stay in the race at least through the final primary in Washington, D.C., next Tuesday. The Clinton campaign separately announced that she and Obama would campaign together on June 15 in Green Bay.\n\nClinton tweeted, \"Honored to have you with me, @POTUS. I'm fired up and ready to go!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden voiced his support of Hillary Clinton Thursday evening at the American Constitution Society's national convention.\n\nSanders, after the meeting with Obama, struck a conciliatory tone, saying he plans to meet soon with Clinton to discuss how they can \"work together to defeat Donald Trump.\" Sanders still plans to compete in next Tuesday's Washington, D.C., primary, the final contest on the calendar.\n\nThe meeting with Obama was private, and no staff or aides were present. The timing and tone of Sanders' remarks appeared to soften compared with his defiant speech early Wednesday after Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination.\n\nSanders offered no endorsement himself but congratulated Clinton \"on her very strong campaign.\" He also thanked Obama for his \"impartiality\" throughout the process.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest later said Sanders has the right to make campaign decisions on his own timeline. Another former primary candidate, ex-Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, did endorse Clinton, saying \"it is time now to unite our party.\"\n\nClinton and Obama, along with other party leaders, are eager to bring Sanders and his supporters into the fold. The president's endorsement reflects their desire to unify as the general election battle between Clinton and presumptive rival Donald Trump intensifies.\n\nSanders acknowledged a common political enemy, railing against Trump in his brief remarks to reporters Thursday afternoon and saying he'll do everything in his power to prevent Trump's election.\n\nSpeculation over the position of Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz has swirled for months, but so far, she has retained the public support of the White House. Obama also endorsed her earlier this year in her House primary battle.\n\nAsked Wednesday about the possibility of Sanders seeking her removal, Wasserman Schultz said she's not worried about her job. \"I'm going to be remaining as the chair of the Democratic National Committee as President Obama has asked me to do until January 21, 2017, and I appreciate the president's support,\" she said.",
    " Title: Lobbying Activity in Washington Reaches Highest Level Since 2010 at $3.34 Billion in 2017\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - Lobbying activity in the United States capital reached a record high of $3.34 billion in 2017, according to a report from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. This marks the highest level of lobbying activity since 2010.\n\nPowerful trade groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Realtors, spent the most money to shape policy last year. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Realtors collectively spent over $100 million in 2017.\n\nSheila Krumholz, the center's executive director, commented on the high level of lobbying activity, stating, \"Lobbyists appear not to have gotten the memo about draining the swamp.\" This is a reference to President Trump's campaign pledge to clean up Washington and rein in lobbyists.\n\nGoogle's federal spending jumped to $18 million last year, a new high in the tech giant's lobbying history in Washington. Tech companies are facing increasing scrutiny as lawmakers consider regulating online advertising and investigating Russia's use of social media platforms to influence the 2016 presidential election. Google's lobbying efforts included cyber-security, tax legislation, immigration, and Trump's controversial executive orders on immigration and refugees.\n\nThe nonprofit Open Society Policy Center, aligned with liberal billionaire George Soros, reported $16.1 million in spending last year, a record for the organization since it began reporting federal lobbying in 2002. Much of the money was spent in the last three months of the year and reflects grants Open Society made to other, aligned groups to support their lobbying activity.\n\nCongressional records show Open Society's lobbying efforts included a push to limit child trafficking and measures introduced by congressional Democrats that would prohibit President Trump from making a preemptive strike against North Korea without congressional approval.\n\nLobbying also soared during the last three months of the year for the National Association of Realtors, which spent $22.2 million during the fourth-quarter of 2017, double what it spent during the previous three months. The trade group waged an aggressive lobbying campaign to reshape the tax overhaul that sped through Congress at year's end.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors has touted several wins, including preserving an exemption from capital gains taxes when homeowners profit from the sale of their primary residence and beating back a provision that would have limited the mortgage interest deduction for home purchases to those with new loans of $500,000 or less. The trade group is already lobbying to ease other provisions that made it into the final law, such as a new, $10,000 cap on the deductions that individual taxpayers can take to offset local and state income, sales, and property taxes.",
    " Title: Political Debate on Medicare Reform: Romney and Obama Clash Over Savings and Costs\n\n Article:\n\n In the ongoing political discourse, Presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, have accused President Barack Obama of reducing Medicare funding by $716 billion. Simultaneously, Obama has countered Ryan's plan by stating it aims to \"end Medicare as we know it.\" These exchanges mark a significant part of the ongoing debate as both parties seek to find ways to manage costs within the entitlement program before Medicare runs out of funds.\n\n The primary difference between the two plans lies in their approach to savings. Obama's health reform law reduces payments to providers, including hospitals, insurers, and other healthcare facilities. In contrast, Ryan's plan proposes transitioning Medicare to a private sector model by providing senior citizens with vouchers to purchase coverage from insurance providers.\n\n Both plans incorporate spending caps. However, under Obama's Affordable Care Act, providers could face larger decreases if costs grow faster than projected, while Ryan's plan shifts any additional expenses to beneficiaries.\n\n Marilyn Moon, a former public trustee of Medicare who heads the health program at the American Institutes for Research, a social science research group, commented, \"It's a different philosophy on who should be bearing the burdens.\"\n\n As the two parties vie for the crucial voting block of senior citizens, the future of Medicare has become a central issue. Both sides are seeking ways to prevent the program from becoming insolvent, which is projected to occur in 2024.\n\n Obama's health reform saves money by reducing payments to hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health care agencies, and insurers who provide Medicare Advantage managed care plans. It also establishes the Independent Payment Advisory Board, tasked with keeping Medicare costs under control. The law specifies that benefits cannot be cut to reduce expenses.\n\n Ryan's budget proposal maintains a traditional fee-for-service Medicare option, but also allows insurers to offer seniors a range of choices. At a minimum, the companies would have to provide benefits equivalent to traditional Medicare. The government would provide a \"premium support\" payment that would cover the cost of either traditional Medicare or the second-least expensive insurer's plan, whichever is less. Seniors can pay for additional coverage, such as dental or vision benefits.\n\n Romney has not fully adopted Ryan's plan, but has stated it \"makes important strides in the right direction.\"\n\n Consumer advocates express concern that seniors would pay more for care under the Ryan plan. They point to a Congressional Budget Office report that shows spending would be between 35% and 42% lower for new enrollees under the Ryan plan versus traditional Medicare.\n\n Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, stated, \"By restructuring the program, it could have a very harmful effect on beneficiaries in the long run.\"\n\n Supporters of the Ryan plan argue that senior citizens will face higher costs under Obama's health reform law. They cite concerns that many providers could stop accepting Medicare if rates are slashed too low. Even the Medicare actuary has stated the cuts are unsustainable.\n\n Rea Hederman, research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, commented, \"They may have traditional Medicare, but they won't have a doctor.\"",
    " Title: Report Finds Half of 'Criminal Aliens' in Priority Enforcement Program Have No Criminal Convictions\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report has revealed that the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), a federal program intended to prioritize the deportation of immigrants with criminal records, is missing its target. An analysis of requests by federal officials for local jails to keep immigrants suspected of violating US immigration law in custody found that half of the individuals targeted had no criminal conviction.\n\nThe Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a research organization based at Syracuse University, obtained the records through an open records request. The most common conviction was for drunk driving, followed by miscellaneous assaults and simple traffic offenses. Only one quarter of the individuals had committed the most serious types of offenses, such as murder or sexual assault.\n\nThe PEP was introduced in 2014 as a replacement for the Secure Communities program, which contributed to a record number of deportations under former President Barack Obama. Under the program, federal officials ask local jails to hold undocumented immigrants they arrest in custody so that they can be transferred to federal immigration detention centers.\n\nHowever, the most recent data shows that ICE now targets people with no criminal record at a slightly higher rate than before. ICE spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez said the agency \"continues to make significant strides... through PEP to ensure a common-sense approach that focuses enforcement resources on convicted criminals and individuals who threaten public safety and national security.\"\n\nImmigration advocates have criticized the program, with some arguing that it undermines community policing and leads to the detention of immigrants who are victims of crimes. Maria Sotomayor, an undocumented immigrant who lives in Philadelphia, met with Homeland Security director Jeh Johnson in May and expressed her concerns about the program.\n\n\"I told him that because of these detainers, an immigrant who is a victim of a crime will think many times before calling the police to make a report because we could get picked up too,\" Sotomayor recalled.\n\nBefore PEP was officially implemented last year, at least 377 local law enforcement agencies were refusing to honor some or all requests to hold immigrants in detention from ICE. The agency says 17 of the 25 jurisdictions with the highest number of declined detainers are now participating in the program.\n\nImmigration in the US:\nAccording to 2012 figures, there are about 8 million unauthorized migrants either working or looking for work, or 5.1% of the labor force. Since 2009, more Mexicans have been leaving the US than entering, likely due to a slow economic recovery since the recession and stricter border enforcement. Barack Obama has deported more than 2.5 million people, more than any other president. His executive orders protect at least 1.2 million people from deportations.\n\nMeanwhile, immigration advocates have sued to obtain more details about how the PEP program actually differs from its predecessor. \"We suspect this PEP program was just a name change,\" said Jessica Bansel, legal director of the National Day Laborers Organizing Network. Bansel noted that while ICE can now ask local jails to simply inform them when an immigrant is in custody, not to detain them, the agency also has two new detainer forms that are specifically designed to request custody of a person who recently entered the country illegally, but has not been convicted of a crime and is not a security risk.\n\n\"This sort of makes the whole thing a joke,\" said Bansel.",
    " Title: Federal Judge Halts President Trump's Border Wall Construction Plans\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced plans to appeal a federal court ruling that halted his plans to construct a border wall using funds from the Pentagon, following a national emergency declaration. The ruling, issued by U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam, an Obama appointee, found that the president and his administration overstepped their powers by rearranging Pentagon funds for border wall construction.\n\nIn a tweet from Japan, where he was traveling, President Trump criticized Judge Gilliam, stating that he was enabling criminals by ruling against the president's most prominent campaign promise. The judge issued a preliminary injunction, finding that Congress is likely to prevail as the case proceeds, and blocked the government from carrying out wall-building that Mr. Trump said was already underway near El Paso, Texas, and Yuma, Arizona.\n\nJudge Gilliam's ruling is a significant setback for President Trump, who orchestrated a government shutdown to secure border wall funding, only to sign a bill to reopen the government without the wall money he sought. The judge wrote that Congress has repeatedly rejected legislation that would have funded substantially broader border barrier construction.\n\nThe ruling is based on the argument that the president is bound to spend only on what Congress authorizes. Judge Gilliam stated that the administration's reading of the relevant provisions, if accepted, would pose serious problems under the Constitution's separation of powers principles.\n\nThe Justice Department had argued that Congress did not explicitly deny the administration the ability to use the money, and in fact, included reprogramming abilities in the laws allowing the administration to shift substantial amounts of money within the Defense Department. However, Judge Gilliam ruled that the administration cannot siphon money from other accounts to fill the drug corridor fund, as it did to construct the border wall.\n\nThe ruling does not address the government's plans to tap the $3.6 billion in emergency declaration money, but given the tenor and reasoning in Friday's opinion, it is difficult to imagine Judge Gilliam would find the use of that money for a border wall legal at this point. Judge Gilliam is one of several courts hearing challenges to President Trump's emergency declaration, with cases in Texas and Washington, D.C., still ongoing.",
    " Title: Obama Faces Challenges in Second Term as Approval Ratings Dip\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama is facing challenges in his second term, with his approval ratings at a low ebb and a contentious political climate. A Gallup poll released Tuesday showed Obama's approval rating at 39 percent, marking a decline from previous polls.\n\nThe president's legislative agenda has faced obstacles, with major legislation such as the Affordable Care Act remaining contentious. The rollout of the health care law has been politically disastrous, putting the president on the defensive.\n\nObama and other Democrats have blamed Republicans for being intransigent, but the unceasing mode of castigating each other does not bode well for any future deal-making. House Republicans consider everything Obama proposes to be dead on arrival.\n\nOne of Obama's goals, a tax package enacted at the start of the year that raised income tax rates for top earners, only delayed the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration. The president has been unable to replace those cuts or reach any kind of broader budget agreement with Republicans.\n\nLast month's deal that ended the partial government shutdown called for a joint House-Senate committee to address larger fiscal concerns. The committee met once publicly, then adjourned for a month.\n\nOn other issues, Obama has failed to get traction. The Senate-passed immigration bill, a major second-term priority for the president, appears to have no life in the House.\n\nObama and his agenda are \"vastly more popular\" than the GOP, says Democratic consultant Jim Jordan. \"But we can count on the Republican Party to continue to obstruct policy that the public roundly supports,\" Jordan says. \"The president's legislative prospects are not particularly bright, as I think the White House will concede.\"\n\nRepublicans look at Tuesday's election results and see no evidence they suddenly need to embrace the president. Instead, they look at the most important Democratic victory, in the Virginia gubernatorial race, and see hope for their side.\n\nThe health care law may ultimately prove a great boon for the country, but in political terms, there could be more pain to come for Obama and his party. Obama's broken promise about people being able to keep insurance plans they liked has so far applied only to the relatively small market of people who buy coverage as individuals. If Americans who are covered through employer-backed plans see cost increases or other changes, Republicans will be sure to blame the law that bears the president's name.\n\n\"For Republicans, it's like the anti-war movement was for Democrats in 2006 \u2014 it's what they live for, fighting Obamacare,\" says William Schneider, a senior fellow at Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank. \"They'll stop at nothing, including shutting down the government.\"\n\nObama remains in an ongoing campaign mode, trying to sell ideas that his opponents will never accept. \"Very little is now possible that was not possible before,\" says Brendan Nyhan, a government professor at Dartmouth College. \"He looks like a very typical second-term president \u2014 not so popular, the agenda's stuck, a little bit of scandal is starting to creep out, and he's hunkering down to ride out the rest of his term.\"",
    " Title: Cruz Family's Investment in Senator Ted Cruz's 2012 Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 2013 interview with The Times, Senator Ted Cruz recounted that his wife, Heidi Cruz, agreed without hesitation to invest their entire savings into his campaign, despite his trailing in the polls and being considered a long shot against Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who spent $24 million of his own money on the race. Heidi Cruz later suggested a more nuanced perspective, telling Politico in 2014 that they should have applied \"common investment sense\" and not use their own money for the campaign unless it made a significant difference in winning.\n\nThe financial support from the Cruzes allowed Cruz's campaign to continue airing television ads before the primary election, including a $300,000 ad buy highlighting the story of Cruz's father's escape from Cuba in the 1950s. Cruz earned enough votes in the primary to qualify for a runoff, where he defeated Dewhurst and went on to win the general election.\n\nCandidates are required to list all assets they held at the close of the year or that generated income during the year in their filings with the Senate. According to Cruz's filings, at the close of 2011, he and his wife had cash and securities in bank, brokerage, and retirement accounts worth $1.3 million to $3.4 million. They also had mortgages and a loan against Cruz's partnership equity in his law firm. In 2012, they sold securities worth $82,000 to $355,000, and the value of other holdings was reduced by, at most, $155,000. However, they also added a money-market account with $250,000 to $500,000, and the value of other holdings increased by as much as $435,000. All told, the value of their cash and securities in 2012 saw a net increase of as much as $400,000\u2014even as the Cruzes were supposedly liquidating everything to finance Cruz's Senate campaign. The article does not mention any loans from banks.",
    " Title: President Obama's Statement on Muslim Rejection of Terrorism: A Fact-Check\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, former U.S. President Barack Obama emphasized the rejection of terrorism by the majority of Muslims worldwide. However, a fact-check of the statement reveals discrepancies with the findings of various polls and research studies.\n\nAccording to Pew Research, only 57% of Muslims in nine predominantly Islamic countries hold an unfavorable opinion of Al-Qaeda. This percentage is significantly lower than the 99.9% suggested by Obama. Similarly, Pew found that 33% of Muslims support Hamas, an organization responsible for a suicide bombing in a hotel in Netanya, Israel, that killed 30 and wounded 140 people.\n\nIt is important to note that Pew Research is a non-partisan organization that conducts extensive polling on what Muslims believe about current events. The findings suggest that a significant minority of Muslims hold favorable views towards extremist groups, contradicting Obama's statement.\n\nMoreover, the statement that Muslims have fought in every American war and serve in the U.S. military today is factually correct. However, the implication that Muslims are not associated with terrorism is not supported by the available data.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that the majority of Muslims want a good life for themselves and their families, the minority that supports extremist ideologies and terrorism is significant and cannot be ignored. President Obama's statement that 99.9% of Muslims reject terrorism is not supported by the available data.",
    " Title: Trump Acknowledges Reimbursement of Hush Money Payment to Stormy Daniels, Stresses Personal Nature of Transaction\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in his first public comments since his lawyer Rudy Giuliani disclosed that the president reimbursed attorney Michael Cohen for a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels, stated that the money was intended to quash \"false\" allegations and emphasized that campaign funds were not involved in the transaction.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Thursday, Trump addressed the $130,000 payment Cohen made to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, to maintain her silence regarding allegations of an affair in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThe president continued, \"These agreements are very common among celebrities and people of wealth. In this case, it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford (Daniels). The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair.\"\n\nTrump added that the agreement was a private one and that money from the campaign or campaign contributions played no role in the transaction.\n\nThe president's tweets referred to a letter written and signed by Daniels in January, stating \"with complete clarity\" that allegations of an affair with Trump were \"absolutely false.\" Daniels also wrote, at the time, that rumors that she received \"hush money\" from Trump were \"completely false.\"\n\nHowever, Trump also stated last month that he was not aware of the $130,000 payment. Giuliani, who recently joined Trump's legal team, revealed Wednesday night on Fox News' \"Hannity\" that Trump indeed made the reimbursement.\n\nGiuliani clarified on \"Fox & Friends\" on Thursday that Trump \"didn't know the details of this until we knew the details of this\" a couple of weeks ago. He has said Trump thought it was to cover unspecified \"expenses.\"\n\nGiuliani stressed that this was a personal payment and disputed any suggestion that it was an unreported campaign contribution.\n\n\"[Cohen] was trying to help the family...I think he was just being a good lawyer,\" he said.\n\n\"That money was not campaign money,\" Giuliani also said on \"Hannity.\" \"It's not campaign money. No campaign finance violation.\"\n\nGiuliani, who recently joined Trump's legal team, added that the money was \"funneled\" through a \"law firm and the president repaid it.\"\n\nWhether Giuliani's argument holds up remains to be seen. A candidate is allowed to contribute an unlimited amount to their campaign, but contributions are supposed to be officially reported. If the payments were wholly personal, there would be no campaign finance violations.\n\nHowever, Giuliani's argument that the payment was unrelated to the campaign could well be challenged. If it's considered a campaign-related expense, the onus may have been on the president or his campaign to report it as a loan.\n\nRichard L. Hasen, an expert in election law at the University of California, Irvine, stated that the greatest significance is that it implicates the president directly.\n\nDaniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Thursday morning that if it's \"true\" that Trump reimbursed Cohen, it's a \"crime\" with \"serious consequences.\"\n\nCohen previously has said the money he paid to Daniels came out of his own pocket. Both Trump's and Giuliani's statements now seem to contradict Cohen's account. Cohen is currently under criminal investigation as part of a grand jury probe looking into his personal business dealings.",
    " Title: Homeland Security Secretary Admits Error in Release of Illegal Immigrant, Urges Cooperation with Federal Agents\n\nArticle:\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson admitted on Tuesday that the administration erred in releasing an illegal immigrant to the sanctuary city of San Francisco before a shocking murder earlier this month. However, he stated that there is little the government can do to pressure sanctuary communities to change their policies.\n\nFacing lawmakers for the first time since the death of Kathryn Steinle, a 32-year-old woman killed while walking with her father, Mr. Johnson made personal appeals to San Francisco to reconsider its refusal to allow police to cooperate with federal immigration agents. He also expressed his hope that more jurisdictions will cooperate with the new Priority Enforcement Program.\n\nThe suspect in Steinle's slaying, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, was an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times before and was out on the streets after San Francisco refused to hold him for pickup by immigration agents. Lopez-Sanchez had just completed a federal prison sentence for one of his many illegal entries into the U.S., and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents had asked the Bureau of Prisons to hold him for pickup. Instead, the bureau shipped him to San Francisco, which wanted him on a decades-old drug warrant. San Francisco canceled that charge and, despite another request from ICE, released him per its sanctuary policy.\n\nMr. Johnson stated that his department and the Bureau of Prisons should be discussing these issues better, and that some discretion is probably needed so the bureau would have prioritized the homeland security claim over San Francisco's. The Bureau of Prisons did not respond to messages seeking comment on how it handled the case.\n\nRepublican lawmakers questioned Mr. Johnson's approach, with Rep. Trey Gowdy demanding to know why he and President Obama haven't taken a tougher stance on recalcitrant sanctuary cities. Steinle's death has refocused the immigration debate, with attention now on victims of illegal immigration.\n\nBeyond the sanctuary city issue, Mr. Johnson stated that border security is improving. Border Patrol agents are on pace to apprehend fewer than 400,000 illegal immigrants this year, which could be the lowest total since the 1970s. The agency says that means fewer people are even attempting to cross in the first place.\n\nHomeland Security has focused on illegal immigrants with serious criminal histories, all but ignoring rank-and-file illegal immigrants. This causes deportations to plummet and detention beds to go unused. Mr. Johnson stated they are approaching 31,000 beds being used on an average day, more than the 27,000 being held at the beginning of the year but still short of the 34,000 beds that Congress has mandated the department keep.\n\nEven as it leaves beds unused, the department continues to release immigrants with serious criminal records who go on to commit more crimes. More than 1,000 criminal aliens released into the community while awaiting deportation in 2014 were convicted of still more crimes after their release, including kidnapping, sexual assault against a child, and vehicular homicide, according to statistics released Tuesday by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte.",
    " Title: Edward Snowden's Whereabouts Remain Unclear as He Remains in Moscow Airport's Transit Zone\n\nArticle:\n\nEdward Snowden, the infamous National Security Agency (NSA) leaker, is reportedly still in the Moscow airport's transit zone, according to Russian officials. Despite numerous attempts to locate him, Snowden has remained elusive, with no confirmed sightings since his arrival more than a week ago.\n\nReporters, including those from the Associated Press, have swarmed the airport, but Snowden has remained invisible. Even his father, Lonnie Snowden, is still trying to establish a \"direct communications link\" with him, according to his attorney Bruce Fein.\n\nIan Phillips, the Associated Press Eastern Europe news director, spent 21 hours in the Moscow transit zone last week in an unsuccessful attempt to find Snowden. Phillips believes Snowden may be holed up in the Novotel, a hotel with one wing jutting into the international transit zone. However, Phillips admitted that Snowden could be in many other places.\n\nWikiLeaks, which is assisting Snowden, could potentially shed light on his whereabouts. On Monday, WikiLeaks announced it would make several important announcements during the day. Hours later, reports surfaced that the WikiLeaks adviser traveling with Snowden has submitted a request for political asylum to Russia. The details about his current whereabouts remain unclear.\n\nJulian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, was cagey during a Sunday show interview about Snowden's circumstances. He stated that the situation is a matter of \"international diplomatic negotiations.\" Last week, after Snowden landed in Moscow, Assange only said that Snowden and the WikiLeaks adviser are \"healthy and safe.\"\n\nSpeculation swirls about Snowden's whereabouts, but U.S. officials still believe he is at the Moscow airport. Russian news reports claimed last week he was at a hotel in the terminal itself. However, the Associated Press could not find any sign of Snowden at the on-site hotel or any worker who would confirm he was staying there.\n\nSnowden was not found in any of the VIP lounge areas. The Associated Press then sent Phillips to the Novotel on Thursday. Phillips described an \"Orwellian\" experience there, and on Monday, he recounted his visit to FoxNews.com.\n\nPhillips arrived last week with the understanding \"it was a long shot.\" He took a bus and \"walked in a free man into the lobby of what looked like a fantastic hotel.\" However, a guard came and took him to the old wing of the hotel where travelers with no visas\u2014like Snowden\u2014are kept under tight security.\n\nPhillips tried to call the other rooms and hang out in the corridor, hoping to catch a glimpse of Snowden. No luck. Any further movement was prohibited. \"I walked out the first night and the guard jumped up as if to say 'what are you doing,'\" Phillips said. \"I think we expected a bit more freedom to roam.\"\n\nWith Russia and now Ecuador trying to distance themselves from Snowden's case, it's unclear who has actually had face-to-face contact with him besides the WikiLeaks adviser.\n\nFein, the attorney for Snowden's father, told Fox News that the family is currently trying to get information to Edward Snowden so he can make an informed decision about what legal options are available. The father last week sent a letter to the Justice Department in hopes of securing a few key conditions for Snowden to return. He asked that Snowden not be detained before trial, not be subject to a gag order, and have a trial in a venue of his choosing.\n\nHowever, Fein clarified to Fox News that these are not \"ultimatums\" and that the father is also respecting his son's wishes. \"He's an adult. He has to chart his own destiny, and his father's not going to dictate that,\" Fein said.",
    " Title: Challenging Biased News Coverage: A Guide to Recognizing and Addressing Media Bias\n\nArticle:\n\nMedia outlets play a significant role in shaping cultural norms and political discourse. It is crucial for news media, along with other institutions, to strive for objectivity and accuracy. To challenge biased news coverage, one must first document instances of bias. Here are some questions to consider when evaluating newspaper, TV, and radio news:\n\n1. Be aware of the political perspective of the sources used in a story. Media often rely heavily on \"official\" sources, such as government, corporate, and establishment think tank representatives. A study found that in 40 months of Nightline programming, the most frequent guests were Henry Kissinger, Alexander Haig, Elliott Abrams, and Jerry Falwell, while progressive and public interest voices were underrepresented.\n\n2. To portray issues fairly and accurately, media must broaden their spectrum of sources. This includes counting the number of corporate and government sources versus the number of progressive, public interest, female, and minority voices. Demand that media expand their rolodexes, and provide them with lists of progressive and public interest experts in the community.\n\n3. Examine the race and gender diversity at the news outlet you consume compared to the communities it serves. How many producers, editors, or decision-makers at news outlets are women, people of color, or openly gay or lesbian? In order to fairly represent different communities, news outlets should have members of those communities in decision-making positions.\n\n4. Analyze the racial and gender composition of the experts media outlets cite. A study of Nightline's U.S. guests found they were 92 percent white and 89 percent male, while a similar survey of PBS's NewsHour found its guestlist was 90 percent white and 87 percent male.\n\n5. Demand that those affected by the issue have a voice in coverage. Political coverage often focuses on how issues affect politicians or corporate executives rather than those directly affected by the issue. For example, many stories on parental notification of abortion emphasize the \"tough choice\" confronting male politicians while quoting no women under 18\u2014those with the most at stake in the debate.\n\n6. Expose double standards by coming up with a parallel example or citing similar stories that were covered differently. For instance, does coverage of the drug crisis focus almost exclusively on African Americans, despite the fact that the vast majority of drug users are white?\n\n7. Educate journalists about misconceptions involved in stereotypes and how stereotypes characterize individuals unfairly.\n\n8. Be aware of loaded terminology that helps shape public opinion. For example, media often use the right-wing buzzword \"racial preference\" to refer to affirmative action programs, which can significantly impact how the issue is perceived.\n\n9. Challenge the assumption directly. Bringing assumptions to the surface often demonstrates their absurdity.\n\n10. Provide context to help journalists understand the full picture. Misleading headlines have a significant impact, as many people only skim headlines.\n\n11. Look at where stories appear. Newspaper articles on the most widely read pages (the front pages and the editorial pages) and lead stories on television and radio will have the greatest influence on public opinion.\n\nBy asking these questions and taking action when necessary, individuals can help challenge biased news coverage and promote a more accurate and fair representation of the world in media.",
    " Title: Senate Candidates Distance Themselves from Obama in Debates Ahead of Election Day\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final four weeks before Election Day, the influence of President Obama is prevalent in several key Senate races across Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia. During Tuesday's debates, Republican candidates frequently brought up Obama, attempting to distance their Democratic opponents from the unpopular president.\n\nIn races where an incumbent Democrat is running for reelection, the attacks were consistent: the candidates have voted with Obama 99%, 96%, or 97% of the time. In races for open seats, Democrats were portrayed as Obama's allies.\n\nThe responses from the Democrats were uniform: they disagreed with the characterization, stating they were running against their Republican opponents, not Obama.\n\nIn the North Carolina debate, Senator Kay Hagan (D) was asked for ways she disagrees with Obama and the Democrats. Hagan, who is in a tight race with state House Speaker Thom Tillis (R), outlined her disagreements on issues such as the use of military force in Syria, the Keystone XL pipeline, trade deals, and military budget cuts.\n\nIn Virginia, Senator Mark Warner (D) also distanced himself from Obama, despite his comfortable lead against GOP challenger Ed Gillespie. Like Hagan, Senator Warner expressed support for the Keystone pipeline and offshore drilling in Virginia, provided the state shares in the revenue.\n\nIn West Virginia, underdog candidate Natalie Tennant (D) joined her Republican opponent, Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R), in opposing proposed regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency that would tighten standards on coal-burning power plants.\n\nPolitical handicappers give Republicans a slight advantage in their quest to retake control of the Senate, but no one rules out the Democrats' chances of holding on. The debates saw no major gaffes, though North Carolina's Thom Tillis misstated Senator Hagan's committee assignments in the Senate multiple times before being corrected.\n\nThe bad news for Democrats is that Obama's low job approvals weigh heavily, particularly in red states. Obama himself invited the distancing when he declared that his policies are \"on the ballot\" on Nov. 4. However, Obama was already a significant factor, in spirit if not literally, well before he made that statement.\n\nThe news wasn't all bad for the president Tuesday. In Colorado, Senator Mark Udall (D), facing a stiff challenge from Rep. Cory Gardner (R), deflected efforts to get him to criticize the president. Udall also offered strong support for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the president's signature initiative.\n\nIn Georgia, Democrat Michelle Nunn hesitated when asked her opinion of the ACA, before listing ways the law could be improved.\n\nDemocrats also came prepared with their own attack lines in Tuesday's debates, tailored to each state and candidate. In North Carolina, Hagan criticized the state General Assembly under Tillis's leadership, while in Georgia, Nunn went after her Republican opponent, David Perdue, for his business career. In Colorado, Udall attacked Congressman Gardner for his past support for \"personhood\" measures, which assert that life begins at conception and would ban some forms of contraception.\n\nGardner responded, \"It's simply outrageous to believe that someone would try to ban birth control.\" Perdue, in response to criticism of his business career, called outsourcing a part of American business.",
    " Title: US Attorney General Defends Border Separation Policy, UN Calls for Immediate Halt\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent radio interview, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended the controversial policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. Sessions stated that while authorities prefer to keep children close to their parents, this is not always possible. The issue has sparked a growing controversy after U.S. officials confirmed hundreds of child migrants had been removed from their families.\n\nOn Tuesday, the United Nations called on the U.S. to \"immediately halt\" the separations. When asked whether it was \"absolutely necessary\" to separate children from their parents, Mr. Sessions replied in the affirmative. He argued that many U.S. children are taken away from their families if their parents are serving prison sentences.\n\nMr. Sessions also stated that migrant children were \"being well taken care of.\" He added, \"It's certainly not our goal to separate children, but I do think it's clear, it's legitimate to warn people who come to the country unlawfully bringing children with them that they can't expect that they'll always be kept together.\"\n\nIn early May, Mr. Sessions announced that anyone found crossing the border illegally would be prosecuted and face possible separation from their children. Previously, those crossing the border illegally for the first time were often charged with a misdemeanor offense, before often being released to face a court hearing. Most never turned up for those hearings, say Trump administration officials.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Office's spokeswoman, Ravina Shamdasani, criticized the policy on Tuesday and said that several hundred children, some as young as one, appeared to have been affected. \"The use of immigration detention and family separation as a deterrent runs counter to human rights standards and principles,\" she said. \"The child's best interest should always come first, including over migration management objectives or other administrative concerns.\"\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection has confirmed that more than 650 children were separated from parents at the border over a fortnight in May. US Ambassador Nikki Haley responded by accusing the UN of \"hypocrisy\" and said that \"neither the United Nations nor anyone else will dictate how the United States upholds its borders.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has tried to shift blame for family separations, claiming they were caused by bad legislation passed by Democrats. However, a fact check by the Associated Press news agency found there was no law requiring families to be separated at the border and that it was a new policy from the Trump administration.\n\nHowever, the problem of children ending up in border immigration holding centers is not a new issue. Jon Favreau, a speechwriter for President Barack Obama, recently tweeted photos of young people being held in a chain-link fence enclosure at a facility in Texas, using the images to excoriate Mr. Trump. Mr. Favreau apparently did not realize the images were taken in 2014 when his former boss, Mr. Obama, was president.",
    " Title: Deadly Shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas Triggers Calls for Gun Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nA shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas on Friday left at least 10 people dead and another 10 injured, making it the deadliest school shooting since the February 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The 17-year-old shooter carried a shotgun and a revolver, and explosive devices were found at the school and the areas surrounding it.\n\nThe tragedy in Santa Fe is still under investigation, and the police are piecing together what happened in the hallways of this high school on Friday morning. The shooting has reinvigorated the gun reform debate, with survivors of the Parkland shooting offering solidarity and support to the survivors of Santa Fe High School.\n\nThe Parkland activists, who have been vocal in their calls for gun control, have seized on this rampage at Santa Fe as another example of lawmakers' failure to act. They also offered solidarity and support to the survivors of Santa Fe High School, who have joined this sorrowful club.\n\nEmma Gonzalez, one of the most vocal Parkland activists, wrote on Twitter, \"You deserve more than Thoughts and Prayers, and after supporting us by walking out we will be there to support you by raising up your voices.\"\n\nDavid Hogg, another Parkland activist, tweeted, \"Get ready for two weeks of media coverage of politicians acting like they give a shit when in reality they just want to boost their approval ratings before midterms.\"\n\nThe Parkland shooting in February sparked a movement among teenagers across the country, with students organizing school walkouts in March and another in April, or marching for gun control in their cities and towns.\n\nIn the wake of the Santa Fe shooting, high school students in Washington, D.C. protested at the Capitol on Friday, and several were arrested. The group that organized the National School Walkout on April 20 called for a moment of silence at 2pm Friday in solidarity with the victims. A March for Our Lives chapter in Salt Lake City rallied at the Utah State Capitol.\n\nThe community's and the state's reaction to the shooting will likely determine if, and how, lawmakers respond, both in Texas and on the federal level. Santa Fe High School held a walkout on April 20, on the 19th anniversary of Columbine, to call for gun control. In a picture on social media, students hold up a sign that reads: \"Santa Fe High School says # NeverAgain.\"",
    " Title: Trump Calls for a War on Washington Waste in Bid to Regain Fiscal Responsibility\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublicans are seeking to regain the offensive on fiscal issues, as the GOP has reportedly allowed big-spending Democrats to appear more financially responsible in terms of balanced budgets. According to polls, Democrats are now more trusted on balancing the budget than Republicans, a situation likened to losing an arm wrestling contest with Nancy Pelosi.\n\nTo regain American trust on fiscal responsibility, President Donald Trump is expected to deliver a nationally televised prime-time speech from the Oval Office, announcing an \"all-hands-on-deck War on Washington Waste.\" The proposed initiative aims to declare a debt-spending emergency, with Trump's commitment to this initiative potentially boosting his approval ratings.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office recently announced that the government is now spending $2 billion more than it takes in every day. This spending trend is alarming, with the government's outlays now exceeding $4 trillion per year.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, a taxpayer watchdog group called OpenTheBooks.com published an open letter signed by former Senator Tom Coburn and Tom Smith, urging a waste war and listing hundreds of examples of taxpayer dollars being wasted. The following table lists some of these instances:\n\n| Item                   | Estimated Waste |\n|------------------------|----------------|\n| Pentagon               | $125 billion    |\n| Unnecessary Earmarks    | $100 billion    |\n| Duplicate Programs      | $ 50 billion    |\n| Unused Property         | $ 25 billion    |\n| Improper Payments      | $ 100 billion   |\n\nWhen President Trump was shown these lists of white elephants, he reportedly responded, \"I thought we already took care of this.\" Unfortunately, the bureaucratic blob ensured that it would not happen.\n\nFighting this war on waste won't be easy. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan appointed the Grace Commission to identify waste, duplication, and inefficiency in the federal government. This commission, composed of private-sector businesspeople, uncovered $420 billion in bureaucratic overspending and called for the elimination of hundreds of bureaus, agencies, and departments that served no purpose.\n\nTrump has called for a 5% cut in the budget of every federal agency in 2019. OpenTheBooks wants Trump to require every agency to list all spending items as little as $100 on a government website, allowing for public monitoring of how the money is being spent. They also want the president to report to the American people each month on the progress made in every agency in cutting their budgets.\n\nAlmost nothing would do more to guarantee Donald Trump's reelection than a crusade to weed out the hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud, inefficiency, and duplication in Washington. A successful businessman, Trump is well-positioned to lead this initiative. A government that is going broke and yet still spends tens of thousands of dollars a year on pianos, hundreds of millions of dollars a year on public relations firms, and billions of dollars a year sending Social Security checks to dead people is not serious about balancing the budget or spending taxpayer money with the same care they spend their own.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Becomes First Woman Nominated for U.S. Presidency by Major Party\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic moment at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders nominated Hillary Clinton as the party's nominee for the presidency of the United States. Clinton, who accepted the nomination later in the evening, became the first woman to be nominated by a major political party for the position of president.\n\nClinton, in her acceptance speech, acknowledged the significance of the moment, stating, \"If there are any little girls out there who stayed up late to watch, let me just say: I may become the first woman president, but one of you is next.\"\n\nThe nomination of Clinton, which occurred 240 years into the existence of the United States, follows the 1919 amendment of the Constitution that gave women the right to vote. However, state restrictions made it difficult for women (and men of color) to exercise that right into the 1960s.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention, chaired by Ohio Representative Marcia Fudge, marked several precedents. Fudge, the first African-American and first female mayor of Warrensville Heights, Ohio, was joined at the helm by two other African-American women: Rev. Leah Daughtry, the chief executive officer of the convention, and Donna Brazile, the interim Democratic National Committee chair.\n\nThe convention also featured ground-breaking speakers such as Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski, who was the first Democratic woman to be elected to the Senate in 1987, and Madeleine Albright, the country's first female secretary of state. Bill Clinton, the former president, was also a keynote speaker, offering a personal portrait of his wife to counter the narrative of corruption and scandal that has at times surrounded the campaign.\n\nThe theme of \"firsts\" will continue on Wednesday night, with President Obama, the first African-American president, offering his support of Clinton. On Monday, Clinton received the support of another history-maker, Michelle Obama, the nation's first African-American first lady.\n\nThis report includes material from the Associated Press and Reuters.",
    " Title: Arkansas and New Hampshire Democrats Accuse Republican Senate Candidates of Threatening Health Care Coverage for Low-Income Residents\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing political battle over the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, Democrats in Arkansas and New Hampshire are accusing their Republican Senate candidates of potentially stripping health care coverage from the state's poorest residents.\n\nRepublican Tom Cotton, who is running against Democratic Sen. Mark L. Pryor, has an anti-Obamacare platform that could jeopardize the federal funds Arkansas is leveraging to provide private health insurance policies for low-income residents. If Obamacare is repealed, the coverage of at least 155,000 Arkansas residents could be affected, according to Democrats.\n\nSimilar criticisms are being leveled at Republican Scott Brown, who is vying for a U.S. Senate seat in New Hampshire. Brown is reportedly wary of a compromise that uses Medicaid dollars to buy commercial insurance for more than 50,000 residents.\n\nThe \"private option,\" a method of insuring residents making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, was a palatable solution for some state Republicans, serving as a key, yet optional, component of President Obama's health care law. However, supporters of Senate Democrats in tight re-election races aim to portray Republican challengers as endangering low-income residents' health care coverage without significantly expanding traditional Medicaid rolls.\n\nErik Dorey, spokesman for Pryor's campaign, stated, \"This is not an issue we\u2019ve been shy about talking about.\"\n\nConservatives argue that Democrats should not equate state-level decisions with success in congressional races. If Democratic incumbents dismiss Republican calls to repeal Obamacare, Republican challengers will counter with stories of canceled health plans, higher premiums, and narrower doctor networks in the lead-up to November's mid-term elections, they said.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Greg Moore, state director for Americans for Prosperity in New Hampshire, which has run ads against incumbent Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, portrays her as the cause of limited health care choices in the state. Shaheen, however, has stated her commitment to assisting New Hampshire implement its Medicaid expansion plan to cover 58,000 people under the state's private option plan.\n\nArkansas pioneered the private option as a means to implement Obamacare's Medicaid expansion last year, attracting enough GOP support to overcome the three-fourths voting threshold needed to pass appropriations in Little Rock. As of March 31, about 155,567 people, or roughly 70 percent of 225,000 eligible residents, had signed up for coverage under the program.\n\nIn Arkansas, Anna Strong, health policy director at Arkansas Advocates for Children & Families, emphasized, \"These are families that are working, they\u2019re going to school, they\u2019re supporting their families.\"\n\nCotton, who assumed his House seat in 2013, voted to repeal President Obama's health care law last May. If Obamacare is repealed, the funding for the state's private-option health care would also disappear, according to his opponents. However, the Cotton campaign asserts that Obamacare \"is such bad policy that it has made every state choose between multiple bad options.\"\n\nIn New Hampshire, the initial wave of coverage under the state's Medicaid expansion is set to begin in July. The federal government is slated to pay for 100 percent of the expanded Medicaid population from 2014 to 2016, a contribution that decreases to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond.\n\nBrown, who has made his home in Rye, N.H., his main residence ahead of the campaign, has expressed concerns about the state's Medicaid expansion, stating, \"Their concerns are what happens at the end of three years? Is it then going to be an unfunded federal mandate, that the citizens of New Hampshire will have a whole new program that they didn\u2019t really want?\"",
    " Title: EPA's Carbon Regulation: Flexible Approach for Kentucky with Potential Short-term Disruptions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has endorsed a flexible approach for states, including Kentucky, to reduce carbon emissions, with the state having the autonomy to devise a plan to meet its carbon reduction target. In Kentucky's case, a 18% reduction of carbon pollution by 2030 is expected, taking into account the state's heavy reliance on coal, which accounts for 93% of its electricity.\n\nThe EPA's regulation is based on a 23-page \"white paper\" sent by Kentucky's energy department last year, requesting states be given wide flexibility in reducing carbon emissions. Instead of regulating emissions from every smokestack, the EPA is providing states with an overall target to meet.\n\nKentucky can achieve the goal by switching plants from coal to natural gas, developing renewable energy like solar, and encouraging the use of efficient home appliances and insulation to reduce demand. The implementation of these changes is not immediate, with any shutdowns years away, as the EPA's proposal faces a political and legal onslaught.\n\nHowever, the implementation of the plan could lead to short-term disruptions, including to local economies tied to individual coal plants that might close, and in mining regions like eastern Kentucky, where the number of coal jobs is already at a historic low. The EPA estimated that coal production in central Appalachia would fall by up to 37% as a result of its proposal.\n\nResidents in affected areas, such as Dionna Sizemore of Burgin, a mother of two, ages 11 and 16, who moved from Harlan County, the heart of Appalachian coal country, to escape dead-end prospects there, are concerned about the potential impact on their communities. \"It's going to be devastating if the power plant goes down,\" said Sizemore. \"We know the impact it's having on friends and family back home: people having to move off.\"\n\nThe exact number of Kentucky's 56 coal-fired generating units that might close is uncertain at this stage, as it is impossible to say which, if any, might close. Many have already installed costly upgrades to comply with earlier pollution rules.",
    " Title: Andrew Tahmooressi Case: Questions Raised Over Former Marine's Story\n\nArticle:\n\nThe case of Andrew Tahmooressi, a former Marine who was arrested in Mexico on weapons charges in March, has gained significant attention from the Tea Party and conservative media. Tahmooressi's mother, Jill Tahmooressi, has frequently appeared on Fox News, and 74 Tea Party Congress members have signed a letter demanding his release from a Mexican jail and urging the closure of the border until Tahmooressi is freed.\n\nThe story has been extensively covered on Fox News and conservative websites, including the Drudge Report, WorldNetDaily, and Breitbart. All of these outlets echo Tahmooressi's claim that his entry into Mexico with a fully loaded AR-15 5.56 caliber assault-style rifle, a chrome-plated 1911 model Colt.45 caliber pistol, a 12-gauge shotgun, extra clips for the rifle and the pistol, and 457 rounds of ammunition was a simple mistake due to a wrong turn.\n\nHowever, some facts are not in dispute. Andrew Tahmooressi served two tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and was promoted to sergeant before being honorably discharged from the Marine Corps. A native of Weston, Florida, he had recently moved to the San Diego area to receive treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder at the VA hospital in La Jolla. On March 31, Tahmooressi parked his pickup truck and walked across the border at the El Chaparral crossing from San Ysidro, California, to Tijuana, Mexico. He spent the day in Tijuana and later that night returned to the American side of the border. Then he got into his truck and drove back across the border, where he was arrested at 10:30 p.m. by Mexican authorities.\n\nTahmooressi and his mother have both consistently claimed that he was driving south on I-5 from La Jolla, on the way to have dinner with friends in San Ysidro, when he missed the last exit before the border and accidentally crossed into Mexico. However, new evidence has turned up, including cellphone records and a hotel receipt, that casts doubt on Tahmooressi's story.\n\nFirstly, Tahmooressi now admits that he had parked his truck at a lot just north of the border earlier in the day and walked into Tijuana. This means when he walked back across the border to his truck, he was already as far south as it is possible to be and still be in the U.S. The second problem is the San Ysidro crossing is the busiest land border crossing in the world. It is large, well-marked, and brightly lit at night on both sides. Even had he been driving south on I-5, which we now know he was not, I-5 is a multilane freeway with numerous signs and ample opportunities to exit and turn around. Even had he somehow missed all of these, there are clearly marked turnaround lines only a few yards from the border.\n\nIn the past week, new evidence has turned up, including cellphone records and a hotel receipt, that casts even more doubt on Tahmooressi's story. Far from being unfamiliar with the San Ysidro crossing, as he originally claimed, cellphone and ATM records show that he had crossed the border five or six times in recent weeks. He has now admitted as much, saying he went to visit a Tijuana woman who works in the notorious Zona de Tolerancia, Tijuana's red light district, with whom he was developing a relationship.\n\nThanks to a receipt, a copy of which was published in the Tijuana news weekly Zeta, we now know that Tahmooressi had taken a room at the Hotel Nelson, a $24-a-night \"hot sheet\" hotel on the edge of the Zona de Tolerancia. His mother has confirmed that the receipt is authentic, but claims that Tahmooressi was afraid to spend the night there, which is why he returned to San Ysidro.\n\nIn the wake of this new evidence, Tahmooressi has secured new counsel to represent him, his third attorney in four months. Jill Tahmooressi, who had been ever present on Fox News and social media, has gone silent and returned to Florida. A press event scheduled for last week in San Diego to garner support for Tahmooressi was abruptly canceled without explanation. In the meantime, larger signs have been installed at approaches to the border warning that guns are illegal in Mexico and highlighting turnaround areas.\n\nIt is unclear why Tahmooressi would try to enter Mexico with a small arsenal and hundreds of rounds of ammunition if he did not make a wrong turn and cross the border accidentally, as the preponderance of evidence suggests. Whatever his reasons, one thing seems sure: Barring a decision by the Mexican government to pardon him, which seems unlikely at this point, it looks like Andrew Tahmooressi could spend a long time in a Mexican prison. It also seems certain that once again the conservative media machine has backed the wrong pony and sold its consumers a story that, to put it mildly, is simply not true. Whatever his intentions were, it's highly unlikely that this troubled young man suffering PTSD will find the help he needs in a Mexican prison.\n\nUpdate: At an evidentiary hearing last week, presided over by Judge Victor Octavio Luna Escobedo, Tahmooressi's attorney, Fernando Benitez, began to lay out his defense. In Benitez's questioning of the border guards, it became clear that he believes the best hope for acquittal is to claim that proper procedures were not followed. Mexican authorities strenuously denied this claim, testifying that standard protocol was strictly followed, and that Tahmooressi's rights under Mexican law were protected at all times.\n\nBoth sides said the trial is likely to last at least until November. Tahmooressi's attorney has asked that a videotape be entered into evidence, hoping the tape, which the defense has not seen, will show the search of Tahmooressi's truck was somehow illegal. Experts on Mexican law say this is a long shot, but as Tahmooressi is facing a mandatory seven to 14 years in prison, his attorney told reporters his only hope was to secure an outright acquittal.\n\nIt is also expected that cellphone and ATM records, as well as additional evidence, including the hotel receipt, will be presented by prosecutors at the next hearing. After all of the evidence has been presented, it will be up to the judge to find Tahmooressi guilty or not guilty.",
    " Title: Turkey Resumes Delivery of Russian S-400 Missile System Amidst US Sanctions Threat\n\nArticle:\n\nTurkey has resumed the delivery of the Russian S-400 missile defense system, despite strong opposition and economic sanctions threats from the United States. The second shipment of equipment necessary to make the S-400s operational was delivered on Saturday, following the first delivery on Friday.\n\nDefense Minister Hulusi Akar of Turkey stated that the acquisition of the S-400s was a necessity due to the country being under \"serious threat.\" Akar made these comments during a phone call with his American counterpart, Mark Esper, on Friday.\n\nThe US has urged Turkey to abandon the deal, warning of economic sanctions that could reportedly cost over $2 billion. The S-400 deal marks the first such move between a NATO member and Russia.\n\nAkar told Esper that Turkey's purchase of the controversial defense system does not signify a change in the country's strategic orientation. He emphasized that Turkey is still assessing a bid to acquire the US Patriot air-defense system and that deteriorating bilateral relations would not serve the interests of either country.\n\nUS officials have urged Turkey to purchase Patriot missiles instead of the S-400s from Russia. However, Ankara claims that the United States refused to sell Patriots to Turkey, leading it to seek other vendors. Russia offered a better deal, including technology transfers, according to Turkey.\n\nThe US has stated that Turkey will not be allowed to participate in the program to produce F-35 stealth fighter jets or buy them. Washington has repeatedly said the Russian missiles are incompatible with NATO systems and a threat to the F-35s.\n\nThe purchase of the S-400 system has raised concerns in Western circles that Turkey may be drifting closer to Russia's sphere of influence. Ankara has refused to yield to pressure from Washington, insisting that choosing defense equipment is a matter of national sovereignty.\n\nNATO, which includes Turkey as a member, is reportedly \"concerned about the potential consequences\" of the S-400 purchase. Members of the US Congress have repeatedly voiced opposition to the move and threatened sanctions.\n\nThe New York-based ratings firm, Fitch Ratings, downgraded Turkey's sovereign rating to \"BB-\" on Friday and warned of the potential significant impact of sanctions on investor sentiment.\n\nThe purchase of the S-400 system has been described as a political statement by some analysts, with Afzal Ashraf, a professor of conflict security at the University of Nottingham in the UK, stating that it demonstrates that the US does not have hegemony and control over NATO members.\n\nMustafa Adyin, from Turkey's Kadir Has University, noted that Turkey has said it is \"totally free\" to use the defense system as it sees fit, but the extent of the restrictions imposed by Russia in the deal remains unclear.\n\nThe ongoing situation between Turkey and the US could mark a new low in their already-tense relations. Last year, the US imposed sanctions on Turkey over the detention of an American pastor, triggering a Turkish currency crisis. The sanctions were later lifted upon the pastor's release.",
    " Title: Quote Approval Becomes Standard Practice in Political Campaigns and Government Agencies\n\nArticle:\n\nQuote approval has become a common practice in political campaigns and government agencies, particularly in high-level interviews. This is evident in the Obama campaign, where almost all mid-level aides and top strategists, including the campaign manager Jim Messina and senior White House adviser David Plouffe, have their quotes approved by the press office before they are released to the media. The Romney campaign also insists that journalists interviewing any of Mitt Romney's five sons agree to use only quotations that are approved by the press office.\n\nThe practice of quote approval is not limited to the political sphere. It is also prevalent in Washington and on the campaign trail. Officials who speak out of school, fearing off-message remarks, often shroud even the most innocuous and anodyne quotations in anonymity by insisting they be referred to as a \"top Democrat\" or a \"Republican strategist.\"\n\nThis practice poses a double-edged sword for journalists, who are getting the on-the-record quotes they have long asked for, but are losing much of the spontaneity and authenticity in their interviews. The changes made to quotes are usually small and seemingly unnecessary, according to those who spoke on the record.\n\nThe Obama campaign declined to make Plouffe or Messina available to explain their media practices. The White House, on the other hand, has made a concerted effort to make more officials available to the news media, according to Jay Carney, the White House press secretary.\n\nBoth presidential campaigns are keenly aware of what can happen when they speak too freely. Damaging sound bites can live on in the news cycle for days, as evidenced by President Obama's \"the private sector is doing fine\" remark and Eric Fehrnstrom's \"Etch A Sketch\" comment.\n\nReporters who have covered the Obama presidency say the quote-approval process fits a pattern by this White House of finding new ways to limit its exposure in the news media. The White House's latest innovation is a variation of the background briefing called the \"deep-background briefing,\" which it holds for groups of reporters, sometimes several dozen at a time. Reporters may paraphrase what senior administration officials say, but they are forbidden to put anything in quotation marks or identify the speakers.",
    " Title: Sen. Joe Manchin to Meet with Senators over Expanded Background Checks Proposal\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia), a co-author of the expanded background checks proposal, is set to meet with individual senators next week in an attempt to garner more support for the legislation. The key question Manchin wants answered is whether a \"minimal change\" to the compromise background check proposal he co-authored with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania would entice more senators to support it.\n\nSince the proposal failed to gain enough support in a vote last month, senators who voted against it have been confronted in their states during the current recess by outside proponents of expanding background checks. Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-New Hampshire) has been the most high-profile target of such confrontations.\n\nGun-control activists, including Erica Lafferty, the daughter of Dawn Hochsprung, a school principal slain in the Newtown massacre last December, have questioned senators and run ads against lawmakers who voted against the Toomey-Manchin compromise and have supported senators who supported it.\n\nThe pressure tactics appear to be working, with polls showing most Americans favoring some sort of new gun restrictions. In order to pass any legislation around the issue, gun control advocates need to find 60 votes in the Senate. Fifty-four senators backed the Manchin-Toomey amendment while 46 opposed it.\n\nManchin's prime targets to flip are all Republicans, including Sen. Ayotte, Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada. Proponents hope that if Murkowski flips, those in favor of tightening gun laws will have a good shot at getting her fellow Alaskan, Sen. Mark Begich, to do the same. However, a source close to Begich told CNN that it is very unlikely that he would change his vote.\n\nThe NRA is likely to be a significant factor in any deal on background checks, much like it was during the last debate. After the compromise background check proposal failed, the NRA Institute for Legislative Action released a statement decrying the \"misguided\" amendment. The NRA is expected to be a powerful force at the upcoming NRA annual convention in Houston this weekend, with several potential 2016 GOP nominees in attendance, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pennsylvania), and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin also spoke to the group.\n\nRepublican Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona), asked by one of the other victims of the Giffords shooting if he thought background checks would come up again, said there was a \"50-50\" chance that it would. A spokeswoman for Democratic Sen. Max Baucus (D-Montana), one of the more high-profile Democrats to vote against the provision, told CNN that if such a bill were to come up, \"Max will evaluate it based on the feedback he gathers from the people of Montana, just as he always does with any legislation.\" However, she also said that in his first vote, \"Montanans told Max loud and clear they did not support new gun controls in the previous bill.\"",
    " Title: \"Panama Papers Expose Offshore Financial Dealings of World Leaders and Celebrities\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe publication of the so-called \"Panama Papers\" on Monday has led to a global backlash, with legal investigations launched in several European countries and the Obama administration calling for greater transparency in the global financial system. The leak, orchestrated by a Washington-based investigative group, exposed the offshore financial dealings of dozens of wealthy, famous, and powerful individuals worldwide.\n\nThe anonymous leak of confidential records from a high-powered Panamanian law firm revealed financial schemes to create shell companies and hide billions of dollars in taxable income and profits. Leaders from Iceland, Ukraine, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United States are among those implicated in the massive document trove.\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande said the revelations could be beneficial, stating, \"These revelations are good news because they will increase tax revenues from those who commit fraud.\" The names and records of at least 29 individuals on Forbes magazine's 500 richest people list have been found in the files, which include financial spreadsheets, client records, corporate registries, passports, and other documents.\n\nThe records expose apparent shell company dealings by world-famous celebrities such as Argentine soccer star Lionel Messi and his father. They raise questions about the financial maneuverings of many international leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping's brother-in-law and Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Prime Minister David Cameron is under fire amid questions about his late father's tax avoidance. In Russia, the scandal faced an effective coverage ban, but heads are already beginning to roll in other nations, with outrage particularly fierce in Iceland, where thousands of protesters called for the ouster of Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson.\n\nThe records indicate that Mr. Gunnlaugsson co-owned a company called Wintris Inc., set up in 2007 on the Caribbean island of Tortola in the British Virgin Islands, to hold investments for his now-wife, Anna Sigurlaug Palsdottir.\n\nMossack Fonseca, the Panamanian law firm at the heart of the scandal, has vehemently denied any illegal activity. Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela issued a statement saying his government has \"zero tolerance\" for illicit financial activities and would cooperate \"vigorously\" with any judicial investigation arising from the leak of the law firm's documents.\n\nDetails of the leak came to light Sunday through a slew of articles published by an international coalition of media outlets that worked with the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) to examine Mossack Fonseca records. While the firm has more than 35 international operations, including an office in Las Vegas and a representative in Miami, it is one of the world's top five creators of shell companies, which can have legitimate business uses but can also be used to dodge taxes and launder money.\n\nMajor international banks, including HSBC, UBS, Credit Suisse, and Deutsche Bank, were named as having worked with the Panamanian law firm to create offshore accounts. Carlos Sousa, a spokesman for the firm, told reporters, \"We have not once in nearly 40 years of operation been charged with criminal wrongdoing. We're proud of the work we do, notwithstanding recent and willful attempts by some to mischaracterize it.\"\n\nBlaming Mossack Fonseca for what people do with their companies, firm co-founder Ramon Fonseca told Panamanian television last month, would be like blaming an automaker \"for an accident or if the car was used in a robbery.\" The Munich-based German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung said it was offered the data more than a year ago through an encrypted channel by an anonymous source. The source sought unspecified security measures but no compensation, said Bastian Obermayer, a reporter for the paper. Suddeutsche Zeitung ultimately shared the data with the ICIJ, which enlisted other partners and hundreds of investigative journalists from around the world to examine the files.\n\nIn total, the documents reference some 214,488 companies and 14,153 clients of the Panamanian firm, according to the ICIJ. \"It allows a never-before-seen view inside the offshore world\u2014providing a day-to-day, decade-by-decade look at how dark money flows through the global financial system, breeding crime and stripping national treasuries of tax revenues,\" the ICIJ said in a statement on Sunday.",
    " Title: Clinton Foundation Accepts Donations from Foreign Governments, Former President Defends Relationships with Middle Eastern Nations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the Clinton Global Initiative University at Miami University in Coral Gables, Florida, former President Bill Clinton addressed the Clinton Foundation's decision to accept donations from foreign governments. The foundation's choice to accept such donations has been questioned by critics as a potential conflict of interest, particularly since some of the funds were received during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, a position she held until 2013.\n\nRegarding donations from Middle Eastern nations such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, President Clinton stated, \"I believe they do a lot more good than harm.\" He cited the governments' and donations' role in combating the self-declared Islamic State or ISIS.\n\nHowever, The Miami Herald reported that not all of the funds complied with recent fundraising pacts with the White House, despite President Clinton's defense of the countries as friendly donors. The former president acknowledged that a $500,000 contribution from the Algerian government was not in compliance with the agreement.\n\nPresident Clinton made no mention of his wife's recent controversy surrounding her use of a personal email account while working for the State Department. Critics argue this lack of transparency, despite Hillary Clinton's request for the release of her emails, shows a lack of commitment to transparency. The Herald outlined the difference between using a private account as opposed to a public server, stating that it was \"impossible to know which emails, if any, were deleted or not turned over.\"\n\nSo far, over 55,000 pages of correspondence have been reviewed. The AP quoted Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short, who accused Hillary Clinton of \"hiding from the press and voters.\" He stated he believes she lives by her own set of ethical rules.\n\nIn an effort to address recent PR issues, the Clintons have selected Donna Shalala, Bill Clinton's former Secretary of Health and Human Services, as the next CEO of their large and widely-respected foundation. Shalala, a close friend and ally of the Clintons, has not shied away from criticizing some of the administration's policies.\n\nKnown for her candor in the Clinton administration, Shalala disagreed with President Clinton's decision to run the ill-fated health care task force, led by Hillary Clinton, from the White House. Shalala has been president of Miami University for 14 years and is an accomplished fundraiser, having secured over $3 billion during her time with the university.\n\nDuring the event on Saturday, Hillary Clinton avoided the recent controversies, focusing instead on issues like the Affordable Care Act, Saturday's 50-year anniversary of the march in Selma, Alabama, and her work promoting equal rights for women. She is soon expected to release a report titled \"No Ceiling,\" part of the larger \"Not There\" program addressing gender inequality.",
    " Title: Trump Hires Brad Parscale as Campaign Manager for 2020 Re-election Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has appointed Brad Parscale, the digital media director of his 2016 campaign, to manage his re-election bid, the campaign announced on Tuesday. The announcement was initially reported by The Drudge Report, a conservative news website with significant influence within the White House.\n\nThe President's decision to run for re-election in 2020 was not unexpected, as he filed for re-election shortly after his 2017 inauguration. However, it is unusual for a sitting president to hire a campaign manager three years before the election.\n\nSarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, stated in June 2017 that Trump was planning to run for re-election in 2020. Eric Trump, one of the President's sons, praised Parscale as an \"amazing talent\" who was \"pivotal to our success in 2016.\"\n\n\"He has our family's complete trust and is the perfect person to be at the helm of the campaign,\" Eric Trump said in a campaign release. Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law and senior adviser, added that Parscale was \"essential in bringing a disciplined technology and data-driven approach to how the 2016 campaign was run.\"\n\nThe campaign also announced that it would be involved in the 2018 midterm election by providing candidates with general support, endorsements, and rallying the support of political grassroots by engaging Trump supporters in districts and states. The midterm elections will be crucial for the future of Trump's presidency, as the party in control of the presidency historically suffers sizable losses in the first election after winning the White House. Trump has already begun mentioning this trend in speeches, hoping to spur his supporters to buck history.\n\nParscale has remained active in his political operation, America First, since Trump took office. Parscale's Florida-based firm, Parscale Strategy, has a contract with the Republican National Committee to help grow its database of small donors, among other things.\n\nBefore joining the Trump campaign in 2015, Parscale had no experience in politics. He worked for the Trump Organization for several years, designing websites and helping develop digital strategy for Trump businesses. Despite going through three campaign managers during Trump's tumultuous presidential bid, Parscale, a close associate of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, was a constant, quiet presence.\n\nParscale's formal title during the Trump 2016 campaign was digital director, but behind the scenes, he grew into a more significant role, directing campaign spending on television ads as well as digital, building a small dollar donor operation, and having significant influence on the overall campaign, working closely with then-Republican National Committee chief of staff Katie Walsh and the RNC's get-out-the-vote operation.\n\nOn digital advertising, Parscale brought Facebook employees into the campaign to better take advantage of social media to promote Trump and tear down Hillary Clinton. The unprecedented spending on digital media did not sit well with the candidate, who angrily questioned Parscale about how he was spending campaign cash during the campaign.\n\n\"I don't believe in this mumbo-jumbo digital stuff,\" Parscale recalled Trump screaming at him. Despite getting dressed down, he kept focused on digital media spending. In fact, during the last week of the campaign, he says he saw data showing movement in Trump's favor in what were considered likely wins for Clinton, and he pounced, moving money out of Virginia, where he did not think Trump could win, and Ohio, where he felt confident Trump would win, and into Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nParscale has said that after Trump won, the President-elect thanked him and made clear he then understood the power of what he had called \"mumbo jumbo digital stuff.\"\n\nParscale has repeatedly insisted he had no knowledge of the Russian operation to influence the 2016 campaign in favor of Trump and against Clinton. He says that is what he told congressional investigators behind closed doors last year when he went before the Senate and House intelligence committees looking into Russian meddling.\n\nHowever, Parscale has been caught up in controversial actions involving Cambridge Analytica, a prominent conservative data firm that he hired to work for the Trump campaign. In 2016, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix tried to reach WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to help take better political advantage of the hacked Clinton emails. The company says Nix never reached Assange, though CNN reported Nix wanted to create a searchable database of the Clinton emails.\n\nParscale says he had no knowledge of that, and has insisted the only reason he brought in Cambridge Analytica was because a digital expert he wanted to hire\u2014Matt Oczkowski\u2014was under contract there. Parscale ended up bringing more than a dozen Cambridge Analytica employees into the Trump campaign as analysts. Parscale says the campaign never used Cambridge Analytica's raw data.\n\nThe Trump campaign's data analytics operation is also under scrutiny by special counsel Robert Mueller, CNN reported in May 2017. Parscale gave private testimony to the House Intelligence Committee last year as part of its investigation of Russian meddling.",
    " Title: Clearview AI's Client List Stolen in Data Breach\n\nArticle:\n\nControversial facial-recognition company Clearview AI has reported a data breach, with The Daily Beast revealing that an unauthorized individual gained access to the company's entire client list. Clearview AI's tool allows law enforcement agencies to search a database of billions of images scraped from social media to identify suspects using facial recognition technology.\n\nThe breach, which was first reported by The Daily Beast, did not result from a hack into Clearview AI's servers but from a \"flaw\" that granted unauthorized access to the company's client list. Tor Ekeland, Clearview AI's attorney, confirmed the report in a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nIn January, The New York Times reported that the company's customers included hundreds of law-enforcement agencies across the US and Canada, including the FBI and Department of Homeland Security. Clearview AI's service has also received inquiries from law-enforcement agencies worldwide, according to a spokesperson who spoke to \u2588\u2588\u2588 in February.\n\nFacebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other companies have threatened legal action against Clearview AI, demanding the company stop scraping public images from their platforms to build its face database. Clearview AI's founder and CEO, Hoan Ton-That, responded by stating that gathering publicly accessible photos is protected by the US Constitution's First Amendment.\n\nIf Clearview AI's client list is leaked to the public, analysts warn, it could lead to even broader backlash against the company. \"It will likely bring the public awareness, and mistrust, of facial recognition to a new level,\" Kjell Carlsson, an analyst with Forrester specializing in AI, told \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nAI startup CEO Albert Liu told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the fact that Clearview maintains a database of faces raises inherent security concerns, especially after this breach. \"One of the major risks with AI software, despite how groundbreaking it is, is that it relies on these massive databases and the amount of sensitive information stored on these platforms,\" Liu said.",
    " Title: Christian Right Joins Immigration Reform Movement\n\nArticle:\n\nA new ally has emerged in the ongoing debate over immigration reform: the Christian right. Traditionally, religious conservatives have either stayed neutral or opposed immigration reform, but they are now actively advocating for change.\n\nRalph Reed, head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, has reported a significant shift in support for immigration reform among social conservatives. Reed's group released a letter on Tuesday outlining broad goals for reform, such as keeping families together, reforming the visa system, and securing the border.\n\nHigh-profile leaders are also joining the cause. Mathew Staver, vice president of Liberty University, and Focus on the Family, which has historically focused on issues like opposing abortion rights and gay marriage, are now supporting immigration reform. Focus on the Family is even using its radio broadcast, which reaches millions, to push its message.\n\nSocial conservatives are targeting GOP offices, aiming to provide political cover for lawmakers in the South, West, and Midwest who are concerned about potential backlash at the ballot box in 2014. The shift in dynamics could provide Republican lawmakers with the political support they need to vote in favor of a deal.\n\nHowever, the unity of the groups may be tested as the debate becomes more politically charged, particularly on issues like border enforcement, citizenship, and immigration rights for gays and lesbians. For now, the focus seems to be on raising visibility among social conservatives.\n\nA coalition of nearly a dozen groups, including Bread for the World, Esperanza, Christian Community Development Association, and the National Association of Evangelicals, has launched a 40-day \"I was a stranger\" campaign, asking parishioners to read a Bible verse dealing with immigrants each day.\n\n\"We've moved beyond the religious leadership in our country on the evangelical side to begin influencing more of the pews,\" said Noel Castellanos of CCDA. \"We need to inform them and expose them the way we did with our pastors.\"",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidate Cory Booker Proposes Clemency Program for Nonviolent Drug Offenders\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Cory Booker has announced a plan to release thousands of nonviolent drug offenders from federal prisons, utilizing the president's pardon power to address perceived inequalities in the justice system. The senator from New Jersey, who is one of two dozen Democrats vying for their party's nomination for the 2020 presidential election, aims to implement a comprehensive clemency program targeting individuals serving \"unjust and excessive sentences\" for drug crimes, including marijuana-related offenses.\n\nBooker's proposal builds upon his longstanding focus on criminal justice reform. He was instrumental in the passage of the First Step Act, a bipartisan bill signed into law last year by President Donald Trump, which eased minimum sentences for drug crimes that disproportionately affected minorities.\n\nIn announcing the proposal, Booker stated, \"The War on Drugs has been a war on people, tearing families apart, ruining lives, and disproportionately affecting people of color and low-income individuals\u2014all without making us safer.\" Booker, who is African-American and a Yale-educated lawyer, previously served as the mayor of Newark, one of New Jersey's poorest cities.\n\nThe United States has the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world, according to researchers. Under Booker's plan, more than 11,000 people serving time for marijuana offenses would be eligible for clemency. Booker's campaign noted that while marijuana use is roughly equally prevalent across races, black people are nearly four times as likely to be arrested as white people for its use.\n\nIn addition, nearly 4,000 inmates serving the kind of minimum sentences now reduced under the First Step Act could receive clemency, as well as prisoners serving more time as a result of sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine.\n\nBooker's proposal calls for an executive panel to review eligible cases. While the panel would start from a presumption of recommending clemency, it would decline any cases in which the defendant poses a threat to the public. The process would be more efficient than the current system, which includes a series of steps through the Justice Department and the White House Counsel's office.\n\nOther Democratic candidates have weighed in on clemency, most notably U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who proposed establishing an advisory board to streamline the process and focus primarily on drug offenders. U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California, like Klobuchar a former prosecutor, has also stated she would look to pardon low-level drug offenders.\n\nIn 2014, President Barack Obama launched a more limited clemency initiative that encouraged certain nonviolent drug offenders serving mandatory minimum sentences to apply.\n\nBooker is currently averaging between 2 and 3 percent in public polling, placing him around seventh place in the crowded field of candidates.",
    " Title: Treasury and Federal Reserve Lend Minimal Amounts Under $500 Billion Coronavirus Aid Fund, Oversight Report Says\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve have lent hardly any money under a $500 billion fund created by the economic rescue law passed in response to the coronavirus crisis, according to a new report from a congressional oversight panel. The report, issued Monday by the Congressional Oversight Commission, contains mostly questions about how the Treasury fund is going to function.\n\nSo far, only one of the new Fed programs has started operating, a lending fund likely to be tapped by large public companies. The program was started on May 11 with $37.5 billion from Treasury. The economic rescue law, also known as the Cares Act, imposed a number of restrictions on the use of the Treasury fund.\n\nThe report states that the Federal Reserve is setting up a Main Street Lending Program intended to facilitate lending by banks to small and medium-size businesses. The program would support lending up to $600 billion, with Treasury providing $75 billion to offset any potential losses. That program also has not disbursed any money, the report said.\n\nThe economic rescue law includes $46 billion to make loans and loan guarantees to the airline industry, which has been hit hard by the pandemic as air traffic has come to a near halt. None of that money has been disbursed.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is pledging to reveal names and other details of entities that borrow from emergency programs the central bank has set up to offset the economic hit from the pandemic. In prepared testimony for a Tuesday congressional hearing, Powell says the Fed will disclose amounts borrowed and interest rates levied under programs to provide credit for large corporations, state and local governments, and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThe Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is set to testify along with Powell on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee. In prepared testimony, Mnuchin states that the Paycheck Protection Program to provide forgiveable loans to small businesses has processed more than 4.2 million loans worth over $530 billion. The program is working \"to keep tens of millions of hardworking Americans on the payroll,\" Mnuchin says. The loans don't have to be paid back as long as the borrower uses 75% of the money to cover payroll.",
    " Title: Investigators Search Saudi Consulate for Evidence in Khashoggi Disappearance; Pompeo Meets with Saudi Leaders\n\nArticle:\n\nInvestigators in Turkey have been searching the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul for traces of \"toxic materials\" in connection with the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to Turkish media reports. The search comes as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Saudi Arabia for talks regarding the matter.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan revealed some details about the consulate search while speaking to journalists on Tuesday, according to the Associated Press, citing Turkey's NTV. The AP also cited a high-level Turkish official as saying that during the search, \"certain evidence\" was found by police, proving that Khashoggi was killed at the consulate. However, the official did not elaborate on the nature of this evidence.\n\nThe announcements came as Khashoggi's family released a statement expressing their concern over his disappearance. The activist and opinion columnist, who was a critic of the Saudi government, was last seen entering the Saudi consulate on Oct. 2, reportedly to obtain documents related to his upcoming marriage to a Turkish woman.\n\nSaudi Arabia, which has repeatedly claimed Khashoggi walked out of the building on his own, is now reportedly considering whether to say that rogue intelligence operatives murdered him by mistake during an interrogation.\n\nIn the family's statement, they expressed their anxiety and trauma over Khashoggi's disappearance. \"Our family is traumatized and yearns to be together during this painful time,\" the statement said. \"The strong moral and legal responsibility which our father instilled in us obliges us to call for the establishment of an independent and impartial international commission to inquire into the circumstances of his death.\"\n\nIn addition to the consulate search that took place on Monday, a Turkish official revealed on Tuesday that the top Saudi diplomat's home in Istanbul will also be investigated. The official did not specify when the search will occur, but Turkish media has reported that the diplomat, Mohammed al-Otaibi, left the country on an afternoon flight just hours after it was announced.\n\nSurveillance footage leaked to Turkish media showed that shortly after Khashoggi disappeared, vehicles were seen moving between the consulate and the diplomat's home, according to the Associated Press.\n\nPompeo, who is currently meeting with Saudi King Salman over the Khashoggi case, arrived in Riyadh on Tuesday. \"The Secretary and the King discussed a number of regional and bilateral issues,\" State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said. \"The Secretary also thanked the King for his commitment to supporting a thorough, transparent, and timely investigation of Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance.\"\n\nPompeo also met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is accused of ordering Khashoggi's detention. \"We are strong and old allies,\" he told Pompeo. \"So we face our challenges together, the past, the day of, tomorrow.\"",

Trump, however, tweeted Tuesday night that the process was \"very organized.\"\n\nIn a tweet, Trump said, \"Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!\"\n\nRogers, who had been working on the transition team for months under Chris Christie, was sidelined as the campaign and transition merged into one presidential team. Rogers, who chaired the House Intelligence Committee while in Congress and is an Army veteran and former FBI agent with an expertise in national security, was told Monday on the phone that he was out, according to a source familiar with the transition.\n\nRogers, in a statement to reporters, positively described his time with the transition team as a \"privilege\" and said he was handing off his responsibilities as a national security adviser to the transition organization to Vice President-elect Mike Pence and \"the stellar new leadership team.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN's Anderson Cooper Tuesday night, Rogers said, \"Sometimes in politics... there are people who are in and people who are out. And the people who have been asked to move on have some relationship with Chris Christie.\"\n\nKushner has been rubbing allies the wrong way in his recent efforts to purge the transition team of Christie associates, sources say. Kushner's father was prosecuted by then-US Attorney Christie in 2004 for tax evasion, witness tampering, and illegal campaign contributions.\n\nHowever, a longtime Christie associate cautioned that there was no \"purge\" of Christie staff, and that such a characterization is \"overblown.\" While some Christie staff have left, others are continuing on with the transition team. A high-ranking Trump insider said the so-called \"purge\" focused only on lobbyists.\n\nRogers' departure was first reported by Bloomberg. Rogers' participation in the transition team was seen as a heartening sign for traditional GOP national security advisers. Rogers has been critical of Russia's role in recent hacking episodes, including the hacks of Democratic political groups during the election, which the US government attributed to high levels of Russian government. Trump repeatedly declined to acknowledge Russia's role, saying the evidence was inconclusive.\n\nAmid the churn in Trump's transition team, the Obama White House Tuesday night said it's moving forward with a broader sharing of information. \"We received the MOU signed by Vice President-elect Pence this evening,\" said Brandi Hoffine, a White House spokesperson. \"The next step is for the President-elect's transition team to provide us with the names of the individuals they have authorized to represent their transition effort across the government. Once we have received those names and related materials, those individuals will be able to receive the briefing materials we have prepared and begin to communicate with their Obama administration agency counterparts as we continue our work to facilitate the transition to the next administration.\"",
    " Title: Congress Averts Government Shutdown, Temporarily Funds Federal Agencies Through January 19\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a swift move on Thursday, the U.S. Congress managed to avert a government shutdown, sending a bill to President Donald Trump that provides temporary funding for federal agencies until January 19. The House of Representatives and Senate passed the hastily written bill by votes of 231-188 and 66-32, respectively, as lawmakers eagerly began a holiday recess until January 3.\n\nThe bill, which will keep agencies operating during the three-month-old fiscal year, is a precursor to a more comprehensive \"omnibus\" spending bill intended to fund the government from January 19 through September 30. Negotiators have been grappling with contentious issues such as defense-spending increases versus increases for other domestic programs, including medical research, opioid treatment, and \"anti-terrorism\" activities.\n\nFiscal hawks are displeased with Congress's decision to once again exceed spending caps designed to curb mounting federal debt. However, some of these same lawmakers earlier in the week voted for a sweeping tax bill that will add $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to a national debt that already stands at $20 trillion.\n\nDemocrats in the House and Senate made a strong push for including protections for young immigrants who entered the country illegally as children, commonly known as \"Dreamers.\" In the end, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and immigration advocacy groups failed to secure these protections. Nearly all of the House's 193 Democrats and 29 of the Senate's 46 Democrats voted no, in part to protest the lack of action on the immigration measure.\n\nThe Senate also put the brakes on another bill that passed the House, which would provide $81 billion in new disaster aid to help Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and several states hit by this year's hurricanes or wildfires. The temporary spending bill does, however, give Trump a modest increase of $4.7 billion for the Department of Defense to be used for missile defense and ship repair.\n\nThe bill includes funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program through March, as well as funding for community health centers and the Indian Health Service. The plan also extends the National Security Agency's expiring internet surveillance program, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, through January 19. Other provisions address funding for veterans, the Coast Guard, and flood insurance. Most government programs would be temporarily extended until January 19 at fiscal 2017 levels.",
    " Title: Speaker Paul Ryan Breaks with Donald Trump, Refuses to Support the Republican Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan, the highest-ranking Republican in the United States, has refused to support Donald Trump as the party's nominee, marking a significant departure from the brash New York billionaire. In a bombshell interview with CNN, Ryan expressed his reservations about Trump's adherence to conservative values, limited government, and the Constitution.\n\nRyan's decision, made swiftly after Trump clinched the Republican nomination, was unexpected, as Ryan had been preparing for a contested convention at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. The speaker's decision could potentially influence the outcome of the 2016 election, particularly for the 200-plus Republicans up for reelection, especially those in swing districts.\n\nThe Ryan-Trump relationship will now take center stage, potentially forcing Trump to prove his mettle on Capitol Hill. Trump's team is already trying to set up meetings in Washington, and Ryan's orbit is open to an audience with the presumptive nominee.\n\nFor the past four months, Ryan has watched Trump's rise in the polls warily, expressing opposition to Trump's stance on issues such as a ban on Muslims in the U.S., white supremacists, and free-trade agreements. Ryan's decision to break ranks with Trump was not due to any particular policy but rather opposition to Trump's principles, according to a source familiar with Ryan's thinking.\n\nRyan's move comes just hours after Trump tweeted \"I love Hispanics!\" along with a picture of him eating a taco bowl, not exactly the kind of fence-mending with the growing Hispanic voting bloc that GOP brass had in mind for Trump's general election pivot.\n\nRyan has ruled out launching a presidential bid this year, and giving Trump the cold shoulder is unlikely to change that calculus. However, the speaker has acknowledged that a bid in 2020 is possible, and this decision could be part of an effort to pick up the pieces if Republicans lose the White House this fall.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's positioning on the party's standard-bearer is more muddled compared to Ryan's. McConnell has committed to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters, but has not explicitly endorsed Trump.",
    " Title: White House Proposes $15 Billion in Federal Spending Cuts, Including CHIP Funds\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House will send a proposal to the House of Representatives on Tuesday, aiming to cut federal spending by $15 billion. The proposal, if approved, would see roughly half of the cuts coming from the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a senior administration official stated on Monday.\n\nThe proposed cuts, often referred to as \"rescissions,\" involve funds that were authorized by Congress but not spent. The plan is a shift from earlier discussions about rescinding funds that were part of a sweeping $1.3 trillion spending bill enacted in March. This proposal would instead seek to rescind funds that were authorized in previous fiscal years but not spent.\n\nThe most controversial element of the proposal is likely to be the $7 billion in proposed cuts to the Children's Health Insurance Program. The federal-state program provides health coverage to more than eight million low-income, uninsured children whose family incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid.\n\nThe White House proposal would rescind $7 billion from that program, of which $5 billion would come from funds where the authority to spend them has expired. An additional $2 billion would come from a contingency fund that isn't projected to be tapped by states, the senior administration official said.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the proposal, stating that the contingency funds are necessary in case CHIP enrollment were to surge unexpectedly and the program, whose funding isn't open-ended, suddenly needed more money.\n\nUnder the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, President Donald Trump will be able to temporarily freeze funding for 45 days, but can't rescind it on his own unless Congress agrees. His proposal will head first to the House. Once drafted into a bill, the rescissions package can be considered under an expedited process and would only need a simple majority to pass both chambers.\n\nThe White House also plans to propose cutting funds that were previously authorized for two technology loan programs, rolling back funds set aside for responding to the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, now declared over, for a railroad unemployment-insurance-benefits program that expired, and for Hurricane Sandy-related emergency watershed programs.\n\nSome lawmakers have expressed doubts that rolling back funds that haven't been spent wouldn't affect agencies. The final outcome of the proposal remains uncertain, as Congress isn't required to take action in response to the President's proposal of spending cuts. If lawmakers haven't taken any action, the funding would remain intact, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking Claims Made During the Vice Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the vice presidential debate, several claims made by both Mike Pence and Tim Kaine were fact-checked for accuracy.\n\nRepublican Mike Pence stated, \"The fact that under this past administration, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious...Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.\" However, as a share of the total U.S. economy, the national debt has increased by 35 percent, not a doubling. The national debt currently stands at $19.6 trillion. This increase is largely due to efforts by the Obama administration to combat the Great Recession. The Clinton plan, with its tax increases, would increase the gross debt by $450 billion over 10 years, according to an analysis by the independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Donald Trump's tax-cut-heavy plan, on the other hand, would increase the gross debt by $4.3 trillion, nearly 10 times more than Clinton's plan.\n\nDemocrat Tim Kaine stated, \"Donald Trump does not have a plan.\" Clinton also does not have a materially different plan than what President Barack Obama is already doing. Clinton has described a three-part strategy to combat the Islamic State, which includes crushing IS on its home turf, disrupting its infrastructure on the ground and online, and protecting America and its allies. All of these elements are currently part of the Obama administration's strategy, so it is not clear what would change or if Clinton would accelerate any portions of it.\n\nPence, in calling Clinton the \"architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy,\" said the crisis in Syria was the result of a \"failed and weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead.\" However, Clinton, as secretary of state, actually pushed for increased U.S. intervention after Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against rebels. Obama is the commander in chief, and nothing has swayed him thus far. Whatever Clinton's failings might be on foreign policy, it is a stretch to accuse her of helping to lead a weak policy on Syria.\n\nPence also stated, \"We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal.\" The coal industry's woes do not come solely from onerous federal regulations. Pence omitted the effects of steep competition from cheap natural gas. A string of major coal companies have filed for bankruptcy in recent years, including Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources, and Peabody Energy. Layoffs and cutbacks have spread economic suffering through coal country in the Appalachians and Wyoming's Powder River Basin. By contrast, these are boom times for natural gas extraction, mostly due to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.\n\nPence also stated, \"I'm proud that 'the state of Indiana has balanced budgets.'\" This is true, but a balanced budget is required by law, as it is in every state except Vermont.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush's Immigration Stance: A Shift in Conservative Immigration Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent profile published by The Weekly Standard, Andrew Ferguson suggests that Jeb Bush's political record in Florida indicates a more conservative stance than the national press and right-leaning activists perceive. Ferguson posits that Bush, while currently presenting as a moderate, may be a self-conscious, deep-dyed conservative.\n\nWhile Ferguson's piece does not delve deeply into Bush's immigration reform stance, a video from Bush's Right to Rise PAC, titled \"Conservative,\" offers insight into this area. The video showcases highlights from Bush's speech at CPAC, where he states, \"There is no plan to deport 11 million people. We should give them a path to legal status where they work, where they do not receive government benefits, where they do not break the law, where they learn English, and where they make a contribution to our society.\"\n\nThis statement, contrasting with the immigration stances of other likely 2016 Republican candidates, indicates a more progressive approach to immigration reform. For instance, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has publicly stressed his opposition to \"amnesty,\" while reportedly expressing support for a path to legal status in private conversations with elites.\n\nBush, however, is taking an opposite approach, not only publicly advocating for legal status but also arguing that it is the true conservative position on immigration reform. This positioning allows Bush to challenge his party's base, which is generally opposed to immigration reform that legalizes the status of unauthorized immigrants, while maintaining his conservative credentials.\n\nBy taking a more progressive stance on immigration, Bush can appear moderate to both the press and activists during the general election, as he does not need to emphasize moderation in other areas. This strategy is unusual in today's highly polarized political climate, as candidates typically avoid challenging their party's base.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that Bush's overall governing record is considered very conservative by both liberals and conservatives. In an interesting sense, Bush's immigration stance allows him to present as a moderate on one issue while maintaining his conservative identity, as his record demonstrates.",
    " Title: Obama Defends Free Speech at United Nations, Emphasizes Importance of Freedom of Expression\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama delivered a robust defense of free speech rights during a high-profile speech to the United Nations Tuesday, addressing the value of freedom of expression following the controversy sparked by an anti-Muslim video.\n\nIn his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Obama emphasized the importance of free speech in the United States, stating that the U.S. Constitution protects the right to practice free speech. He also addressed recent criticism from Republicans who have accused him of failing to stand up for \"American values\" in response to the protests.\n\n\"I know there are some who ask why we don't just ban such a video,\" Obama said. \"The answer is enshrined in our laws: Our Constitution protects the right to practice free speech.\"\n\nObama further explained that Americans have fought and died to protect the right of all people to express their views, even those that are offensive or disagreeable. He argued that efforts to suppress free expression are increasingly ineffective in an interconnected world.\n\n\"I know that not all countries in this body share this understanding of the protection of free speech,\" Obama said. \"Yet in 2012, at a time when anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive views around the world with the click of a button, the notion that we can control the flow of information is obsolete.\"\n\nThe president made little mention of Afghanistan during his speech, devoting only a clause to a recent suicide bombing and a sentence to promising that \"America and our allies will end our war on schedule in 2014.\"\n\nObama began his address with a tribute to Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, who was killed earlier this month along with three other Americans in an attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The president sought to harness sympathy and outrage over the attack by describing it as a strike on diplomats of all nations and on the entire civilized world.\n\n\"The attacks of the last two weeks are not simply an assault on America,\" Obama said. \"They are also an assault on the very ideals upon which the United Nations was founded.\"\n\nThe president's speech came amid fresh GOP attacks for his decision to delegate one-on-one meetings with world leaders to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, even as Obama made time Monday for a taping of \"The View.\" Obama's forceful defense of free speech rights included a civics-class-style explanation of why allowing offensive speech and confronting it with other speech is preferable to trying to ban objectionable speech outright.",
    " Title: Rubio's Shift on Immigration: From Advocate to Hardliner\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who once advocated for a comprehensive immigration reform bill, is now taking a harder line on illegal immigration. This shift in stance has left immigration activists, including Gaby Pacheco, who he consulted with two years ago, perplexed.\n\nRubio, a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, has abandoned the bill he co-authored and is now calling for an end to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows individuals like Pacheco to remain in the United States.\n\n\"It's another Marco Rubio that I just don't know,\" Pacheco said.\n\nAfter experiencing a decline in political standing among conservatives who were critical of his immigration advocacy, Rubio is now focusing on border security, a stance more in line with GOP activists who hold significant influence in the selection of a White House nominee.\n\nLast month, Rubio urged President Barack Obama not to take actions that would shield millions of people who entered the U.S. illegally. He argued that Congress should first \"make real progress on stemming the tide of illegal immigration.\"\n\nImmigrant advocates contend that Rubio's emphasis on border security and dismissal of his own bill amounts to a switch in sides in the heated immigration debate. However, Rubio's aides claim that he has always emphasized border security and insisted on tougher enforcement measures.\n\nThe shift in stance comes as potential 2016 rivals such as Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who voted against the overhaul that Rubio helped write, take hard-line stands on immigration.\n\nRubio has begun visiting South Carolina and Iowa, early-voting states in the 2016 nominating calendar where immigration is a significant issue for White House hopefuls. In these appearances, Rubio has embraced GOP calls to bolster security and deploy the National Guard along the Mexican border in response to the arrival of tens of thousands of Central Americans.\n\nRubio was the only potential GOP candidate who helped write the immigration bill, which would strengthen border security while also offering a path to citizenship for many of the 11.5 million people who are in the U.S. illegally. Now, the party committee working to elect Republicans to the Senate is using that bill, which more than a dozen Republicans support, in ads to attack Democrats as pro-\"amnesty.\"\n\nThe bill remains unpopular among some in the Republican base, and Rubio's popularity has plummeted in public polls. However, last month, Rubio won applause from conservatives in South Carolina when he scolded immigration activists for interrupting his speech at a Republican fundraiser.\n\nIn a series of appearances on Fox News and conservative talk radio, Rubio has emphasized the need for border security and the deployment of the National Guard along the Mexican border. When asked about his stance on a House bill that would phase out DACA, Rubio expressed concerns about the \"unintended consequences\" for youths who have already come forward and obtained work permits. Nevertheless, he said, \"I certainly think at some point that will have to end too.\"",
    " Title: Democrats' Uninterested in Viewing Unredacted Mueller Report Despite Calls for Transparency\n\nArticle:\n\nDespite demands from Democrats for Attorney General William Barr to release the full unredacted report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, key Democratic lawmakers have shown little interest in viewing the report themselves. In a move towards transparency, Barr allowed a dozen members of Congress, six Democrats and six Republicans, to access the report with most of the redactions removed.\n\nWhile grand jury material had to be redacted to comply with federal requirements, this version of the report does include classified information, materials related to ongoing investigations, and information that could damage the reputations of individuals not charged with crimes.\n\nPrior to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing with Barr last week, only two lawmakers had taken advantage of the opportunity, and both were Republicans. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham and Representative Doug Collins, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, reviewed the unredacted information, and both said the new details did not change their assessment of the report in any way.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler were also granted access to the document. Despite being some of the most vocal critics of the way Barr handled the release of the report, none of them bothered to review the information that they claim is so critical. Not even the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, deigned to read the less redacted version of the report prior to the attorney general testifying in front of her own panel.\n\nSince the Democrats are so determined for the public to have access to the unredacted report, along with all the underlying evidence no less, their unanimous refusal to inspect the redacted information themselves raises some serious questions about their true motives in making such a fuss about the release of the full report. The Democrats had evidently \"boycotted en masse\" the opportunity to review the unredacted report because they wanted Barr to also remove legally required redactions of grand jury material and grant access to a broader array of lawmakers.\n\nHowever, that is just a sad excuse for their behavior. It is now abundantly clear, if it was not already, that the Democrats no longer truly believe there is anything significant hiding behind the redactions in the special counsel report. If they did then it would be grossly negligent of the Democrats to deliberately keep themselves in the dark about all those hidden details.\n\nIn fact, it increasingly appears that the Democrats would prefer that Barr never release the unredacted report at all. So long as the redactions are in place, they can keep making baseless insinuations about a nonexistent cover-up. That is why the Democrats who have a chance to do not want to read the unredacted report because without actually seeing it, they do not have to lie about it to fit their narrative. They can let their imaginations run wild and simply claim ignorance in case the truth ever does get out.\n\nBarr has bent over backwards to satisfy the Democrats with all of their purported concerns about the redactions, but they have only escalated their attacks on his character in response to each concession that he has made. Until the Democrats are willing to find out the truth for themselves, they have no business telling the public that the redactions are shielding something nefarious. By their own choice, the top Democrats in Congress are as ignorant as everybody else. The reality is there is nothing there.\n\nMadison Gesiotto, an attorney and a commentator who serves with the advisory board of the Donald Trump campaign, stated, \"The Democrats who have a chance to do not want to read the unredacted report because without actually seeing it, they do not have to lie about it to fit their narrative. They can let their imaginations run wild and simply claim ignorance in case the truth ever does get out.\" Gesiotto is on Twitter @ MadisonGesiotto.",
    " Title: Obama Shifts Focus to Middle Class, Economic Policies in Major Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech billed as a reset after a series of political stumbles and a string of bad economic news, President Barack Obama focused on the middle class and economic policies during a major address on Thursday. The speech, delivered at Cuyahoga Community College outside Cleveland, Ohio, marked a shift in the president's campaign strategy, with the only new line being a call for voters to break the partisan deadlock in Washington.\n\nThe president emphasized his role as the champion of the middle class and warned of the potential economic consequences of Mitt Romney's proposed policies if the Republican presidential nominee were to be elected. Obama claimed that Romney's economic plan consists mainly of trillions of dollars more in tax cuts, severe spending cuts, and deregulation of corporations. However, he asserted that Romney's plan would not protect middle-income workers and would jeopardize programs that help them pay their bills, keep down health care costs, and send their children to college.\n\nMitt Romney delivered a stinging rebuke of President Obama's economic record earlier in the day in Cincinnati, accusing the president of being \"long on words and short on action\" with unemployment figures still above 8 percent. Romney criticized Obama for not delivering a recovery for the economy and for his recent comments that \"the private sector is doing fine.\"\n\nThe president's re-election campaign decided to have Obama deliver a major economic address, as they believe he has not delivered a recovery for the economy. Romney stated, \"He's going to be saying today that he wants four more years, but he may have forgotten he talked about a one-term proposition if he couldn't get the economy turned around in three years.\"\n\nThe president's speech at the same community college where Bill Clinton gave a campaign speech in 2010 was billed as a pivotal moment for the campaign, a way to regain the offensive after a rough couple of weeks following May's dismal jobs report, Governor Scott Walker's victory in the Wisconsin recall election, and the president's Friday comments that \"the private sector is doing fine.\"\n\nObama made light of his recent political misstep at the beginning of his speech, acknowledging the criticism he has received for blaming former President George W. Bush and the economic crisis he inherited from his predecessor. However, the president hewed closely to that theme, denouncing the Bush-era economic and policy choices that he said Romney and Republicans support, which led to the global economic crisis of late 2008.\n\nThe crowd of roughly 1,500 chanted \"Four more years\" and \"Fired up and ready to go\" at the beginning of the speech and at times during it. However, there were few rousing applause lines, and at times the hour-long remarks seemed to ramble and repeat various refrains the president has been pushing for months, including his desire to \"double-down on\" spending on clean energy, technology, infrastructure, and education as a way to help boost the economy.\n\nBoth Obama's and Romney's campaigns have invested heavily in Ohio, and their dueling visits on Thursday demonstrate just how strongly the two are competing for the state's 18 electoral votes. Ohio has played a critical role in determining the winner in the past few presidential contests, with Obama winning the state in 2008, and George W. Bush taking it in 2004. No Republican has ever won the White House without carrying Ohio.\n\nPolls show the two men running neck and neck in Ohio, with Obama ahead by a statistically insignificant 1 percentage point. However, Ohio, whose unemployment rate is 7.4 percent\u2014nearly a full point below the national average\u2014is faring better than many other areas of the country. The Obama team is eager to credit the auto bailout as one of the reasons for Ohio's relative economic stability.\n\n\"When my opponent was arguing that we should let Detroit go bankrupt, we made a bet on American ingenuity, and today our auto industry is back,\" Obama said. The president planned to spend the evening at a star-studded fundraiser in Manhattan at the home of Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick and co-hosted by Anna Wintour.",
    " Title: FBI Documents Detail Clinton's Unrecalled Details During Email Server Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, reportedly stated approximately three dozen times during an extensive FBI interview that she could not recall specific details or events related to her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. The FBI's interview, which concluded the agency's investigation without recommending criminal charges, was detailed in documents released on Friday.\n\nThe documents reveal that Clinton could not recall specific emails and details of briefings on handling classified information. The FBI noted that Clinton recalled being briefed on Specific Access Program (SAP) information but could not recall any specific briefings on handling information associated with the SAPs.\n\nThe documents also address Clinton's use of her BlackBerry after being advised about the risks of using her personal device. Clinton reportedly requested a secured BlackBerry while at State but could not recall why they were unable to provide one.\n\nIn December 2012, Clinton suffered a concussion from a fall and later developed a blood clot. The documents do not provide further details about this incident.\n\nCampaign spokesman Brian Fallon stated after the documents were released, \"While her use of a single email account was clearly a mistake and she has taken responsibility for it, these materials make clear why the Justice Department believed there was no basis to move forward with this case.\"\n\nJason Miller, spokesman for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, commented that the files \"reinforce Clinton's tremendously bad judgment and dishonesty.\"\n\nThe documents show Clinton repeatedly claimed to have little training or understanding about the classification process, despite leading the department that handled such information on a regular basis and having a security clearance. The document dump also revealed gaps in the record, with numerous sections redacted and the FBI unable to obtain 13 Clinton mobile devices and two iPads that may have been used to send emails from her personal email address.\n\nClinton claimed to have relied on the judgment of her aides and other officials to handle classified material appropriately. She also stated that she did not know the meaning of the \"C\" marking before a paragraph in an email marked \"Confidential,\" and when asked about different classification types like \"Top Secret,\" Clinton could not recall the details.\n\nThe FBI document notes that the email in question was in fact marked \"classified at the Confidential level.\" Clinton's server was found to have more than 2,000 emails with classified material, most of which were retroactively classified. However, FBI Director James Comey has disputed Clinton's insistence that none of them were marked as such at the time. Clinton has repeatedly stated that her use of private email was allowed. In July, she told FBI investigators she \"did not explicitly request permission to use a private server or email address.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Urges Support for Gun Control Package as Proposal Faces Resistance in Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama moved to rally support for a gun control package facing resistance in the Senate on Thursday, urging voters to pressure Congress into backing the proposal. In a speech at the White House, Obama expressed concern that the shock from the Newtown elementary school shooting could soon fade.\n\n\"Less than 100 days ago, that happened,\" Obama said. \"Shame on us if we've forgotten.\" He added, \"I haven't forgotten those kids. Shame on us if we've forgotten.\"\n\nThe president's remarks were made in the presence of the mothers of shooting victims, and he called on wavering lawmakers to \"not get squishy.\" He accused opponents of drumming up \"fear\" and urged supporters to call members of Congress and pressure them into backing the package.\n\nRepublican Senator Mike Lee of Utah criticized the president for his remarks, suggesting he was exploiting the Newtown tragedy. \"The proposals the president is calling for Congress to pass would primarily serve to reduce the constitutionally protected rights of law-abiding citizens while having little or no effect on violent crime,\" Lee said in a statement.\n\nSenator Lee and his conservative colleagues plan to ensure that any firearms proposals require a 60-vote threshold in order to proceed, which could be a high hurdle for the Senate to clear. Already, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has dropped a proposal to renew and expand the expired assault weapons ban from the main package.\n\nThe base bill will instead cover universal background checks, strengthened punishments for illegal trafficking, and more money for school security. Items like school security enjoy broad support, but the move to include private sales\u2014including gun show purchases\u2014in the background check system remains controversial in some circles. The assault weapons ban, which Republicans most adamantly oppose, is still expected to get a vote as an amendment to the main bill.\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) criticized the latest Obama push, accusing him of campaigning \"against guns to please the fringe.\" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently launched a $12 million ad buy in support of the legislation.\n\n\"It's not done until it's done,\" Obama said Thursday. \"There are some powerful voices on the other side that are interested in running out the clock, or changing the subject... They're doing everything they can to make all our progress collapse under the weight of fear and frustration.\"",
    " Title: President Obama's Statement on International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement issued over the weekend, former U.S. President Barack Obama recognized the first-annual International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists. The day aims to highlight the critical role of a free press in fostering prosperous, open, and secure societies.\n\nObama emphasized the importance of a free press, stating that it allows citizens to access information and hold their governments accountable. He referenced the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which upholds the right to \"seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\"\n\nThe former president acknowledged the risks journalists take daily, with hundreds killed in the past decade and countless more harassed, threatened, imprisoned, and tortured. In the majority of these cases, the perpetrators remain unpunished.\n\nObama called for governments to protect the freedom of journalists to write and speak freely. He commended the contributions of journalists, praising their role in shedding light on corruption, asking tough questions, and bearing witness to the plight of innocent people.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that President Obama's relationship with the media has been a subject of controversy. Some reporters, including those from The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today, and others, have characterized him as the most anti-free press, \"control freak\" president in history. Critics point to his use of the Espionage Act to prosecute more sources than any other president and the monitoring of journalists' phones and emails by his Department of Justice.\n\nAccording to the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index, the United States currently ranks 46th, behind countries such as Botswana, Ghana, and the United Kingdom. This suggests that, despite the statement, concerns about press freedom in the U.S. persist.",
    " Title: Impeachment Evidentiary Challenges Faced by Democrats in the Trump Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe second volume of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report has highlighted an obstacle that impeachers may face: the requirement of proving corrupt intent in cases of obstruction of justice. According to Mueller, the obstruction-of-justice statute necessitates both obstructive acts and corrupt intent. While corrupt intent can often be inferred from the alleged conduct, it might not be possible when there is a plausible legitimate governmental motive for an official's actions. In such cases, the element of corrupt intent must be established separately, which presents a difficult evidentiary challenge.\n\nMueller left the question of President Donald Trump's intent for Congress to decide. The Constitution grants the House and the Senate the power to determine what constitutes \"Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" In the current Congress, removing Trump would require the votes of 20 Republican senators, assuming all Democrats and independents voted in favor. This high hurdle is due to Trump's guarded support among Republican senators.\n\nDespite this potential vulnerability, the Democrats have failed to carry this reduced burden. The evidence presented in the impeachment inquiry, primarily concerning President Trump's dealings with Ukraine, has left Democrats with the task of proving that any personal benefit derived from these acts was not merely incidental but was the purpose of the acts. This daunting evidentiary challenge has led Democrats to search for more promising grounds for impeachment.\n\nHowever, the grounds they have alighted on, such as the alleged conditioning of aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting on a personal favor, also present an evidentiary challenge. The question remains whether the personal political benefit was the primary purpose or merely incidental to a legitimate government purpose. This is a question that has been raised in previous administrations, such as President Barack Obama's \"hot mic\" conversation with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in 2012, which was not considered impeachable.",
    " Title: House Speaker Ryan Declines Support for Trump Censure, Urges Bipartisan Approach to Charlottesville Response\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan, in a town-hall meeting aired live on CNN on Monday, stated that President Donald Trump \"messed up\" in his response to the racial demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, but cautioned against politicizing the response, saying it would \"descend this issue into some partisan hack-fest.\"\n\nRyan, a Republican, expressed that he would not support a Congressional move to censure Mr. Trump. He emphasized the importance of avoiding a partisan divide, stating, \"To make this us against them, Republicans against Democrats, pro-Trump, anti-Trump, that is a big mistake for our country.\"\n\nThroughout the meeting, Ryan repeatedly referred to white supremacists as \"fringe\" and emphasized the need to keep them in that category. He acknowledged that Trump's response was correct on Monday, incorrect on Tuesday, and then correct again during the beginning of his speech on Afghanistan on Monday night.\n\nCNN host Jake Tapper pressed Ryan to criticize Trump more directly for his handling, pointing out that the two times Trump's response was more acceptable, it was from prepared remarks, while his less acceptable response came during an impromptu press conference.\n\nThe questioners selected by CNN also attempted to provoke Ryan into criticizing Trump. When one man accused the president of \"bullying\" tweets and asked him to explain that to his own children, Ryan offered more practical advice: \"I tell my kids to turn off the TV, get off the internet.\"\n\nTapper, a television host, jokingly questioned how to take the advice to turn off the TV.\n\nDemocrats have indicated that when Congress returns from vacation, they will attempt to vote to censure Trump. However, Ryan's rejection is likely to keep it a Democratic-led effort.\n\nRyan emphasized, \"It should not be about the president. This is not about Republicans or Democrats. This shouldn't be about some vote in Congress or some partisan issue. This is so much more than that.\"\n\nRyan defended the House GOP's agenda under Mr. Trump, citing the passage of an Obamacare repeal (which has stalled in the Senate), legislation to overhaul the Wall Street reforms enacted after the 2008 collapse, and to boost job training. He noted that hundreds of other bills are awaiting Senate action.\n\nOn healthcare, Ryan stated that the House has done its part, and the Senate must return to work. However, he declined to set deadlines for senators, stating that there are other key votes coming up that must be addressed promptly, including raising the government's borrowing limit.",
    " Title: Obama Administration's Foreign Policy Strategy Faces Setbacks in Second Term\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama Doctrine, the foreign policy strategy of President Barack Obama in his second term, is facing numerous challenges and setbacks around the globe. This year has seen setbacks in countries such as Egypt, Syria, Russia, and China. The most obvious failure was the cancellation of a planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week, following Russia's granting of asylum to fugitive National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.\n\nThe inability of the Obama administration to capture Mr. Snowden is just one of many unresolved foreign policy challenges since Mr. Obama's re-election. Some foreign affairs specialists attribute this to a president who is not devoting much time to hot spots overseas.\n\nAaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, stated, \"He\u2019s one of only 17 presidents elected to a second term, and he\u2019s clearly trying to figure out where he wants to put the majority of his time. He\u2019s much more focused on the middle class than he is on the Middle East.\"\n\nIn April, the White House revealed reports of chemical weapons use in Syria's civil war, which Mr. Obama deemed a \"game-changer.\" Four months later, the civil war continues, with fresh reports this week that an al Qaeda affiliate is infiltrating Syrian territory that was seized by rebel groups.\n\nIn Egypt, the military ousted President Mohammed Morsi in early July, who was elected after Mr. Obama encouraged democratic reforms in that country. Mr. Obama had major disagreements with Mr. Morsi, but the military's action left the White House in the awkward public position of denying that it met the legal definition of a \"coup.\"\n\nEuropean allies such as Germany and France have criticized Mr. Obama over surveillance programs revealed by Mr. Snowden. At a Group of Eight summit in June in Northern Ireland, the news was Mr. Putin\u2019s refusal to sign a communique calling for the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad, another setback for Mr. Obama.\n\nA summit between Mr. Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping in June was overshadowed by the breaking news of Mr. Snowden\u2019s revelations and by the Chinese leader\u2019s ability to turn the tables on Mr. Obama and claim that China was a \"victim\" of U.S. cyberattacks.\n\nAs the summer progresses, Mr. Obama has parsed earlier statements that the U.S. has \"decimated\" al Qaeda. The administration closed 20 diplomatic facilities overseas because of threatened attacks by al Qaeda and its affiliates.\n\nJames Jay Carafano, an analyst on national security and foreign affairs at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Mr. Obama's second-term problems internationally can be traced to the terrorist attack in September that killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, at the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya.\n\n\"Benghazi, I think, is a signature moment for the president,\" Mr. Carafano said. \"If there were three [foreign policy successes] he could point to, they were winning the war with al Qaeda, resetting with the Russians, and not being George Bush doing everything with a heavy hand. Benghazi really kind of destroyed that mythology. Benghazi has made him incredibly risk-averse.\"\n\nRussia\u2019s decision to grant temporary asylum to Mr. Snowden was especially embarrassing for the White House because Mr. Obama had made personal appeals to Mr. Putin to send the fugitive back to the U.S. Relations between the two leaders have never been strong; Mr. Putin made a point of skipping a summit hosted by Mr. Obama at Camp David last summer.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to assess where the relationship [with Russia] can advance U.S. interests and increase peace and stability and prosperity around the world,\" Mr. Obama said at a news conference Friday. \"Where it can, we\u2019re going to keep on working with them. Where we have differences, we\u2019re going to say so clearly. And my hope is, is that over time, Mr. Putin and Russia recognize that rather than a zero-sum competition, in fact, if the two countries are working together we can probably advance the betterment of both peoples.\"\n\nOne of the few foreign policy bright spots for Mr. Obama was the agreement this month of Palestinians and Israelis for renewed peace talks. Mr. Obama encouraged both sides to resume talks during a trip to the Middle East in March.\n\nLawrence Korb, senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said the development is \"not going to solve all the problems\" in the Middle East and suggested that the progress is more style than substance.\n\n\"It shows [administration officials] are willing to spend some political capital,\" Mr. Korb said. \"Even if it doesn\u2019t work, it undermines the narrative that we don\u2019t care.\"\n\nMr. Miller said the president can point to three major foreign policy accomplishments in his first term: extricating U.S. troops from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, reducing U.S. dependence on \"Arab hydrocarbons,\" and preventing another terrorist attack in the U.S. on the scale of 9/11\u2014notwithstanding the Fort Hood shootings and the Boston Marathon bombings.\n\n\"On balance, you\u2019re dealing with a guy whose foreign policy has had no spectacular successes, other than the killing of bin Laden,\" Mr. Miller said. \"But it\u2019s been pretty disciplined, with no spectacular failures, either. Given the limitations on American power and our own domestic difficulties, that\u2019s actually not so bad.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Agency for Global Media Chief's Actions Raise Concerns over Editorial Independence of International Broadcasters\n\nArticle:\n\nReports suggest that the new chief executive of Voice of America and its sister organizations is refusing to renew visas for hundreds of foreign journalists, potentially exposing them to retaliation for their reporting. This development has reignited concerns that the individual may be attempting to co-opt the foreign broadcasters for political ends.\n\nVoice of America, along with other publicly funded international broadcasters, is a trusted and popular news source globally due to its independence from political pressure. These reports follow other indications that the Trump administration may be interfering with the broadcasters' editorial independence. In late April, the White House baselessly attacked VOA as Chinese \"propaganda.\" More recently, Michael Pack, the new chief executive at the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which administers the broadcasters, has reportedly fired senior leadership and is refusing to act on visa applications, effectively terminating these foreign journalists and depriving the USAGM broadcasters of essential expertise for their reporting.\n\nWhile Pack has the authority to manage the USAGM, he cannot interfere with the legal \"firewall\" that has been established to safeguard the editorial independence of U.S. international broadcasters from political influence. This firewall is based on two fundamental pillars: international broadcasters must adhere to the highest standards of journalism, including transparency, comprehensiveness, balance, accuracy, and strict autonomy; and political appointees, like Pack and the secretary of state, are barred from interfering in the \"professional independence and integrity\" of the broadcasting services. Any attempt by Pack or others in the administration to dictate news content would likely be illegal.\n\nFurther, journalists and editors at the USAGM broadcasters have First Amendment rights independent of their status as government employees and contractors. The news staff at VOA and the other broadcasters are members of the media, and efforts to interfere with their work could trigger basic First Amendment protections, such as the right to gather news, the right to be free from a \"prior restraint\" (were Pack to try and block a story's publication, for instance), and prohibitions on official retaliation for protected speech.\n\nMoreover, particularly with respect to the foreign journalists now facing what amounts to firing as their visas expire, Pack's moves may violate civil service protections. It is well established, for instance, that career government employees may not be terminated based on national origin. Additionally, the firewall itself may protect journalists and editors to the extent the decision not to renew their visas is an attempt to interfere with the broadcasters' independence.\n\nSetting aside the legal implications, efforts to interfere with the independence of publicly funded international broadcasters are practically unwise. During the Cold War, autonomy, credibility, and professionalism were identified as essential factors in the success of U.S. international broadcasting. The ability of broadcasters like VOA, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Liberty to relay both good news and bad (including bad news about the U.S.) drove massive audience engagement and trust. The appeal was so pressing for officials in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc that they spent the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars trying to jam the broadcasters' signals.\n\nThe public broadcasters also provided an essential counterweight to state-controlled media. For example, when the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl suffered a catastrophic meltdown in 1986, foreign broadcasters were the first source of hard news on the disaster for millions of people behind the Iron Curtain, and it forced state-controlled media to grudgingly acknowledge the accident.\n\nFinally, and of particular relevance to the foreign journalists who now face a forced return to countries where their reporting may have angered government officials, one other crucial factor for success was the ability of the public broadcasters to tailor their news to the audience. \u00c9migr\u00e9 broadcasters with an intimate knowledge of the language and culture of listeners again bolstered credibility and thus advanced the effectiveness of U.S. public diplomacy. That talent is invaluable and irreplaceable, and for it to be squandered today for political reasons would be tragic.\n\nThe Reporters Committee regularly files friend-of-the-court briefs and its attorneys represent journalists and news organizations pro bono in court cases that involve First Amendment freedoms, the newsgathering rights of journalists, and access to public information.

    " Title: Rising Costs of Necessities Contrast with Falling Prices of Discretionary Items During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday showed a 0.1% decrease in May, primarily due to discounting in energy, car insurance, public transportation, and clothing prices. The core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also decreased by 0.1%, marking the first time it has fallen for three consecutive months.\n\nHowever, the CPI data may not accurately reflect the experiences of many households, as most households spend a significant portion of their income on necessities such as food, shelter, transportation, healthcare, and clothing. According to researchers at the Brookings Institution, low-income households typically spend 82% of their income on these five categories, while middle-class families spend 78%. Even high-income families spend about two-thirds of their income on necessities.\n\nWhile some discretionary items, such as gasoline, clothing, transportation, and hotel rooms, have seen decreases in price, the cost of necessities, such as food and shelter, has increased. This trend can be attributed to supply and demand dynamics, exacerbated by the unique challenges the coronavirus has imposed on supply chains. Shortages are common.\n\nIn May, grocery prices rose 1% compared to April, and have increased by 4.1% over the past three months, equivalent to an annual rate of 17.5%. Beef prices have risen by 11% in just three months. Shelter prices, including both rental and ownership costs, are not increasing as rapidly as they were at the beginning of the year but are still rising, up 2.6% in the past year compared with a 0.9% drop in the prices of all other goods.\n\nThe increase in shelter costs, which take up a significant portion of household incomes, translates into a substantial impact on budgets, particularly for low-income families, who spend, on average, 41% of their income on housing.\n\nWhile overall savings have soared to a record 33% of disposable incomes in April (with May figures not yet available), households that have lost more than 25% of their income may be feeling the pinch, especially if they are relying on one-time $1,200 checks or the soon-to-expire $600 unemployment bonus. If grocery prices continue to rise 1% every month, this could further strain their budgets.\n\nWhile the country as a whole may be experiencing deflation, not everyone is benefiting from falling prices in the items they need to survive. As the pandemic continues, it remains to be seen how these trends will evolve and how they will impact households across income levels.",
    " Title: Visualizing Two Centuries of U.S. Immigration: A Data-Driven Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nFrom 1820 to 2013, approximately 79 million people obtained lawful permanent resident status in the United States. An interactive map, available for viewing as a video or a full-screen interactive version, visualizes this migration based on the immigrants' prior country of residence. The brightness of a country corresponds to its total migration to the U.S. at the given time.\n\nOver the two centuries, the sources of immigration have traced a clear path across the world. Through most of the 1800s, immigration came predominantly from Western Europe, including Ireland, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Toward the end of the century, countries further east in Europe, such as Italy, Russia, and Hungary, became the largest sources of migration. Beginning in the early 1900s, most immigrants arrived from the Americas, including Canada and Mexico. The last few decades have seen a rise in migration from Asia.\n\nThe same trends are clear when examining the history of New York City's foreign-born population. The largest immigration \"waves\" have been charted over time, showing the progression. While it may seem that immigration over the last few decades has been higher than ever before, the picture looks very different when viewed relative to the size of the U.S. population.\n\nThe data used for the map is \"persons obtaining lawful permanent resident status,\" which does not include illegal immigration or, as pointed out by @ artsyTrish, people brought to the U.S. as slaves (\"forced immigration\"). World borders for the map were provided by Natural Earth.\n\nFor those interested in learning more about the causes behind these immigration waves, this graphic summarizes some of the major events that led to migration from specific countries. The role of the United States as a sanctuary for troubled people across the world is a significant part of its history.\n\nThe data for this analysis was obtained from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Immigration Statistics, available in a full report and in Excel format. The author, Max Galka (@galka_max), has also created a project called Elementus, which aims to bring transparency to the cryptocurrency market.

    " Title: U.S. Unemployment Rate Drops Below 6 Percent for First Time Since 2008, Adding 248,000 Jobs in September\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate has dipped below 6 percent for the first time since July 2008, with nonfarm payrolls adding 248,000 new jobs in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The jobless rate fell 0.2 percentage points to 5.9 percent.\n\nEmployment increased in professional and business services, retail trade, and health care, as reported by the BLS. The data were stronger than expected, with employers adding about 69,000 more jobs in July and August than the government initially reported.\n\nThe median forecast among economists surveyed by Bloomberg had called for 215,000 new jobs in September.\n\nJason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement that the report extends the \"longest streak of private-sector job growth on record.\"\n\n\"The data underscore that six years after the Great Recession \u2014 thanks to the hard work of the American people and in part to the policies the President has pursued \u2014 our economy has bounced back more strongly than most others around the world,\" Furman said.\n\nMany economists consider 5.5 percent unemployment a \"healthy number,\" and as the unemployment rate moves closer to that figure, The Associated Press says it \"could ratchet up pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate.\"\n\nAs NPR's John Ydstie reports, \"Over the past few years, much of the decline in the unemployment rate has been attributed to people leaving the labor force. But, Jim O'Sullivan of High Frequency Economics says in 2014 it's largely job growth that's has pushed unemployment down.\"\n\nDean Maki, chief U.S. economist at Barclays PLC in New York, is quoted by Bloomberg as calling the latest data \"strong across the board.\"\n\n\"The labor market continues to grow fast enough to keep pushing the unemployment rate down,\" Maki told Bloomberg.\n\nEven with the new jobs, nearly 100,000 people stopped looking for work. The number of Americans working or looking for work was at 62.7 percent, the lowest proportion since February 1978, according to The Associated Press.",
    " Title: President Trump Vetoes Bipartisan Resolution to Block Border Emergency Declaration\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday used the first veto of his administration to reject a bipartisan resolution that sought to block his declaration of a national emergency at the border. The veto is likely to kill the measure, as lawmakers are unlikely to muster the two-thirds majority required to override.\n\nTrump's veto came a day after 12 Senate Republicans joined Democrats in voting for the resolution, despite last-minute efforts between the White House and GOP lawmakers to keep the Republican Party united. The measure ultimately passed 59-41.\n\nIn the Oval Office, Trump, surrounded by law enforcement officials and families of those killed by illegal immigrants, said, \"I am vetoing this resolution.\" He added, \"Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution, and I have the duty to veto it.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that the veto was a sign that Trump \"had chosen to trample all over the Constitution.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the House will vote to override the veto on March 26.\n\nTrump originally declared a national emergency on the border last month after Congress granted only a fraction of the $5.7 billion he requested for a wall on the border. Declaring a national emergency allows Trump to steer an extra $3.6 billion to the wall.\n\nSenate Democrats, who have consistently opposed many of Trump's hardline immigration policies, were joined by Republicans who expressed support for Trump's calls to build a wall but cited concern about the expansion of presidential power. The resolution had previously passed the Democrat-controlled House.\n\nIn a separate development, the Senate also voted to end U.S. support for Saudi forces in Yemen. The vote was not related to the border emergency declaration.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who voted against the border emergency declaration, said the vote was a question of the balance of power that is core to the U.S. Constitution. \"This is not about the president or border security, in fact, I support border security, I support a barrier,\" Romney told reporters.\n\nThe other Republicans who voted against the border emergency declaration were Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah; Rob Portman, R-Ohio; Susan Collins, R-Maine; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; Rand Paul, R-Ky.; Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn.; Roger Wicker, R-Miss.; Roy Blunt, R-Mo.; Jerry Moran, R-Kan.; and Pat Toomey, R-Pa. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., had initially said he would oppose the declaration but reversed course on the Senate floor. Sen. Mike Lee had introduced a bill that would end future emergency declarations after 30 days, but after Trump said he opposed that legislation, Lee eventually backed the measure to rebuff Trump.",
    " Title: Protesters Breach U.S. Embassy Compound in Yemen's Capital, Sanaa\n\nArticle:\n\nProtesters in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, have stormed the U.S. Embassy compound, marking the latest attack on U.S. diplomatic posts in the Middle East. The protesters breached the embassy perimeter and reached the compound grounds, although they did not enter the main building housing the offices. Angry young men brought down the U.S. flag, burned it, and replaced it with a black banner bearing Islam's declaration of faith.\n\nYemeni security forces, who rushed to the scene, fired in the air and used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators, driving them out of the compound after about 45 minutes and sealing off the surrounding streets. It was not immediately clear whether anyone was inside the embassy at the time of the attack.\n\nDemonstrators removed the embassy's sign on the outer wall, set tires ablaze, and pelted the compound with rocks. Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi ordered an investigation into the attack, avowing to bring the culprits to justice, stating the attack by a \"rowdy crowd\" was part of a conspiracy to derail Yemen's close relations with Washington.\n\nThe movie cited in the attacks, \"Innocence of Muslims,\" came to attention in Egypt after its trailer was dubbed into Arabic and posted on YouTube. The video-sharing website blocked access to it Wednesday. The trailer depicts Muhammad as a fraud, a womanizer, and a madman in an overtly ridiculing way, showing him having sex and calling for massacres.\n\nThe Yemen incident was similar to an attack on the U.S. Embassy in the Egyptian capital of Cairo on Tuesday night. A mob in Libya also attacked the U.S. consulate in the eastern city of Benghazi on Tuesday, killing American Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.\n\nThree diplomats injured in the Libyan attack are being treated at an American military hospital in Germany, and one of the two most seriously wounded is expected to leave the intensive care unit on Thursday. A State Department status report obtained by The Associated Press says the third injured staffer is awake and alert at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center near the Ramstein Air Base, where 33 uninjured consulate personnel are staying and receiving military counseling. All were evacuated from Benghazi early Wednesday and arrived in Germany late that afternoon along with the remains of the four diplomats.\n\nAccording to the report, the injured staffers \"are doing relatively well\" and most want to return to Libya. In Iraq, several hundred Shiite hardliners protested in Baghdad's Shiite stronghold of Sadr City. The leader of an Iranian-backed Shiite militia that previously attacked U.S. troops, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, threatened anti-U.S. attacks. The movie \"will put all the American interests in Iraq in danger,\" the militia leader, Qais al-Khazali, told The Associated Press.\n\nIn Iran, about 50 protesters shouted, \"Death to America,\" outside the Swiss Embassy, which looks after U.S. diplomatic interests in Iran. Riot police kept the crowd away from the building. On Thursday, Egyptian protesters also clashed with police near the U.S. Embassy in Cairo for the third day in a row. Police used tear gas to disperse the protesters, and the two sides pelted each other with rocks. But unlike Tuesday, the police kept the protesters away from the embassy's compound. The Interior Ministry, which is in charge of police, said 16 protesters and 13 policemen were wounded in the clashes, which broke out overnight and were ongoing. Twelve protesters have been arrested, it said. Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi criticized the movie Thursday during a visit to the European Union in Brussels. \"We condemn strongly... all those who launch such provocations and who stand behind that hatred,\" Morsi said, adding that he had asked Obama \"to put an end to such behavior.\" But Morsi also urged the Egyptian people to not engage in \"unlawful acts.\"",
    " Title: Ted Cruz's Ivy League Background Adds to Liberal Disdain\n\nArticle:\n\nTed Cruz, the freshman senator from Texas, has been a subject of disdain for liberals over the past year, with his political views being a significant source of contention. The article notes that Texas, as a state, is known for producing Republican figures reviled by the other side, and Cruz is no exception.\n\nUnlike his predecessors George W. Bush and Rick Perry, Cruz is an Ivy Leaguer, having graduated magna cum laude from Harvard and excelling as a debater at Princeton. This pedigree, however, seems to add an extra element of disbelief to the disdain Cruz faces from Democrats and liberal pundits.\n\nCruz's political views are considered gauche at the prestigious universities where he studied, and he is often portrayed as a constitutionalist conservative who is a \"traitor to his class.\" A Daily Beast piece quoted fellow Princetonians who expressed surprise at Cruz's political transformation, describing him as a man of \"calcified thinking, dangerously impervious to facts.\"\n\nThe left's deepest prejudice is that its opponents are unintelligent, and Cruz challenges this stereotype. Chris Hayes of MSNBC has even expressed fear of Cruz's brilliance, while Attorney General Eric Holder was reportedly cornered during a hearing on the administration's drone policy.\n\nCruz has not shied away from making his presence felt in the Senate, entering the upper chamber with the boldness of a SWAT team. This assertiveness has been met with disapproval from senators who are used to wielding intellectual and moral superiority.\n\nThe article acknowledges that Cruz's tactics are not without criticism, particularly his push to defund Obamacare, which some view as a slogan without a realistic path to legislative success. The strategy of a government shutdown to achieve this goal is seen as unrealistic, and Cruz has been criticized for not providing a clear explanation of how such a strategy would lead to the desired outcome.\n\nDespite the criticism, the article suggests that Cruz will be a significant force in the Senate, potentially shaping policy for decades to come and continuing to elicit strong reactions from both sides of the aisle.",
    " Title: Mortgage Rates in the U.S. Reach All-Time Low Amid COVID-19 Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nMortgage rates in the United States have reached an all-time low, dropping to 3.29% during the week ending March 5, according to Freddie Mac. This significant decrease of 16 basis points from the previous week was primarily in response to concerns related to the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThe 15-year fixed-rate mortgage also fell 16 basis points to 2.79%, while the 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage dropped only two basis points to an average of 3.18%. The decline in rates presents a major opportunity for millions of homeowners across the country, who could potentially save thousands of dollars in interest by refinancing.\n\nAn estimated 44.7 million homeowners have $6.2 trillion in home equity that they could access through a cash-out refinance, according to real-estate data firm Black Knight. With the chance to access that cash at a lower interest rate, many homeowners may take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nMortgage rates have been following the yield on the 10-year Treasury, which dropped below 1% for the first time ever this week after the Federal Reserve announced it was cutting its benchmark interest rate in response to the potential economic impact of the illness outbreak.\n\nThe decline in rates has stoked another refinancing boom, with mortgage applications increasing 10% last week from one year ago and showing no signs of slowing down. However, lenders have been hesitant to trim rates at such a fast pace, as they need to maintain their margins and don't want to cut into their profits too much by reducing rates.\n\nAn emerging risk that those looking to refinance may want to consider is the possibility of government orders to shelter in place amid the coronavirus outbreak. This could potentially create friction in the system, as some of the work can be done remotely but may not be possible if loan processing centers are closed.\n\nHome buyers may also be hard-pressed to take advantage of low rates due to the low inventory of homes for sale. In recent months, the inventory of homes for sale has hit an all-time low amid the high demand from buyers. This low inventory is largely the result of depressed home construction activity in the wake of the recession, which did not keep pace with household formation across the country.\n\nOverall, the drop in rates could help push some people to sell their homes, but it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to meet the demand in the market. If the broader economy weakens due to the coronavirus outbreak, it may be challenging for the housing market to remain above the fray.",
    " Title: Vice Presidential Candidates Deliver Polarized Performances in Debate, Addressing Campaign Vulnerabilities and Policy Differences\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the highly anticipated vice presidential debate on Tuesday, Mike Pence and Tim Kaine delivered polarized performances, each using the opportunity to address campaign vulnerabilities and delve into policy differences. The debate served as a valuable service for both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, as it advanced the narrative and provided a platform for fresh attacks on each other's running mates.\n\nFor Governor Mike Pence (R-IN), the debate was a welcome opportunity to move beyond the worst week of the Trump campaign. The Republican nominee was widely seen as having lost to Clinton in their first debate, and his subsequent comments about a former Miss Universe and the release of old Trump tax return details further damaged his image.\n\nPence faced a barrage of incoming from Senator Kaine (D-VA), and in many cases, declined to defend Trump. This strategy may have been the smart move, as Pence might have spent the entire debate playing defense, responding to accusations about Trump's taxes, admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, demeaning comments about women, and birtherism.\n\nInstead, Pence deflected and ignored much of Kaine's assault. When Kaine asked Pence why he wasn't defending Trump, Pence replied, \"I'm happy to defend him,\" and then continued to not defend him on many of the points.\n\nWhen Kaine accused Trump of running an \"insult-driven\" campaign, Pence ignored the vast catalog of evidence and turned the slam back on his opponent. \"Ours is an insult-driven campaign?\" Pence interjected, with mock incredulity. Then he ran for daylight, countering Clinton's labeling half of Trump supporters as a \"basket of deplorables.\"\n\nPence also raised the controversies around Clinton's private email server and the family's charitable foundation. In a way, for Pence, it was a do-over debate \u2013 a chance to score some points against Clinton that Trump failed to do last week and show him how to keep his cool during a debate.\n\nFor Kaine, the debate was a chance to unload a torrent of sound bites against a Trump candidacy loaded with vulnerabilities. However, he came in so aggressive, and interrupted so much, especially at first, that Pence was widely seen as winning on temperament \u2013 an important measure of whether a candidate is \"presidential.\"\n\n\"Kaine wins on substance, loses on style,\" wrote independent pollster John Zogby.\n\nKaine got off some obviously rehearsed one-liners that may turn up in future Clinton campaign ads. More than once, he referred to Trump as the \"you're fired\" candidate and Clinton, the \"you're hired\" candidate. And he accused Trump of having a \"personal Mount Rushmore\" \u2013 President Putin, Kim Jong-un, Muammar Qaddafi, Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe tenor of the debate shifted markedly when the subject of faith came up. Both men are deeply religious \u2013 Kaine is Roman Catholic, Pence is a born-again Evangelical \u2013 and they spoke from the heart. Moderator Elaine Quijano of CBS News asked each to discuss a time when faith conflicted with governing. Kaine spoke of his struggle, as governor of Virginia, with the death penalty, which he opposes.\n\n\"It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I did not feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did,\" Kaine said.\n\nPence didn't offer a similar example, and instead used the opportunity to speak on \"the sanctity of life.\" He also offered warm words for Kaine. \"I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine's sincere faith. I truly do,\" he said.\n\nPence then turned to the Clinton-Kaine ticket's support for abortion rights, including so-called \"partial-birth abortion\" (which Kaine had, in fact, once opposed). But it was a respectful critique. And in a campaign nearly devoid of discussion on issues that matter to religious conservatives, a crucial element of the Republican base, Pence surely in that moment did his ticket some good.",
    " Title: Connecticut School Shooting: President Obama Vows Action Against Gun Violence\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama, in response to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, which left at least 25 people dead, including 20 children, expressed his condolences and vowed to press for meaningful action to prevent similar incidents.\n\nIn a statement made on Friday, Mr. Obama said, \"We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years.\" The comments echoed those he made in the aftermath of the 2011 shooting in Tucson, Arizona, that severely wounded then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killed six. However, no new federal gun laws were enacted in the aftermath of that incident.\n\nThe Connecticut school shootings, in which 27 people were killed, have raised questions about the origin of the firearms believed to have been used in the massacre. According to two federal law-enforcement officials, authorities recovered a Glock, a Sig Sauer, and a.223 Bushmaster rifle near the body of the suspected shooter, Adam Lanza, 20 years old. The guns were registered to Lanza's mother, Nancy Lanza, who was among Friday's victims.\n\nThe AR-15, one of the most popular rifles in America, is under scrutiny after police say the weapon was used in the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. The registration answers one of the questions about the origin of the firearms believed used in the mass shooting. Under federal law, Lanza would have been prohibited from buying handguns from a licensed dealer because of his age. An 18-year-old, however, can get a handgun as a gift or from a private seller.\n\nThe shootings come one day after Michigan lawmakers voted to allow trained gun owners to carry concealed weapons into places once prohibited. Under the bill, which is now on the desk of Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, schools can opt out if they wish. Gov. Snyder said through spokeswoman Sara Wurfel that the bill \"was going to be already going through a careful review and analysis.\"\n\nThe most prominent federal gun law to go into effect during the Obama administration was one that eased restrictions, allowing gun owners to carry loaded weapons into National Parks and wildlife refuges as long as the relevant state's laws permitted it.\n\nIn the comments Mr. Obama delivered from the White House, he spoke of the children who were killed. \"The majority of those who died today were children\u2014beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them\u2014birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own.\"\n\nThe shootings have sparked calls for tougher federal legislation on gun control. Some legal and policy experts believe the Connecticut shootings could prompt tougher federal legislation on gun control. Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said, \"This is the cap to an awful year of horrific shootings. And if anything's going to cause politicians to act, it's a roomful of child victims.\"\n\nHowever, gun-rights supporters argue that restrictive gun-control regimes, such as that in place in Connecticut, are ineffective. Dave Workman, the editor of TheGunMag.com, a magazine owned by the Second Amendment Foundation, a pro-gun-rights lobby group, said, \"It's a very restrictive state, and this presumably occurred in a gun-free school zone. It creates a situation where the criminals have guns, and everyone else is defenseless.\"\n\nThe debate over gun control is likely to continue in the aftermath of the Connecticut school shootings. The full facts of the incident are still emerging, and the impact on federal and state gun laws remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Court Rules Against Trump Administration in Lawsuit Over Federal Grant Funds for Sanctuary Cities\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 7th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled against the Trump administration in a lawsuit filed by the city of Chicago over the withholding of federal grant funds due to the city's status as a sanctuary city. The court found that the administration's threat to withhold public safety grants from jurisdictions that do not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) violates the Constitution's separation-of-powers provisions.\n\nThe court battle dates back to 2017 when the Department of Justice (DOJ) moved to withhold Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants from Chicago, a city that has refused to honor ICE detainer requests, share information, or cooperate with immigration agents. Then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel sued the DOJ in response.\n\nIn a 95-page ruling, Judge Ilana Rovner, writing on behalf of the three-judge panel, stated that the executive branch's authority on immigration policy does not include withholding funds from cities that were allocated from the legislative branch. The court found that such a move would concentrate power and potentially lead to tyranny, which the Founding Fathers intended to prevent.\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Rahm Emanuel's successor and a major opponent of Trump's immigration agenda, celebrated the court's decision. \"When I got the news from our corporation counsel earlier this morning, I let out a cheer,\" Lightfoot said, according to CBS Chicago. \"This is a great victory, not only for Chicago, but for our immigrant and refugee communities everywhere in the country.\"\n\nThe grant money at stake was a mere fraction of 1% of Chicago's budget, but the drawn-out court fight indicated that the lawsuit was much more for Chicago leaders than receiving federal funds. The Justice Department has the option of appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, but it's not clear yet how the DOJ will proceed.\n\nChicago authorities have specifically instructed local law enforcement not to work with ICE agents in many circumstances. The city does not honor ICE detainer requests, and has even allowed illegal aliens charged of heinous crimes to walk free without notifying the agency, which has led to some gruesome consequences. In response to public backlash over such incidents, Lightfoot has put blame back on ICE.",
    " Title: White House Scrambles to Address Ongoing Confusion and Humanitarian Concerns Over Family Separation Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House is currently grappling with the fallout from President Donald Trump's reversal on the separation of parents and children who cross the southern border as undocumented migrants. The President's executive order, aimed at resolving a growing political crisis, has created its own set of problems, particularly as it does not address the 2,300 children already separated from their parents who are awaiting prosecution.\n\nThe Trump administration faces a potential legal challenge, with one scenario potentially allowing the separations to be reapplied. The uncertainty surrounding the reunification of families has led to Trump's hopes of quelling the political uproar over the separations being dashed.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen responded to criticism by stating that the administration is working to reunite split families. \"We have a plan to do that,\" Nielsen told CNN's Tal Kopan. \"So a combination of DHS, DOJ, HHS [Department of Health and Human Services] reuniting as quickly as we can.\"\n\nHowever, CNN reported Wednesday that the order did not contain any procedures for how to reunite children currently in the care of the federal government with their parents. The agency later walked back the statement but said any further plans to reunite families were still in development.\n\nJohn Sandweg, a former director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, expressed his concerns about the executive order's execution. \"I think the intention was to change things [but] I think the way the order is drafted is not executable,\" Sandweg told CNN's Anderson Cooper.\n\nTrump's critics accuse him of creating the problem by adopting a \"zero-tolerance\" policy of prosecuting undocumented migrants, which led to restrictions on children being held in jail with their parents, triggering the separations.\n\n\"He created a crisis, he said he solved the crisis. He has not,\" said Democratic House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer to CNN's Kate Bolduan. Immigration was a foundational issue of Trump's 2016 campaign, and it forms the essential link between the President and his base. While his retreat is embarrassing, it's unlikely to signal any softening of his broader stance on undocumented immigrants.\n\nThursday morning, Trump continued to express his displeasure with current immigration laws and mislead about the state of US immigration courts. The President mentioned the reversal only in passing at a campaign event in Minnesota on Wednesday night.\n\nWhile the political situation is murky, the legal challenges to the executive order may be even more complex. Under the Trump administration's new policy adopted earlier this year, many people are funneled into the criminal justice system when they cross the border illegally\u2014and US guidelines mandate at that point that children are separated from their parents. The executive order lays down new guidelines, requiring families to be kept together in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security. However, this position is almost certain to be challenged in court due to a 1997 consent agreement that stipulates that children can be kept in detention only for 20 days. That decision could even lead to families being separated again.\n\n\"It's absolutely a possibility,\" said Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University professor of law, outlining two possibilities if the administration could not get the consent agreement modified, a scenario he judged as doubtful. \"You reunite the family; a clock is ticking. If it goes beyond 20 days, you either release the entire family, which is similar to the Obama policy that the President wants to change, or you once again separate the family and send the child into some type of custodial care.\"",
    " Title: Boris Johnson Elected as Britain's Prime Minister, Faces Challenges on Brexit and Iran Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nBoris Johnson, a known supporter of the United States and defender of President Trump at times, has been elected as the new Prime Minister of Britain. Johnson, who has pledged to complete Brexit in three months, now faces an escalating naval crisis with Iran.\n\nLast Friday, Iran's Revolutionary Guards seized a British-flagged oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation for the British seizure of an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar earlier this month. Johnson, however, has signaled his opposition to a hawkish stance towards Iran. During last week's TV debates, Johnson stated that he would not support US military action against Iran.\n\nIn 2018, when he was foreign minister, Johnson traveled to Washington to try to persuade President Trump to stay in the Iran nuclear deal, stating that the British government remained committed to the agreement.\n\nJohnson's pledge to leave the European Union by October 31, regardless of circumstances, is a challenge he inherits from the same divided Conservative Party and Parliament that helped bring down Prime Minister Theresa May. Johnson may also face a 'no-confidence vote' and early elections within weeks.\n\nPresident Trump expressed his support for Johnson, stating, \"I like him. I like Boris Johnson. I spoke to him yesterday. I think he's going to do a great job. I think we're going to have a great relationship.\"\n\nDuring an interview, Johnson was asked if he would be as submissive as prime minister, to which he responded, \"I've been, towards the United States of America, craven? Do not be ridiculous. If I may say so. When it comes to sticking up for UK interests, whether it's over climate change, over disputes with Iran, over the Iran nuclear deal, we have been very, very forthright with the United States of America, and I will continue to be forthright.\"\n\nIn 2015, Johnson accused Trump of having \"stupefying ignorance\" and said Trump was \"unfit to hold the office of president of the United States.\" Johnson, a former mayor of London known for his occasionally unconventional ways, has adopted a populist style that has served him well.\n\nHowever, as prime minister, Johnson must navigate through an international crisis, with possible war clouds looming.",
    " Title: Five Common-Sense Policies to Cut Spending, Boost Revenue, and Stimulate Economic Growth\n\nArticle:\n\nAmericans have expressed a desire for lower deficits and increased economic growth, but reaching a consensus on policies to achieve these goals remains challenging due to partisan differences. Republicans oppose new taxes, while Democrats are averse to cuts in entitlement spending. Even the sequester, which included minimal spending cuts of 8% for defense and 5% for other spending, was met with significant opposition.\n\nIn an effort to find common ground and stimulate economic growth, this article presents five practical policies that could be implemented with bipartisan support:\n\n1. Reduce Medicare and Medicaid spending: Encourage competition between U.S. pricing and international pricing for drugs, as Americans currently pay the highest prices in the world. This competition would lead pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices in the U.S. Additionally, doctors should be reimbursed based on procedures rather than a percentage of drug costs or tests performed. To reduce end-of-life procedures for terminally ill patients, Americans should be asked to state their end-of-life wishes when they renew their driver's licenses.\n\n2. End the war on drugs: The war on drugs has proven ineffective, similar to Prohibition. Legalizing and taxing marijuana would generate new revenue and reduce spending on overcrowded jails. State lawmakers in Washington are anticipating hundreds of millions of dollars a year in new tax revenue due to a now-legal pot market. Legalization would also create job opportunities for the unemployed.\n\n3. Grant Green Cards to the best and brightest: Encourage those who receive advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay in the U.S. by offering them Green Cards. These individuals contribute to the success of U.S. companies, create jobs, and generate new tax revenue.\n\n4. Require unemployment benefits recipients to volunteer: Research indicates that the longer unemployment benefits are provided, the longer the jobless remain unemployed. Instead of incentivizing the jobless to find work, we continue to pay them benefits. By requiring the unemployed to volunteer 20 hours a week at a non-profit, the unemployment rolls would decrease, and those volunteering would develop skills and create job networks.\n\n5. Allow companies to bring back foreign profits: American companies have parked over a trillion dollars overseas due to taxes on profits made abroad. The U.S. uniquely taxes these profits again at one of the highest corporate tax rates in the developed world. To stimulate the economy, jobs, and tax revenue, companies should be allowed to return their profits at a lower rate (e.g., 10%) if at least half the money is spent on new U.S. jobs or capital investment.\n\nTo balance the budget and put the U.S. on a path to prosperity, creative and bipartisan thinking is required. Adopting these common-sense solutions could help meet sequestration goals without raising taxes or cutting entitlements.",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Invokes \"Nuclear Option\" to Alter Filibuster Rules\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, known for his hard-ball style of leadership, has taken an unprecedented step by altering the filibuster rules for presidential nominees in the Senate. This move, which was carried out on a straight party-line vote, could have significant implications for future presidents, reshape the Senate, and define Reid's legacy as one of the longest-serving Democratic leaders in history.\n\nOn the weekend of Nov. 9, Reid consulted with his top lieutenants, Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York and Dick Durbin of Illinois, to gauge the caucus's sentiment. Despite several weeks of vote counting, Reid encountered skepticism from some of his confidants as late as Monday evening. However, after personal intervention from President Barack Obama, Reid won the vote on a slim margin, 52-48.\n\nThe move, which was emblematic of Reid's leadership style, has been criticized by both parties. Three Democrats, the retiring Carl Levin of Michigan, the moderate Joe Manchin of West Virginia, and the vulnerable Mark Pryor of Arkansas, broke ranks with Reid.\n\nThe \"nuclear option\" allows the Senate to set a new precedent by a simple majority of 51 senators, rather than the typical 67 votes needed to change the rules by regular order. This means any majority can fundamentally weaken the filibuster without consensus of the minority party, effectively weakening its ability to block, delay, or shape legislation.\n\nUnder the new rules, senators can no longer filibuster nominees to executive branch posts or the courts, with the exception of the Supreme Court. Legislation could still be filibustered, as could many other Senate actions. However, both sides acknowledge that future majorities will cite Reid's precedent to continue weakening the filibuster, potentially ending the delaying tactic on all bills and Supreme Court nominees and allowing a simple majority of senators to work their will.\n\nReid's decision to alter the filibuster rules has been met with criticism from Republicans, who warn that Reid will ultimately come to regret it. Democrats, on the other hand, argue that the move was necessary due to Republican obstruction of Obama's judicial picks and the ongoing gridlock in the Senate.\n\nThe latest move has left both parties grappling with the far-reaching ramifications of Reid's decision. When asked about the potential impact of his move on his legacy, Reid stated, \"I don't write history.\"",
    " Title: Republicans Push for Consensus on Obamacare Replacement as Supreme Court Case Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublicans have been advocating for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, for nearly five years. However, 2015 could be the year that Republicans define their replacement plan. In March, the Supreme Court will hear a case, King v. Burwell, that threatens subsidies that form a core of the Affordable Care Act. If King prevails, subsidies could be abruptly cut off to millions of people in states relying on the federal health exchange.\n\nSen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, stated, \"What the King case does is give us an opportunity and a reason to come to a consensus sooner so, when we get the ruling of the Supreme Court in June, we are then prepared to say, 'Here is what is better for the American people in terms of affordability, quality, and choice.'\"\n\nThe Republican discussions are preliminary, and a breakthrough isn't imminent. Various Republican proposals have been put forth over the years, but forging agreement requires bridging deep ideological differences among Republicans about the scope of a plan, the role and responsibility of the federal government in health care, and how much to spend.\n\nSenators such as Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Richard Burr of North Carolina, along with Representatives Fred Upton (R-Mich.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), are working on a replacement draft. They aim to present a logical solution prior to the Supreme Court case being heard.\n\nThe Republican moves come as the Affordable Care Act is working fairly well. The three-month enrollment season for 2015 is going smoothly and will likely surpass the administration's modest second-year goals of having 9 million covered in exchange plans. As of mid-December, more than 6 million had signed up in the federal exchange, a tally that will rise when the state numbers are added in.\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules against the White House in the King case, it would hobble President Barack Obama's signature law and spill over into the rest of the U.S. health insurance system. Without subsidies in two-thirds of the states, the uninsured rate would probably rise, reversing its sharp decline. Premiums could soar if only the sickest people stick with their more expensive coverage.\n\nThe GOP could face a political backlash if people lose coverage from a lawsuit it supported, reminiscent of the fury Obama faced over last year's plan cancellations. The uncertainty surrounding the court case also adds complexity to the Republican attempts to undermine the law through repeal votes as well as the budget process known as reconciliation. Republicans may wait until the court's ruling to decide how they want to use reconciliation.\n\nNo matter what strategy they adopt, they won't be able to get rid of the law legislatively while Obama is in the White House\u2014although they hope that the Supreme Court could create an opening for significant changes.",
    " Title: Trump Compares Approval Ratings to Obama's at End of First Year in Office\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump took to Twitter on Friday morning to compare his approval ratings to those of former President Barack Obama at the end of Obama's first year in office. Trump's tweet came after a discussion on the Fox News program \"Fox & Friends\" concerning a new Rasmussen poll showing Trump's approval rating at 46 percent, with Obama's at 47 percent for the same time period.\n\nBeverly Hallberg, president of the District Media Group and a fellow for the conservative Heritage Foundation, commented on the program that the poll \"kind of reinforces what [Trump] would refer to as the 'fake news.'\" Trump's tweet followed shortly after.\n\nHallberg continued, stating that Trump ended December with landmark tax reform legislation being passed, which was \"huge for his presidency.\" She also pointed out that Trump's media coverage has been negative, citing ABC's Brian Ross's suspension for an incorrect story about the former national security adviser in Finland and CNN's retractions of some stories.\n\nFox News contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy, guest-hosting on the program, commented that she could \"just imagine what Obama's poll numbers would be if he had endured the abuse\" Trump \"has endured.\"\n\nHallberg added that Trump's tweets sometimes make it harder for himself, and he has faced multiple Russia investigations and staff turnover throughout 2017. Despite these challenges, she noted that Trump's high approval numbers, especially in light of Democratic claims that he could not be re-elected, suggest that some in the media may not be taking the numbers seriously.\n\nHallberg also pointed out that media stories about Trump were six times more negative than those about Obama, with Obama's coverage being \"far more favorable.\" She concluded that Trump's presidency has been controversial when it comes to his relationship with the media, but the high approval numbers were largely due to a fantastic December and the passage of tax reform.",
    " Title: Obama Faces Challenges in Domestic and Foreign Policy as Second Term Begins\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Americans continue their post-Labor Day return to work, President Barack Obama has resumed his duties in the White House, facing a series of significant and complex issues that could shape his presidential legacy. The following outlines some of the most pressing challenges Obama will encounter in both domestic and foreign policy, as well as the qualities he may need to address them effectively.\n\nIn the short term, the most critical issue is reaching a new spending plan in collaboration with Congress by September 30 to avoid a government shutdown on October 1 and to raise the debt ceiling. The United States must also address its debt ceiling to prevent a potential default. While GOP leaders may not wish to cause a shutdown, they would like to see more spending cuts as part of the debt-ceiling deal. To navigate this situation, Obama will need to demonstrate patience and diplomacy.\n\nIn the long term, the economy remains a significant challenge. Obama plans to embark on a bus tour of the Northeastern United States to present his ideas for economic recovery. When he leaves office in January 2017, Americans will evaluate his performance based on whether they are better off than they were in 2009, when he took office. To achieve economic growth, Obama will need to demonstrate persuasive abilities, as he and the GOP have differing views on economic policy.\n\nForeign policy challenges include the humanitarian crisis in Syria and the political instability in Egypt. Both situations require concerted effort to uncover solutions, reduce human suffering, and move toward peace. Obama has shown caution in addressing these issues, which is generally a prudent approach when no clear best option presents itself. To navigate these challenges, Obama will need to demonstrate wisdom, courage, and diplomacy.\n\nAnother domestic challenge is funding and implementing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as \"Obamacare.\" Republicans feel they have a good chance to stop the ACA before it starts by withholding funding and slowing implementation at the state level. Obama will need determination, flexibility, and open-mindedness to find enough consensus to move forward.\n\nPassing immigration reform legislation is another significant challenge. While GOP senators support bipartisan legislation, GOP representatives in the House are divided on the issue. They first want to address border security and find the idea of \"amnesty\" for those already illegally in the U.S. unacceptable. To win over GOP opponents, Obama will need determination, flexibility, and open-mindedness, looking for enough consensus to move forward.\n\nEntertaining the 1972 Super Bowl champion Miami Dolphins football team on August 20 will provide a welcome relief for an embattled president who is also a sports fan. The most satisfying event for Obama may be helping to mark the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech on August 28. The connection between King's call for racial equality in 1963 and the nation's first African-American president makes an eloquent statement, regardless of the words the president chooses for the occasion.",
    " Title: Debate Analysis: President Obama and Governor Romney's Foreign Policy Face-Off\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the third and final presidential debate of the 2012 election, President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney engaged in a foreign policy discussion that, according to several news outlets, resulted in a draw. Both candidates presented strong arguments on various issues, with Romney demonstrating poise and preparedness, while Obama took a more aggressive approach.\n\nRomney, as anticipated, aimed to present himself as informed, composed, and credible as a potential president. He effectively countered Obama's attacks, particularly those perceived as dishonest, and emphasized the need for solutions rather than confrontation.\n\nObama, on the other hand, often appeared to be the aggressor, challenging Romney in most of his responses. The candidates found common ground on several issues, such as Syria and Iran sanctions, leading to smaller disagreements over timing and the intensity of their respective responses.\n\nRomney's strongest answers were on the economy, the national debt, Israel, and the so-called \"apology tour.\" He concluded the debate effectively, while Obama shared a touching anecdote about meeting a 9/11 orphan and repeatedly emphasized his role as Commander-in-Chief.\n\nIn the post-debate analysis, several media outlets, including CNN and The New York Times, fact-checked a disagreement over the number of troops remaining in Iraq, with Romney being correct and Obama being wrong. The New York Times also supported Romney's contentions regarding the auto industry.\n\nCBS's instant poll gave a substantial advantage to Obama, 53-23, with 24 percent calling it a tie. However, CNN's snap poll indicated a narrow Obama debate win, 48-40, with Romney running neck-and-neck with the sitting president on the Commander-in-Chief test.\n\nThe moderator, Bob Schieffer, was widely praised for his performance, executing his responsibilities effectively. Twitter volume suggested a significant decrease in viewership and interest compared to the first and second debates.\n\nThe president's team has already backpedaled from Obama's assertion that the sequestration defense cuts \"will not happen.\" A bizarre moment on CNN involved swing voters in a focus group who claimed they had made up their minds but were not asked in which direction.\n\nPPP insta-poll respondents gave the debate to Obama 53-42, but the poll appeared to be biased toward Democrats, and the results were relatively undramatic. The Romney team is likely to find this data point favorable, particularly among independent voters.\n\nJohn Harris from Politico was not impressed with the president, stating that his performance \"diminished\" the presidency. CNN's post-debate poll indicated a narrow Obama debate win, but Romney was competitive on the Commander-in-Chief test.\n\nCharles Krauthammer and Ross Douthat, prominent political commentators, agreed that Romney won the debate tactically and strategically. The big picture, according to Douthat, is that the snap polls will give a clear edge to Obama, but Romney's polling may not suffer significantly as a result.",
    " Title: Reuters Media Columnist Jack Shafer Questions 'War on the Press' Narrative\n\nArticle:\n\nReuters media columnist Jack Shafer has raised questions about the notion of a \"war on the press\" in a May 24 piece, arguing that while there have been legal actions against the media, they do not amount to a full-scale war.\n\nIn the article, Shafer discusses the investigation of journalist James Rosen's emails, which he uses as a primary example of the alleged war on the press. He cites a George Washington University Law School professor who states that the labeling of journalism as a \"criminal offense\" in the affidavit for the search warrant does not necessarily indicate a prelude to prosecution.\n\nShafer's defense focuses on the language in the affidavit for the search warrant, but he also acknowledges that there has been a leak crackdown, albeit primarily among bureaucrats rather than journalists. He notes that the administration has been compared to an information \"black hole\" by his colleagues in the media.\n\nHowever, Shafer's argument is nuanced, and he undercuts the arguments against President Obama at several points. He suggests that the press also lobbies like any other interest group and uses the traditional liberal defense of blaming Republicans for similar actions.\n\nDespite Shafer's self-proclaimed non-liberal stance, his career and actions suggest otherwise. He has worked for left-wing publications such as The Washington City Paper and Slate, and his personal website features a prominent link to a \"Hot Topic\" called \"Everything Murdoch,\" which includes columns critical of Fox and Rupert Murdoch.\n\nIn a previous column published on May 21, Shafer criticized Fox reporter James Rosen for poor journalistic practices. This column was a long critique of Rosen's reporting, despite Shafer's defense of the concept of Rosen's journalism in his later piece.\n\nShafer's columns carry the tagline: \"Jack Shafer is a Reuters columnist, but his opinions are his own.\" In the media landscape, this statement remains largely accurate, as Shafer's defense of Obama's actions towards the press appears to be a singular perspective.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Pursue \"Nuclear Option\" to Alter Senate Rules on Executive Nominees\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Democrats have initiated a process to change the Senate rules regarding filibusters on executive branch nominees, setting up a potential showdown on Tuesday. This move, known as the \"nuclear option,\" would allow the confirmation of President Obama's controversial appointments without the need for a supermajority, or 60 votes, to end a filibuster.\n\nThe decision to pursue the nuclear option follows Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's (D-NV) announcement that he would not use the option at the beginning of the year. However, after Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) delayed confirmation of some of President Obama's nominees, Mr. Reid changed his stance.\n\nIn a morning floor speech, Mr. Reid stated, \"A deal is a deal, a contract is a contract, an arrangement is an arrangement, a bargain is a bargain, as long as each party to such an agreement holds up his end of the bargain.\"\n\nRepublicans have warned that they may retaliate if they regain the majority by ending other filibusters, allowing them to push through their own priorities without fear of minority obstruction.\n\nThe term \"nuclear option\" refers to changing the rules by a majority vote, rather than the two-thirds vote the Senate usually requires, which guarantees the minority certain rights that have defined the chamber throughout its history. If Republicans filibuster the nominees, Mr. Reid is expected to ask for a parliamentarian ruling on the legality of the filibuster. Based on Senate history, the parliamentarian will rule that it is legal, and Mr. Reid will move to overturn that ruling, which requires a simple majority and sets official precedent.\n\nThe nuclear option would apply only to executive branch and independent agency nominations, not judicial nominations or legislation. Democrats have historically used partisan filibusters of judicial nominees, but both parties have a long history of filibustering each other's executive branch appointments.\n\nSeven nominees are scheduled for filibuster votes on Tuesday: the Labor Department secretary, Environmental Protection Agency administrator, three members of the National Labor Relations Board, the president of the Export-Import Bank, and the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nRepublicans have been slow-walking or outright blocking many of President Obama's nominees, but they signaled Thursday that they would be willing to relent and allow votes on most of them. The only nominees Republicans are reluctant to approve speedily are two NLRB nominees and the consumer bureau nominee, each of whom President Obama has installed to temporary appointments using his recess powers. A federal court ruled that this maneuver violated the Constitution.\n\nIt takes only a majority vote to approve a nominee on a final vote, but the minority is allowed to filibuster to prevent that final vote, and it takes 60 votes to end the filibuster. The increasing use of filibusters, or their threat, has shifted power from the president, whom the Constitution gives the right to nominate officers of the United States with the \"advice and consent\" of the Senate.\n\nPresident Obama tried to regain some of that power by using his recess appointment powers in an unprecedented way. He appointed members to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the National Labor Relations Board even though the Senate did not consider itself in recess. Two federal appeals courts have ruled that President Obama's NLRB appointments violated the Constitution. The Supreme Court is set to hear one of the cases, and the ruling could dramatically circumscribe the president's power.\n\nMr. Reid waited until after he cleared a major immigration bill through his chamber to raise the filibuster issue, knowing it would be so contentious that it could have ruined his chances to win the bipartisan vote on that bill. Republicans contemplated using the nuclear option in 2005 to end Democratic filibusters of judicial nominees, but backed off after a bipartisan \"Gang of 14\" senators struck a deal that preserved the filibuster in limited circumstances. That deal has since dissipated.",
    " Title: Kavanaugh Denies Sexual Misconduct Allegations in Fox News Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview aired on Fox News' \"The Story with Martha MacCallum\" on Monday night, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, sitting next to his wife Ashley Estes Kavanaugh, refuted allegations of sexual misconduct made by two women. The interview came days before the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hold another hearing on his confirmation. President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh in July to succeed Justice Anthony Kennedy on the high court.\n\nThe vote on Kavanaugh's nomination has been delayed due to allegations leveled by one of his accusers, psychology researcher and Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford. She alleges that while both were in high school, Kavanaugh held her down, put his hand over her mouth to silence her, and tried to remove her clothes.\n\nA second woman, Deborah Ramirez, a Yale University classmate of Kavanaugh's, claims that he exposed himself to her and shoved his penis in her face at a dorm room party in their freshman year at the Ivy League school. She said they were playing a drinking game at the time and admits there are gaps in her memory of that night.\n\nDuring the interview, Kavanaugh stated that he never had sexual intercourse \"or anything close to (it)\" until long after he left Georgetown Prep, the elite all-boys Catholic high school he attended in Rockville, Maryland. When asked about his sexual activity during the years in question, he answered, \"Many years after.\"\n\nKavanaugh also denied the allegations made by Ford, stating, \"I was never at any such party,\" and that the other people who were alleged to be present have said they do not remember any such party. He further stated, \"I am not going to let false accusations drive us out of this process and we\u2019re looking for a fair process where I can be heard and defend my integrity, my lifelong record.\"\n\nPresident Trump is standing by his pick, stating during an appearance at the United Nations General Assembly in New York that Kavanaugh \"is an absolutely outstanding person. Hopefully he will be confirmed quickly.\" Ashley Kavanaugh, who was the personal secretary to President George W. Bush when Brett Kavanaugh worked in the White House, sat next to her husband as he forcefully defended himself.\n\nMacCallum asked Kavanaugh to address the specific allegations, whether he had ever blacked out from drinking too much in high school, and whether similar allegations by someone in high school should count against them later in life. Kavanaugh repeatedly refuted the allegations, stated that he never blacked out from drinking too much in high school, and responded, \"I think everyone's judged on their whole life.\"\n\nShaunna Thomas, executive director of UltraViolet Action, a progressive group that opposes Kavanaugh's confirmation, criticized the judge for choosing the \"comfort of a partisan network\" to air his denials. \"If Kavanaugh really wanted to get to the truth, he\u2019d go to the FBI, not Fox News,\" she said. \"This was the move of a political hack, not a nominee to the Supreme Court.\"",
    " Title: Florida State University Shooting Leaves Three Injured, Gunman Identified as FSU Alum\n\nArticle:\n\nA shooting incident at Florida State University (FSU) in Tallahassee left three people injured on Thursday, according to Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo. The gunman, identified as Myron May, a 2005 FSU graduate who had recently moved back to the area, was fatally shot by police.\n\nMay, who had written documents and made videos discussing being targeted by the government, was shot and killed by officers after refusing to surrender, according to DeLeo. The police chief did not confirm whether May fired at police.\n\nMay had written documents and made videos discussing being targeted by the government, and his Facebook page includes Bible verses and links to conspiracy theories about the government reading people's minds.\n\nOne victim was hospitalized in critical condition, another in good condition, and a third was treated at the scene and released. More than 300 students were in the Strozier Library when the shooting began at about 12:15 a.m.\n\nCampus Police Chief David Perry said classes will resume on Friday, and the library will reopen. He promised a strong police presence. Officials canceled classes on Thursday but kept the campus open and made counseling available to students and staff.\n\nJason Derfuss, 21, was leaving the library when the shooter opened fire near him. Derfuss posted on Facebook pictures of a bullet and a book, Great Medieval Thinkers: John Wyclif, which the bullet had torn through. Derfuss says in his post he was near the gunman when the shooting started, but never felt the shot and only discovered the damage three hours later.\n\nAllison Kope, a freshman from Cocoa Beach, Fla., said she ran for her life when she heard someone say, \"Somebody's got a gun.\" She ran right out the back door and left her laptop and other belongings behind.\n\nUniversity President John Thrasher described the shootings as an isolated incident but also said police did \"an extraordinary job taking quick and decisive action to prevent further tragedy.\"\n\nDaniel Morales, a 19-year-old freshman from Fort Pierce, Fla., said that when he first heard someone say, \"Somebody's got a gun,\" he thought they were joking. But after realizing a gunman was in the library, Morales and others raced to a back room on the second floor where they barricaded a door with desks.\n\nThree freshmen who were in the DeGraff Hall dormitory at the time said they began getting reports from friends locked down in the library.\n\n\"We know there are definitely people who saw the shooter,\" Anthony Coons said.\n\n\"You hear all these stories on the news, then it happens,\" Martin said. \"This is something you never want to happen.\"\n\nNikolai Hernandez, who was in another dorm room nearby, said he heard \"consecutive gunshots\" that sounded as if they came from an automatic rifle.\n\n\"That was confirmed when I went outside and talked to someone who said they saw police open fire on a shooter who was armed right on the front steps of the library,\" the freshman said.\n\nThe video below was posted on Facebook by Jessica Davis. An individual can be heard over the intercom saying, \"There has been a shooting in the library. Stay where you are,\" and instructing people to call 911 if they have been shot.\n\nStudents were allowed to leave the library about 3 a.m. Before that, students were on lockdown at the campus' library and in dorms. FSU police issued an alert warning its 40,000 students that read: \"Dangerous Situation! Main Campus - Tallahassee. Seek shelter immediately, away from doors and windows.\"\n\n\"If there is any positive news we can take from this occurrence, (it) is that the victim count was not higher,\" Tallahassee Mayor-elect Andrew Gillum said.\n\nSocial media immediately lit up with messages of concern and prayer requests.",
    " Title: The Misrepresentation of Pre-existing Conditions and the Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nA new AP-NORC poll indicates that approximately half of Americans support the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. However, many Americans want the health care law repealed, and few want to maintain it in its current form. The social media narrative surrounding the ACA has been a subject of debate, with hashtags like #MakeAmericaSickAgain and #CoverageMatters emerging as rhetorical weapons for Obamacare defenders.\n\nOne such hashtag, #the27percent, claims that 27% of Americans under the age of 65 with pre-existing conditions could lose coverage if Obamacare is repealed. This statistic is based on a new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation. However, a closer examination of the data reveals that the pre-existing condition crisis used to sell Obamacare to voters never actually existed.\n\nThe ACA requires insurers to sell to all applicants, regardless of their health status or history. This \"guaranteed issue\" provision has been popular among Democrats and Republicans alike. Obamacare's defenders argue that repealing this provision will cause millions of people with pre-existing conditions to lose their coverage.\n\nHowever, the Kaiser report estimates that 52 million non-elderly people, or 27% of the population, have uninsurable health conditions. Yet, even this smaller figure is an exaggeration. According to the Kaiser report, the vast majority of these individuals with declinable pre-existing conditions have coverage through an employer or through public programs like Medicaid.\n\nIndividuals insured through a government program have long been protected from coverage denials based on pre-existing conditions. Since 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act has provided the same protection to Americans insured through their employers. Therefore, denials of coverage were only ever possible in the individual market pre-Obamacare.\n\nA 2010 congressional investigation found that the nation's four largest insurers denied coverage to only one in seven applicants because of a pre-existing condition. Assuming the same denial rate in a post-Obamacare world, roughly 1% of the non-elderly population is actually at risk of losing coverage.\n\nThe GOP's replacement plan will still protect those with pre-existing conditions. The plan will bar insurers from raising people's premiums significantly, provided they maintain continuous coverage. If they cannot find affordable insurance on the open market, they'll be able to turn to state-based high-risk pools supported by $25 billion in federal funding over 10 years for subsidized coverage.\n\nThis network of high-risk pools will guarantee affordable coverage for those with pre-existing conditions without raising premiums for everyone else in the general insurance pool, as Obamacare did. The social media campaigners behind #the27percent are perpetuating precisely the false narrative about pre-existing conditions that gave rise to Obamacare in the first place. Instead of opting for #FakeNews, Obamacare's partisans should stick to the facts.\n\nSally C. Pipes, president and Thomas W.

    " Title: Hollywood Faces Challenges as Cinemas Reopen Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the United States gradually eases restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, a semblance of normalcy returns, albeit in a limited capacity. Restaurants, stores, salons, and small gatherings are resuming their roles in weekly routines. However, one traditional aspect of American life remains absent: going to the movies.\n\nTheaters, which were already struggling in an era of home streaming, are preparing to reopen in July. Yet, the movie industry faces significant challenges. Production of new movies has stalled during the pandemic, resulting in fewer releases than usual. Theaters are also implementing safety measures such as capacity limits and strict guidelines, including mandatory mask-wearing and temperature checks.\n\nThese precautions aim to ensure the safety of moviegoers, but they may hinder the immersive experience that draws audiences to the cinema. The fear of an infectious disease, the concession stand, the restroom, and the theater seat may detract from the intended 90-minute escape from reality.\n\nHollywood, like the rest of society, has been disoriented by the pandemic. Attempts to create content during this time, such as the widely criticized \"Imagine\" performance, have fallen short. Now, more than ever, the public seeks escapism from the anxiety and gloom of the past few months, not a reminder of it.\n\nSeveral upcoming film releases, such as \"Unhinged,\" \"Tenet,\" and \"The Rental,\" may be well-crafted, but they do not offer the desired escape from reality. These films, featuring themes of road rage, World War III, and surveillance, are not the desired antidote to the current climate.\n\nHowever, there are glimmers of hope. Films like \"The Little People,\" an Irish horror flick about a young couple besieged by 2-foot-tall goblins, and the rumored return of Michael Keaton as Batman in \"The Flash,\" may provide the escapism audiences crave.\n\nDespite the new realities of watching movies safely, there is faith that Hollywood can deliver another essential form of protection: perfectly pure escapism. S.E. Cupp, the host of \"S.E. Cupp Unfiltered\" on CNN, expresses this sentiment.",
    " Title: District of Columbia's Political Lean Remains Steadfast Despite Demographic Shifts\n\nArticle:\n\nThe District of Columbia, the nation's capital, has maintained a consistent Democratic voting pattern in presidential elections, as reported by FiveThirtyEight in a recent article. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district's sole member of Congress, provided insights into the factors contributing to this political lean.\n\nHistorically, the District of Columbia has shown a significant Democratic bias, with the closest Republican victory being Ronald Reagan's loss by 61 percentage points in 1980. This trend is expected to continue in the 2012 election, with President Obama predicted to win an overwhelming majority of the vote on November 6.\n\nThe reason for this Democratic bias lies in the district's urban nature and its large black community. Cities, particularly those with a high black population, tend to vote Democratic, and Washington, D.C., fits this description. Black residents became a majority in Washington in the 1960 census, but they have always constituted a significant portion of the city's population. In the 1790s, about 25% of Washington residents were black. The black population peaked at 71% in the 1970s, after many white residents moved to suburbs.\n\nHowever, over the last decade, Washington's economy has thrived, attracting young, affluent, mostly white professionals. These new residents have formed white pluralities in downtown neighborhoods like Chinatown and the Penn Quarter. Currently, 49% of adults in the District of Columbia have a college degree.\n\nSimultaneously, many middle-class black families have moved to suburban communities in Maryland and Virginia. The high-income newcomers have caused rents and property taxes to rise in many neighborhoods, pushing out less wealthy longtime residents, many of them black. The 2010 census found the city's black majority barely intact, and demographers have reported that the black share of the population may have fallen below 50% since then.\n\nDespite these demographic shifts, the changing racial makeup of Washington has not altered its voting patterns. The city has a large number of students and faculty members at colleges and universities, as well as a significant number of public-sector workers, both core Democratic constituencies.\n\nBoth longtime and new Washingtonians share a common dissatisfaction over the district's lack of a voting member of Congress. Delegate Norton, who can serve on committees and speak on the House floor but cannot vote on legislation, has been a vocal advocate for giving Washington's representative voting rights in Congress.\n\nOn Independence Day, a holiday marking the struggle for political representation, Delegate Norton planned to walk in a Fourth of July parade, symbolizing Washingtonians' struggle for full voting rights. Unless Mitt Romney personally defeats an alien invasion\u2014and maybe not even then\u2014President Obama is expected to win the District of Columbia's three electoral votes.",
    " Title: South Korea Denies Imminent Nuclear Test by North Korea, Tensions Escalate\n\nArticle:\n\nMilitary and government officials in South Korea have denied reports that Seoul had detected signs North Korea was preparing for an imminent nuclear arms test. However, a mid-range, conventional missile test by the North remains highly likely, and may occur within the next week, according to analysts in the South.\n\nStrategic provocation, such as a missile or nuclear test, is considered \"more probable\" than military provocation, such as a direct attack against South Korea, said Kim Sung-han, an international relations expert at Korea University in Seoul. The former does not have to invite immediate retaliation, but the latter will provoke \"massive retaliation\" from South Korea, Kim added.\n\nThe United States' top military commander in South Korea, Gen. James Thurman, and South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Gen. Jung Seung-jo, have both canceled separate, long-scheduled trips to Washington in the next week.\n\nNorth Korea said Monday it will recall 51,000 North Korean workers and suspend operations at a factory complex it has jointly run with South Korea, moving closer to severing its last economic link with its rival as tensions escalate. The statement from Kim Yang Gon, secretary of a key decision-making body, the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, did not specify what would happen to the 475 South Korean managers still at the Kaesong industrial complex in North Korea.\n\nThe statement comes amid weeks of North Korean war threats and other efforts to punish South Korea and the U.S. for ongoing joint military drills. North Korea is also angry over the U.S.-led push for United Nations sanctions over its Feb. 12 nuclear test.\n\nPyongyang may launch a missile at some point in the next seven days. Wednesday is the day beyond which Pyongyang warned last week it can not guarantee the safety of diplomatic staff for the limited number of countries that maintain diplomatic representation there.\n\nNext Monday, April 15, is the anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, a key date in a state whose main religion is the cult of the Kim family.\n\nIf the North fires missiles or conducts another nuclear test, \"I think South Korea and international society will rely on the United Nations Security Council,\" Kim said. \"This type of diplomatic response is more probable.\"\n\nSouth Korea is concerned about a provocative attack near the border areas or a possible terrorist attack from the North that is difficult to identify quickly, as with the sinking of the South Korean navy ship Cheonan in 2010.\n\nOf great concern is not knowing how the North's relatively new leadership will act. The North began hurling threats and curtailing ties after new economic sanctions were imposed on it by the U.N. to get it to halt its nuclear program. The threats were increased during routine annual training exercises between the U.S. and South Korean militaries.\n\nUnlike his father Kim Jong Il, who had more than 15 years to prepare for stepping into the shoes of his father Kim Il Sung, the current leader Kim Jong Un, 30, is ill-prepared for his role, and rushing to deepen his power base, say analysts.\n\n\"This problem of power consolidation is his gigantic task to accomplish in a short period of time,\" Kim said.\n\nThe current crisis \"should culminate around 15 April, but will remain noisy until late April,\" predicted Andrei Lankov, a North Korea specialist at Koomkin University in Seoul. From the North Korean perspective, a missile test is \"cheap and necessary,\" compared to a nuclear test that will deplete the North's limited plutonium supply, he said.\n\nThe North Korean regime is \"gradually losing domestic support. There is a chance of an outbreak of public discontent,\" he said. \"It's always helpful to remind the people that their country is surrounded by evil and scheming enemies, and only the leader and the army can keep the country secure.\"\n\nThere is a \"high possibility\" of an imminent provocation from North Korea, but a mid-range missile test is \"more likely\" than another nuclear test, said Shin Jong Dae, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.\n\n\"The Park Geun-hye administration are taking the threat from North Korea seriously, but they don't see signs North Korea is preparing to attack South Korea. I think the South Korean government will preserve a cool stance,\" even if the North conducts a missile test, he said.\n\nWhile some analysts insist domestic concerns guide Kim Jong Un's actions, Shin said foreign policy goals drive Pyongyang's recent threats and tests.\n\n\"They want to force South Korea and United States to offer dialogue, and to extract concessions from Washington and Seoul,\" he said.\n\nThe industrial complex that Pyongyang said would be shut down combines cheap North Korean labor and South Korean know-how and technology. It is the last remaining inter-Korean rapprochement project from previous eras of cooperation.\n\nNorth Korea closed the border to northbound South Korean managers and cargo last week, though managers already there were allowed to stay. About a dozen of the more than 120 South Korean companies at Kaesong have already shut down because they can no longer get needed supplies.\n\n\"The zone is now in the grip of a serious crisis,\" Kim said, according to state media. He said it \"has been reduced to a theater of confrontation with fellow countrymen and military provocation, quite contrary to its original nature and mission.\"",
    " Title: Reagan's Landslide Victory over Carter in 1980 and Parallels to the 2016 Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 1980 presidential election, Ronald Reagan's victory over Jimmy Carter was attributed to several factors, including economic \"misery,\" public anxiety over American hostages in Iran, and the splintering of the Democratic voting coalition. A significant factor, as reported by \u2588\u2588\u2588, was a televised debate in which Carter attempted to portray Reagan as a \"simpleton\" and hard-right war-monger, but failed. Instead, Reagan was perceived as \"calm and reasonable,\" a decisive achievement for him with many undecided voters.\n\nFast forward to the 1984 election, Reagan's second debate against Walter Mondale was also highlighted for its impact. Reagan's performance was described as \"relaxed\" and included an \"eye-twinkling one-liner\" about not exploiting Mondale's \"youth and inexperience.\" The second debate was considered \"indispensable\" because the first debate had seen the president floundering after being urged to show off a mastery of technical policy details, only to seem overwhelmed. However, a new tactic was employed by the Reagan White House to spin the debate in their favor, with high-ranking insiders fanning out across the press room to press their verdict on reporters.\n\nAs the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton approaches, some historical parallels are emerging. Candidates can mangle facts and botch details and still win if a debate performance conveys a simple message: this is someone presidential.\n\nIn 2000, a TV debate between George W. Bush and Al Gore showed both candidates fighting against negative stereotypes of themselves. Bush was fighting the idea that he knew nothing, while Gore was fighting the idea that he was obnoxious or a liar.\n\nIn the 2016 election, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton need to fight not just with each other, but to slay their own monsters. Trump needs to reassure voters who worry that he is too ignorant, too divisive, and too hot-headed to lead, while Clinton needs to win over voters who dislike her as a calculating avatar for everything they resent about politics.\n\nThe test set by Monday's debate is the same for both: can Americans imagine waking on the morning after election day, feeling happy, comfortable, or even safe as they contemplate President Trump or President Clinton in the Oval Office?\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588's correspondents in America will live-tweet their analyses of the debate from 9pm New York time (2am London, 9am Hong Kong).

    " Title: New Yorker Publishes Allegations Against Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Raising Questions About Credibility\n\nArticle:\n\nThe New Yorker magazine has published an account alleging that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself to a woman while they were both students at Yale University. The alleged incident, which reportedly occurred during a drunken party in their freshman year, has been met with skepticism due to the accuser's shifting recollections and the lack of corroborating evidence.\n\nThe woman making the charge, Deborah Ramirez, initially expressed uncertainty about Kavanaugh's role in the incident, according to the magazine. She only decided to speak out after six days of assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney. However, her account still contains gaps, as she was drunk and did not directly see Kavanaugh during the incident.\n\nThe only other corroboration comes from an unidentified classmate who reportedly told the magazine that they heard about the incident later. The New Yorker has not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party, a significant omission if the story is to be used as evidence in an attempt to damage Kavanaugh's reputation. Two male students identified by Ramirez as being present at the party have stated they have no recollection of any such incident.\n\nThe New Yorker story comes after another blow to the credibility of Christine Blasey Ford's account, who has accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were both teenagers. Ford has identified four other people who were present at the high-school party, all of whom have denied the allegations. Leland Keyser, a long-time friend of Ford's and a Democrat, has stated through her lawyer that she does not know Kavanaugh and has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present.\n\nThe opposition to Kavanaugh is reportedly hoping that the two stories, with potentially more on the way, will support each other despite their inherent weakness. If Democrats manage to derail Kavanaugh's nomination on the basis of these charges, they will have achieved a miraculous feat by stopping a Supreme Court nominee with two unproven and probably unprovable charges, in what some are calling a disgraceful episode that makes Borking look above-board and responsible by comparison.\n\nIf Republicans choose to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination based on the current evidence, they may face the ire of their own voters, who have expressed strong support for the nominee. The facts, as they currently stand, lead to the belief that this is a questionable episode that raises serious questions about the credibility of the allegations against Kavanaugh.",
    " Title: Environmental Lobbies and Climate Activists Call for Ban on CO2 Coalition\n\nArticle:\n\nStacey Abrams, former gubernatorial candidate of Georgia, and Tom Steyer, former presidential candidate, are advocating for the ban of the CO2 Coalition, a research group that focuses on the benefits of carbon dioxide emissions. The CO2 Coalition, which consists of 55 climate scientists and energy economists, has an annual budget of half a million dollars, in contrast to the combined annual budgets of the 17 large environmental lobbies, totaling over half a billion dollars, and Steyer's personal wealth of $1.6 billion.\n\nThe CO2 Coalition's primary focus is on the role of carbon dioxide, a non-polluting, mild warming gas, as a source of plant and plankton food. The group's budget is significantly smaller compared to the environmental lobbies, and their views on climate change are often excluded from mainstream media discussions.\n\nThe campaign to ban the CO2 Coalition is led by Eric Michelman, a Silicon Valley computer entrepreneur who has been advocating for climate change alarmism for over a decade. Michelman is the founding and lead funder of Climate Feedback, a group that \"fact-checks\" and labels as \"false\" any deviant thoughts about fossil-fueled climate catastrophe. Climate Feedback is certified as an unbiased source on climate issues by the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, which operates the left-leaning PolitiFact.\n\nIn 2019, a \"false\" label was placed on a Washington Examiner article written by Dr. Patrick Michaels, a senior fellow at the CO2 Coalition, and the article's author, Dr. Caleb Rossiter, the executive director of the CO2 Coalition. The label triggered a wave of censorship from Facebook's algorithms, blocking reposting and advertising. The detailed, scientifically referenced letter written by the CO2 Coalition to Facebook was almost identical in form and argument to responses this summer to similar Climate Feedback censorship written by environmental writer Michael Shellenberger, Dr. Michaels, and climate statistician Dr. Roger Pielke Jr.\n\nClimate Feedback has been criticized for its bias, sloppiness, and inaccuracies. For example, the group contradicts the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's finding that there has been no statistically significant increase in rates of sea-level rise, hurricanes, droughts, and floods during the carbon emissions era.\n\nMichelman's Climate Feedback is his third major attempt at promoting climate alarmism and silencing opposing views. Previous attempts include the Climate Change Education Project in 2008 and the More than Scientists campaign in 2015. Michelman's group should never have been let into a network of \"unbiased\" reviewers, and its performance shows why.\n\nDr. Caleb Rossiter, the executive director of the CO2 Coalition, is open to debating with Climate Feedback but believes that the cancel culture does not believe in debate. Instead, it aims to silence its opponents by denying them a platform. The CO2 Coalition intends to hold on as long as possible, believing that the truth will eventually prevail, even against \"fact-checkers.\"",
    " Title: Military Background of George Washington's First Cabinet\n\nArticle:\n\nGeorge Washington's first cabinet, the first in the history of the United States, consisted of 80% members with military experience, if Washington is included in the count. Thomas Jefferson, the Secretary of State, was the sole civilian member.\n\nWashington hand-picked every member of his cabinet. For the Secretary of the Treasury, he chose Alexander Hamilton, who was born on the island of Nevis in the Caribbean and was illegitimate. Hamilton, who had no military training, joined the Continental Army as an artillery officer during the American Revolution and met Washington in this capacity.\n\nThomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry wrote to Washington, recommending Edmund Randolph, another aide-de-camp, as a young patriot with no military training but eager to serve. Randolph, however, was called home to settle his uncle's estate and take over management of the Randolph fortune.\n\nHenry Knox, America's first Secretary of War, was from Boston and had no military training before the Revolution. He made his living as a bookbinder but studied engineering and military tactics in his spare time. Knox enlisted in the Revolution and designed an artillery rampart in Roxbury, which Washington admired. He was named the chief of artillery and played a significant role in the American victory at the Battle of Yorktown.\n\nSamuel Osgood, the first Postmaster General, led a company of local militia at the Battle of Lexington and Concord and was promoted to Major during the Siege of Boston.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that the concern over the generals Trump has appointed or is considering for his cabinet is unwarranted, given the ongoing wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, as well as the threat posed by the Islamic State. The article argues that military men have leadership skills, are loyal, and have been defending the American people and the Constitution for 227 years. The article also notes that the United States has never had a military coup, and the liberties are not in danger, no matter how many generals serve in the cabinet.",
    " Title: New Orleans Removes Jefferson Davis Monument, Second of Four Confederate-Era Statues\n\nArticle:\n\nDozens of people gathered in New Orleans on Thursday morning to witness the removal of the Jefferson Davis Memorial, the second of four Confederate-era monuments set to come down. The statue, erected in 1911 in honor of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, was taken down at around 6 a.m. by workers wearing masks and helmets. The area was heavily guarded by police officers, presumably to prevent clashes between pro- and anti-monument groups.\n\nNew Orleans voted to remove four Confederate-era monuments in 2015, with many residents viewing the statues as symbols of racism and white supremacy. In a press release on Thursday, the city stated that the statues were built decades after the Civil War to \"celebrate the 'Cult of the Lost Cause,'\" a movement it says promotes white supremacy.\n\nNew Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said in the statement, \"Three weeks ago, we began a challenging but long overdue process of removing four statues that honor the \u2018 Lost Cause of the Confederacy.\u2019 Today we continue the mission.\" He further stated, \"These monuments have stood not as historic or educational markers of our legacy of slavery and segregation, but in celebration of it. I believe we must remember all of our history, but we need not revere it.\"\n\nThe city began the process of taking down the statues late last month, starting with the removal of the monument to the Battle at Liberty Place. Landrieu said the monument was put up to celebrate the murder of police officers by white supremacists.\n\nWorkers in the removal crew also wore masks, and the area was guarded by officers and snipers during the removal of the Liberty Place monument. Proponents and opponents of the removal plan have taken part in sometimes tense demonstrations at monument sites in the past. Multiple protesters were arrested and charged with disturbing the peace on Sunday after a fight broke out at an event held to celebrate the removal of the Liberty Place monument. The demonstration attracted more than 700 people, including counter-protesters who carried Confederate flags.\n\nThe city has not released a timeline for its removal plans, citing \"widely known intimidation, threats, and violence, serious safety concerns.\" However, Landrieu previously said the monument of Davis and the statues of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and P.G.T. Beauregard could come down \"anytime, sooner rather than later.\"\n\n\"To literally put the Confederacy on a pedestal in some of our most prominent public places is not only an inaccurate reflection of our past, it is an affront to our present, and a bad prescription for our future,\" Landrieu said in Thursday's statement. \"We should not be afraid to confront and reconcile our past.\"\n\nThe staff at the Morris Jeff Community School, located near the Jefferson Davis monument, sent out a recorded message late Wednesday to parents, saying that the New Orleans Police Department had confirmed that the statue would be removed overnight. Parents were also asked not to share the news on social media \"for safety and security\" reasons, as it fears that could intensify crowds and \"attract more protesters.\"",
    " Title: Yates Testifies on Flynn Misinformation Warnings to Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified before a Senate subcommittee on Monday, detailing her efforts to warn the Trump administration about misinformation provided by former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn regarding his discussions with the Russian ambassador to the U.S.\n\nYates stated that she spoke with White House counsel Donald McGahn three times, twice in person and once over the phone, following President Trump's inauguration. She informed McGahn that statements made by Vice President Mike Pence and others about Flynn's interactions with the Russian ambassador were inaccurate. Yates expressed concern that Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail due to these potential misrepresentations.\n\n\"We believe that General Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians,\" Yates told lawmakers.\n\nThe testimony focused primarily on Yates' conversations with McGahn. She explained, \"We told them how we had this information, how we had acquired it, and how we knew it was untrue.\"\n\nPresident Trump dismissed Flynn four days after The Washington Post published a story about Flynn and the reported misinformation he provided. This occurred more than two weeks after Yates' warning to the White House. In response to the hearing, Trump tweeted, \"Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Council.\"\n\nYates clarified during the hearing that she did not know how The Washington Post obtained the story. However, she did confirm that Flynn had shared inaccurate information due to phone calls intercepted by the Obama administration.\n\nTrump has defended Flynn, and Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group that has filed a lawsuit about these intercepted phone calls, has supported him. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton stated, \"President Trump is onto something. The Obama administration was monitoring at least people close to him, and certainly the results of that classified intelligence gathering were leaked, which is wildly illegal.\"\n\nYates maintained that her decision to inform the White House was not politically motivated and she did not call for the Trump administration to fire Flynn. \"We gave them this information so that they could take action,\" she said.",
    " Title: DOJ to Urge Federal Judge to Implement Pre-clearance Procedure for Texas Voting Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on Thursday that it will urge a federal judge to subject the State of Texas to the pre-clearance procedure for voting laws and practices, a measure largely struck down by the Supreme Court last month. The move is expected to be made in a lawsuit filed by Latino state lawmakers challenging Texas' redistricting plan based on the 2010 census.\n\nIn a speech to a National Urban League conference in Philadelphia, Attorney General Eric Holder stated that the federal government's request is based on evidence of intentional racial discrimination and the history of pervasive voting-related discrimination against racial minorities. The new request would require Texas to continue to pre-clear changes for the next decade.\n\nGovernor Rick Perry criticized the move, stating that it demonstrates \"utter contempt for our country's system of checks and balances, not to mention the U.S. Constitution.\" Texas' Attorney General, Greg Abbott, also announced plans to push back against the DOJ's action.\n\nIn its ruling last month, the Supreme Court invalidated a legislative formula that required parts or all of 15 states to clear all voting changes in advance with the Justice Department or federal court. However, the justices left intact a rarely-used mechanism that allows judges to impose the same pre-clearance requirements on states and localities found to have intentionally discriminated illegally in voting practices.\n\nSome advocates of tough voting rights enforcement by the federal government have argued that the DOJ could and should use the \"bail-in\" procedure to restore some of the status quo that existed before the Supreme Court's decision. Attorney General Holder vowed to keep up the pressure on voting rights, but warned that piecemeal measures would not completely replace the process in place until last month.\n\nThe DOJ's move against Texas was met with applause from the largely African-American audience at the Urban League conference. The session the attorney general addressed was billed by the group as an \"emergency town hall on voting rights and justice.\" While Holder spoke extensively about the shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida last week, he made no direct reference to the episode or to the acquittal of George Zimmerman on murder charges stemming from the shooting.",

Trump referred to Iran as a \"corrupt dictatorship\" and North Korea as a \"rogue regime,\" and threatened to \"totally destroy\" North Korea if necessary. Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, described Trump's speech as \"ignorant hate speech\" and North Korea has yet to respond.\n\nTrump's speech outlined a vision for a world filled with sovereign states working for the betterment of their citizens, but he spent significant portions targeting what he called \"rogue nations.\" He criticized Iran's nuclear deal, calling it \"one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.\" Iranian media have followed Foreign Minister Zarif in denouncing President Trump's remarks.\n\nIn response to Trump's criticism, Iranian MP Mahmudi Sadeqi wrote on Twitter, \"The poor translator suffered so much trying to distort and censure Trump's baseless remarks simultaneously on IRINN!\" Iranian TV also reported Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's description of Trump as a \"new Hitler.\" Pro-reform dailies heaped scorn on what the newspaper Ebtekar called the U.S. president's \"repetitive and baseless claims.\"\n\nTrump also targeted Venezuela, calling its government a \"corrupt socialist dictatorship.\" Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza rejected what he called \"threats.\" Bolivian President Evo Morales, an ally of the Venezuelan government, tweeted, \"I am not surprised that a multi-millionaire like Trump attacks socialism.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron defended the nuclear deal with Iran during his speech, stating, \"Renouncing it would be a grave error.\" However, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu backed Trump during his speech, calling for the amendment or scrapping of the Iran nuclear deal and warning against the spread of Iranian influence in the Middle East.\n\nPresident Trump's speech was an eloquent exposition of his \"America First\" doctrine, but at the same time contained some fulsome (and perhaps unexpected) praise for the United Nations as a body that can bring together sovereign states to tackle the world's problems. Trump saw national sovereignty as the main pillar of the international system, contrasting with the focus on globalization that has driven much of foreign policy discussion since the 1990s. Nonetheless, Trump's worldview contained many contradictions, as he called for the return of democracy in Iran and Venezuela, but it remains unclear if this will lead to practical action. All eyes will now be on Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, who will address the UN General Assembly later today.",
    " Title: Romney and Obama Campaigns Engage in Financial Attacks Ahead of November Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing presidential campaign between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama has taken a new turn as both sides engage in financial attacks, with the focus on Romney's wealth and offshore bank accounts.\n\nAmanda Henneberg, a spokeswoman for Mitt Romney, has labeled questions about the Republican's wealth as an \"unfounded character assault\" and described such actions as \"unseemly and disgusting.\" The intensified scrutiny comes just days after a mediocre jobs report, which added 80,000 jobs in June, marking the worst quarter for job creation since the summer of 2010.\n\nPresident Obama, in response, has called for an extension of middle-class tax cuts, stating that the fate of similar cuts for the wealthy will be resolved by voters in November's election. He emphasized that his opponent, Mitt Romney, will fight to keep the tax cuts in place, while he will fight to end them.\n\nMeanwhile, the Obama campaign and its advisers have shifted their focus to Mr. Romney's financial holdings, seizing on reports by the news media that some of the Republican's personal money is kept in overseas bank and investment accounts. A Vanity Fair magazine article published last week added new details about the status of Mr. Romney's finances, including his financial interests of at least $30 million in 12 funds in the Cayman Islands.\n\nKevin Madden, a spokesman for Mitt Romney's campaign, stated on Fox News Sunday that the Republican candidate \"hasn't paid a penny less in taxes by virtue of where these funds are domiciled.\" He added that the liability is the same as if the fund investments were held directly in the U.S.\n\nHowever, the Obama campaign and its allies have not been deterred from their attacks. Robert Gibbs, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign, accused the Republican candidate of not giving voters the information they need to make a decision about his wealth. He stated, \"Release the tax returns, put all this to rest. If Mitt Romney is not hiding something in Bermuda and Switzerland and the Caymans, it will be in the tax returns.\"\n\nDan Senor, an adviser to Mitt Romney, countered these attacks on the same \"Morning Joe\" episode, accusing Mr. Gibbs of being \"stunningly dishonest\" in his attacks. He emphasized that the accounts in question are in the tax returns that Mitt Romney released.\n\nThe Obama campaign is walking a fine line, attempting to portray Mr. Romney as out of touch while not appearing to question the value of being a wealthy businessman. This approach could backfire, especially with moderate voters in battleground states.\n\nSo far, Mr. Obama's campaign has focused more directly on Mr. Romney's role as a business executive, suggesting that his career was a boon to the wealthy and that he did not have the interests of workers at heart. Now, Democrats are hoping to contrast Mr. Obama's refusal to extend tax cuts for the wealthy and Mr. Romney's desire to cut taxes for people like him.\n\nMitt Romney's advisers believe that the effort will misfire. They argue that voters want the candidates to discuss how they will turn around the economy. Polling suggests they may be right, as a Washington Post/ABC News poll in April found that 71 percent of those surveyed did not consider Mr. Romney's wealth to be a major reason to support or oppose him. Among those who did consider it a major factor, his wealth was more likely to be a negative.\n\nFor the most part, Mr. Romney's advisers intend to ignore the attacks on his personal wealth. On Monday, they focused on Mr. Obama's renewed call to let the tax cuts for the wealthy expire. \"Americans are struggling in a 'zombie economy,' and President Obama's only answer is to pass one of the largest tax hikes in history,\" Ms. Henneberg said.",
    " Title: The Misinterpretation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Testimony as a Symbol of White Male Entitlement\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent testimony of Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee has sparked a heated debate, with some interpreting his demeanor as a representation of \"White Male Entitlement.\" This article aims to challenge this perspective, arguing that the characterization of Kavanaugh as a symbol of a preconceived notion rather than a real person with human agency is a significant flaw in contemporary political discourse.\n\nThe notion of Kavanaugh as a symbol of White Male Entitlement is a form of allegory, not an argument. In allegories, characters are not real people but metaphors for certain ideas. For instance, in John Bunyan's \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" (1678), the main character is named Christian, and he encounters other abstractions in human form, such as Mr. Worldly Wiseman.\n\nIn this context, Kavanaugh is portrayed as Mr. White Male Entitlement, and as such, he is deemed wrong by definition, as he is assigned the role of embodying an idea. Over the weekend, philosopher Martha Nussbaum penned an essay and pigeonholed Kavanaugh into her preconceived theories of what's wrong with the world. In her telling, Kavanaugh is simply the incarnation of her theory that men are brimming with misogyny driven by fear of, and anger at, \"women making demands, speaking up, in general standing in the way of unearned male privilege.\"\n\nSimilarly, Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart and New York Times' Maureen Dowd have characterized Kavanaugh's behavior as manifestations of \"white entitlement\" and \"entitled white men acting like the new minority.\"\n\nThis portrayal of Kavanaugh as a symbol of White Male Entitlement overlooks the possibility that Kavanaugh may feel entitled to the job due to his qualifications and years of service on the second-highest court in the country. Furthermore, it disregards the potential for Kavanaugh to feel entitled to some measure of fair play, given the accusations that have surfaced against him, which were not present before his nomination.\n\nThe characterization of Kavanaugh as a symbol of White Male Entitlement also ignores the potential for individual agency and the complexities of human behavior. By reducing Kavanaugh to a symbol, his critics have fallen into an argument built on a narrative of bigotry, where men from his background have done bad things in the past, and since he fits the stereotype, he is a symbol of their collective guilt.\n\nThis approach disregards the specific circumstances of individual cases and the need for a fair and impartial investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh. It also overlooks the historical context of racial bias, where \"believe all white women\" was the rule, leading to unspeakable evils when they made allegations against black men.\n\nIn conclusion, the interpretation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh's testimony as a symbol of White Male Entitlement is a flawed perspective that overlooks the complexities of human behavior and the need for a fair and impartial investigation of the allegations against him. This article aims to challenge this perspective and remind readers that Kavanaugh is a real person, deserving of human agency and a fair hearing.",
    " Title: President Trump Reverses Decision to Eliminate Funding for Special Olympics\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced that he is reversing a budget request to eliminate funding for the Special Olympics. The decision comes a day after Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was criticized for defending a proposed $17.6 million cut to the organization, which provides year-round training, health education, community building, and athletic competition for children and adults with intellectual disabilities.\n\nThe request was included in Mr. Trump's $4.75 trillion federal budget, which is not expected to pass Congress. Mrs. DeVos had earlier told Congress that the US Department of Education had to make \"tough choices\" following a 10% cut to her agency's budget, adding that the nonprofit group should be funded through private donations.\n\nThe cuts came as part of the administration's proposed budget for the 2020 fiscal year, which totals $4.75 trillion, the largest in federal history. The budget request slashed $17.6 million in funding for the Special Olympics, about 10% of the nonprofit organization's overall revenue. The majority of the group's support comes from individual and corporate donations as well as fundraising campaigns.\n\nThe spending plan also included more than $1 trillion in cuts to the Medicaid health program for the poor and disabled, while allotting $8.6 billion for the US-Mexico border wall. However, the budget proposal is not expected to pass Congress, which must approve it.\n\nAndrea Cahn, the Senior Director of Unified Champion Schools for Special Olympics who runs the Unified Champion programs in the United States, states that the budget cuts would have affected programs in 6,500 schools. The funding received from the US Department of Education is specifically for the Unified Champion schools programming, according to Ms. Cahn. However, the budget cuts would not impact any state games, world games, or any ongoing competitions that are scheduled.\n\nRaymond S Kellis High School in Arizona is one of the schools that has adopted this type of program. Michael Wakeford, a special education teacher and Unified Sports coach at the school, states that the program has enabled children with intellectual disabilities to be more outgoing. \"It helps our society bring faith back to humanity in a divisive world in a place where it's easy to fear what we do not know and to fear what we do not understand,\" Mr. Wakeford adds.\n\nThe Special Olympics, founded in 1968 in Washington DC, currently serves over five million athletes across 190 countries. The sports organization is separate from the Paralympics, which are mostly for elite athletes who have physical disabilities. Both groups are recognized by the International Olympics Committee. The US Special Olympics chapter provides trainings and competitions in 18 sports, including soccer, swimming, equestrian, and basketball. The Special Olympics World Games, which took place in Abu Dhabi earlier this month, are held every two years.",
    " Title: Georgia Governor Overrules Local Mask Mandates, Extends COVID-19 Restrictions\n\nArticle:\n\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp has overruled local government mandates requiring people to wear masks in public to prevent the spread of COVID-19, asserting that the state's less-stringent guidelines take precedence.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kemp extended the state's COVID-19 restrictions, which strongly encourage the wearing of masks but do not require them in public, calling a statewide mask mandate \"a bridge too far.\" His order rescinds mask orders in key cities such as Atlanta, Savannah, Athens, and Augusta, along with more than a dozen other local jurisdictions where similar directives have been issued.\n\nKemp, a Republican, has been at odds with mayors and city administrators over the issue in recent days. Last week, for instance, Atlanta's Democratic Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced a return to tough measures to control an ongoing spike in coronavirus infections in the capital, but Kemp's office insisted that her order was \"non-binding and legally unenforceable.\"\n\nGeorgia reported its second-highest new coronavirus case count to date on Wednesday, with 3,871 new confirmed cases and 37 COVID-19 deaths. Since the start of the pandemic, nearly 128,000 people in Georgia have tested positive for the coronavirus, and over 3,000 have died. Half of all new cases are being reported in Atlanta, the capital and largest city.\n\nThe Fulton County Health Department released their latest COVID-19 epidemiology report on July 13. The full report (which includes data for hospitalizations, long-term care facilities, demographics, and maps) can be found on the Fulton County Information website at <https://t.co/pqVzMBaLq3>.\n\nEarlier this month, some 1,400 health care workers signed a letter to Kemp warning that Georgia \"is simply not prepared\" for an upsurge in COVID-19 cases. The letter stated that the rising number of confirmed infections in the state \"cannot be accounted for by increased testing.\"\n\nKemp's new order requires people who are most vulnerable to COVID-19, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, to shelter in place. It also requires restaurants and other businesses to follow social distancing precautions and restricts public gatherings to no more than 50 people.\n\nIn their letter, the health care workers called for stricter measures, including a statewide mask requirement, reinstating the closing of bars and nightclubs, and prohibiting indoor gatherings of more than 25 people, including in churches, synagogues, and mosques.\n\n\"To close down when they need to close down, to mandate masks even if the governor's not willing to mandate masks. It could make a huge difference,\" Dr. Melanie Thompson, who helped write the letter, said, according to 11Alive News.\n\nThe governor's new order, which expires at the end of the month, was issued on the same day that President Trump visited a UPS hub in Atlanta. The president thanked \"every driver, worker, and employee\" who has worked through the pandemic.\n\nTrump has sought to deflect criticism of his administration's handling of the crisis, at times using racist, anti-Asian language to describe the coronavirus. In his speech at the UPS facility, the president praised the carrier's workers and referred to \"our battle against the China virus.\"",
    " Title: Geithner's 2008 Warning on LIBOR Rate-Setting Process\n\nArticle:\n\nTreasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, in his capacity as President of the New York Federal Reserve in 2008, expressed concerns about the LIBOR benchmark interest rate-setting process in a two-page memo addressed to Mervyn King, the then-head of the Bank of England. The memo, obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Thursday, recommended measures to \"improve the integrity and transparency of the rate-setting process.\"\n\nThe memo, which contained six key recommendations, aimed to prevent accidental or deliberate misreporting and eliminate incentives for banks to report inaccurate rates. Geithner requested a discussion on these recommendations, expressing hope for potential changes.\n\nThe LIBOR manipulation scandal erupted last month when London's Barclays bank was fined hundreds of millions of dollars for its practices, leading to the resignation of its CEO Bob Diamond. The 2008 note to King is expected to draw questions from lawmakers on Capitol Hill regarding Geithner's knowledge of banks' efforts to manipulate LIBOR and the extent to which he attempted to address the issue.\n\nThe LIBOR benchmark interest rate, published every business day in London, gauges the cost of borrowing between banks. The number of banks contributing to the process varies per currency (18 for the U.S. dollar). The rate, published midday, affects the cost of lending for a range of products, such as mortgages and credit cards.\n\nA group of 12 Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council on Thursday, demanding a full investigation. \"This scandal calls into further question the integrity of many Wall Street banks and whether our prosecutors and regulators are up to the task of regulating them,\" the senators wrote.",
    " Title: Partisan Differences in Perceptions of the Affordable Care Act's Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nA new Kaiser Family Foundation poll has revealed significant differences in the perceptions of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) between Democrats and Republicans. The poll suggests that Democrats are more likely to report personal benefits from the health care law and to know individuals who have gained coverage through it, while Republicans are less likely to do so.\n\nThe poll found that more than a quarter of Democrats reported being helped by the Affordable Care Act, while the number was 5% among Republicans. Similarly, when asked if they knew someone else who had been helped by the health care law, Democrats reported a higher number, while Republicans reported a lower one.\n\nInterestingly, Republicans were more likely to report knowing someone who had lost their health coverage or had their hours reduced due to Obamacare.\n\nThe disparities in perceptions could potentially be attributed to political views influencing impressions of the Affordable Care Act's effectiveness or failure. It is suggested that Democrats may overestimate the health law's reach, while Republicans may underestimate it, with the truth likely lying somewhere in the middle.\n\nIt is unclear from the provided information if the differences in perceptions are due to factors such as the implementation of the Medicaid program in Democratic-governed states compared to Republican-governed states. However, it is unlikely that this would account for the significant disparities in perceptions of the health care law's progress. Instead, the differences seem to reflect the more fundamental fact of whether people hold a positive or negative view of Obamacare.",
    " Title: Project Veritas Exposes Alleged Anti-Conservative Bias in Facebook's Content Moderation\n\nArticle:\n\nInvestigative journalism group Project Veritas, led by James O'Keefe, has released a series of undercover videos that allegedly reveal anti-conservative bias within Facebook's content moderation team. The videos feature comments from Facebook insiders and contractor employees discussing their perceived bias against conservative content and the intention to ban pro-Trump content on the platform.\n\nIn one video, a Facebook content moderator, Daniel Will, is heard stating, \"I think they [Facebook] are very biased with who they protect... They already shadowban, Facebook is notorious for it... They say they don't, but it's clear that people's content doesn't come up because it's been de-filtered off the queue.\"\n\nAnother video features a Cognizant employee, working as a social media content moderator, stating, \"If someone is wearing a MAGA hat, I'm going to delete them for terrorism.\"\n\nA former Cognizant employee, Zach McElroy, came forward with his findings while working at the content moderation company, outlining the bias he perceived within the company and across Facebook. McElroy claimed that while working at Cognizant, a graphic image of President Trump having his throat cut was allowed on the platform while memes and cartoons about former Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke were removed from the platform.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. commented on Project Veritas' video, stating, \"More truth about Facebook and the social media masters. Enough is enough, we can't let them interfere with elections any longer.\"\n\nFacebook has not yet issued a public statement regarding the allegations made in the Project Veritas videos.",
    " Title: Senate to Vote on Government Reopening as Both Parties Weigh Political Costs and Rewards\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, CNN - Democratic and Republican leaders are making intricate political calculations ahead of a planned 12 p.m. ET vote in the Senate on whether to end the government shutdown. Each side must decide whether the political costs and rewards of prolonging the showdown are greater than the costs and rewards of ending it.\n\nDemocrats must ask themselves whether they have sufficient trust in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, and his assurances he will hold a key immigration debate if the government reopens and a funding deal is secured. On the other side, Republicans in the Senate have to consider if there are any new steps they are prepared to take as they seek to pry open divisions between moderate and liberal Democrats in order to break down opposition to opening the government.\n\nPresident Donald Trump must decide whether, despite his self-image as a master dealmaker, he is willing to sit on the sidelines and watch as he is portrayed as an unreliable bit player in the drama. Trump, who sources say has been watching the showdown unfold hour-by-hour on cable TV, may also have to make a leap of faith if he wants to end the shutdown, and to steel himself to go against hardline advisers and his own political base to make concessions on immigration that Democrats want.\n\nThe President, on Monday, hit Democrats for being captives of their own most vehement supporters, a criticism ironically that they have leveled at him, in a potential sign he is not yet ready to soften his position.\n\nSo far, both sides can claim to have won political benefits from the impasse that closed down the federal government on Friday at midnight. Democrats can argue they stood firm against Trump on a key issue: the fate of 700,000 people brought to the US illegally as children and whether to extend their legal status, which they could lose in March. The Democratic stand came on a weekend when tens of thousands of activists took to the streets and held women's marches and rallies directed against Trump - a sign of liberal engagement in mid-term election year.\n\nRepublicans spent the weekend taking political shots at Democrats, accusing them of closing down the government on an unrelated issue to funding federal programs. The tactic allowed Trump aides to stoke enthusiasm in his own political base and put pressure on Democratic senators facing re-election in states in November in states that Trump won in 2016.\n\nA message to callers on the White House switchboard Sunday said Democrats were \"holding government funding, including funding for our troops and other national security priorities hostage to an unrelated immigration debate.\"\n\nHowever, the costs of the shutdown and the political pressures on both sides are expected to rise significantly as the full force of the stalemate becomes clear as government operations remain silent at the start of the work week. The Senate is due to vote at noon Monday on a bill to reopen the government and fund it for three weeks. It's unclear at this point whether the plan will win over sufficient Democrats to pass. Democrats have called for a funding extension of a matter of days to ensure momentum in negotiations is maintained.\n\nFive Democrats in traditionally red states voted to keep the government open on Friday. Republican leaders will test on Monday whether those numbers will increase as the pressure mounts.\n\n\"This is their off ramp,\" a senior GOP aide involved in the talks told CNN's Phil Mattingly on Sunday night. \"We'll see if they dig in or if they want a way out.\"\n\nMcConnell offered a guarantee on Sunday that if the DACA issue was not resolved by the end of a proposed interim funding period for the government on February 8, he would hold a full debate on the issue. However, Democrats must consider whether that assurance is sufficiently concrete for them to sell to base voters who are in uproar over DACA. It also appears uncertain whether the Republican-led House would follow suit if the Senate has a debate on the issue and passes legislation.\n\nThe uncertainty over Trump's position will also weigh against a Democratic shift of position after he called for, and then rejected, a previous bipartisan deal on immigration.\n\n\"The challenge is that Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan have delegated this to the President, and - the President - can he get to yes?\" Maryland Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin told CNN's \"New Day\" Monday. \"We'll see whether he can.\"\n\nIf the Democratic grassroots perceive that their Senate leaders have caved, there could be implications at the margins for their level of enthusiasm and willingness to mobilize in November. At the same time, Democrats must bear in mind a CNN poll showing that, while there is overwhelming support for helping DACA recipients, 56% of Americans say it's not worth shutting the government down to do so.\n\nThe longer the shutdown drags on, the more red state Democrats - like Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and Claire McCaskill of Missouri - risk damage by association with party leaders who the GOP says are appeasing \"illegal immigration\" by shutting down the government.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have to consider how long they are prepared to accept the picture of chaos and dysfunction in Washington that is deepening even while they control the House, the Senate, and the White House. Conventional wisdom suggests that the public is likely to punish a party in that situation - even though the GOP has done an effective job trying to shift blame to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and the Democrats.\n\nTrump, by doing little so far since Friday to publicly resolve the shutdown, also faces seeing his already compromised image as the only man who could fix Washington further tarnished. If he throws himself into a big public effort to resolve the issue and to move to a full-on solution of DACA, he could win significant political points - though he risks alienating advisers like Stephen Miller and grassroots voters in his coalition who take an uncompromising line on immigration issues.\n\nSchumer and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have complained that Trump's White House team is obstructing, rather than helping chances of a deal. Should a big intervention by the President fail, however, he could further compromise his \"Art of the Deal\" mystique at a time when his temperament, knowledge of complicated issues, and capacity to govern is in question.",

Bernie Sanders are embarking on a national campaign trail this week, supporting left-wing candidates in various states. On July 20, they will campaign for two congressional candidates in Kansas, James Thompson in Wichita and former Sanders delegate Brent Welder in the suburbs of Kansas City.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is also supporting several progressive candidates aiming to replace Democratic incumbents in other regions, causing concern among Democratic leaders and pundits who fear her rising national profile and far-left politics could fracture the party ahead of the critical midterm elections.\n\nIn Michigan, Ocasio-Cortez will visit on July 28 and 29 to support Abdul El-Sayed, a progressive candidate for governor. El-Sayed, Detroit's former public health commissioner, is challenging Democratic former State Sen. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has also endorsed other progressive candidates, including Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, Reps. Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Adam Smith of Washington, and Michael Capuano of Massachusetts.\n\nIn Kansas' Republican-leaning 4th District, where Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez will campaign together on Friday, Thompson came close to winning in a special election last year, and is taking his second shot at unseating GOP Rep. Ron Estes. Meanwhile, far-left Welder is running against GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder, whom President Trump endorsed on Twitter this week as someone who has voted for \"$5 Billion for Border Security\" and who \"loves our Military and Vets.\"\n\nWelder, a labor lawyer who advocates for a $15 minimum wage and a \"Medicare for All\" platform, has polled ahead of Yoder, and his 3rd District went to Hillary Clinton by a slim margin in 2016.\n\nPrimaries in both Kansas and Michigan take place on Aug. 7.\n\n\"It's a huge boost to our campaign to welcome Senator Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to Wichita,\" Thompson said in a statement. \"The interest and enthusiasm here has been electric.\"\n\nHowever, as the progressive pair seeks to export their brand of progressive politics to the Sunflower State and beyond, top Democratic leaders have increasingly sounded the alarm.\n\nRep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., charged this week that Ocasio-Cortez was overly idealistic. \"Meteors fizz out,\" Hastings said. \"What she will learn in this institution is that it's glacial to begin with, and therefore no matter how far you rise, that's just how far you will ultimately get your comeuppance.\"\n\nRep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., said that Ocasio-Cortez's decision to publicly feud with longtime Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., even after she defeated him in a shocking primary contest last month, was upsetting Democrats in the House.\n\n\"She's not asking my advice,\" Pascrell said. \"I would do it differently, rather than make enemies of people.\"\n\nRep. Lacy Clay, D-Mo., who is facing a primary challenge from the left by community activist Cori Bush, who has Ocasio-Cortez's backing, was more direct.\n\n\"Once an election is over and you win, why are you still angry?\" Clay asked. \"I think it's a lack of maturity on her part, and a lack of political acumen, for her to be that petty.\"\n\nFormer Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman echoed these sentiments in an interview on Wednesday.\n\n\"When I see somebody who really says she's a socialist -- she's a very captivating, charismatic candidate -- when you look at those policies, those policies will not be supported in many places across America,\" Lieberman said.\n\n\"If her win makes her into what Kellyanne Conway called the new face of the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party's not going to have a very bright future,\" he added.\n\nLieberman wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed calling for voters to reject Ocasio-Cortez in the November elections.",
    " Title: \"Visiting Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa: A Reflection on America's Past and Present Influence\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the summer of 2022, a visit to Okinawa, one of Japan's 6,852 islands, presented a unique challenge due to the absence of signage. The island chain, located in the East China Sea between Taiwan and the Japanese mainland, is the largest of the Ryukyu Islands, stretching seventy miles long and averaging seven miles wide. Despite its peaceful modern-day appearance, Okinawa was the site of some of the fiercest fighting during World War II.\n\nOn a hot, humid day, my son, Zachary, and I found ourselves walking up a gentle sidewalk leading to what the U.S. Marines who had fought there called \"Hacksaw Ridge.\" The area, now known as the Maeda Escarpment, bore little resemblance to the black and white photographs of a gray, muddy battlefield where nothing grew during the violent spring days of 1945. Instead, we saw a peaceful, green landscape that had been replaced with hotels, resorts, and industry.\n\nThe Battle of Okinawa was one of the most brutal and merciless fights in the history of warfare, with as many as 150,000 Okinawan civilians losing their lives. The fighting in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II was particularly savage, as depicted in E.B. Sledge's classic memoir, \"With the Old Breed.\" The fighting on the Eastern Front between Germany and the Soviet Union was the only comparable in ferocity.\n\nThe invasion force for \"Operation Iceberg,\" the code name for the Okinawa invasion, was deployed from bases in San Francisco (6,200 miles away) and Pearl Harbor (more than 4,000 miles away). By the time the Battle of Okinawa was over, 14,000 American boys had made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nThe U.S. forefathers, recognizing the connection between the militaristic, emperor-worshiping Imperial Japanese regime and the atrocities being committed, were resolved to unseat the ideology that had given rise to those evil actions. They fought the enemy, from one bloody Pacific rock to another, until they had defeated them and supplanted the evil ideology that had produced such fanaticism in the first place.\n\nVisiting modern Japan today, one can see the success of their efforts, as it is one of the most democratic and peaceful nations on earth. The Japanese people are envious of America, according to one Japanese woman, who stated, \"The Japanese people are envious of America: your way of life and your freedom. America is the standard.\"\n\nReturning from Hacksaw Ridge and the beaches that saw Americans drive a stake through the heart of Japanese fascism, I was reminded of a line from The Funeral Oration of Pericles: \"We do not imitate our neighbors, but are an example to them.\" The visit to Hacksaw Ridge was a sobering reminder of America's total commitment to the demolition of ideologies that promote fanaticism and violence.",
    " Title: Illinois Sees Surge in Marijuana-Related Emergency Room Visits After Legalization\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the legalization of recreational marijuana in Illinois on January 1, 2020, several emergency room visits related to cannabis-induced illnesses have been reported. Eleven states, including Illinois, and Washington D.C., have now legalized marijuana for recreational use for adults over 21. Thirty-three states have legalized marijuana for medical purposes only.\n\nDr. Trevonne Thompson, an emergency room physician and toxicology director at the University of Illinois at Chicago hospital, reported a surge in cannabis-related incidents since the new year. He noted that novice marijuana users are coming into the hospital at the highest rate.\n\nThompson explained that law-abiding baby boomers and others in their middle-aged years who may have tried marijuana decades ago and have not touched it since are in for a rude awakening. Today's newer strains of pot are typically much more potent than those of years past, meaning they contain higher percentages of THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana that gives the \"high\" sensation.\n\n\"So perhaps before a couple of puffs was enough to get you the effect that you were looking for,\" he said, \"And now perhaps a little less can get you what you were looking for and now some adverse symptoms.\"\n\nThe most common symptoms are heart palpitations, anxiety, and restlessness, but they can be more severe. In some cases, patients require sedation, but each case is different, and the amount of cannabis consumed largely dictates the treatment.\n\nIllinois is not alone in the surge of marijuana-related hospital visits following its legalization for recreational use. According to multiple studies, Colorado doctors saw close to triple the number of cannabis-induced emergency room cases after it was legalized for recreational use there.\n\nDoctors say edibles tend to cause the majority of issues. Edibles are food products that contain cannabis and are typically consumed at a faster rate than smoking it. Examples of edibles include gummy candies and other sweets. Consuming marijuana in edibles often causes a delay in experiencing the effects of the THC, during which time the user consumes more of the product.\n\n\"By the time the first dose kicks in, you have a lot in your system that is circulating,\" said Dr. Thompson. \"You can get yourself into a situation where you have more of the product that you would have liked and you start having symptoms.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Tweet Criticism of Attorney General Sessions and FISA Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's recent tweets criticizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions have raised concerns about the politicization of the ongoing investigation into FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) abuse. The president's tweets come as the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee investigate possible abuse of the government's national-security surveillance powers under FISA.\n\nTrump criticized Sessions for asking the Justice Department's inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, to investigate the conduct of FBI and Justice Department officials in the FISA court proceedings. The president called the move \"DISGRACEFUL!\" and questioned Horowitz's impartiality, stating that he is \"an Obama guy\" who is \"already late\" in filing a report on actions taken by former FBI Director James Comey during the Clinton emails investigation.\n\nAttorney General Sessions' decision to request an investigation by the inspector general is in line with federal law and Justice Department protocols. When there are allegations of wrongdoing by Justice Department or FBI officials, federal law and Justice Department protocols require an internal investigation by the Office of the Inspector General or the Office of Professional Responsibility.\n\nHorowitz, the inspector general, has earned a reputation for probity and fact-driven independence. Although he was appointed to the post by President Obama, he is a career prosecutor who has been assigned to high-level positions by administrations of both parties and has won the respect of congressional Republicans.\n\nThe investigation into FISA abuse has become politicized due to Trump's ongoing criticism of Sessions and the Justice Department. This could potentially discredit the investigation and any subsequent findings. The president's call for an investigation by Justice Department prosecutors, while valid in urging an investigation, has added fuel to the politicization of the matter.\n\nThe ongoing vacancies in vital Justice Department leadership positions, including the attorney general, have made it difficult to confirm Trump nominees. With a razor-thin majority in the Senate, the president's criticism of Sessions and the politicization of the FISA investigation could further complicate the process of filling these positions.",
    " Title: Report Reveals Extensive Use of Major Social Media Platforms in 2016 US Election Disinformation Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report released today by the US Senate claims that Russia used various major social media platforms, including YouTube, Tumblr, Instagram, PayPal, Facebook, and Twitter, to spread propaganda during the 2016 US election. The report, compiled by the University of Oxford's Computational Propaganda Project and social network analysis firm Graphika, is the first analysis of millions of social media posts provided by Twitter, Google, and Facebook to the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe report, titled \"Information Warfare in an Age of Social Media: Emerging Strategies of Political Influence in the 2016 U.S. Election,\" exposes the scale of Russian disinformation efforts. Its authors criticize the \"belated and uncoordinated response\" by tech firms to these activities.\n\nThe report details a vast campaign spearheaded by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian company described by the United States Intelligence Community as a troll farm with ties to the Russian government. The IRA reportedly had a particular focus on targeting conservatives with posts on immigration, race, and gun rights, as well as efforts to undermine the voting power of left-leaning African-American citizens by spreading misinformation about the electoral process.\n\nAnother report, also released today by the Senate, by the research firm New Knowledge, similarly highlights Russia's efforts to target African-Americans. It explains how Russia's IRA were focused on \"developing Black audiences and recruiting Black Americans as assets,\" which included encouraging activists to stage rallies.\n\nOne IRA campaign highlighted in the Oxford and Graphika paper, Black Matters US, existed across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Google+, Tumblr, and PayPal. These various accounts would promote each other's posts and events. When Facebook suspended the group on its platform, the group's Twitter account complained about the move and accused the social network of \"supporting white supremacy.\"\n\nThe report suggests that all messaging clearly sought to benefit the Republican Party and specifically Donald Trump. \"Trump is mentioned most in campaigns targeting conservatives and right-wing voters, where the messaging encouraged these groups to support his campaign,\" the report says. \"The main groups that could challenge Trump were then provided messaging that sought to confuse, distract, and ultimately discourage members from voting.\"\n\nWhile the data used by the researchers was provided by Facebook, Twitter, and Google, their findings criticize the \"belated and uncoordinated response\" from these companies to Russia's disinformation campaign. The researchers highlight details that could have led internet companies to detect interference earlier, such as the use of the Russian rouble to buy advertisements and internet signatures relating to the IRA's base of operations.\n\nThe BBC has asked Russia's Embassy in the UK for comment. The IRA was among the three companies indicted earlier this year, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Twelve of the agency's employees faced indictment charges, as well as its alleged financier, Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\nThe report concludes by stating, \"Social media have gone from being the natural infrastructure for sharing collective grievances and coordinating civic engagement, to being a computational tool for social control, manipulated by canny political consultants and available to politicians in democracies and dictatorships alike.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court Allows Implementation of Trump Administration's Green Card Wealth Test Amid Ongoing Litigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to implement a new wealth test for green card applicants, despite ongoing litigation. The decision, like two of the three previous immigration-related decisions by the court, split 5-4.\n\nFor 130 years, the government could deny permanent legal status to immigrants at risk of becoming a \"public charge.\" However, a rule that originally barred only a handful of destitute immigrants could, under the revision announced last August, affect hundreds of thousands of immigrants. Those who are deemed likely to need food stamps, Medicaid, or housing assistance over 12 of the next 36 months\u2014after considering family size, English proficiency, credit score, and income, among other factors\u2014would be ineligible for a green card.\n\nThe Trump administration's implementation of the change was blocked in a federal district court in New York on October 15th. Judge George Daniels wrote that the move has \"absolutely no support in the history of US immigration law\" and is \"repugnant to the American dream.\"\n\nAfter an appeals court allowed Judge Daniels' injunction to stand, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to step in. The court granted the request without comment. Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, expressed frustration with the phenomenon of district judges issuing injunctions that apply universally across the country.\n\nIn his four-page statement, Justice Gorsuch noted that two circuit courts had lifted similar injunctions against the revised wealth test and that an injunction in Illinois applied only to in-state green-card applicants. However, Judge Daniels' move, Justice Gorsuch complained, involved \"a single judge\" who \"enjoined the government from applying the new definition to anyone, anywhere, without regard to 'participation in this or any other lawsuit.'\"\n\nThese injunctions, according to Justice Gorsuch, dictate how the government must treat people \"who are not parties to the case.\" Judicial interventions that have an impact on everyone from coast to coast affected by a government program are \"patently unworkable\" and sow chaos, Mr. Trump's first Supreme Court appointee argued. He also characterized them as \"a sign of our impatient times.\"\n\nThe use of broad injunctions, contrary to Justice Gorsuch's claim, has been traced back to the 19th century, according to Mila Sohoni, a professor at the University of San Diego law school. Howard Wasserman, a law professor at Florida International University, agrees with Justice Gorsuch's reasoning but wonders why he chose this moment to attack universal injunctions.\n\nMila Sohoni speculates that Justice Gorsuch's missive may be designed as a warning to judges \"to be more cautious in issuing such broad injunctions\" and an invitation to the Department of Justice to keep up its \"aggressive\" efforts against injunctive overreach.\n\nHowever, the debate regarding when universal injunctions are appropriate is not \"some late-blooming efflorescence of post-Warren Court judicial hubris,\" as Ms. Sohoni's forthcoming article in the Harvard Law Review states. There is a debate to be had regarding when universal injunctions are appropriate, says Amanda Frost, a law professor at American University. It is \"almost laughable\" to argue that they are unconstitutional, Ms. Frost says, as administrative law explicitly allows judges to invalidate regulations \"as to everyone, not just the plaintiff.\"",
    " Title: US Deploys 1,500 Troops, Aircraft, and Missile Defense Systems to Counter Iranian Threat\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is deploying approximately 1,500 troops, fighter jets, drones, and other weaponry to the Middle East in response to the ongoing threat posed by Iranian forces, according to Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. The move follows a series of incidents in the Gulf of Oman that have escalated tensions between the two nations.\n\nIn a statement, Shanahan said that additional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, a team of engineers, a fighter aircraft squadron, and a Patriot missile-defense system would also be sent. He stated that the deployment was intended to \"safeguard US forces given the ongoing threat posed by Iranian forces, including the IRGC [Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps] and its proxies.\"\n\nThe IRGC is the most elite military unit in Iran. Last month, the US designated it as a foreign terrorist organization. Shanahan explained that the move was a \"prudent defensive measure... intended to reduce the possibility of future hostilities.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced the deployment earlier on Friday, describing it as \"relatively small.\" He added that the extra troops would be \"mostly protective.\" Trump appeared to downplay the possibility of tensions escalating further, stating, \"Right now, I do not think Iran wants to fight and I certainly do not think they want to fight with us.\"\n\nThe deployment of troops and hardware has been signaled for several days but is a much more modest move than many expected. Around 1,500 service personnel are likely to be deployed, significantly down on the 5,000-10,000 that some administration sources had floated.\n\nIn addition to the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers already announced, extra Patriot missile batteries will give the US significant capabilities to counter any threat from the air, be that missiles or aircraft. The deployment of surveillance planes, both manned and unmanned, will allow a clearer assessment of Iranian activity such as the alleged attacks on commercial tankers recently and any troop movements along the coast.\n\nHowever, it is still far from clear whether there is a settled view in Washington about the nature of the increased threat from Iran and what should be done about it. Despite some tough rhetoric, the president has appeared reluctant to become overly entangled in the region, mindful no doubt of his promises to bring troops back from there and not the reverse.\n\nTensions between the US and Iran began rising this month when Washington ended exemptions from sanctions for countries still buying from Iran. The decision was intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying the government its main source of revenue. Trump reinstated the sanctions last year after abandoning the landmark nuclear deal that Iran has signed with six nations - the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany.\n\nIran has now announced it will suspend several commitments under the deal. Four oil tankers were damaged in what the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said were sabotage attacks while drone attacks on two oil pumping stations in Saudi Arabia by Yemen's Houthi rebels - who are supported by Iran - forced the temporary closure of a pipeline. Iran denied it was behind the incidents, but Rear Admiral Michael Gilday, director of the US Joint Staff, accused the IRGC of being directly responsible.\n\n\"The attack against the shipping in Fujairah [part of the UAE], we attribute it to the IRGC,\" he said on Friday, explaining that limpet mines used in the attacks had been linked directly to the IRGC.",
    " Title: CNN and Fox News Reject Political Ads from Trump and Biden Campaigns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of developments, both CNN and Fox News have rejected political ads from the campaigns of President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nCNN has rejected another ad from President Trump's reelection campaign that targets the whistleblower complaint and the impeachment inquiry. The ad, titled \"Coup,\" was criticized for labeling the whistleblower process as a \"coup.\" The ad features a clip of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Fox News claiming that the complaint is based on hearsay and is a \"set up.\"\n\nCNN's spokesperson stated, \"Our company accepts political and advocacy advertising across the political spectrum. Advertisers must substantiate all factual claims made in their ads. We cannot accept this ad as it contains statements of fact that are not true.\" The ad was also targeted to air on Turner Sports, which is also rejecting it.\n\nThe spokesperson further explained that the ad \"contains assertions of fact about the whistleblower complaint that have been refuted by the Intelligence Inspector General. In addition, it is inaccurate to use the word 'coup' to describe a constitutionally prescribed legal process.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Joe Biden's campaign is urging Fox News to follow CNN in rejecting a Trump campaign ad, \"Biden Corruption,\" arguing that it \"states falsely that Vice President Biden offered Ukraine $1 billion to fire the prosecutor investigating a company affiliated with his son.\"\n\nCampaign Manager Greg Schultz wrote in a letter to Fox News General Counsel Lily Chaffee, \"The allegation of corrupt motive has been demonstrated to be completely false.\" Schultz also wrote that if the network permits the ad, \"you are acting with the understanding that the Trump campaign is using your facilities to mislead your viewers.\"\n\nFox News spokesperson responded, \"We are not in the business of censoring ads from candidates on either side of the aisle. Vice President Joe Biden has a standing invitation to appear on any of our platforms.\" The network did accept an ad that ran as part of Democrat Tom Steyer's Need to Impeach campaign.\n\nOn Sunday, Biden's campaign sent a letter to the chiefs of the major networks, asking them to stop booking Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, for making an array of claims, including the one that is the source of the ad.\n\nEarlier, CNN refused to air an ad from President Trump's reelection campaign that pushed debunked claims about Joe Biden and Ukraine and bashed some of the network's personalities, including Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo, and Jim Acosta. The ad, titled \"Biden Corruption,\" was rejected as it did not meet CNN's advertising standards.\n\nThe Trump campaign criticized CNN's decision to not air the ad, with spokesman Tim Murtaugh telling The Daily Beast that the network \"spends all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming, so it's not surprising that they're shielding him from truthful advertising too, and then talking to other media outlets about it.\"\n\nThe ad is part of a $10 million blitz that the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee say they are spending to push back against the Democrats' impeachment inquiry. The spots are being run on TV and social media, including Facebook.\n\nNick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, said last week that politicians would be generally exempt from their fact-checking program. \"We don't believe that it's an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician's speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny,\" he said in a speech. \"That's why Facebook exempts politicians from our third-party fact-checking program.\"",
    " Title: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox Blames U.S. Drug Consumption for Border Violence\n\n Article:\n\n In an exclusive interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588, former Mexican President Vicente Fox suggested that drug trafficking and violence at the border are not caused by Mexico, but by drug consumption in the United States.\n\n \"Drug trafficking, I guess people here in the [United] States say, 'These Mexicans have gone crazy. They're killing each other all day, violence and killings. Have they been drinking too much tequila?'\" Fox said.\n\n He continued, \"No, we're in a drug war that is not ours. We don't produce drugs significantly. Maybe Donald [Trump] should know that the state of California produces more marijuana than all of Mexico together.\"\n\n Fox stated that Mexico does not consume drugs significantly, with drug consumption in the United States being about five percent of people daily, compared to a negligible amount in Mexico.\n\n \"We don't have a consumption problem. Then, the question, why the war? Why the killings? It's because we are in between those that consume the drugs here in the north in the United States and those who produce the drugs south, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia,\" Fox explained.\n\n He added, \"And here is Mexico in this war, why? We have accepted to collaborate with the United States in trying to cut the drug trafficking, trying to impede the drug from reaching the U.S. market. We're paying the price.\"\n\n Fox also criticized the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for his statements about crime on the border.\n\n \"So all this talking about homicides [and] violence in Mexico, the one that Trump criticizes, is produced here,\" Fox challenged. \"Let's get rid of that language of hate that this campaign has brought about, that's not United States. United States is a great nation.\"\n\n Fox, who identifies as an \"activist\" for legalizing marijuana, also commented on the economic implications of the drug trade.\n\n \"This market generates $55 billion U.S. dollars... and where do they go? That money is laundered, and that money goes to the cartels\u2014and I ask this nation, who does the laundering?\"\n\n He concluded, \"One day, I think it's going to happen very soon, a Mexican president will come and tell the United States, 'You don't want drugs in your territory, you hold it.'\"",
    " Title: ACLU Files Discrimination Complaint Against Republican Candidate Peter Meijer Over Refusal to Host Drag Show\n\nArticle:\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a complaint against Republican congressional candidate Peter Meijer for refusing to host a drag queen performance at a venue he owns, featuring a group of performers with Down syndrome known as \"Drag Syndrome.\"\n\nMeijer, who is running for the seat currently occupied by Rep. Justin Amash in Michigan, stated his decision was based on concerns that the performers might be exploited. The ACLU filed a complaint with the Michigan Department of Civil Rights, alleging discrimination based on disability and sex, according to The New York Times.\n\nJay Kaplan, a staff attorney at the ACLU Michigan chapter, suggested the complaint primarily focused on the drag component. \"If members of the group were to perform an orchestra recital, chances are he wouldn't have canceled the performance,\" Kaplan said.\n\nMeijer told the Times that he did not make the decision lightly, consulting with numerous individuals, including members of the disability advocacy community, parents of children with Down syndrome, members of the L.G.B.T. community, and national groups dedicated to Down syndrome.\n\nMeijer's primary concern was whether the participants could give full, informed consent. In a letter regarding his decision, Meijer wrote, \"The involvement of individuals whose ability to act of their own volition is unclear raises serious ethical concerns that I can not reconcile.\" He added, \"The differently abled are among the most special souls in our community, and I believe they, like children and other vulnerable populations, should be protected.\"\n\nProduction company DisArt, which focuses on artists with disabilities, criticized Meijer for allegedly discriminating against the performers due to their disability. \"Exclusion is discrimination, it is self-preservation, it is exploitation for political gain. It is not protection,\" the statement from DisArt said. \"We are deeply saddened, angered, and appalled at the decision to exclude Drag Syndrome.\"\n\n\"DisArt WILL protect the artists of Drag Syndrome by protecting their rights,\" the statement continued. \"There will be another venue announced soon, and on September 7th, as part of Project 1 by ArtPrize, Drag Syndrome will perform in Grand Rapids, Michigan. We hope you will be there to celebrate, to learn, to grow, and to build a stronger, more inclusive community for all.\"\n\nMeijer expressed confusion over critics labeling him as an ableist or a transphobe for his decision. \"I have been called a bigot, an ableist, a homophobe, and a transphobe,\" the candidate told the Times. \"I fundamentally don't understand how someone can take my very good faith concern about the potential for exploitation and spin that into discriminating against people with a disability.\"\n\nAccording to the outlet, Meijer could face a fine for denying his venue if the complaint were to be considered valid.",
    " Title: Howard Schultz's Presidential Ambitions Draw Criticism from Both Sides\n\n WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump took a swipe at the potential presidential candidacy of businessman Howard Schultz, even as critics fear an independent bid by the former Starbucks CEO could help Trump in his re-election bid.\n\nOn Monday, Trump tweeted, \"Howard Schultz doesn\u2019t have the 'guts' to run for President!\" He added that he agreed with Schultz's self-deprecating assessment that he is not the smartest person in the world and would hire good advisers. \"America already has that!\" Trump claimed, also mentioning his ongoing business relationship with Starbucks.\n\nDuring a conversation with CBS' \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday, Schultz, a longtime Democratic donor, said both the Democratic and Republican parties are failing the American people, and that Trump has proved he is wholly unqualified to be president.\n\nRegarding Trump's comment about intelligence, Schultz, 65, said, \"I have a long history of recognizing I'm not the smartest person in the room, that in order to make great decisions about complex problems, I have to recruit and attract people who are smarter than me and more experienced, more skilled.\"\n\nPolitical consultants from both parties praised Schultz's business background, but said an independent bid would likely split the anti-Trump vote with the Democratic nominee, giving the incumbent a better chance to win re-election.\n\nRepublican consultant Mike Murphy, a Trump critic, tweeted of Schultz, \"I admire the guy and think his intentions are completely honorable but if he runs his campaign slogan really should be, 'Schultz: The Independent Vote-Splitting Leadership Trump Needs Now' # WakeUpAndSmellTheCoffee.\"\n\nDemocratic strategist Mark Mellman also urged the businessman not to make the race. \"Mr. Schultz, the honest truth,\" he tweeted, \"Despite your achievements, you have no chance of being elected POTUS running as an independent, but some real chance of throwing the general election to @realDonaldTrump. That can\u2019t be your goal, but it could be your effect, if you pursue this course.\"\n\nAsked about the prospect of tipping the race to Trump, Schultz told \"60 Minutes,\" \"I want to see the American people win. I want to see America win. I don't care if you're a Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, Republican. Bring me your ideas.\"\n\nSchultz also told CBS he anticipates tweeted attacks from Trump. \"I think, like most people,\" he said, \"I've become bored with President Trump and his tweets.\"",
    " Title: Comparative Analysis of Corroboration in Tara Reade's Allegations Against Joe Biden and Christine Blasey Ford's Allegations Against Brett Kavanaugh\n\nArticle:\n\nTara Reade, a former Senate staffer, has garnered more corroboration for her sexual misconduct allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden than Christine Blasey Ford had for her claim against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Seven people have corroborated details of Reade's story, with Reade accusing Biden of both sexual harassment and sexual assault. Biden and his campaign have denied the allegations.\n\nIn contrast, Ford's accusation against Kavanaugh, which earned support from virtually every high-profile Democrat, lacked the level of corroboration that Reade's allegations have. There is no evidence that Ford and Kavanaugh ever met in high school, the time of the alleged assault, and Ford's primary corroborating witness, Leland Keyser, ultimately said she didn't have confidence in Ford's account.\n\nOther than Keyser's account, the biggest piece of corroborating evidence Ford had against Kavanaugh was the result of discussions nearly 30 years after the alleged assault was said to have taken place. Ford's therapy sessions from 2012 and 2013 show that she discussed an alleged high school assault, though she didn't name the alleged perpetrator. Other friends said they'd had discussions with Ford about the alleged assault, though not before 2012.\n\nThe latest piece of evidence in Reade's case against Biden came in the form of a 1996 court document showing that Reade's now ex-husband said she had told him that she had been a victim of sexual harassment while working in Biden's Senate office in 1993. That revelation came three years after the alleged assault.\n\nReade's husband is at least the seventh person to say they heard part or all of Reade's story decades ago. Reade's ex-neighbor, Lynda LaCasse, said Reade alleged to her in the 1990s that her boss in Washington, D.C. had sexually assaulted her. Reade's brother, Collin Moulton, also corroborated details of Reade's account and said she had told their mother about the alleged incident.\n\nMoulton's position is backed up by the fact that Reade's mother appears to have referenced her daughter's alleged issues at Biden's office while calling into a 1993 \"Larry King Live\" episode. Lorraine Sanchez, who worked alongside Reade in the mid 1990's for a California state senator, said that Reade had complained to her that her former Washington, D.C. boss had sexually harassed her. Two anonymous friends of Reade have also backed up her story.\n\nReade's case against Biden hasn't been without criticism. As with Ford, aspects of her story have provided ammunition for doubters. Skeptics have pointed out that the story Reade told to journalists changed over time, escalating from a sexual harassment accusation to a sexual assault accusation. Three former Biden aides who Reade says she told about alleged harassment from Biden have denied her account.\n\nThe difference between Reade's account and Ford's is that while both gave skeptics reason to question their accounts, Reade's accusation has more corroboration from third parties relatively close in time to the alleged assault than Ford's. However, the corroboration of Reade's account hasn't been enough for many high-profile Democrats to offer her the same support they offered Ford.\n\nDemocratic California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a prominent defender of Ford, called Reade's accusation \"ridiculous.\" Democratic New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who also showered Ford with praise, said she \"stand[s] by Vice President Biden. He's devoted his life to supporting women and he has vehemently denied this allegation.\"\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez, who said in December 2017 that any candidate or elected official \"who has engaged in sexual misconduct\" should \"step aside,\" has thrown his full support behind Biden. \"I'm very familiar with the vice presidential vetting process. They look at everything about you. They looked at the entire history of Joe Biden, his entire career,\" Perez told ABC's Martha Raddatz.\n\n\"And I'll tell you, if Barack Obama had any indication that there was an issue, Barack Obama would not have had him as his vice president. Barack Obama trusted Joe Biden. I trust Joe Biden and those investigations have been done.\"\n\nWhile Ford's Kavanaugh accusation had issues, it was still stronger than other Kavanaugh accusations Democrats hyped against the Supreme Court nominee. Julie Swetnick, the client of disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti, alleged without any evidence whatsoever that Kavanaugh was involved in gang rapes in high school. Despite that lack of evidence and despite Avenatti's track record providing good reasons to doubt him, some in the media still gave Swetnick's claims credence.\n\nAnd Swetnick's accusation wasn't even the thinnest claim against Kavanaugh to receive credulous press coverage. CNN and The Hill both spread a bombastic accusation against Kavanaugh, before later updating their coverage to note that the man who made it retracted his claim and apologized for making it. A Rhode Island man called Democratic Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's office and claimed that Kavanaugh and one of the judge's high school friends, Mark Judge, had drunkenly sexually assaulted a friend of his while in Rhode Island in 1998, a transcript from a Senate Judiciary Committee interview with Kavanaugh showed. The man retracted the claim shortly after it became public and said he made a \"mistake\" in leveling the false accusation.",
    " Title: Declining Absolute Mobility in the United States: A Study by Raj Chetty and Team\n\nArticle:\n\nA study led by economist Raj Chetty has revealed a decline in absolute mobility in the United States over the decades. The research indicates that children born in 1940 had a high likelihood of earning more than their parents, while those born in 1980 have a less certain chance of upward mobility.\n\nThe study found that for individuals born in the bottom of the income distribution and rising to the 95th percentile, there was a significant likelihood of upward mobility. However, for those born into the middle 60 percent of the income distribution, experiencing upward mobility relative to their parents has become a \"crapshoot.\"\n\nThe study's findings suggest that economic growth is not the primary factor influencing this decline in mobility. Instead, the researchers found that inequality plays a significant role, especially for the middle 60 percent of the income distribution.\n\nTo illustrate this, the study provides two charts. The first chart compares the mobility experienced by children born in 1980 with the mobility that would have been observed if they had grown up with the same GDP growth as children born in 1940. While this scenario increases mobility, it still leaves a significant gap compared to the mobility experienced by children born in 1940.\n\nThe second chart holds GDP growth constant but considers what mobility would look like if inequality had remained at 1940 levels. This scenario shows a substantial difference, particularly for the middle 60 percent of the income distribution.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that to restore the broadly shared increase in living standards that the United States was known for in the postwar decades, a more egalitarian income distribution is necessary. Focusing on growth alone will not achieve this goal.\n\nWhile faster growth is generally desirable, achieving it on a sustained basis is unclear, and some argue that it may be impossible for a country like the United States that is already affluent overall. On the other hand, achieving more equality through different tax and regulatory structures is technically feasible. However, implementing such changes in a political system that seems to be moving towards a large regressive tax cut is another matter.\n\nThe study's findings indicate that upward mobility can be restored, even without bringing back the unusually rapid growth of the postwar decades.",
    " Title: Facebook Removes Natural News Page for Violating Spam Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook has removed the page for Natural News, a far-right conspiracy outlet with nearly 3 million followers, due to violations of the social media company's spam policy. The decision was confirmed by Facebook to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Monday.\n\nThe founder of Natural News, Mike Adams, wrote on fellow right-wing conspiracy site Infowars that his site was \"permanently banned\" from posting. Adams also shared his perspective on the apparent ban with the Gateway Pundit, another far-right site, stating it as evidence of a conspiracy against his website.\n\nAccording to The \u2588\u2588\u2588, Natural News and its founder had a history of pushing hoaxes and calling for mass arrests against the left. Prior to the ban, Natural News had more Facebook followers than Infowars at its peak. The page was used to promote Natural News's trademark combination of natural remedies and far-right conspiracy theories, including disinformation about vaccines.\n\nFacebook has previously taken similar actions against pages associated with Infowars, a move that has been criticized by the right as \"censorship\" by Silicon Valley. In May, Facebook issued bans against Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, Milo Yiannopoulos, and anti-Semitic and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, with the bans also applying to Facebook-owned Instagram.\n\nIn response to the bans in May, a Facebook spokesperson stated, \"We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology. The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.\"\n\nFacebook has been taking stronger actions against conspiracy and extremist content over the past year. In August, it banned Infowars and its founder Alex Jones, although Infowars appears to have used similar-sounding pages like \"Newswars\" to promote its content after the ban.\n\nAdditionally, Facebook began taking stronger actions against anti-vaccination hoaxes this year, banning anti-vax ads in March. These ads were previously targeted at women in measles-stricken areas, according to The \u2588\u2588\u2588.",

In response to criticism that Facebook's news feed may have rewarded false stories during the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election, such as a post claiming Donald Trump had Pope's endorsement, Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, outlined steps the company has already initiated.\n\nZuckerberg stated, \"We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or mistakenly restricting accurate content. We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties.\"\n\nFacebook is considering labeling stories that have been debunked by third parties or the community, providing a warning before they are read or shared. The company is also working to simplify the process for users to report fake news and improve technical systems to better detect such articles.\n\nIn addition, Facebook is seeking external assistance. The company plans to meet with journalists to understand their information verification processes and is exploring partnerships with third-party fact-checking organizations.\n\nZuckerberg acknowledged that fake news has become a lucrative business and stated that Facebook is investigating ways to disrupt the economics of it.\n\nThese remarks come just a few days after Zuckerberg described the idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the election outcome as \"crazy.\" He previously stated that more than 99 percent of the stories on Facebook are accurate. However, criticism of his handling of the issue has grown, and by the end of the week, even President Barack Obama spoke about the negative impact of fake stories on social media.\n\nZuckerberg concluded, \"Some of these ideas will work well, and some will not. But I want you to know that we have always taken this seriously, we understand how important the issue is for our community, and we are committed to getting this right.\"",
    " Title: Schools Across U.S. to Remain Closed for Several Months; Reopening Plans Call for Social Distancing Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Trump last week urged the nation's governors to \"seriously consider\" reopening schools as part of a larger push to revive the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. However, most schools in the United States will remain closed for at least several months. A total of 45 states and Washington, D.C., have ordered or recommended school building closures through the end of the academic year and shifted their focus to possibly resuming in-person instruction in the fall.\n\nThe impact of shifting to distance learning has been significant. Students, especially those in vulnerable groups, are missing out on important academic and social development. Meanwhile, many parents are unable to work without a reliable place to send their kids every day. Experts agree that reopening schools will be one of the most important steps in getting the country back to normal.\n\nOptimistic forecasters suggest schools will be able to safely reopen on time in the fall, though day-to-day instruction will likely look very different. A vaccine won't be widely available for another year at the very earliest, health experts say, meaning the coronavirus will be a threat through the entirety of the next school year. Most models for a return to instruction call for social distancing measures to protect students, teachers, and parents at home from infection. Suggested changes include limiting class sizes to keep desks far apart, staggered schedules to limit the number of kids on campus, and a blend of online and in-person learning.\n\nThe next few months will also provide important data on the viability of reopening schools. There's significant evidence that the virus poses less risk to young children than adults. Some epidemiologists say there's reason to believe kids are also less likely to pass it on to others, though there's not enough research to know for sure yet. The U.S. will also learn a lot about the impact of reopening from schools in other countries, some of which are already bringing students back.\n\nOthers point to a long list of logistical hurdles that need to be resolved before schools can open. The biggest challenge will be lack of resources, some argue. Many of the country's 13,000 school districts were struggling to operate before the pandemic, a problem that will only be exacerbated amid the economic downturn caused by the virus. Without proper funding, there won't be enough space or staff available to enact distancing measures, some administrators argue. Any plan to return will also need to be approved by the teachers unions. The biggest unions in the United States have already suggested they would strike if proper safety measures weren't in place when schools return.\n\nAnother point of view suggests schools should only reopen when testing is widely available and technology to effectively track outbreaks is in use, even if that takes well beyond the start of the next school year. A number of national education associations have banded together to lobby Congress for $200 billion to prop up state budgets and ensure that schools have the resources to reopen safely. Funding for states is expected to be a major point of debate as lawmakers in Washington consider yet another massive stimulus bill in the coming days and weeks.\n\n\"Whenever students do come back, classes are unlikely to look anything like the school days they remember. There may be staggered half-day classes or one-day-on, one-day-off schedules so desks can be spread out and buses can run half-empty.\" - Shawn Hubler, Erica L. Green, and Dana Goldstein, New York Times\n\n\"Like so much else right now, the opening of schools seems to depend most of all on the availability of testing, either at the community or school level, on a scale that seems impossible as long as the Trump administration fails to act.\" - Dan Froomkin, Salon.",
    " Title: Trump's Strike on Soleimani and Its Aftermath: A Look at the Current Political Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the U.S. strike that resulted in the death of Iran's top military commander, Qassem Soleimani, the political landscape surrounding Iran policy has shifted significantly.\n\nSenator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) stated that President Trump is now in a \"negotiating position\" due to Iran's own foreign minister's readiness to engage in diplomatic talks. Inhofe added that Trump has already achieved a victory and there is no need for further military action.\n\nOn the other hand, some Democrats view Trump's strike as another example of his erratic foreign policy decisions. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) expressed concern that the U.S. is in a worse position than a week ago and fears that Trump's legacy could be a nuclear-armed Iran.\n\nSenator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) stated that he now has a better understanding of the reasons behind the strike and the timing of the action. However, most Democrats argue that there is a lack of strategy, proportionality, and predictability in the administration's response to Iran-related events.\n\nTwo Republican senators, Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), have announced their intention to support efforts to constrain Trump's military stance toward Iran due to their dissatisfaction with Wednesday's briefing. Senator Mike Lee criticized the administration for not allowing debate and discussion on the appropriateness of further military intervention against Iran.\n\nExperts warn that Iran could respond with missile attacks, cyberattacks, or proxy attacks against the U.S. or its allies. The Department of Homeland Security has issued a warning that an attack in the U.S. may come with little or no warning.\n\nTrump's aides and allies argue that his approach has left the U.S. in a better position than under his predecessor, as the decision to kill Soleimani sent a clear message to the Iranian regime to deter future attacks from Iran-linked groups. Those in defense of the Trump administration's maximum pressure campaign argue that the U.S. and Iran were always on a collision course, but now, as the two countries come head to head, Trump is dealing with an economically anemic regime.\n\nWithin the Republican Party, there was a general sense of relief on Wednesday, with Senator Mitt Romney (R-Utah) praising Trump's address and expressing relief that Soleimani, a \"very bad person,\" was dead. However, Romney noted that the long-term results depend on Iran's actions and expressed doubt that Trump has any interest in going to war with Iran.",
    " Title: Congress Fails to Renew Federal Funding, Leading to Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nCongress adjourned early Tuesday morning without renewing funding for the federal government, resulting in the White House issuing orders to shut down \"nonessential\" services across the nation. Senators adjourned first, while House lawmakers continued past 1 a.m., but a middle ground remained elusive.\n\nWith no deal in sight to continue funding into fiscal year 2014, the White House Budget Office issued an order to begin closing operations, sending 800,000 federal workers on furlough and leaving hundreds of thousands more employees to report for work without the guarantee of paychecks.\n\nOne program that did not shut down was the program at the center of the Republican ire\u2014Obamacare itself. The President's health care overhaul is funded through other laws and, despite the shutdown, is operational as of Tuesday morning. Americans without health insurance can now go on state-based exchanges to begin shopping for insurance, often with the benefit of government aid.\n\nThe debate raged as Congress approached the deadline, with House Republicans sending repeated proposals to Senate Democrats, though never the one plan senators demanded: a funding bill with no strings attached.\n\n\"It is now midnight, and the great government of the United States is now closed,\" Rep. Louise Slaughter, New York Democrat, said on the House floor at the deadline.\n\nPresident Obama increased the pressure, releasing a video message early Tuesday morning to American troops, in which he blamed Congress for letting the military down.\n\n\"It has failed to pass a budget and, as a result, much of our government must now shut down until Congress funds it again,\" he said.\n\nA last-ditch House plan to request formal talks with Senate Democrats was met with derision by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who said there will be no negotiations with the threat of a shutdown still looming.\n\nAt stake were most basic government operations. National parks were preparing to shutter, federal agencies were notifying about 800,000 nonessential employees who will be furloughed, and officials warned that there would be delays in processing new benefit applications for a wide range of programs.\n\nHowever, the list of what is deemed \"essential\" and remains in effect was longer: air traffic controllers, Border Patrol agents, the military, and federal law enforcement would remain on the job, though, with the exception of the troops, they would do so without paychecks\u2014at least in the near term.\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner emerged after a final House vote to say he felt he and his troops had done their best to keep the government open while trying to also make a dent in the health care law.\n\n\"We are hoping the Senate will take our offer,\" he said in a brief press conference.\n\nHouse Democrats, though, said the GOP's push for talks was a smokescreen to cover the fact that Republicans wanted to force a shutdown.\n\nRepublicans said that wasn't true, and they pointed to the three separate proposals they'd already sent to the Senate to cancel, delay, or otherwise change Obamacare, only to see each of them defeated by a unified Democratic caucus in the Senate.\n\nFor their part, Senate Democrats have passed a bill to fund the government through Nov. 15 and have refused any other offers, saying they need to take a stand against what they called \"extortion\" by the GOP.\n\n\"We will not go to conference with a gun to our head,\" Mr. Reid said.\n\nRepublicans countered that if senators wouldn't even agree to talk, it showed they were the ones who wanted a shutdown.\n\n\"This is a logical next step when the House and Senate are unable to resolve our differences,\" said Rep. Hal Rogers, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.",
    " Title: Aetna's Exit from Obamacare Exchanges Highlights Challenges in Some Regions, Experts Offer Solutions\n\nArticle:\n\nAetna's announcement this week that it is withdrawing from \"Obamacare\" market exchanges in 11 states has added to the perception that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is facing difficulties. However, the ACA has other components that are functioning, according to Chris Sloan, senior manager at Avalere Health, a healthcare consulting company in Washington.\n\nWhile premiums are set to rise more quickly next year, by 9 percent instead of 2 percent, they are still, on average, less expensive than the government's original forecast. Approximately 20 million Americans now have health insurance who did not have it before. Moreover, projections for the total cost of healthcare in America have fallen by $2.6 trillion compared to the government's forecast in 2010, when the law was signed.\n\nAetna's move, however, highlights a problematic aspect of the new system, particularly in some rural areas: the \"exchange\" markets where people choose their insurer under Obamacare. The issue is that key insurers are losing hundreds of millions of dollars in these exchanges and are pulling out of some of them, leaving consumers with only one insurer, i.e., no choice.\n\nAvalere Health's forecast, released on Friday, suggests that a third of the country's exchange regions may offer only one insurer in 2017. This analysis reflects publicly announced pullbacks from exchanges by insurer giants Aetna, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare and by some co-ops for 2017. The marketplace exchanges, which cover about 11 million people in total, enable people to get subsidized healthcare.\n\nSeven states \u2013 Alaska, Alabama, Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wyoming \u2013 are expected to offer only one insurer in each market-exchange region in the state, according to Avalere Health's analysis. This analysis does not account for insurers that may still be planning to enter these markets, which is a distinct possibility.\n\nSome argue that pullouts by insurer heavyweights from some of the exchange markets do not necessarily spell doomsday. Some of these markets are serviced by smaller insurers, and the big companies simply couldn't compete.\n\n\"When some insurers are coming in with narrower networks, at a lower price, that's what you want,\" says Linda Blumberg, an expert on the exchanges at the Urban Institute. That's healthy competition, she says, \"not necessarily a cause for panic.\"\n\nHowever, policy experts such as Ms. Blumberg and Mr. Sloan offer several suggestions on how to address the lack of competition in some parts of the country. Some fixes require action by Congress, but that's not a remote possibility before the election, though it may be possible afterward, depending on the outcome, analysts say.\n\nHere are some of the commonly suggested \"fixes\" to the exchanges:\n\n1. Expand the pool of healthy enrollees: A big problem is that there aren't enough young, healthy enrollees in some of the exchange markets to balance out the costs of older participants whose care is more expensive.\n\n2. Increase outreach efforts to attract healthier people.\n\n3. Offer plans that young people perceive as desirable and affordable, which would mean changing the government requirements for the plans.\n\n4. Increase federal financial support in troubled markets.\n\n5. Allow states to take the lead in designing plans to serve their populations.\n\n6. Encourage states to expand their markets by allowing competition between exchange-market regions within and between states. Inter-state exchanges would require a compact between states.\n\nWhether Congress and the next administration will work toward some of these fixes depends entirely on the makeup of the next Congress and who wins the White House, say experts. Experts of all stripes interviewed for this story said that Hillary Clinton would be more likely to reach a deal with Congress than would Donald Trump, though they did not rule out an effort by the billionaire dealmaker. However, outright repeal is unlikely, they said, given the blocking power of Democrats in the Senate and the loud cry that would arise from taking away a benefit, even one with problems.",
    " Title: Syriza Party Takes Power in Greece, Promising to Re-negotiate Bailout Terms\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Syriza party, a far-left coalition, has formed a government in Greece after securing a coalition with the Independent Greeks party. The new government, led by Alexis Tsipras, has vowed to re-negotiate the terms of Greece's international bailout, which has been a source of contention since its implementation in 2010.\n\nThe bailout, totaling approximately $270 billion, has allowed Greece to avoid bankruptcy but has come at the cost of severe spending cuts. The Syriza party, which did not win the absolute majority of seats in Sunday's election, has the support of the Independent Greeks party, which holds 13 seats in the 300-seat parliament.\n\nTsipras, who was sworn in as the new Greek prime minister on Monday, has pledged to secure better terms for Greece as it grapples with high unemployment, anemic growth, and a 30% decrease in GDP since the financial crisis. The country's unemployment rate stands at 26%, and one-third of its population lives below the poverty line.\n\nIn a statement, the White House congratulated the country, expressing support for Greece's efforts to recover economically. The Athens Stock Exchange initially dropped nearly 4% before recovering some losses. Markets across Asia and Europe were weaker, although the euro currency strengthened slightly on Monday.\n\nGiorgos Stathakis, Syriza's financial planning official, stated that the new government has no plans to meet with negotiators from the European Commission, European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund (the \"troika\") and will instead seek talks directly with governments. Yields on Greece's 10-year government bonds increased 40 basis points to 8.81%.\n\nAnalysts suggest that doubts over the extension of the EU bailout program could put pressure on Greek bonds and the euro. The Syriza party's victory could also signal a shift in European politics towards economic populism, potentially leading to increased pressure to pare back austerity measures within Spain and Italy.\n\nEuropean leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have warned the Syriza party not to make promises to the Greek electorate that it cannot keep and to respect the current debt arrangements. Tsipras, in response, stated, \"Greece is leaving behind catastrophic austerity, fear, and autocratic government.\"",
    " Title: Trump Praises Michael Cohen for Not Alleging Collusion with Russia, Criticizes Timing of Testimony\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has criticized his former attorney Michael Cohen for lying in testimony to Congress but found reason to praise him for not alleging Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in 2016.\n\nDuring a news conference in Vietnam following a failed peace deal with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, Trump called the blockbuster hearing back in Washington \"fake\" and said it should not have been scheduled during his trip.\n\n\"He lied a lot, but it was very interesting because he didn't lie about one thing - he said no collusion with the Russian hoax,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I wonder why he didn't lie about that too, like he did about everything else. I was actually impressed that he didn't say, 'well, I think there was collusion for this reason or that.' He didn't say that,\" Trump added.\n\nCohen testified on Wednesday, calling Trump a \"conman\" who knew in advance about the release of stolen emails aimed at hurting his Democratic rival in the 2016 election campaign.\n\nTrump criticized the timing of the hearing, saying it should not have been held while he was on an important trip.\n\n\"Having a fake hearing like that and having it in the middle of this very important summit is really a terrible thing. They could have made it two days later or next week,\" he said.\n\n\"But having it during this very important summit is sort of incredible,\" Trump added.\n\nTrump has called an investigation into possible collusion between Moscow and his presidential campaign a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nCohen, 52, was a close aide of Trump for years, and his testimony could increase the legal and political pressure on the Republican president. However, Cohen did not appear to disclose a \"smoking gun\" that could sink his former boss.\n\nCohen said he had no direct evidence that Trump or his campaign colluded with Moscow during the election campaign. Possible collusion is a key theme of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, which has dogged the president during his two years in office. Trump has repeatedly denied the allegation as has the Kremlin.",
    " Title: Lawyer for Accuser in Trump Defamation Case Discusses Funding and Donations\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney Lisa Bloom, representing Summer Zervos in her defamation case against President Donald Trump, has stated that she is not concerned about the motivations of donors supporting Ms. Zervos' case. In an interview, Ms. Bloom expressed that she does not have the means to determine whether donors have a political agenda or simply believe in the importance of truth.\n\nMs. Bloom has been actively soliciting donations for Ms. Zervos' case online and has discussed fundraising assistance with David Brock, a former self-described \"right-wing hit man\" who became a staunch supporter of Hillary Clinton during her campaign against Mr. Trump.\n\nAs of the interview, Ms. Bloom reported that the fundraising efforts have yielded approximately $30,000, primarily in small donations. The funds are being used for expenses such as depositions, but have not been utilized to cover legal fees, which Ms. Bloom stated have already reached $150,000. Ms. Bloom and Ms. Zervos will not personally accept any of the donated funds.\n\nIn an email, Ms. Bloom wrote, \"We certainly do not see any prospect of being paid by the fund based on the amounts donated to date. Nevertheless, we will continue to devote ourselves to Ms. Zervos' case because we believe, as does Ms. Zervos, that truth matters and that President Trump should be held accountable for his words and actions.\"\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Ms. Zervos accused Mr. Trump of sexually assaulting her in 2007, following her appearance as a contestant on his reality TV show, \"The Apprentice.\" Mr. Trump dismissed these and other accusers' claims as \"made-up nonsense\" and suggested they were motivated by fame or were orchestrated by Hillary Clinton's campaign. These comments form the basis for the defamation suit Ms. Zervos filed after the election. A judge is currently deciding whether to allow the lawsuit to proceed.",
    " Title: Trump's Unconventional Approach to Foreign Policy Affects U.S. Diplomacy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the last week, President-elect Donald Trump has made several controversial statements regarding foreign policy issues. He has called for the strengthening and expansion of the United States' nuclear capabilities, accused China of an unprecedented act in seizing a U.S. Navy underwater drone in the South China Sea, and suggested that the U.S. should let China keep the drone after its return. Trump also condemned the deadly truck rampage at a Christmas market in Berlin as an \"attack on humanity,\" and linked it to his proposed immigration ban from countries with a history of Islamic extremism. He further suggested that the U.S., along with other countries, should \"fight back\" against such attacks.\n\nTrump's pronouncements, often vague and offhand, have raised questions about their long-term impact on policy. However, his intervention in pressuring Egypt to delay a United Nations Security Council vote disrupted a sensitive diplomatic negotiation and potentially undermined President Barack Obama's final opportunity to make a statement on the stalled Middle East peace process.\n\nWhen Egypt yielded to Trump's pressure, the same resolution was brought to a vote by four other countries on the Security Council: Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal, and Venezuela. The U.S. largely observed the proceedings from the sidelines. On Friday morning, President Obama, from his vacation home in Hawaii, directed his national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, to instruct the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, not to block the resolution.\n\nDaniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to both Egypt and Israel, commented, \"In a practical sense, the message this sends is that the Obama administration is over. Everybody knows this resolution doesn't carry any weight. The assumption has to be that the Israeli government will take some retaliatory measures. Knowing that Trump is coming into office, and knowing that Trump tried to oppose this, they will do so with impunity.\"\n\nThis role reversal between the departing and incoming presidents has deepened what was already an unsettled moment in American foreign policy. There is a sense that the White House's policies toward the world's most troubled places have run out of steam and are about to change radically, but in ways that are wholly unpredictable.\n\nTrump has been respectful of his predecessor, and his aides have stated that the two men have spoken often. However, Trump has shown little patience for the traditions of the interregnum between presidents.",
    " Title: National Review Publishes Anti-Trump Editorial, 22 Conservative Thought Leaders Voice Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nThe National Review, a conservative American magazine founded by William F. Buckley, has published an editorial expressing concerns about Donald Trump's potential presidency. The editorial follows a series of submissions from 22 right-leaning thought leaders who question Trump's suitability for the American presidency.\n\nThe central issue appears to be ideological, with the National Review editors expressing concern that Trump's populist approach could alter the conservative ideological consensus within the Republican Party. The editorial concludes that Trump is a political opportunist who might undermine the traditional conservative ideals of limited and orderly government.\n\nWhile not all contributors to the anti-Trump effort are absolute Trump opponents, many express doubts about Trump's political leanings. Some point to his past donations to Democratic parties and his support for single-payer healthcare. Others question his assertions that his personality alone can solve complex problems, perceiving an authoritarian streak in these claims.\n\nWilliam Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, writes in his National Review section that Trump's approach resembles a \"two-bit Caesarism\" that American conservatives have historically disdained.\n\nDespite the anti-Trump sentiments, Trump remains popular, leading in New Hampshire and tied in Iowa. His core supporters may view such criticisms as validating his anti-establishment stance, a significant part of his appeal.\n\nIn response to the editorial, Trump tweeted, \"National Review is a failing publication that has lost its way. Its circulation is way down, with its influence being at an all-time low. Sad!\"\n\nThe core challenge for the anti-Trump movement is the lack of a viable alternative candidate. With the primary season approaching, the Republican establishment has yet to rally around a preferred candidate, leaving the race between Trump and Ted Cruz.\n\nPolitical analyst Jonathan Bernstein, in his Bloomberg View column, noted, \"What is clear is that at least for now, Republican party actors have collectively failed to choose any of the remaining mainstream conservatives \u2013 Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, or John Kasich \u2013 who would seem to offer an excellent chance of winning the nomination if only party actors could signal to mainstream conservative voters that one of them is the horse to back.\"",
    " Title: Republican Leaders Consider Multiple Strategies to Prevent Government Funding Showdown Over Immigration\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican leaders are actively planning to prevent a potential government funding showdown resulting from President Barack Obama's expected executive action on immigration. The showdown could disrupt efforts to pass a long-term spending bill by the Dec. 11 deadline.\n\nAccording to sources involved in the planning sessions, Republican leaders are considering several legislative options to address the immigration issue and ensure the government's funding. These options include offering a separate immigration bill on the floor, tightening border security and demanding the president enforce existing laws, renewing the effort next year when Republicans have larger numbers in both chambers, and passing two separate funding bills.\n\nThe leadership has not made any decisions and is likely to weigh additional options. The House is expected to choose one strategy and stick with it. The strategies aim to prevent another standoff over government funding, as Republicans take control of Capitol Hill in January and have promised to govern responsibly and end crisis-fueled legislating.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions, who will chair the Senate Budget Committee next year, stated, \"I think there is a growing momentum to the idea that Congress would be acting responsibly and modestly if it funds the government but simply bars the president from executing policies that Congress believes shouldn't be executed by denying funding.\"\n\nRepublican leaders have not completely given up on a funding bill that would last until next October, but the political and legislative climate is unpredictable. The White House has not told Republican leaders when it will take unilateral action, but senior aides and lawmakers have made it clear to the Obama administration that acting before Congress funds the government would backfire.\n\nThe least desirable option, according to several Republicans, is a series of short-term spending bills. The GOP clearly sees the short-term option as a losing fight, as it could lead to an immigration-fueled, government-shutdown scare every two or three months.\n\nAs of now, House conservatives seem unsure of their strategy. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) expressed uncertainty over whether Republican leaders can control the conservative elements of their party. The potential government funding showdown remains an open question, with the outcome depending on the actions of both the Republican leadership and President Obama.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Feud with CNN May Influence Pending Media Merger\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing feud between the Trump administration and CNN appears to have extended to a potential media merger. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, President Donald Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, expressed his discontent with CNN during a meeting with Gary Ginsberg, a top executive at Time Warner, CNN's parent company, earlier this year.\n\nIn the meeting, Kushner suggested that CNN should reduce its staff by 20% due to its coverage of the 2016 presidential election. A White House official told the Wall Street Journal that Kushner's remark was not serious, stating that he \"was simply trying to make a point.\" The White House did not immediately respond to the Wall Street Journal's request for comment about the meeting.\n\nThe Trump administration's antagonism towards CNN, as well as the wider media, has been a point of concern. When Kushner took a more significant role in his father-in-law's presidential campaign last summer, he reportedly complained to CNN executives about its coverage of Trump. He was particularly upset after CNN fact-checked a speech Trump gave on June 22 and threatened to keep campaign members from appearing on the network.\n\nSince then, Trump's anger towards CNN has escalated. Trump continues to label the media organization as \"fake news,\" and he has publicly shared doctored videos and cartoons criticizing CNN.\n\nThe White House's open attack on CNN, and the media in general, is troubling. However, Trumpworld's antagonism towards CNN may lead the administration to deny a pending media merger that involves the network.\n\nOn October 22, 2016, AT&T announced its intention to acquire Time Warner, a media company that houses premium TV channel HBO, film studio Warner Bros., and networks like CNN, for $85.4 billion. Due to the merger's size, the government must review it for antitrust reasons.\n\nLast year, Trump stated he would not approve the merger, citing concerns about the concentration of power. On Wednesday, news broke that the administration was looking to block the deal. It remains unclear whether the administration wants to stop the merger due to its animus towards CNN or because Trump promised a populist presidency that would be an antitrust enforcer.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal notes that the administration claims politics are not factoring into the government's review of the merger, and AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson stated on Thursday that politics is not an issue. However, as my colleague Matthew Yglesias wrote on Wednesday, it's hard to know with Trump:\n\n\"We have a president who lies constantly, who disregards the norms of American government, who's openly disdainful of the social function of a free press, and who's set up his administration in a way that seems to generally sideline expertise while opening the door to massive financial conflicts of interest. Under those circumstances, any actions he takes naturally fall under a pall of suspicion, and it's easy for companies who are adversely impacted by his administration's regulatory decisions to raise questions about them.\"\n\nSo even if Kushner's remark was just a joke, it's no laughing matter.",

The venture, which will initially focus on technology for simplified, high-quality, and transparent healthcare, could potentially negotiate directly with drugmakers, doctors, and hospitals to undercut industry \"middlemen.\"\n\nThe new, not-for-profit entity will be led by CEOs Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, and Jamie Dimon, who have expressed concerns about the ballooning costs of the U.S. healthcare system, which accounts for 18 percent of the economy and has been increasing annually faster than inflation.\n\nThe three companies plan for their entities to be the only clients of the joint venture, but they intend to share the strategies and technology they develop to reduce costs for the economy and the government. Traditional healthcare players, such as health insurers and pharmacy networks, could be among the hardest hit.\n\nInvestors expect Amazon will become a major disruptor of healthcare, similar to its impact on the retail industry. The partnership with JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, and Berkshire, the third-largest public company globally and an insurance provider, offers new opportunities to reshape the industry.\n\nHealth insurers that provide benefit management or health plans to Amazon, JPMorgan, and Berkshire could be among the hardest hit. Shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc, Cigna Corp, and health insurer Anthem Inc were 4 percent to 7.2 percent lower at the close, while drugstore operators CVS and Walgreen Boots Alliance, as well as Express Scripts, closed between 3 percent and 5.2 percent lower.

    " Title: Democratic Party's Struggle with Religious Outreach and the Rise of Secularism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2004, the Democratic Party faced criticism for its perceived lack of outreach to \"values voters\" following John Kerry's defeat by George W. Bush. This led to an attempt by some Democrats to appeal to religious voters, with figures like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama adopting more moderate stances on issues like abortion and gay marriage. However, this effort was met with skepticism and eventually abandoned by many liberals.\n\nBy 2012, the Democratic Party had moved away from religious outreach, with liberals pushing for the removal of any mention of God from the party's platform and booing party officials who attempted to restore such references. This shift was confirmed by Michael Wear, Obama's 2012 \"faith-outreach\" director, who criticized the party for its indifference to Christianity and its religious illiteracy.\n\nWear, in an interview with The Atlantic, stated that the party's secularism, moral relativism, and Islamophilia are too deeply ingrained to allow for serious Judeo-Christian outreach. He also highlighted the party's lack of understanding of religious references, citing an instance where White House staffers were confused by a biblical reference in a faith-outreach document.\n\nWear's comments are likely to be met with indifference by the Democratic Party, which has become associated with secularism, transgender bathrooms, and Ramadan dinners. This is reflected in the political career of Congressman Keith Ellison, who has ties to the Nation of Islam and is running to head the Democratic National Committee.\n\nIn 2008, Barack Obama attempted to reconcile America's Judeo-Christian traditions with modern, pluralistic democracy, but his efforts were short-lived, with the party moving away from moderating its positions and instead focusing on moderating its rhetoric. The door to the party for Christians has been largely closed, and it may be too late to open it again.",
    " Title: Analysis: Kentucky, Mississippi, and Virginia Elections Offer Insights for 2020\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent elections in Kentucky, Mississippi, and Virginia have provided some insightful results as we approach the 2020 elections.\n\nIn Kentucky, the victory of Democrat Andy Beshear over incumbent Republican Governor Matt Bevin was not an upset, despite Inside Elections changing its rating on the governor's race from Lean Republican to Toss-up in mid-July. The decision to use the election as a message to the nation was a strategic move for Bevin and the Republicans, but it was not enough to overcome Bevin's vulnerabilities.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's influence was a factor in the race, as his last-minute visit likely prevented a wider margin of defeat for Bevin. However, the impeachment process is not a silver bullet for Republicans, as demonstrated by the Kentucky results.\n\nIn Virginia, the political landscape has undergone a significant transformation. Just over a dozen years ago, Virginia had two Republican U.S. senators. Now, Republicans are struggling to field a credible challenger against Sen. Mark Warner, and Democrats hold full control of the commonwealth at both state and federal levels.\n\nThe suburbs continue to pose a problem for the Republican party, as demonstrated by the results in northern Kentucky and northern Mississippi. In these areas, the GOP margin has decreased significantly since President Trump took office. This trend could be particularly concerning for Trump in his efforts to win Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, and Texas in 2020.\n\nIn Mississippi, State Attorney General Jim Hood, viewed as the strongest possible Democratic candidate, lost by 5 points.\n\nNathan L. Gonzales, an elections analyst for CQ \u2588\u2588\u2588, was not quoted in the provided text.",
    " Title: No President Since WWII Re-elected with Jobless Rate Over 7.4%; Economy Remains a Focal Point in Obama's Re-election Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest June jobs report has refocused the presidential campaign on the economy, a critical factor in President Barack Obama's re-election bid. Since World War II, no president has won re-election with a jobless rate over 7.4 percent, a figure the economy is unlikely to reach before November. With four reports remaining before the election, the president is running out of time to lower the jobless rate.\n\nFriday's report, which showed the economy added only 80,000 jobs in June and marked the worst quarter for job creation in two years with unemployment remaining at 8.2 percent, reinforces Mitt Romney's argument that Obama has not pushed the economy onto a faster growth track. The weak jobs figure also serves to counter a tough news cycle for Romney, refocusing the campaign on the Republican challenger's strong suit: economic growth.\n\nObama attempted to place the weak jobs number in context, citing the over 4 million jobs created during his term. He also blamed Congress for hindering policies he believes would create faster growth, such as infrastructure spending and hiring more police officers, teachers, and other public employees.\n\nObama's approval rating on the economy, consistently rated as the top issue for voters, has long been in dismal territory. Despite adding over 4 million jobs and reducing the jobless rate from a high of 10 percent in October 2009, this may not be enough to sway voters.\n\nThe Romney campaign is expected to add new communications staff and prepare a fresh defense of Romney's record as head of private equity firm Bain Capital. The Romney campaign and its supporters are also expected to launch an unprecedented advertising campaign, fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars, to criticize Obama's economic stewardship and defend Romney's private sector record.\n\nObama's campaign strategy, which involves attacking Romney's business record and wealth, may have limited impact as the Romney campaign and its supporters counter with their own advertising blitz. Obama currently holds a slim lead in most national polls, but the effectiveness of this approach may wane as the campaign intensifies.",
    " Title: Obama to Embark on West Coast Fundraising Trip for Democratic Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama will commence a three-day fundraising trip to the West Coast on Wednesday, attending five events in California to support Democratic congressional candidates. The events will be hosted by executives from Disney studios, Yahoo, and the former chairman of Qualcomm, among others.\n\nThe fundraisers are part of more than 20 events that the president has committed to this year, as Democrats aim to maintain control of the Senate and gain seats in the House. Despite his job-approval ratings reaching a low point during his presidency, Obama joked at the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner about Democrats' perceived reluctance to campaign with him.\n\nObama's first stop will be in Arkansas, where he will tour tornado damage and meet with victims' families, accompanied by Sen. Mark Pryor, a red-state Democrat running for a third term against Republican Rep. Tom Cotton. The appearance with Obama is not a campaign event, but rather a tour to assess the damage caused by the tornado. Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe, a Democrat, and Rep. Tim Griffin, a Republican, will also join the tour.\n\nLater on Wednesday, Obama will travel to Los Angeles to participate in a joint fundraiser for House and Senate Democratic candidates and receive an \"Ambassador for Humanity\" award from Steven Spielberg at a Holocaust memorial event sponsored by the University of Southern California's Shoah Foundation. The award recognizes Obama's commitment to democracy and human rights, as well as his appointment of the nation's first special envoy for Holocaust Survivor Services.\n\nThe Holocaust event and an \"official\" energy-related event in San Jose will ensure that taxpayers cover much of the cost of the president's trip, despite the majority of the trip being dedicated to political fundraising.\n\nOn Thursday, Obama will attend four fundraisers in Southern California, with hosts including Walt Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn, billionaire and former Qualcomm Chairman Irwin Jacobs, and Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer. Tickets for the events range from $1,000 per person to $64,800 per couple, depending on the event and the level of access to Obama.\n\nIrwin Jacobs was the second-biggest donor to Obama's 2012 campaign, contributing well over $2 million to the president's re-election effort.\n\nDemocrats currently hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate (53 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the party), but they are defending 21 of the 36 seats contested in November. Many political analysts believe the GOP is within reach of picking up the net six seats needed to regain control of the Senate. In the House, Democrats would need a net gain of 17 seats to take the chamber, a goal that most political strategists believe the party can not achieve. Democrats are leading in the 2014 money race of \"hard\" contributions, which are subject to federal limits, but Republicans are believed to be benefiting more from spending by outside groups that don't need to disclose their contributions.",
    " Title: Candidates Focus on Ohio in 2012 Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2012 presidential campaign has zeroed in on the state of Ohio today, with Mitt Romney and Barack Obama holding campaign events in the state. Ohio is a pivotal state, as no Republican has won the White House in modern times without it.\n\nMitt Romney built his argument to Ohioans around the national debt and stood in front of a ticking debt clock. President Obama accused his challenger of newfound outrage over China policy, a particularly important subject in Ohio, where there is sensitivity to the outsourcing of U.S. jobs.\n\nBoth candidates were in the state all day, sharing turf for the first time in roughly two months. Romney has seen his support there slip. Pollster Nate Silver had rated Ohio a clear \"tossup,\" but shifted that to \"leans Democratic\" after a series of polls showed growing support for President Obama there.\n\nThe bad news for Romney in Ohio was reinforced by the public perception, in a new Quinnipiac University-Washington Post poll, that his campaign has faltered. Six in ten Americans expressed a negative opinion of how he's handling his campaign, and a majority responded unfavorably to his comments on people who do not pay income taxes.\n\nObama's ratings for handling his campaign are substantially better, 54-43 percent, favorable-unfavorable. And while ratings of Romney's campaign have grown more negative, favorable ratings of Obama's campaign efforts have gained 8 points since July, according to pollster Gary Langer.\n\nAfter waking up to daunting poll numbers showing him behind by double digits in Ohio, Mitt Romney, appearing at a campaign event with golfing great Jack Nicklaus, today attempted to showcase a rare bright spot in the polls, that he leads Obama on his perceived handling of the federal-budget deficit.\n\n\"There's something else he wants to do that's the same as he's done in the past, and that is trillion-dollar deficits,\" Romney said today in Westerville, Ohio, of his differences with Obama on budget-deficit reduction. \"If he were re-elected, I can assure you it will be almost $20 trillion in debt.\"\n\nThe new Quinnipiac University poll shows that when asked who would do a better job on the budget deficit, Ohio voters preferred Romney over Obama 49 percent to 45 percent.\n\nPresident Obama took the stage this afternoon at Bowling Green State University, while Romney, 130 miles away on the opposite side of the state, hosted a business roundtable in Bedford Heights.\n\nObama accused Republican rival Romney of \"newfound outrage\" over Chinese trade practices and disingenuous claims that he would hold the Asian power accountable.\n\n\"When you hear this newfound outrage, when you see these ads he's running promising to get tough on China, it feels a lot like that fox saying, 'You know, we need more secure chicken coops,'\" Obama told a crowd of 5,500 supporters in Bowling Green. \"I mean, it's just not credible.\"\n\nThe president sought to cast himself as a warrior for U.S. workers, highlighting trade cases his administration has brought -- and won -- against China at the World Trade Organization.\n\nA Romney campaign spokeswoman noted that Obama has refused to label China a \"currency manipulator\" and argued that the actions the administration touts have \"failed, expired, or been described as mere 'peanuts' by trade analysts\" at restoring a level playing field for U.S. companies.\n\nThe candidates will then swap sides of the state, presumably passing each other mid-flight, with Romney holding a 5:30 p.m. ET event at the SeaGate Convention Center in Toledo while Obama stumps in Kent at Kent State University.\n\nThere is more than a month left in the campaign, although voters in some key battleground states start early with absentee voting this week. There are pivotal presidential debates between now and Election Day.\n\nMitt Romney has made preparation a priority, taking days off the campaign trail in recent weeks to prepare. President Obama, meanwhile, has only engaged in several preparation sessions, although he plans a three-day crash course in Nevada before the first debate on Oct. 3.\n\nAs Nate Silver's political director Amy Walter pointed out today, debates can mean the difference in a presidential campaign. It rarely happens, but she pointed to Gallup data showing that George W. Bush might have benefited enough from the debates to squeak into Election Day. In advance, both campaigns this week sought to lower expectations for their debate performances.",
    " Title: Americans Rush to Beat Government Policies, Fiscal Cliff Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final months of 2012, a sense of urgency has gripped Americans, with crowds flocking to gun shows, shops, and financial institutions. This mass movement is driven by the desire to either avoid or benefit from government actions, as the \"invisible hand\" of free markets is being replaced by the \"visible hand\" of bureaucrats.\n\nThe political class is now the dominant force in the nation, with the tax-and-spending drama in Washington posing real-world consequences for every American. The reelection of President Barack Obama in 2012 secures first-term government expansions, such as ObamaCare, which carries expensive mandates and potential unintended consequences.\n\nThe fiscal cliff, including wild swings in the stock market, provides an ominous snapshot of the new reality. The real impact of Obama's statist policies will be felt in the new year and for many years to come.\n\nSome statistics, such as housing prices, suggest the economy is growing, but the unemployment rate is falling largely because millions have stopped looking for work. Ordinary wages are stagnant or falling. However, it is a boom time for the government, with spending continuing to rise, hiring on the increase, and the Federal Reserve's printing presses running overtime.\n\nThe Obama administration is content to keep borrowing 40 cents of every dollar it spends, or nearly $4 billion a day, seven days a week. Each day brings plans for added regulations and new ways to redistribute wealth.\n\nThe combination creates a huge cloud hanging over every family and business. Debts and inflation exact penalties, perhaps for generations, and already are stifling innovation and job creation. The United States has become the world's largest debtor nation and still needs more lenders.\n\nThe certain result will be an economic pie that doesn't grow fast enough, which will lead to new demands for more redistribution under the guise of \"fairness.\" The government redistributes by taking the first bite for itself.\n\nThe most disheartening aspect of this gloomy vision is that Americans voted for it. Obama was upfront about wanting to raise taxes and expand government and the debt. The reach and cost of Washington grew dramatically in the last four years, and he was rewarded with four more.\n\nIt is naive to think he will change course. His rejection of any serious reforms of entitlements shows that he is emboldened. Woe to the man who dares declare that the government already is too big and powerful. He will be denounced as cruel and caricatured as wanting no government at all.\n\nThis being the season for predictions, one is that millions upon millions of Americans who voted for Obama will be disappointed in 2013. But most will not blame him. They will agree with him that the solution is to double the dose of Washington power.\n\nNever mind that the patient is dying. The Obama operation is a great success. Just ask him.",
    " Title: Beto O'Rourke Exits Presidential Race Due to Weak Poll Numbers and Fundraising Struggles\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke has ended his presidential campaign, leaving the Democratic primary race after a series of weak poll numbers and fundraising struggles. O'Rourke, who gained national attention during his close 2018 Senate race against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, entered the presidential race in March but failed to maintain the momentum he had garnered.\n\nInitially, O'Rourke's polling numbers suggested he might be a serious contender for the nomination, with polls showing him at 10% or more shortly after his announcement. However, his survey numbers quickly deteriorated, and he spent the past four months mostly polling below 5%.\n\nFundraising difficulties also plagued O'Rourke's campaign. Despite raising $6.1 million in the first 24 hours of his campaign, the second-best opening day after only former Vice President Joe Biden, his fundraising efforts dwindled. He had raised only $13 million by the end of the second quarter and added just $4.5 million in the third quarter.\n\nO'Rourke's debate performances did not help him recover, with his most recent performance seemingly hurting him. After the October debate, O'Rourke's net favorability among Democratic primary voters fell by about 6 points in a post-debate poll with Ipsos, the biggest decline for any of the 12 candidates on stage. His place at future debates was in jeopardy, as he was two qualifying polls shy of making the November debate and had yet to register a single qualifying survey for the December debate.\n\nO'Rourke's struggle to attract a large enough base of support in the primary may have been due to the makeup of the Democratic electorate. As a moderate three-term congressman, he won over many suburban white voters in his Texas Senate bid, but a base of white moderates, particularly younger ones, was not enough. According to data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, only about 12% of 2016 Democratic primary voters fit all three descriptors\u2014young, white, moderate.\n\nO'Rourke's leftward pivot on issues, particularly gun control, may have also damaged his ability to run for statewide office in Texas again, as it's still a Republican-leaning state. The exact future political endeavors of O'Rourke remain uncertain, but his exit from the presidential race serves as a reminder that early campaign strength does not always translate into success.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Face Decision on Filibustering Supreme Court Nominee Neil Gorsuch\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Democrats are grappling with the decision of whether to filibuster President Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch. According to Politico, at least seven conservative Democratic senators favor an open vote for Gorsuch, while others, including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are considering the potential consequences of appearing obstructionist.\n\nThe Democratic Party's internal debate revolves around the possibility of preserving the filibuster for a more conservative future nominee. However, it is crucial for Senate Democrats to filibuster Gorsuch, or any other nominee put forth by President Trump, as a matter of principle and to maintain a chance in the 2018 midterms.\n\nThe most significant factor to consider is the contention that this Supreme Court seat is stolen, as Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) argues. Historically, Supreme Court justices have retired or died during the final year of a presidential term, and presidents have still managed to get their nominees confirmed. The Senate's decision to block a nominee for an entire year, in the hope that the next president will be from the opposing party, is unprecedented.\n\nRepublican senators like John McCain and Ted Cruz had previously vowed to hold the seat open throughout a potential Hillary Clinton presidency. Since Republicans control the Senate, Gorsuch's confirmation is imminent regardless of the Democrats' actions. The filibuster will remain in place until it obstructs the Republican agenda, at which point it will be abolished. As Jonathan Chait argues, Democrats should challenge Trump's nominee now and force Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to take responsibility for pushing Gorsuch into the contested seat.\n\nThe political climate surrounding the nomination process is further complicated by the contentious nature of President Trump's administration. Trump lost the popular vote by a significant margin, and the election was marked by efforts to disenfranchise African-Americans and FBI interference on Trump's behalf. Instead of governing moderately, as President Obama did despite winning the popular vote twice, Trump and his advisers are pushing through radical, bigoted policies as quickly as possible.\n\nOne of the most alarming policies is the proposed ban on Muslim immigration from seven countries, which has been implemented through executive order and appears to disregard federal court orders. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the legality of these actions, and there is reason to believe that Gorsuch will act as a \"partisan stooge,\" as Tom Scocca argues. This raises the possibility of Gorsuch being used to legally justify Trump's illegal actions.\n\nTrump's unpopularity, particularly for a recently-elected president, is another factor to consider. Trump's executive order has caused widespread chaos, and Republicans are preparing for mass deportations and the loss of health insurance for millions. Protests, fueled by years of activism from groups like Black Lives Matter, are occurring frequently in cities across the country, including Birmingham and Louisville.\n\nDemocrats will face midterm elections in 2018, and the Senate map is challenging, with many seats up in states that Trump won. However, compromising with Trump is not a viable strategy for winning those seats. The Democrats' primary issue is voter turnout, and they need a passionate, activist base to drive turnout among their traditional demographic groups, which have historically been underrepresented in midterm elections. To achieve this, they need to offer their base something to fight for.\n\nCurrently, there is significant anti-Trump energy. If Democrats want to harness this energy, they must demonstrate a commitment to opposing Trump at every turn. Filibustering Gorsuch is the most overt way they can do this.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush Urges Senate to Confirm Loretta Lynch as Attorney General\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush has called for the Senate to confirm President Barack Obama's nominee for Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, during a speech at the \"Politics and Pie\" forum in Concord, New Hampshire, on Thursday night. The nomination has faced opposition from a number of Senate Republicans.\n\nBush stated, \"I think presidents have the right to pick their team,\" according to reports of his speech. He also took a jab at the current Attorney General, Eric Holder, suggesting that the longer it takes to confirm Lynch, the longer Holder remains in office.\n\nThe confirmation process for Lynch has been stalled for 160 days since Obama announced his choice on Nov. 8, due to a Senate standoff over a sex-trafficking bill containing a controversial abortion provision. However, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has threatened to bypass Senate protocol and force a vote on the Senate floor.\n\nBush expressed his belief that there should be some deference to the executive branch and that the process should not always be partisan. \"If someone is supportive of the president's policies, whether you agree with them or not, there should be some deference to the executive,\" Bush told reporters.\n\nIn a lighter moment, Bush joked about not attempting to break a tie between his family and the Adamses, who are the two families to have produced the most U.S. presidents. John Adams was the 2nd president, from 1797-1801, and his son, John Quincy Adams, was the 6th president, from 1825-1829.\n\nBush also made a reference to Hillary Clinton's recent visit to Chipotle, joking that he cooks at home and does not need to dine at the fast-casual chain, though he does occasionally. Bush broke his strict paleo diet to enjoy some blueberry pie at the event. \"To hell with the diet,\" he said, according to reports. \"Where are the french fries?\"",
    " Title: Congressional Democrats Consider Expanding Inquiry into Trump's Tax Returns to Include Business Returns\n\nArticle:\n\nCongressional Democrats are deliberating whether to broaden their investigation into President Donald Trump's tax affairs to encompass his business tax returns, in addition to his personal returns. This expansion, some view as essential for effective oversight, is a contentious issue amidst ongoing discussions among aides and lawmakers.\n\nThe debate has intensified following last week's testimony by Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, who alleged that Trump manipulated his business asset values and reduced employee salaries to lower his taxes. The testimony suggests that investigators in the House of Representatives will require both his personal and business returns to comprehensively assess Trump's adherence to tax laws and understand the intricate network of businesses he owns, according to lawmakers.\n\nHouse Democrats have spent months preparing for an unprecedented request to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for Trump's personal tax filings. The inclusion of Trump's business returns could complicate an already legally delicate endeavor, aides and lawmakers said. Trump owns over 550 companies and business entities, including the Trump Organization, as per his financial disclosure reports.\n\nRepresentative Richard Neal, chairman of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, is attempting to formulate a request to Mnuchin that can withstand a potential court battle with Trump, who has refused to release his returns, defying decades of presidential practice. Unlike his predecessors, Trump has retained extensive business interests while serving as president, raising questions about conflicts of interest.\n\nInterest in Trump's business returns is coming from at least four other House panels, including Oversight and Judiciary. House Oversight is keen on deposing Sheri Dillon, a long-time Trump tax attorney who likely has a deep understanding of Trump's tax returns.\n\nNo final decision has been made on whether to pursue the business returns in the initial request, committee officials said this week. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the House Oversight Committee, stated that Cohen's testimony has opened up numerous investigatory avenues.\n\n\"It's about comparing his financial statements with his tax reports. What Cohen named particularly were the Trump Organization taxes,\" Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nDemocrats, who won control of the House in the November 2018 U.S. elections, argue that Trump's personal returns would reveal whether he has complied with U.S. tax laws and any IRS audits, as well as his effective tax rate, business and investment income, and charitable contributions.\n\nHowever, Democrats could stumble if they focus solely on Trump's personal returns, if their aim is to identify conflicts of interest between his sprawling business investments and the policies he advocates from the Oval Office, tax experts say.\n\n\"Personal returns alone fall short,\" said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a think tank in Washington.\n\nSuccess against legal resistance to disclosure by Trump would greatly depend on the ability of Democrats to demonstrate a legitimate legislative purpose for their request. Rosenthal suggested that including business returns would strengthen the House's argument because the documents are geared strongly to legitimate oversight questions such as conflicts of interest.\n\nHouse Democrats are reportedly considering simplifying their request by targeting a limited number of Trump companies tied to investments of interest, rather than the entire business network, and possibly making further requests later.\n\n\"It's going to be a combination of both personal and business, because he goes back and forth between both. To get the full picture, I don't think you can just pick one or the other,\" said Representative Gerry Connolly, an Oversight member.",

Tipsword, 85, had long viewed Ferguson as a model of integration, but was taken aback by the anger that erupted after Brown's death. Over the last 25 years, Ferguson has transitioned from being nearly three-quarters white to two-thirds black.\n\nIn the 1990s, a group called Proud, which stood for People Reaching Out for Unity and Diversity, was formed in Ferguson to promote integration. The group's efforts, many believed, had achieved their goals, leading to a perceived decline in the group's relevance.\n\n\"We integrated so well, I had thought,\" Ms. Tipsword said. \"I just didn't know.\"\n\nChief Anderson, a black police commander from Glendale, Arizona, was introduced as Ferguson's new interim police chief last month. He emphasized his commitment to a new kind of inclusive, community-centered policing during his introduction at the community center. Ed Beasley, an African-American who had previously been the city manager in Glendale, was also announced as Ferguson's interim city manager a month earlier. New members of Ferguson's City Council, including two African-Americans elected in April, were also present.\n\nThis new leadership team represents a significant shift in Ferguson's public image. City leaders are under pressure to swiftly present a new image following the Justice Department's findings that the city's law enforcement policies were predatory, and that city officials stood by as some employees shared racist emails.",
    " Title: US Government Weighs Response to Alleged Russian Cyberattacks on Political System\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration is grappling with how to respond to a series of cyberattacks targeting Democratic Party organizations and election registration websites, with strong evidence pointing to Russian hackers as the culprits, according to law enforcement and intelligence officials briefed on the investigation.\n\nThere is debate within the administration about publicly attributing the attacks to Russia, with FBI and Justice Department officials advocating for such a move, while US intelligence agencies and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence have expressed caution due to concerns about Russian retaliation and potential exposure of US intelligence operations.\n\nWhite House officials are also reportedly hesitant due to the political overtones of making such an attribution weeks before the US presidential election. Some officials believe the FBI and intelligence agencies need to provide more definitive links between Russian intelligence hackers and WikiLeaks, the organization that published the stolen documents from the Democratic National Committee.\n\nAn administration official stated that there is no effort to slow down the attribution of the hacks, with the law enforcement and intelligence communities set to reach their own conclusions in due course. The policy decisions regarding public attribution are contingent on the results of the ongoing investigation.\n\nIntelligence and law enforcement officials believe the Russian goal is not necessarily to elect a particular candidate, but rather to sow dissension and raise doubts about the US political system. This is similar to Russian activity in Europe, according to US officials.\n\nThis week, congressional leaders and staff received briefings on the sprawling US hacking investigation, during which they were told that there is near-certainty that Russian intelligence is behind cyberattacks targeting a range of political organizations, think-tanks, and even reporters at The New York Times. There is also increasing confidence that recent attacks against election registration websites in Illinois and Arizona link back to Russian government hackers.\n\nThe prospect of Russian hacking activity affecting confidence in the US election is a primary concern for US government officials. While voting machines and tabulation systems are not connected to the Internet, there are concerns about hackers tampering with registration data and causing voters to find they are not on the voting rolls on election day. This could amplify such issues this year and potentially affect public confidence in the election outcome.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, stated, \"There are troubling signs that hostile foreign cyberactors are working to undermine our political process. This is a direct provocation that goes to the heart of American democracy. We can not allow such action to go unanswered.\"",

KABC radio host Leeann Tweeden has accused Franken of groping and forcibly kissing her.\n\nIn an account published by Minneapolis' Star Tribune, Tweeden described the incident, stating, \"He repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said 'OK' so he would stop badgering me. We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth. I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn't be so nice about it the next time. I walked away. All I could think about was getting to a bathroom as fast as possible to rinse the taste of him out of my mouth.\"\n\nFranken's statement regarding the allegations is not a denial. He said, \"I certainly don't remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann. As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn't. I shouldn't have done it.\"\n\nThe appropriate response or consequence of such behavior is a matter of debate. Franken was 55 at the time of the alleged incident.\n\nDemocrats are expected to be divided in their responses. Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri stated on Twitter, \"I'm shocked and concerned. The behavior described is completely unacceptable. Comedy is no excuse for inappropriate conduct, and I believe there should be an ethics investigation.\"\n\nHowever, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, when asked about the Franken allegations, responded, \"You guys need to find something more interesting.\" It is important to note that this statement was made before being asked about the Franken accusations, a significant error in the reporting.\n\nThis article is based on the information provided and does not include personal opinions, political bias, or subjective language.

Over 900,000 electricity customers in Georgia and South Carolina have lost power due to the storm. A tropical storm warning is in effect for all of Georgia's Atlantic coast and most of South Carolina's coast.\n\nIn Charleston, knee-high floodwaters have coursed through the streets, with some residents navigating by kayak. The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood emergency for Charleston County, and parts of the city's historic core, located on the Charleston peninsula, are being closed down.\n\nMayor John Tecklenburg stated that the city experienced a four-foot storm surge, leaving parts of the peninsula looking as if they had merged with the Ashley River. He explained that Charleston was affected by the counterclockwise rotation of Irma and a clockwise high-pressure rotation over the Atlantic, which created strong winds and hurricane bands that directly impacted the city.\n\nFurther inland, concerns about serious damage remain high, even as the storm's power diminishes. In Atlanta, winds have caused trees to crash into residences and roadways, and the city's public school system has canceled classes through Tuesday. Delta Airlines, based in Atlanta, has canceled approximately 900 flights due to strong north-south crosswinds at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.\n\nIn Jacksonville, Florida, Mayor Lenny Curry has urged residents to heed warnings, as high tides will raise river waters up to 6 feet above their normal levels and cause additional flooding. The city is facing a \"trifecta\" of water-related threats: storm surge, heavy rainfall over the weekend, and Monday's rising tides.\n\nIn Tampa, Mayor Bob Buckhorn reported that the city had been spared the storm's worst, with minimal flooding and manageable debris. The city was again spared from a direct hit by a hurricane, as it has been for over 90 years.\n\nIn St. Petersburg, tree limbs littered lawns, and minor debris has blown onto roads but is not stopping traffic.

    " Title: Experts Discuss the Relevance of Youthful Indiscretion in Supreme Court Nominee's Alleged Assault\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of assaulting a girl at a house party in 1982, have sparked a national debate on the significance of youthful indiscretion.\n\nRod Dreher, editor of The American Conservative, tweeted, \"I do not understand why the loutish, drunken behavior of a 17-year-old high school boy has anything to tell us about the character of a 53-year-old judge.\" Fox News commentator Stephen Miller likened the allegations to \"drunk teenagers playing seven minutes of heaven.\"\n\nHowever, experts argue that an assault such as the one alleged by Christine Blasey Ford falls outside the realm of youthful indiscretion. Ford claimed that Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her, tried to remove her clothes, and put his hand over her mouth. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.\n\nScience suggests that teenagers do not have full control of their impulses, with the part of the brain responsible for self-control still developing into their 20s. Teenagers often engage in risky behavior, such as binge drinking and reckless driving, but these actions are usually \"calibrated not to hurt people,\" according to Christine Nicholson, a clinical psychologist who works with adolescents.\n\nHowever, sexual assault is a hard line, Nicholson said. If a boy covers the mouth of a girl to drown out her screams, \"it's pretty clear that you do not have consent,\" she said. Katie Edwards, a psychology professor and affiliate at the University of New Hampshire's Prevention Innovations Research Center, which combats sexual violence, noted that children begin to read emotions and learn right from wrong as early as age 2 or 3.\n\n\"Trying to make an argument that boys will be boys, that\u2019s just reaffirming rape myths that we know are so pervasive in our culture,\" Edwards said. \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any scientific evidence that this person wouldn\u2019t know that what he was doing was harming another person.\"\n\nUnlike binge drinking and similar actions, sexual assault is a rare offense in teenage boys, a deviant behavior, Nicholson said. \"This is not a common thing for a boy to do,\" she said. \"A boy can get drunk. A girl can get drunk. But to sexually assault someone while drunk is not a common affair.\"\n\nAlcohol's ability to lower a person's inhibitions and perpetuate crime has been well-studied. Sherry Hamby, a psychology professor at the University of the South, said it should not be considered an exculpatory factor for bad behavior, just as it would not be for any other crime committed while intoxicated.\n\nIn discussing the Kavanaugh allegations, Ari Fleischer, a former spokesman for President George W. Bush, asked, \"Should any of us be held liable today\u2014when we lived a good life, an upstanding life by all accounts\u2014and then something that maybe is an arguable issue took place in high school?\"\n\nSurvivor advocates noted that assaults can follow victims decades later. Of college-age men who self-reported acts that would qualify as rape, 63% admitted to repeat rapes, according to a 2002 study by researchers at the University of Massachusetts and the Brown University School of Medicine.\n\n\"People who offend throughout adulthood often began those behaviors in adolescence,\" said Kristen Houser, chief public affairs officer at the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. \"That does not mean that people who behave badly in their youth, in adolescence, all go on to do this across their lifetime.\"\n\nYouths who commit sexual assault can be reformed by taking responsibility for their offense and working through it in therapy, experts said. But that takes admitting it first.\n\n\"There would be a big difference if this guy said, 'Look, I did this. It was so godawful, and I'm embarrassed and ashamed, and I have never done it again' and apologized profusely,\" said Yale psychiatry professor Joan Cook.\n\nNicholson said that sexual assault, even if perpetrated in elementary school, would invalidate someone from serving on the Supreme Court. \"You can't attempt to rape someone and go on to become a Supreme Court justice,\" she said. \"People don't do that.\"",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Navigate Delicate Balance on Immigration Reform and Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Democratic leaders are grappling with the extent to which they should pressure President Barack Obama to take action on immigration reform before the midterm elections, as they seek to avoid potentially complicating the reelection bids of Democrats in red states.\n\nThe dynamic leaves the Senate's most powerful Democrats in a challenging position. Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington have all called for executive action to halt deportations, with Schumer even suggesting in March that the White House should move on the matter in October.\n\nHowever, the leaders are now evasive about whether they want the president to act before November or wait until after the elections. Representatives for each of the senators declined to comment this week on the timing of the president's action.\n\n\"The timing of it is entirely up to him,\" said Ben Marter, spokesman for Sen. Durbin, regarding the president's decision.\n\nDemocrats are attempting to redirect focus towards the Republican-controlled House, where Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has stated that he has no plans to act on immigration this year.\n\n\"If House Republicans would just do their job and pass an immigration reform bill that fixes a broken system, then we wouldn't even be having this conversation,\" said Adam Jentleson, spokesman for Sen. Reid, who declined to comment further.\n\nA spokesman for Sen. Schumer echoed this sentiment, stating, \"The president would not be forced to even contemplate taking independent action to cope with our broken system had House Republicans not spent more than a year blocking the Senate's already-passed bipartisan immigration reform legislation.\"\n\nThe debate underscores the delicate balance that Democrats are maintaining on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue regarding immigration. Obama and Democratic congressional leaders are weighing calls for action to stem deportations, but risk going too far and potentially flipping the Senate to the GOP, giving Republicans full control of Congress and a more powerful platform to block immigration reform.\n\nThe GOP is already capitalizing on the issue, making immigration reform a topic in key Senate races.\n\nObama administration officials are currently reviewing immigration enforcement practices and are expected to take steps within weeks to ease deportations of certain immigrants living in the United States illegally, though the exact timing remains a subject of speculation.\n\nThough he previously maintained that he had little legal authority to act on immigration, Obama stated in June that he would take executive action on deportations this summer after it became clear that House Republicans would not move a bill. The president is unlikely to halt deportations for all undocumented immigrants who would have become legalized under the Senate's comprehensive reform bill that passed last year, but the administration is considering relief for smaller populations based on criteria such as family ties or how long they have lived in the United States.\n\nIn a Univision interview this week, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) emphasized family ties, stating that parents of U.S. citizens or young undocumented immigrants should be granted the same protections as the so-called \"Dreamers\" who were shielded under a 2012 Obama administration directive. Pelosi also supports the call from Latino lawmakers to protect the estimated 8 million undocumented immigrants who would have qualified under the Senate bill, a position that Durbin and Schumer have also endorsed.\n\n\"It would be my hope that the president's lawyers would advise him on the broadest possible prosecutorial discretion,\" Pelosi said during the interview.\n\nWith the potential for fallout to impact their incumbents in conservative states, Democratic leaders in the Senate want little ownership of the timing of the president's decision. At the same time, they do not want to alienate pro-immigration groups by publicly siding with red-state Democrats, even though the Senate leadership has aggressively tried to protect their vulnerable members from taking tough votes and being cornered into uncomfortable positions all year. Endangered Democrats have already pushed back on the president's upcoming move. In an interview before the August recess, Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas insisted that Obama needs statutory authority to act on deportations, stating, \"I'm not for government by executive order.\"",
    " Title: Supporting Protesters: A Guide to Local Bail Funds and Other Organizations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of ongoing protests against police brutality and systemic racism, many individuals are seeking ways to support protesters and the cause. One method to consider is making a donation to a local bail fund. The importance of releasing protesters from jail quickly, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, is highlighted due to the increased risk of exposure in detention facilities.\n\nSeveral local bail funds have been established to assist protesters in securing their release. Due to an outpouring of support, some of these funds, such as the Minneapolis Freedom Fund and the Brooklyn Bail Fund, have asked donors to redirect their funds to other nonprofits. A variety of funds, many within your own community, require financial support.\n\nA starting point for deciding where to send your donations can be found in this thread compiled by filmmaker Matthew A. Cherry, which lists funds for major cities across the country. As Cherry notes, this is a starting point for deciding where to send your donations, but it is essential to conduct a background check on an organization before sending money.\n\nAnother possible first step is to check out the National Bail Fund Network, which offers a directory of community bail funds\u2014including a listing of dedicated bail funds for protesters\u2014organized by state. Additionally, ActBlue's donation portal provides the option of splitting your donation among 38 different community bail funds.\n\nIn the short-term, getting protesters out of jail quickly is critical. In the longer-term, police brutality is a systemic issue that requires comprehensive reform. If you have a little extra money to spare, it's also worth donating to organizations working on solutions for ending police brutality, such as Campaign Zero. In addition to accepting donations, Campaign Zero is also a good resource for understanding possible solutions and learning what actions you can take right now to address police violence.\n\nFor those looking for ways to advocate for Black lives, a list of resources is available. These resources provide information on various aspects of the Black Lives Matter movement and offer guidance on how to take action.",
    " Title: Sarah Palin Endorses Donald Trump for President, Joins Campaign in Iowa\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has endorsed Donald Trump for the presidency, marking her first foray into the 2016 presidential race. In a statement from the Trump campaign, Palin expressed her support for Trump, stating, \"I am proud to endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States of America.\"\n\nAt a campaign event at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, Palin appeared alongside Trump, where she praised the real estate mogul and praised his commitment to making America great again. \"You\u2019re putting relationships on the line for this country because you\u2019re willing to make America great again,\" she said at the rally.\n\nTrump, in turn, expressed his gratitude for Palin's support, stating, \"She\u2019s the woman that from day one I said I needed to get her support.\" Palin, who became a symbol of the Tea Party movement following the 2008 presidential election, is the highest-profile backer for a Republican contender so far in the race.\n\nIn her endorsement speech, Palin praised Trump for bringing up controversial issues to create \"a good, heated primary,\" while taking aim at what she called \"establishment candidates\" in the race. \"They\u2019ve been wearing political correctness kind of like a suicide vest,\" she said.\n\nThe endorsement comes less than two weeks ahead of the critical lead-off Iowa caucus, where Trump is locked in a dead heat with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. In the statement announcing the endorsement, Trump's campaign described Palin as a conservative who \"helped launch the careers of several key future leaders of the Republican Party and conservative movement.\"\n\nCampaigning in New Hampshire, Tuesday, Cruz responded to Palin's endorsement of Trump, saying \"regardless of what Sarah intends to do in 2016, I will remain a big, big fan of Sarah Palin.\"\n\nPalin is expected to join Trump on Wednesday for campaign events in Norwalk, Iowa, and Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Democratic National Committee responded to the endorsement, stating, \"Even with a record number of candidates and internal calls to become more inclusive as a party, Donald Trump and Sarah Palin remain two of the GOP\u2019s most influential leaders.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Committee also criticized the divisive rhetoric of Trump and Palin, stating, \"Their divisive rhetoric is now peddled by everyone from Ted Cruz to Marco Rubio. Americans deserve better than what Trump and Palin have to offer, but it seems like the other Republican candidates would rather follow in their footsteps.\"\n\nIn addition to Palin's endorsement, Trump received an endorsement from Aissa Wayne, the daughter of the western film actor John Wayne, while campaigning at Iowa's John Wayne Birthplace Museum. Wayne said the country needs a strong and courageous leader like her father, and that he would be offering his endorsement if he were still alive.",
    " Title: Technological Unemployment: A Closer Look at the Impact of Automation on Jobs\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing technological advancements have led to a shift in jobs away from cities like Youngstown, Ohio, with most of the jobs moving to other American cities such as Houston or Chattanooga. The decline in jobs in coal mining industries is not due to foreign competition but rather new techniques that have made natural gas production cheaper.\n\nThe fear of technological unemployment, where automation replaces human jobs, is a concern for some, including economists like Robert Gordon and Tyler Cowen. They argue that we may face challenges when jobs are lost, such as the potential replacement of America's 3.5 million truck drivers by autonomous vehicles.\n\nHowever, the overall results of automation are positive. Workers move from assembly-line jobs to better ones monitoring robots, earning higher wages due to the higher technology. Alternatively, they may move to jobs outside the auto industry, earning pay that goes further due to the cheaper goods produced by robots.\n\nCritics, such as Robert Reich, attribute the decline in American wages to automation, computers, software, robotics, computer-controlled machine tools, and widespread digitization. However, these innovations have actually raised real wages, as a human with a better tool can produce more outputs. The point of an economy is production for consumption, not the protection of existing jobs.\n\nHistorically, if the fear of technological unemployment were true, it would have already occurred on a massive scale. In 1800, four out of five Americans worked on farms, but only one in 50 do so now, despite mechanical harvesting and hybrid corn. Similarly, the decline in jobs in sectors like railways, manual telephone operators, and elevator operators has not led to high unemployment rates.\n\nEach month in the United States, approximately 1.7 million jobs disappear, with over 1% of jobs lost per month due to creative destruction. This is a normal occurrence, as companies go out of business, get merged or downsized, or decide that an extra salesperson on the floor of a big-box store is not worth the costs of employment.\n\nThe net increase or decrease in jobs reported on the evening news is misleading, as the relevant figure for concerns about technological unemployment is the gross figure of 1% of jobs lost per month. This equates to over 10% per year at simple interest. At such rates, in just a few years, a third of the labor force would be unemployed, and the fraction would continue to rise.\n\nTo \"save people's jobs\" by stopping all innovation would result in perpetual employment of capital and labor in the same way, leading to stagnant income. This is not ideal for those who are poor or young. Job protections for the old have already created a dangerous class of unemployed youths in some parts of the world, such as Greece and black South Africa.\n\nHelping the poverty-stricken is commendable, but it is not feasible to subsidize 1.7 million people a month. Nor is job retraining a good idea when directed from above, as the wise heads in Washington do not know the future and may end up teaching people skills for companies that no longer exist. Workers themselves know best how to retrain and relocate, as demonstrated by the hundreds of thousands who moved to North Dakota during the brief oil boom there.\n\nIn conclusion, the labor force should be as flexible as the capital force. This requires liberty, not government programs. When considering which society we'd rather enter at birth, without knowing where within that society we'd end up, one with all jobs protected and a stagnant economy, or one with flexible labor laws and an economy that lifts up the poorest among us, the latter seems more desirable.",
    " Title: Presidential Interference in Military Justice: Bergdahl Case Raises Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nA controversy surrounding the court-martial of Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl has sparked debate over the influence of political figures on military justice proceedings. The case, which concluded on Friday, has been criticized for its outcome, with Bergdahl receiving a minor fine and a dishonorable discharge.\n\nDuring the trial, President Donald Trump, then a candidate, had publicly criticized Bergdahl, calling him a \"dirty rotten traitor\" and suggesting he should be executed. These comments, made before Trump's presidency, were a concern for some due to the potential for inappropriate command influence on military proceedings.\n\nAfter Bergdahl pled guilty, questions were raised about the impact of Trump's pre-election tweets on the prosecution. Andrew McCarthy, a legal analyst for National Review and former federal prosecutor, noted that the seated Commander in Chief's only reasonable response would be \"No comment.\" However, Trump responded, stating, \"People heard what I said.\"\n\nThe presiding judge, Col. Jeffery R. Nance of the Army, stated during a hearing at Fort Bragg that he would consider the president's comments as mitigation evidence when determining an appropriate sentence. This decision has been met with criticism, as the president's comments do not provide any factual, legal, or moral justification for a lenient sentence.\n\nThe concern is that the president's comments may have unlawfully pressured the military and its court-martial system. Federal rules of evidence allow the exclusion of evidence that may be more prejudicial than relevant or probative, but the primary concern is usually about improperly influencing lay jurors. Col. Nance, as a judge, is not an impressionable member of a jury who needs to be protected from sensational headlines.\n\nCol. Nance's statement is being criticized as an illogical disgrace, and Bergdahl's sentence is being labeled a travesty. The president's comments do not mitigate in favor of Bergdahl; they weigh against continuing the case and risk tainting the prosecution by undue influence. The case should either be deemed compromised and dismissed, or the statements excluded and ignored, and justice administered by the book.\n\nThis controversy has sparked calls for reform in the military justice system to prevent political interference in future cases. The families of the soldiers who died searching for Bergdahl and the millions of informed Americans who bear witness to this case are left to grapple with the outcome.",
    " Title: Investigators Examine ACS64 Locomotive and Train Speed in Philadelphia Derailment\n\nArticle:\n\nInvestigators and experts are focusing on the actions of the engineer, Brandon Bostian, in the moments and days leading up to the derailment of Northeast Regional Train 188, which occurred Tuesday night north of Center City Philadelphia. The train was traveling at 106 m.p.h., more than twice the speed limit, before it derailed, resulting in eight fatalities and over 200 injuries.\n\nInvestigators reviewed a video shot from the front of the train until the moment it left the track. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairman Robert Sumwalt stated that with 65 seconds remaining on the video, the train's speed was 70 m.p.h. With 16 seconds left, the speed was 100 m.p.h., and the train reached 106 m.p.h. before the engineer applied emergency brakes, causing a slight decrease in speed.\n\n\"Mere seconds into the turn, we see the train tilting approximately 10 degrees to the right,\" Mr. Sumwalt told reporters at a news conference. \"And then the screen went blank.\"\n\nThe ACS64 locomotive, which had been in use for less than a year, had no reported issues, according to Mr. Sumwalt. Similarly, there were no problems with the track, which was inspected by the railroad the day before the accident, or with the signals that have been checked since, with the exception of those in the immediate vicinity of the wreckage.\n\nAlthough railroads like Amtrak continue to rely on decades-old infrastructure, the locomotive involved was a new addition\u2014a \"Cities Sprinter\" electric locomotive that was introduced only last year, with design roots in Germany and Austria. The locomotive was built by Siemens and delivered to Amtrak in 2014 specifically for its Northeast Corridor service.",
    " Title: Democrats' Opposition to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nThis week, Vice President Mike Pence was compelled to cast the deciding vote for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, marking a significant moment in American politics. The intense opposition from Democrats towards an education secretary has raised questions about the reasons behind this all-out war.\n\nSome Democrats and mainstream media outlets have focused their opposition on Betsy DeVos' alleged \"radical\" views. However, as noted by New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, Secretary DeVos' views are not significantly different from the Obama administration's pro-charter schools position and are similar to the perspectives of centrist Democrats such as Senator Cory Booker.\n\nOther Democrats and media outlets have opposed DeVos due to her lack of experience as a government bureaucrat or school administrator, as well as her inability to answer certain questions during the confirmation hearings. However, a deeper analysis suggests that these factors may not be the primary reasons for the heightened opposition.\n\nOpinion pieces in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal argue that the overheated Democratic opposition is motivated by:\n\n1. The influence of powerful interest groups, such as teachers' unions, who recognize that they will no longer have a near-monopoly on education with the introduction of charter schools and vouchers.\n2. The Democratic Party's upper-middle-class suburbanite constituency, who understand that DeVos' charters and vouchers will be attractive to families with financial disadvantages, ethnic minority heritage, or ideological and religious convictions that differ from the mainstream. In other words, private schooling will be accessible to children who are very different than the Democratic Party's upper-middle-class suburbanites.\n\nFour reasons have been proposed as to why Betsy DeVos may prove to be a beneficial remedy for America's educational challenges:\n\n1. Liberation from Bureaucracy: DeVos' educational philosophy could enable her to liberate American education from federal bureaucracy. Under the Obama administration, the federal government functioned as a giant octopus, bypassing families, communities, and states to impose its will on school curriculum, teacher evaluation, values conformity, and even restroom policies. DeVos signals a departure from this era, with her stated educational philosophy suggesting a reduction in federal encroachment to empower families, local communities, and states.\n2. Pluralistic Education: DeVos' educational philosophy aligns with the values of Dutch Calvinism, a religious tradition that emphasizes the rights and freedoms of families, communities, and religions. This philosophy would allow financially-disadvantaged children to choose the education that fits their unique needs and abilities, increasing educational diversity and accessibility.\n3. Increased Influence: Under DeVos' potential system of vouchers and charters, citizens will be able to exercise more influence over their own child's education, sending their children to a wider variety of schools, including those that would have been financially prohibitive without the vouchers.\n4. Qualifications: Despite criticism that DeVos lacks the traditional qualifications for the position, her extensive involvement in education and interactions with politicians and educational policy makers demonstrate a unique path to the post of secretary that qualifies her for the role.\n\nIn conclusion, while Betsy DeVos may face challenges as Education Secretary, her philanthropic background, commitment to education, and potential to reduce bureaucracy, increase free thinking, and empower the financially disadvantaged make her a promising candidate for reforming America's education system.",
    " Title: President Trump Continues to Use \"Chinese Virus\" Term, Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump again used the term \"Chinese virus\" to refer to the novel coronavirus on Wednesday, despite calls from global health officials to avoid labels associating the disease with a particular nation or ethnic group. The president's rhetoric has drawn backlash and raised concerns about stigmatizing Asian-Americans.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump's comments gained growing attention after he used the phrase in a tweet about supporting the airline industry as travel restrictions decimate their business. \"The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before!\" he wrote.\n\nScientists say the virus originated in Wuhan, China, late last year, but the World Health Organization has warned against using terms that associate diseases with certain groups of people. Despite this, Mr. Trump again referred to the coronavirus as \"Chinese virus\" on Twitter Wednesday morning and later at a White House press conference.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter why he continues to use a phrase that some consider to be racist, the president defended his terminology. \"Because it comes from China,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's not racist at all. It comes from China, that's why. I want to be accurate.\"\n\nThe White House also noted that similar names for illnesses have been used in the past. \"Spanish Flu. West Nile Virus. Zika. Ebola. All named for places. Before the media's fake outrage, even CNN called it 'Chinese Coronavirus.' Those trying to divide us must stop rooting for America to fail and give Americans real info they need to get through the crisis,\" the White House said in a tweet.\n\nOn social media, many critics condemned the president's use of the term. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted, \"Our Asian-American communities\u2014people YOU serve\u2014are already suffering. They do not need you fueling more bigotry.\" The NYPD is investigating several cases of potential hate crime attacks on Asian-Americans in recent days, and Asian-Americans across the country have reported experiencing heightened discrimination, bullying, and harassment.\n\nDr. Eugene Gu responded, \"I've been deathly afraid of this exact moment where Trump turns to racism and xenophobia and calls COVID-19 the 'Chinese Virus.' We are in deep trouble as a nation now that the President of the United States makes the conscious decision to go down this dark path of hate.\"\n\nEvangelical pastor Eugene Cho called for the president to set an example of unity instead of finger-pointing. \"Mr. President: This is not acceptable. Calling it the 'Chinese virus' only instigates blame, racism, and hatred against Asians\u2014here and abroad. We need leadership that speaks clearly against racism; Leadership that brings the nation and world together. Not further divides.\"\n\nHowever, at least one TV personality came out in support of Mr. Trump's remark Tuesday night. Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson praised the president, saying, \"How is it inaccurate to call a virus from China 'Chinese?'\" \"Good for him,\" Carlson said. \"That was Trump at his very best.\"\n\nThe president has used such rhetoric before. In his Oval Office address last week, Mr. Trump made a point of referring to it as a \"foreign virus\" that \"started in China.\" At a congressional hearing on March 10, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield, agreed when asked by Congresswoman Lois Frankel that it was \"absolutely wrong and inappropriate\" to call COVID-19 the \"Chinese coronavirus.\"\n\n\"This painful rhetoric has consequences,\" Democratic Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley said at another hearing on March 12, calling out an unnamed Republican colleague who'd also referred to it as the \"Chinese coronavirus.\" \"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, we've seen not only the spreading of the virus but also a rapid spreading of racism and xenophobia.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Affirms Belief in U.S. Intelligence Agencies' Assessment on Russian Election Interference, Yet Accepts Putin's Denials\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump clarified on Sunday that he accepts the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, but also stated that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin is sincere in his denials of such interference.\n\nDuring a news conference in Hanoi with Vietnam's president, Mr. Trump said, \"I believe that he [Putin] feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election.\" He added, \"As to whether I believe it, I'm with our agencies. As currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Trump had criticized the former heads of the FBI, the CIA, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, labeling them as \"hacks\" and questioning their judgment on the matter of Russian meddling. The president, who now has new leadership in all three agencies, said on Sunday that he has worked \"very strongly\" with the new leadership in U.S. intelligence.\n\nThe CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia meddled in the 2016 election to help Mr. Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. A special counsel's examination of potential collusion between Moscow and Trump campaign aides has led to indictments against Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman and another top aide for crimes unrelated to the campaign, and a guilty plea from a Trump foreign policy adviser.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-AZ) criticized Mr. Trump's belief in Mr. Putin's denial as \"naive.\" McCain stated, \"There's nothing 'America First' about taking the word of a KGB colonel over that of the American intelligence community.\" He added, \"Vladimir Putin does not have America's interests at heart.\"\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday, the president criticized his critics, accusing them of \"playing politics\" and hurting the U.S. Referring to his earlier comments about Mr. Putin's denials, Mr. Trump told reporters on Sunday, \"What I said there is that I believe he believes that, and that's very important for somebody to believe. What he believes is what he believes. What I believe is that we have to get to work.\"\n\nHe reiterated that the U.S. needs Russia's help on issues ranging from North Korea to Syria. \"We have to get to work to solve Syria, to solve North Korea, to solve Ukraine, to solve terrorism,\" the president said. He also pointed to recent U.S. sanctions against Moscow over the election meddling, stating, \"People don't realize Russia has been very, very heavily sanctioned. They were sanctioned at a very high level, and that took place very recently. It's now time to get back to healing a world that is shattered and broken.\"\n\nMr. Trump commented on the Russia election issue for the second straight day on Sunday before arriving in the Philippines, the final stop on a five-country trip to Asia. In Manila, Mr. Trump is meeting with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and will attend a pair of international summits.",
    " Title: Arizona Primary: Sanders' Prospects in Question After Super Tuesday Losses\n\nArticle:\n\nBernie Sanders' campaign, which was initially expected to gain momentum in Arizona, has faced a significant setback following his losses in the Super Tuesday primaries. The Vermont senator, who has invested resources in Arizona and attracted large crowds to his events, is now facing doubts from Arizona Democrats about his ability to recover in time for the March 22 contest against Hillary Clinton.\n\nD.J. Quinlan, an unaligned Arizona Democratic strategist and former executive director of the state Democratic Party, stated, \"I think he needed a lot of momentum heading into the last week of voting here. Hillary's sweep definitely took away any momentum they had.\"\n\nSanders faced a challenging situation in Arizona even before the Super Tuesday losses. In 2008, Clinton won 13 of the state's 15 counties in her primary race against Barack Obama, and the state's sizable Hispanic population tends to favor Clinton. The recent visit by Sanders' wife, Jane, to Sheriff Joe Arpaio's \"Tent City\" outdoor jail, an event that went awry when Arpaio unexpectedly joined the senator's wife on the tour, further complicated matters.\n\nThe Clinton campaign quickly capitalized on the Arpaio visit, with Illinois Congressman Luis Gutierrez, a leading immigration rights advocate, stating, \"When Jane Sanders visited Joe Arpaio's inhumane detention center, the Sanders campaign had a chance to tell Arpaio to his face that he was wrong and that he needed to resign -- as many of us have said for years.\"\n\nThe Clinton campaign also released a series of ads, including a 60-second spot highlighting Clinton's work on immigration reform and contrasting her record with real estate mogul Donald Trump and Arpaio, who has endorsed Trump.\n\nIn response, the Sanders campaign has been active in its Latino outreach efforts. Sanders has secured endorsements from more than a dozen prominent Latino Democrats in the state and released ads featuring Tucson-based Congressman Raul Grijalva, a leading progressive who represents much of southern Arizona.\n\nThe pattern in Democratic primaries and caucuses so far is that Sanders has had the advantage among younger voters and less diverse electorates, while Clinton has had the upper hand in more diverse electorates and among older voters. Arizona is closer to the latter.\n\n\"She's doing very well with whites over 50, which is most whites,\" Quinlan said, pointing to this as a positive sign for Clinton. \"Frankly, I just think Hillary's organization is stronger, and the fact is I just think she has a built-in demographic advantage.\"\n\nSanders isn't just fighting demographics in Arizona \u2013 he's also fighting against a candidate who is well-known in the state. \"The Clintons have been very popular in Arizona. President Bill Clinton has visited on multiple occasions to campaign on behalf of Democrats over the last two, four cycles,\" said Arizona Democratic Party chairwoman Alexis Tameron.\n\nClinton, who currently leads by 26 percentage points in the only recent polling, has yet to campaign in the state, while Sanders has made stops three times and his campaign has attracted large crowds. Early voting, which in Arizona starts about two weeks before the primary election, may offer some clues as to the eventual outcome.\n\nEarly voting numbers have provided some positive signs for Clinton: According to figures provided by the Arizona Democratic Party, of the 601,049 early ballot requests, 262,547 were returned, with 121,374 from voters 65 and over and another 75,504 from voters between the ages 50-64. Both age groups have been friendly to Clinton in other states.\n\nBy contrast, just 18,842 ballots have been returned from voters between the ages of 25 to 34 and 8,959 from voters between 18 and 24 \u2013 ominous signs for Sanders, who runs best among younger voters.\n\nSanders' chief strategist Tad Devine acknowledged the challenges facing the campaign in Arizona but remained optimistic that Sanders might pull out a victory. \"I think Hillary's ahead. I concede that. I think she had a bump out of Tuesday there as well,\" Devine said. \"There's a lot of early vote and she tends to be very much ahead with the early vote. I think about half the people have already voted in Arizona. So I think she has an advantage. But I think we're closing hard.\"",
    " Title: Republican Presidential Debate Highlights the Rivalry Between Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio\n\nArticle:\n\nThe final Republican presidential debate of 2015 focused on the growing feud between Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida. The two senators, both Cuban-American and first-term, have emerged as the main alternatives to front-runner Donald Trump as the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1 approach.\n\nSenator Cruz, who is surging in the polls, is an anti-GOP-establishment outsider with strong conservative credentials and significant appeal among evangelicals. Senator Rubio, now polling third nationally, represents a kinder, gentler face of Republicanism, with a more collegial relationship with fellow senators and the potential to attract swing voters in the general election.\n\nThe debate, held in Las Vegas, focused on national security and immigration, the dominant themes in the wake of terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California. The battle between Cruz and Rubio did not involve attacks on Trump, as both senators may be attempting to woo his supporters should they cool to his unorthodox campaign persona and style.\n\nThe exchange on NSA phone record surveillance centered on Rubio's criticism of Cruz's vote for the USA Freedom Act, which imposed new limits on the collection of phone metadata by US intelligence agencies. Rubio argued that the legislation could hinder the government's ability to identify potential terrorists before they attack. Cruz defended the legislation as expanding the potential universe of records the government has access to, but did not mention the requirement for a court order to access them.\n\nOn defense spending and approach to the Islamic State, Rubio criticized Cruz for voting against legislation that authorizes defense spending, stating that air forces alone cannot defeat ISIS. Cruz has promised to \"carpet bomb\" ISIS with air strikes and is less enamored of sending US ground troops to Syria and Iraq than is Rubio.\n\nCruz also tried to distance himself from Rubio by associating him with the policies of President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Cruz argued that the focus should be on killing the bad guys, not getting stuck in Middle Eastern civil wars.\n\nImmigration was a fraught issue for Rubio, as it gives some conservatives pause over his candidacy. As a new senator, he co-authored comprehensive immigration reform legislation, only to renounce the bill, which included a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Rubio has sought to paint Cruz as favoring \"legalization\" of the undocumented, over his support for big increases in the caps on green cards and the number of visas for high-tech workers. Cruz has since backed off that position, and in the debate, he fought back, stating that he led the fight against Rubio's \"legalization and amnesty.\"\n\nIn debate post-mortems, both senators were deemed to have had strong performances, and their duel is likely to intensify in the weeks ahead. The Cuban-American background of both senators may be an accident of history, but it matters to a Republican Party anxious to showcase diversity. Whether either candidate could make major inroads into the Hispanic vote is an open question, particularly for Cruz, who does not speak Spanish and who only uses his heritage to highlight his Cuban-born father's journey to freedom in the US. Rubio, on the other hand, is fluent in Spanish and has made his Cuban-immigrant parents' humble lives as service-workers a central part of his optimistic view of the American dream.\n\nIf any of the Republican candidates are capable of channeling Ronald Reagan, whose sunny demeanor helped him to the presidency twice, it may be Rubio. Likability is a key ingredient to presidential campaign success, and if support for Trump begins to wane, one can't assume that his voters go to Cruz. \"Too often [Cruz's] message seems negative,\" says Henry Barbour, Republican national committeeman from Mississippi, speaking before Tuesday's debate. \"The key is to come across as the guy with the positive agenda \u2013 the Ronald Reagan of the group. And everybody wants to be the Ronald Reagan.\"",
    " Title: Brazil's President-elect Jair Bolsonaro's Policies and International Reactions\n\nArticle:\n\nBrazil's president-elect Jair Bolsonaro, often referred to as the \"Trump of the tropics,\" has been met with concern from the Western liberal elite following his election. The UK Spectator notes that Brazilians, tired of years of leftist governance, have chosen military discipline over a corrupt left-wing regime.\n\nBolsonaro's policies have been met with criticism from some media outlets, with coverage focusing on his perceived anti-environmental stance and his diplomatic appointments. For instance, the appointment of Ernesto Araujo, Bolsonaro's choice for foreign minister, has been met with disapproval due to Araujo's views on climate change and the environment.\n\nAraujo, in an article, has been critical of climate change activism, labeling it as a Marxist ideology. He also criticizes the green movement as anti-Christian and a tool used by anti-Western countries to stifle economic growth. This has led to headlines such as \"Brazil's Bolsonaro names Trump fan top diplomat as Cuba relations sour.\"\n\nBolsonaro has also been criticized for his stance on the Paris climate accord, with some media outlets portraying his potential withdrawal as a threat to the environment. However, Bolsonaro has expressed concerns about the accord's potential negative impact on Brazil's agribusiness sector.\n\nThe media has also expressed concern over Bolsonaro's pre-inauguration meetings with John Bolton, the former U.S. National Security Advisor. The meetings have been portrayed as a shift in Brazil's foreign policy, with some outlets suggesting that Bolsonaro is favoring relations with the United States over regional communist nations.\n\nDespite the media's portrayal of Bolsonaro's policies as monstrous or odd, many Brazilians view them as long-overdue common sense. The country's high homicide rate and historical leftist governance have led some to view Bolsonaro's emphasis on beef, bibles, and bullets as a means of addressing the country's unique challenges.\n\nIn contrast, France, under President Macron, has been grappling with environmental issues, with Macron threatening to retaliate against Brazil if it withdraws from the Paris climate accord. Bolsonaro, however, has shown no signs of backing down from his stance on the issue.",
    " Title: Esquire's Cover Story Sparks Controversy During Black History Month\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected move, Esquire magazine debuted a cover story on Tuesday that has sparked controversy, particularly during Black History Month. The March issue features a lengthy profile about 17-year-old Ryan Morgan, a high school senior from West Bend, Wisconsin, under the headline \"An American Boy.\" The subhead reads, \"What it's like to grow up white, middle class, and male in the era of social media, school shootings, toxic masculinity, #MeToo, and a divided country.\"\n\nThe cover choice has been widely criticized on Twitter as tone-deaf. One user, @seanieviola, tweeted, \"Inside Esquire conference room: 'We should probably do a cover story for Black History Month, any suggestions?' 'There's a white boy in Wisconsin who's sad.' Esquire CEO: 'Run it.'\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi's daughter, Christine Pelosi, also voiced her disapproval, writing, \"Esquire: 'Let's use a white teen boy as our foil to lament the rising power of #MeToo and of gun violence prevention advocacy in a cover photo above an inside look at Harvey Weinstein's rape defense for #BlackHistoryMonth.' - @esquire making a series of bad choices.\"\n\nA follower replied, \"Esquire: 'Have you dry heaved this morning? Let us help you.'\"\n\nThe Esquire piece about Morgan chronicles his daily life and the adversity he's faced for being a supporter of President Trump. \"I couldn't say anything without pissing someone off... Lots of drama over politics,\" he told the magazine. \"It ruined friendships and changed social groups. People were making friends based on their politics more than anything.\"\n\nIn a separate story titled \"Why Your Ideological Echo Chamber Isn't Just Bad For You,\" Esquire editor-in-chief Jay Fielden explained that Morgan's cover story is part of a series on growing up in today's society, featuring different demographics. \"What we asked [author Jennifer Percy] to do\u2014and she did brilliantly\u2014was to look at our divided country through the eyes of one kid,\" Fielden said. \"Ryan Morgan is his name.

    " Title: U.S. Imposes Sanctions on China over Uighur Repression; China Threatens Countermeasures\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has imposed sanctions on China over the repression of Uighurs, a Muslim minority in China's Xinjiang region, following the signing of a bill by President Donald Trump on Wednesday. The bill, which passed with only one \"no\" vote in Congress, mandates sanctions against those responsible for the oppression of Uighurs.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that over a million Muslims have been detained in camps in the Xinjiang region. The U.S. State Department has accused Chinese officials of subjecting Muslims to torture, abuse, and attempting to erase their culture and religion.\n\nChina, which denies the mistreatment and claims the camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism, responded to the signing of the law with anger. China's Foreign Ministry stated that the U.S. was \"vilifying\" the human rights situation in Xinjiang and launching a malicious attack against China. China threatened countermeasures, without providing details.\n\nThe U.S. and China are already at odds over various issues, including China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and U.S. support for Chinese-claimed Taiwan. The main exile group, the World Uyghur Congress, thanked Trump for signing the law, stating it \"gave hope to the desperate Uighur people.\"\n\nTrump signed the bill as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held his first face-to-face meeting since last year with China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi. Trump issued a signing statement, stating that some of the bill's requirements might limit his constitutional authority to conduct diplomacy, regarding them as advisory, not mandatory.\n\nThe signing came as newspapers published excerpts from the new book by former national security adviser John Bolton. Among other allegations, Bolton claims that Trump sought Chinese President Xi Jinping's help to win re-election during a closed-door 2019 meeting and that Trump approved of the construction of the camps in Xinjiang.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Uighur law for the first time calls for sanctions on a member of China's powerful Politburo, Xinjiang's Communist Party secretary, Chen Quanguo, as responsible for \"gross human rights violations.\" It also calls on U.S. companies operating in Xinjiang to take steps to ensure they do not use parts made with forced labor.",
    " Title: House Budget Plans Reveal Divergent Visions for the Future\n\nArticle:\n\nThis week, two contrasting budget plans were unveiled by conservative House Republicans, led by Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, and the House Progressive Caucus, led by Reps. Raul Grijalva and Keith Ellison. The plans offer a glimpse into two distinct visions for the nation's future.\n\nThe Republican budget, outlined in a 91-page document, aims to balance the federal budget within a decade. The plan involves tax reform, which lowers rates for individuals and corporations, including high-income earners, while eliminating deductions and credits. National defense is fully funded, but Medicare is essentially voucherized for individuals turning 55 now, with the program surviving through cost containment measures. The plan also includes the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as \"Obamacare,\" and tort reform to reduce frivolous lawsuits.\n\nThe House Progressive Caucus' 19-page blueprint, on the other hand, reduces the deficit but does not eliminate it. The plan involves raising taxes and investing in infrastructure, education, and public welfare programs. The Bush tax cuts would expire for those earning over $250,000, and tax rates for millionaires and billionaires would increase. The plan also includes a public-option health system, expanded unemployment benefits, and increased funding for infrastructure, Medicaid, and state law enforcement.\n\nBoth budgets represent extreme positions, and their full implementation is unlikely due to the political makeup of Congress. The prospects for cap-and-trade, voucherizing Medicare, the public option, and repealing the Affordable Care Act are all uncertain. These two documents serve as a reminder of the deep partisan divide in the House, with Republicans being fiscally conservative and the House Progressive Caucus being liberal in their spending priorities.\n\nOver the next 10 years, a compromise between the two parties is expected, representing a middle ground between the two visions. The budget plans illustrate the significant differences between liberals and conservatives in their views of the future and the challenges they face in finding common ground.",
    " Title: Democratic Candidates Adopt Republican-Style Campaign Tactics in 2014 Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2014 midterm elections, several Democratic candidates are adopting campaign strategies that traditionally align with the Republican Party, particularly in districts that were favorable to President Barack Obama in previous elections. This shift in strategy is a response to the challenging political environment, characterized by Obama's rising unpopularity and the tendency for conservatives to have higher voter turnout in midterm years.\n\nIn a competitive district that Obama won in 2012 and 2008, Colorado Democrat Andrew Romanoff has launched a campaign ad that emphasizes his record in balancing the state's budget. The ad, which carries a tea party theme, features Romanoff stating, \"It's really pretty simple. You don't buy things you can't pay for.\"\n\nNew Hampshire Rep. Ann McLane Kuster, whose district favored Obama by a significant margin in 2012, is running an ad that highlights her support for small-business tax cuts and shows her touring a local microbrewery. Separately, former Iowa state Sen. Staci Appel, who won her district by 4 percentage points two years ago, emphasizes her record of fighting overspending in state government, a theme often heard from tea party-aligned conservatives.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ron Barber, in a swing district in southern Arizona, has highlighted his support for increasing border security funds in his first TV spot. The ad, which includes an image of a border patrol car, does not mention elements of immigration reform that are typically more popular among Democratic voters.\n\nIn deep-red districts, Democratic candidates are adopting multiple conservative themes. For instance, North Little Rock Mayor Patrick Henry Hays, who is running in an Arkansas district that Mitt Romney won in 2012, discusses the need for a balanced budget, limited government regulations, and less wasteful spending in his first TV ad. Like Romanoff, Hays includes a graphic to depict the national debt.\n\nThese campaign ads, similar to those aired by Romanoff, Kuster, Appel, and Barber, do not mention the candidates' Democratic Party affiliation. The strategy adopted by these candidates is a reflection of the need to appeal to more conservative voters in the upcoming 2014 midterm elections.\n\n\"It's a different kind of electorate,\" said Ben Tulchin, a San Francisco-based Democratic pollster. \"If you're running in a competitive district as a Democrat in a nonpresidential year, you want to strike a more moderate tone.\"",
    " Title: Obama Clarifies Economic Remark, Acknowledges Weak Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama, during a press conference on Friday, found himself in a swift retreat after his comment that \"the private sector is doing fine\" became a focal point for criticism from Mitt Romney and congressional Republicans. The statement contradicted the consensus of economists who view the current recovery as the weakest in modern American history.\n\nObama's original comment was intended to highlight private-sector job growth outpacing public payrolls, but it was quickly seized upon by his opponents as evidence of his alleged disconnect from the state of the economy.\n\nWithin hours, Obama clarified his statement, acknowledging that \"it is absolutely clear the economy is not doing fine.\" He made these remarks during a photo spray in the Oval Office for his meeting with the president of the Philippines.\n\nThe ensuing controversy provided a counterpoint to Mitt Romney's own economic gaffe, his off-key declaration that \"corporations are people.\" Despite this, Republicans did not hesitate to capitalize on the situation.\n\nMitt Romney, speaking at a midday rally in Iowa, stated, \"For the president of the United States to stand up and say the private sector is doing fine is going to go down in history as an extraordinary miscalculation and misunderstanding by a president who\u2019s out of touch.\"\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) also weighed in, expressing their disagreement with Obama's initial statement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) went so far as to say, \"The president must be on another planet.\"\n\nIn his afternoon remarks, Obama decried the \"political games\" that had amplified his morning comments into controversy. He reiterated his awareness of the economy's weakness, stating, \"The economy is not doing fine. There are too many people out of work. The housing market is still weak, too many homes underwater and that\u2019s precisely why I asked Congress to start taking some steps that can make a difference.\"\n\nInitially, Obama's appearance in the White House briefing room was intended to offer assurances that he was working to address Europe's economic troubles while still pushing for growth at home. He also used the opportunity to denounce rumors of leaks of key national security information as \"offensive.\"",
    " Title: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington Speech: A Symphony of Biblical Rhythms and Historical Allusions\n\nArticle:\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr., the son, grandson, and great-grandson of Baptist ministers, was adept at blending the oral tradition of the black church with the cadences of the King James Bible. His speeches, including the iconic \"Dream\" speech delivered at the March on Washington, were a fusion of his own words, those of others, and biblical passages.\n\nIn the \"Dream\" speech, Dr. King referenced a passage from Galatians when he spoke of a future where \"all of God's children\u2014black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics\u2014will be able to join hands.\" He also drew parallels between the African-American struggle and the Israelites' journey from Egypt to the Promised Land, as depicted in the book of Exodus.\n\nThe March on Washington speech was replete with biblical rhythms and historical allusions, resonating with listeners through references to the prophets Isaiah and Amos, the Declaration of Independence, Shakespeare, and popular songs like Woody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land.\" These references added depth and layers of meaning to the speech, much like the myriad allusions in T. S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land.\"\n\nDr. King, who held a doctorate in theology and had contemplated an academic career, was influenced by his childhood in his father's church and his later studies of thinkers like Reinhold Niebuhr, Gandhi, and Hegel. He developed a gift for synthesizing diverse ideas and making them his own, enabling him to address multiple audiences simultaneously while making radical ideas familiar and accessible.\n\nIn addition to his ability to unite disparate factions within the civil rights movement, Dr. King was also adept at nestling his arguments within a historical continuum, lending them the authority of tradition and the weight of association. For some in his audience, the articulation of his dream for America would have evoked memories of Langston Hughes' call in a 1935 poem to \"let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed\" and W.E.B. Du Bois' description of the \"wonderful America, which the founding fathers dreamed.\" His final lines in the March on Washington speech were a reference to a Negro spiritual, reminding listeners of slaves' sustaining faith in the possibility of liberation: \"Free at last, free at last; thank God Almighty, we are free at last.\"",
    " Title: Congress Aims to Finalize Spending Bill by Tuesday, Avoiding Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the deadline for government funding approaches, House Speaker Paul Ryan expressed hope that negotiators will finalize an agreement for the $1.3 trillion spending bill by Tuesday. Ryan stated that congressional leaders are not yet discussing a continuing resolution as a backup plan.\n\n\"There are some unresolved issues. We're working through them as we speak, and we're hoping to post it today,\" Ryan, R-Wis., said.\n\nAppropriators are working tirelessly to complete the spending bill, with one top GOP aide close to the negotiations reporting that they worked past 1 a.m. on Tuesday before taking a break and resuming at 7:30 a.m. The agreement requires bipartisan agreement from the White House and all four corners of Congress\u2014Senate and House Democrats as well as Senate and House Republicans.\n\nA top Democratic aide reported that there are approximately 20 riders still in play and at least a dozen other major issues under discussion during the negotiations. \"This process just takes time,\" the aide added.\n\nRyan signaled that Republicans may attach the Fix NICs gun purchase background checks bill to the spending package, a move that could help build bipartisan consensus around the package. \"That's something we're discussing with our colleagues. I think we should do Fix NICS. I agree with Fix NICS. That's something we're discussing with our friends on the other side of the aisle,\" Ryan said.\n\nRep. Dan Donovan, a New York Republican, is hoping to attach the Gateway Tunnel project to the spending bill. Donovan believes President Trump could be backing off his veto threat if the omnibus helps fund the project.\n\n\"This is important. It's important to the nation. It'd be an economic stimulus,\" Donovan said. \"Certainly after Hurricane Sandy, our two tunnels were deteriorating because of the storm, and building two new ones and retrofitting those two old ones will be an incredible boom to the country.\"\n\nRep. Dave Brat, a Virginia Republican and member of the Freedom Caucus, has announced he will vote no due to the $1.3 trillion price tag. \"I'm not happy with the product that's going to be there in four days, but we can get there. That's the problem is we're going to get there,\" Brat said. \"I'm a no on just the spending piece alone.\"\n\nWith government funding set to lapse at the end of the day on Friday, time is running out for Donovan and the rest of Congress. \"We have to keep our government open. Nobody sent us to Washington to shut their government down. They sent us to make it work better for them,\" Donovan said.",
    " Title: Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe Admits to Misleading Investigators About Media Leak\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a revelation from transcripts released by the Justice Department's inspector general on Thursday, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe admitted to misleading investigators about his role in a media leak. The transcripts were made public in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nAccording to the transcripts, an unidentified FBI investigator expressed frustration over the time spent investigating the leak, only to discover that the leak originated from McCabe himself. McCabe had repeatedly denied being the source of the leak, but later confessed and apologized when confronted by the investigator.\n\nAn FBI agent recounted the conversation, stating, \"I remember saying to him, 'Sir, you understand that we've put a lot of work into this based on what you told us.' I mean, and I even said, long nights and weekends working on this trying to find out who amongst your ranks of trusted people would, would do something like that. And [McCabe] kind of just looked down, kind of nodded and said, 'Yeah, I'm sorry.'\"\n\nLast year, Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz concluded that McCabe \"lacked candor\" with investigators probing a leak to The Wall Street Journal that revealed the FBI was investigating Hillary Clinton's emails and the Clinton Foundation. The Justice Department fired McCabe in the spring of 2018, citing Horowitz's conclusions. McCabe is currently suing the Justice Department for wrongful termination, alleging President Trump ordered his firing.\n\nWhen confronted by FBI investigators about the leak, McCabe denied authorizing the disclosure to The Wall Street Journal. He also presented himself as a \"victim,\" according to the agent who conducted the interview. After receiving \"conflicting information\" on whether he ordered the leak, McCabe confessed in a follow-up interview, the transcripts said.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney in D.C. is currently considering criminal charges against McCabe based on Horowitz's conclusions. His attorneys have denied any wrongdoing. McCabe has stated he would refuse a plea deal.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Sends Oregon Bakery Discrimination Case Back to Lower Court\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court has sent back a case involving an Oregon bakery that claims it was driven out of business due to state fines for refusing to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian couple based on religious beliefs. The top court scrapped a ruling from the Oregon Court of Appeals in favor of the same-sex couple.\n\nIn an order, the Supreme Court asked the appeals court to reconsider the case in light of a top court holding from last year, the Masterpiece Cakeshop case. In that case, the court ruled 7-2 in favor of a baker who refused to serve a same-sex couple, stating that the state of Colorado was impermissibly hostile to the baker's religious beliefs.\n\nThe court in the Masterpiece case did not decide on the underlying question of whether a wedding cake qualifies as the type of artistic expression that is entitled to the Constitution's most stringent protections under the First Amendment. By sending the case back to the lower court, the justices handed an incremental win to the owners of the bakery while avoiding hearing the divisive case in the midst of the 2020 election campaign.\n\nThe court's term beginning in October is already expected to be significant for LGBT rights. In April, the court agreed to hear a set of cases that could settle whether federal antidiscrimination laws apply to LGBT employees. An opinion in the case is expected by June 2020, just months before Americans go to the polls in the next presidential election.\n\nThe court has now effectively punted twice in two years on the issue of whether a bakery may refuse service to a same-sex couple. In the Masterpiece case, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has since retired and has been replaced by Brett Kavanaugh, emphasized the difficulty of deciding the issue. He wrote that a baker's religious rights \"might\" be violated by antidiscrimination laws, but noted the difficulty of pinpointing the moment when a customer's right to not be discriminated against could give way to the business owner's own First Amendment rights.\n\nJustice Kennedy also provided examples of situations that seem all but endless, such as a baker's refusal to attend a wedding to ensure that the cake is cut the right way, or a refusal to put certain religious words or decorations on the cake, or even a refusal to sell a cake that has been baked for the public generally but includes certain religious words or symbols on it. Ultimately, Kennedy predicted the issue would be addressed in \"some future controversy involving facts similar to these.\"",
    " Title: Shale Gas Replacement of Coal and Its Implications for Climate Change\n\nArticle:\n\nThe shift from coal to shale gas as a source of electricity has been noted due to the former's lower carbon dioxide emissions. According to oil economist Philip Verleger Jr., this transition will lead to an increase in oil and gas production at lower prices, benefiting American consumers, manufacturers, and jobs. However, Verleger also warns that as hydrocarbon prices decrease, it may become increasingly challenging to promote renewable energy programs. Additionally, improper extraction methods could potentially release large quantities of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere.\n\nIn the context of the Keystone pipeline approval, environmentalists are urged to advocate for policies that discourage the use of carbon-intensive fuels and promote low-carbon energy. A carbon tax is suggested as a means to achieve this, as it would not only clean the air, drive clean-tech innovation, weaken petro-dictators, and reduce the deficit but also be part of the budget debate.\n\nPresidential authority under the Clean Air Act can be utilized to order reductions in CO2 emissions from existing coal power plants and refiners by up to 25 percent. The president could then negotiate with power companies to achieve these reductions in different regions of the country.\n\nThe president is also encouraged to uphold his commitment to halve energy waste in homes and businesses over the next 20 years, as approximately 30 percent of energy in buildings is wasted.\n\nLastly, the concept of \"natural infrastructure\" has been proposed by Mark Tercek, the president and CEO of The Nature Conservancy. This concept emphasizes the role of forests, wetlands, and other ecosystems in controlling floods, supplying water, and adapting to climate change. Investment in natural infrastructure, such as restoring dunes and wetlands, can provide storm protection and wildlife habitat, as demonstrated by Cape May, New Jersey, which was spared significant damage during Hurricane Sandy due to its pre-restoration efforts. The president is urged to emphasize natural infrastructure investment, expanding federal programs like the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Farm Bill to make communities more resilient, and incentivizing private investment through changes in the tax code and other federal rules.",
    " Title: Obama Defends NSA Data Collection as Modest Encroachment on Privacy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a hastily arranged news conference in San Jose, California on Friday, President Barack Obama defended his administration's massive seizure of private citizens' phone records, emails, and Internet activities, describing them as \"modest encroachments on privacy\" necessary for the war on terrorism.\n\nThe president stated, \"Nobody is listening to your telephone calls. They're not looking at peoples' names and they're not looking at content. We have established a process and a procedure that the American people should feel comfortable about.\"\n\nThe controversy arose Wednesday night when it was revealed that the National Security Agency (NSA), at the request of the FBI, was routinely collecting the phone records of millions of Verizon customers in the U.S. On Thursday, the government acknowledged that the NSA is also gathering Internet users' personal data, such as emails, photos, and online chats in real-time, from the computer servers of at least nine large web service providers under a top-secret program called \"Prism.\"\n\nThe revelations have sparked a wave of protest among privacy advocates and in Congress, where many lawmakers expressed surprise about the scope of the programs. Mr. Obama stated that lawmakers are \"fully briefed\" on the programs periodically.\n\nRegarding the surveillance of web data and emails, Mr. Obama insisted, \"This does not apply to U.S. citizens, and it does not apply to people living in the United States.\"\n\nWhile Mr. Obama sought to reassure the public that government agents aren't targeting individuals without probable cause, he also acknowledged the possibility that he himself might be on such a \"list\" after he leaves office.\n\n\"I will leave this office at some point, sometime in the next three and a half years,\" Mr. Obama said. \"After that I will be a private citizen. And I suspect that, on a list of people who might be targeted so that somebody could read their emails, or listen to their phone calls, I'd probably be pretty high on that list. So it's not as though I don't have a personal interest in making sure my privacy is protected.\"\n\nMr. Obama emphasized the need to balance national security interests with the protections of individual freedom guaranteed in the Constitution. \"I came in with a healthy skepticism about these programs,\" he said. \"My team evaluated them. My assessment, and my team's assessment, was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks.\"\n\nThe president stated that there is a system of checks and balances in place among federal judges, Congress, and the executive branch to ensure the surveillance programs are not abused. \"We've got congressional oversight and judicial oversight,\" he said. \"If people can't trust not only the executive branch but also don't trust Congress and don't trust federal judges to make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution and due process and rule of law, then we're going to have some problems here.\"\n\nHe concluded by stating, \"The government employees involved in America's national security 'take this work very seriously.' They cherish our Constitution. They operate like professionals. The last thing they'd be doing is taking programs like this to listen to somebody's phone calls.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Community Agencies Believe COVID-19 Originated in Wuhan Laboratory as an Accidental Leak\n\nArticle:\n\nThe majority of the U.S. intelligence community agencies have reportedly concluded that the COVID-19 virus is natural and accidentally leaked out of a laboratory in Wuhan, China, according to a senior intelligence official speaking to \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation. While not all of the 17 agencies that make up the Intelligence Community (IC) are fully behind this theory, most believe it to be the case. The holdouts are still open to the possibility that the virus leaked from a laboratory.\n\nThe IC's unanimous view is that the virus was not the result of an intentional act, the senior official noted. This account confirms what Fox News White House reporter John Roberts reported on Saturday, and aligns with what President Donald Trump has said publicly.\n\nRoberts cited a senior intelligence official in reporting that \"there is agreement among most of the 17 Intelligence agencies that COVID-19 originated in the Wuhan lab. The source stressed that the release is believed to be a mistake, and was not intentional.\"\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence confirmed in a statement on Thursday that the IC is \"rigorously\" investigating whether the virus was a result of a lab leak, while making clear that COVID-19 is not believed to be \"manmade or genetically modified.\"\n\nDuring a press conference on Thursday, Trump stated that he has seen information that indicates with a high degree of confidence that the virus originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. When asked by Roberts if he had seen anything that gave him a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of the virus, Trump answered, \"Yes, I have.\" Trump also criticized the World Health Organization for being \"like the public relations agency for China.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Showcases Families Benefiting from Health Care Law, Criticizes Repeal Attempts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a display at the White House, President Barack Obama highlighted families who have received rebate checks from their insurance companies due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The president criticized Republican lawmakers who are attempting to repeal the program.\n\n\"I recognize that there's still a lot of folks in this town at least who are rooting for this law to fail,\" Mr. Obama said. \"Some of them seem to think this law is about me. It's not\u2014I already have really good health care.\"\n\nThe president mocked Republican lawmakers for their repeated votes to repeal parts or all of the 2010 ACA, stating, \"Sometimes I just try to figure out why.\" He suggested that they might be engaging in political maneuvers.\n\nThe president was joined by families who have benefited from the ACA provision that provides consumers with a refund if their insurance company doesn't spend a set percentage of premium dollars on medical care and improving health care quality, rather than administrative costs or overhead.\n\nMorgan Theriot, a self-employed woman from Silver Spring, MD, was introduced by the president. She received a $267 refund check from her insurance company last summer after it didn't meet the requirement to spend at least 80 percent of her premium dollars on her health care.\n\n\"I'm curious\u2014what do opponents of this law think that folks here today should do with the money they were reimbursed?\" Mr. Obama asked. \"Should they send it back to the insurance companies? Do they think that was a bad idea, to make sure that insurance companies are being held accountable?\"\n\nHowever, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, countered that the president isn't telling Americans the full story.\n\n\"What he won't say is that next year, Obamacare will impose a new sales tax on the purchase of health insurance that will cost Americans about $8 billion,\" Mr. McConnell said Thursday. \"If the administration is concerned with saving people money on their health care, I have some advice for them. Work with us to repeal Obamacare and start over.\"\n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, reaffirmed the GOP's commitment to repealing the law.\n\n\"The picture that the president paints of his health care law looks nothing like the reality facing struggling American families,\" Mr. Boehner said. \"The law is costing American jobs; it's forcing people to give up health plans they like; and it's driving up the cost of care for families across America. In my home state, many Ohioans will pay nearly $200 more a month, on average, for individual plans. This law has to go.\"\n\nFor the law to work as its supporters envision, more young and healthy people need to sign up for insurance under the various health exchanges being set up in states. The audience at the White House included community groups who will be working at the grassroots level across the country to help enroll Americans in the new health insurance marketplaces this fall.\n\nThe president's pitch came a day after the House voted to delay mandates in the federal health care law requiring individuals and large employers to have coverage. Thirty-five Democrats joined with House Republicans to give large businesses a one-year reprieve on the requirement to provide health insurance for full-time employees, helping pass that provision on a 264-161 vote. The House also voted 251-174 to give individuals the same one-year break, with 22 Democratic lawmakers joining Republicans. The measures are certain to go nowhere in the Democrat-controlled Senate.\n\nThe president chuckled at Republican lawmakers for repeatedly voting to repeal provisions of the law.\n\n\"Yesterday, despite all the evidence that the law is working the way it was supposed to for middle-class Americans, Republicans in the House of Representatives voted for nearly the 40th time to dismantle it,\" he said. \"We've got a lot of problems in this country, and there's a lot of work that Congress needs to do.\"\n\nMr. Obama pointed out that individuals buying insurance on the state-based health care exchange in 2014 will see their premiums drop by an average of 50 percent compared with last year's direct-pay individual rates in New York.\n\nThe administration announced in July that it was postponing for one year, until 2015, the law's requirement for employers with more than 50 workers to provide health insurance for all full-time employees. Sharon Stiller, an employment law specialist at the New York firm of Abrams, Fensterman, said many of her employer-clients expect the law's definition of \"part-time\" employee to be changed. Currently, the law defines a part-timer as any employee who works less than 30 hours per week.\n\n\"The word on the street is that there may be some changes with respect to the definition of 'part-time,'\" Ms. Stiller said. \"It's harder for employers to decide to do the necessary planning because they're not sure exactly what the final criterion will be.\"\n\nProgressive allies of the president launched a TV ad campaign timed to coincide with the president's message. Americans United for Change went on the air with a new TV ad, \"Hands Off Obamacare,\" attempting to put the GOP on the defensive for trying to strip away provisions of the health law.\n\n\"Republicans want to take your benefits away and put insurance companies back in charge,\" says the announcer in the ad. \"Obamacare is working. Tell Republicans\u2014hands off Obamacare.\"",
    " Title: Heritage Action's \"Key Vote\" on Obamacare Repeal Bill Complicates Republican Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nHeritage Action, the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation, has announced a \"key vote\" on a bill the House is set to consider, which aims to repeal several components of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The bill, H.R. 3762, does not fully repeal Obamacare, including its major spending provisions such as the expansion of Medicaid and subsidies for individuals to purchase insurance on the exchanges.\n\nThe move by Heritage Action could complicate the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, as it puts pressure on conservatives to vote against a bill they had otherwise been enthusiastic about. By using the budget reconciliation process, Republicans can pass the bill with a simple majority in the Senate, but only provisions tied to spending can be included in the measure.\n\nPolicy experts agree that using budget reconciliation rules to repeal Obamacare is Republicans' best chance to put a repeal bill on President Obama's desk, even though the president is virtually guaranteed to veto it. The bill repeals the individual and employer mandates, several taxes, and an independent panel to cut Medicare costs, among other components. It also defunds the bulk of Planned Parenthood's taxpayer subsidies, redirecting those dollars to women's health centers that are not scandal-tainted abortion factories.\n\nThe bill is a net tax cut, a net spending cut, and a net cut in the deficit and debt. It causes heartburn in the other team and will force President Obama to double down on the most unpopular parts of his healthcare law. The organization laid out its reasoning in an online post earlier this week.\n\nHowever, some important context is that in order to use the \"reconciliation\" budgetary tool to roll back much of Obamacare, the maneuver must result in a net reduction of the deficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office's math. The only provisions of Obamacare that are eligible for repeal through this process are the ones directly pertaining to fiscal and budgetary issues. A House Ways and Means Committee spokesman told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the legislation that is slated to be voted on this week, and against which Heritage Action is lobbying, represents \"the best way to repeal the worst parts of the law.\" The constraints of reconciliation prohibit a repeal of the entire law.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Court Latino Voters as Immigration Policy Takes Center Stage\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2012 presidential election, both President Barack Obama and presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney are addressing the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) this week. Obama will speak on Friday, while Romney will address the group on Thursday.\n\nThe appearances come a week after President Obama announced a new policy allowing some undocumented young people to remain in the U.S. Romney has not denounced the move, and both candidates view garnering Latino votes as crucial to their electoral success.\n\nMatt Barreto, of political opinion research group Latino Decisions, has conducted a new survey. According to Barreto, Obama's move on immigration policy has resulted in a significant shift in Latino voter enthusiasm. \"Obama went from a 19-point deficit on an enthusiasm measure to a plus-35,\" Barreto said, referring to a 50-point turnaround in just one announcement.\n\nRomney's stance on the issue remains unclear, and he has repeatedly refused to say whether he would continue President Obama's policy. During a conference call on the economy, the Romney campaign shut down the discussion after receiving three questions about immigration.\n\nThe immigration issue has become a significant wedge issue for Romney, as the president's policy is popular with independent voters and Hispanics, but unpopular with many Republican base voters who view it as a form of amnesty. During the primaries, Romney himself condemned a similar policy known as the DREAM Act.\n\nIn an election that may be decided by base voter turnout, Romney cannot afford to alienate anti-amnesty conservatives while still needing Hispanic votes. \"Of all the 10 or 12 states that are theoretically in play, all of them have enough of a Hispanic population\u2014for the most part\u2014that could make a difference in a very close election,\" said Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.\n\nIn 2008, Obama won two-thirds of the Latino vote. Polls show he is still getting the same share of that vote, but with his support among white voters declining, he will need to register more Latinos and get them to the polls. That will be a challenge, as Latino registration has declined since 2008.\n\nHowever, the president's decision to suspend certain deportations gives him something to campaign on, according to Barreto. \"There's something he can go out and campaign on. It's not just promises or 'I'll do this next time.' He actually has done something,\" Barreto said. \"And if there's a clear contrast there, with the other candidate saying, 'I don't know how I think about that,' that's a clear decision for Latinos. This is an important personal symbolic issue.\"\n\nSen. Rubio does not agree that immigration policy is the key to the Hispanic vote. \"This idea that Hispanics, all they think about is immigration 24 hours a day, seven days a week, is just not true,\" he said. \"They're like everybody else in the country.\"\n\nEd Gillespie, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign, believes there is a way for Republicans to improve on the 31 percent of the Hispanic vote Sen. John McCain of Arizona received in 2008. \"I believe a pro-legal immigration message, a pro-economic growth, a pro-job creation message, a pro-education reform message will be very resonant with Americans of Hispanic descent,\" Gillespie said. \"I believe as a result of that, we're going to see Gov. Romney's share of the Latino vote rise from the baseline of Sen. McCain's share.\"\n\nWhen Romney attends NALEO's political convention in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday, he will have an opportunity to make his case to the Hispanic community.",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader Rejects Trump's Proposal for Simultaneous ObamaCare Repeal and Replace\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has rejected President Trump's suggestion for the Senate to pass its ObamaCare overhaul measure by first repealing the 2010 health care law and then replacing it later. McConnell, the leader of the GOP-controlled Senate, stated on Friday night that the bill, which includes significant and complex changes to ObamaCare, remains challenging, but \"we are going to stick with that path.\"\n\nTrump's suggestion, made in a tweet earlier in the day, revives an approach that GOP leaders and the president himself considered but dismissed months ago as impractical and politically unwise. The Senate introduced its bill about two weeks ago but left Washington for the July 4 recess without enough support from the chamber's 52 GOP senators to pass the measure. McConnell will need support from at least 50 of them because the bill has no support among Senate Democrats.\n\nThe president's tweet followed a suggestion made by Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse on Fox & Friends, in which he proposed a vote on repealing former President Barack Obama's health law followed by a new effort at working out a replacement. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., also claimed credit for recommending the tactic to the president in a conversation earlier in the week.\n\nTrump's suggestion has the potential to harden divisions within the GOP as conservatives like Paul and Sasse complain that McConnell's bill does not go far enough in repealing former President Barack Obama's health care law, while moderates criticize it as overly harsh in kicking people off insurance rolls, shrinking the Medicaid safety net, and increasing premiums for older Americans.\n\nMcConnell has been trying to strike deals with members of both factions in order to finalize a rewritten bill that lawmakers can vote on when they return to the Capitol the second week of July. Even before Trump was inaugurated in January, Republicans had debated and ultimately discarded the idea of repealing the overhaul before replacing it, concluding that both must happen simultaneously. Doing otherwise would invite accusations that Republicans were simply tossing people off coverage and would roil insurance markets by raising the question of whether, when, and how Congress might replace Obama's law once it was gone.\n\nThe idea also would leave unresolved the quandary lawmakers are struggling with now, about how to replace Obama's system of online insurance markets, tax subsidies, and an expanded Medicaid with something that could get enough Republican votes to pass Congress. House Republicans barely passed their version of a replacement bill in May, and the task is proving even tougher in the Senate, where McConnell has almost no margin for error.\n\nModerates were spooked as the week began with a Congressional Budget Office finding that McConnell's draft bill would result in 22 million people losing insurance over the next decade, only 1 million fewer than under the House-passed legislation, which Trump privately told senators was \"mean.\" However, conservatives continue to insist that the bill must go further than just repealing some of the mandates and taxes in Obama's law.\n\nUnderscoring the fissures within the GOP, conservative group leaders on that call welcomed Trump's suggestion but said it did not go far enough because it could open the door to a subsequent bipartisan compromise to replace Obama's law. At the same time, a key House Republican, Rep. Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, rejected Trump's suggestion, contending that it \"does not achieve what President Trump set out to do.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Previews State of the Union Address, Blames Washington Decisions for Economic Contraction\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his weekly radio and Internet address, President Barack Obama, in what is likely a preview of his upcoming State of the Union address on February 12, attributed the recent disappointing economic news, including the unexpected contraction of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2012, to \"bad decisions in Washington.\"\n\nThe president defended the overall economy and cautioned against excessive focus on cutting government spending, stating that such measures could hinder recovery and potentially lead to job losses.\n\n\"We all agree that it's critical to cut unnecessary spending,\" Obama said. \"But we can't just cut our way to prosperity. It hasn't worked in the past, and it won't work today. It could slow down our recovery. It could weaken our economy. And it could cost us jobs\u2014now, and in the future.\"\n\nThe president proposed a balanced approach to economic policy, advocating for spending cuts where possible, while also advocating for investments in areas such as education, infrastructure, research, and development. He argued that these investments are essential for America's competitiveness in the global economy.\n\nThe president's remarks come in response to Wednesday's news that the American economy contracted by 0.1% in the last quarter of 2012. This contraction has been increasingly attributed to the Republican Party's \"austerity politics\" by Democrats.\n\nRepublicans have emphasized reining in government spending since their party took control of the House in 2010, arguing that government bailouts, stimulus projects, and higher taxes are detrimental to the economy.\n\nDemocrats counter that the economy would have been worse without government spending, and they advocate for continued stimulus measures. In his Saturday remarks, Mr. Obama defended the overall health of the economy.\n\n\"We began this year with economists and business leaders saying that we are poised to grow in 2013,\" he said. \"And there are real signs of progress: Home prices are starting to climb again. Car sales are at a five-year high. Manufacturing is roaring back. Our businesses created 2.2 million jobs last year. And we just learned that our economy created more jobs over the last few months than economists originally thought.\"\n\nHowever, the president also acknowledged the recent economic contraction, stating, \"This week, we also received the first estimate of America's economic growth over the last few months. And it reminded us that bad decisions in Washington can get in the way of our economic progress.\"\n\nThe president predicted that 2013 would be a year of \"solid growth,\" if Washington could avoid \"self-inflicted wounds.\"",
    " Title: \"Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare's Individual Mandate: A Look at the Origination Clause and the Affordable Care Act\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, often referred to as \"Obamacare,\" has been a subject of intense debate since its inception. One of its contentious features, the individual mandate, is set to take effect in 2014. This mandate, which requires nearly everyone who is not covered by an employer to buy health insurance or face a penalty, was labeled a \"tax\" by the Supreme Court in its decision on Obamacare last June. However, the Obama administration never argued that the individual mandate is an exercise of Congress' taxing authority.\n\nThe individual mandate's classification as a \"tax\" has sparked new debates about semantics and created a potential constitutional issue. Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution states that \"all bills for raising revenue\" must originate in the House of Representatives. This \"Origination Clause\" was designed to keep the taxing power close to voters and entrust it to members of the House, who are elected every two years and have smaller constituencies than senators.\n\nHowever, Obamacare did not follow this constitutional script. Instead of originating in the lower chamber, it started in the Senate when Majority Leader Harry Reid took an old bill the House had passed that would have given veterans tax credits to buy homes, struck out all of that bill's language, and inserted instead the confusing web of provisions that became the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThis question is now before U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington, D.C., in a challenge to Obamacare filed on behalf of Matt Sissel, an Iowa small business owner who was decorated for service as a medic in the Iraq war.\n\nObamacare was passed hastily, by lawmakers who admitted they had not read the bill. The legislation was passed during the holiday season, through questionable procedural tricks. It was never popular, and a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that only 36 percent of Americans currently support the law. Even the Supreme Court's liberal wing agreed that large parts of it were unconstitutional.\n\nThe Constitution's procedural guidelines might seem like dry formalities, but such procedures were designed to safeguard the rights of the American people. If last June's Supreme Court decision is not to become a precedent for Congress to impose any variety of mandates on Americans under the taxing power, courts should take care to enforce democratic controls over that power.\n\nTimothy Sandefur, a principal attorney with Pacific Legal Foundation, a public-interest legal organization that litigates for limited government, individual rights, and free enterprise, represents small business owner Matt Sissel in challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate \"tax.\"",
    " Title: Nike Announces Colin Kaepernick as Face of 30th Anniversary \"Just Do It\" Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been unveiled as one of the faces in Nike's \"Just Do It\" 30th anniversary campaign. In 2016, Kaepernick, who is known for his activism, refused to stand for the national anthem in protest of police violence against African-Americans. This action sparked a divisive response, with some players following suit and others, including U.S. President Donald Trump, expressing criticism.\n\nKaepernick has not played in the National Football League (NFL) since last year and is currently suing the organization, arguing that team owners deliberately froze him out because of his activism. The Nike advertisements feature Kaepernick with the slogan, \"Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.\"\n\nOther sports stars, including fellow NFL players Odell Beckham Jr and Shaquem Griffin, are also part of the 30th anniversary \"Just Doit\" campaign. On Monday, Kaepernick posted the advert and the slogan on his Twitter account.\n\nGino Fisanotti, Nike's vice president of branding for North America, was quoted by cable sports network ESPN as saying, \"We believe Colin is one of the most inspirational athletes of this generation, who has leveraged the power of sport to help move the world forward.\"\n\nTennis great Serena Williams, another star of the Nike campaign, expressed her support. However, some on social media have used the #BoycottNike and #JustBurnIt hashtags, a play on the company's slogan. Country star John Rich posted a photo of a pair of socks with the Nike emblem cut off.\n\nKaepernick, 30, remained on a contract with Nike throughout the kneeling controversy, but it has now been renegotiated to make him part of the anniversary campaign. In May this year, the NFL announced that teams whose players who knelt for the national anthem would be fined under a new policy. The league said players not willing to stand for The Star-Spangled Banner could stay in the changing rooms until it had been performed. However, the new policy is yet to be imposed as negotiations between the league and the players' union are ongoing.",
    " Title: First Lady Melania Trump and Greta Thunberg: A Comparative Analysis of Public Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has refuted allegations of hypocrisy leveled against First Lady Melania Trump for criticizing attacks on her son Barron Trump, while not publicly condemning her husband's criticism of 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham stated on Friday that Barron and Thunberg are in different categories, with the latter being a global climate activist who delivers speeches.\n\nThe statement from Grisham followed President Trump's tweet on Thursday, criticizing TIME Magazine's decision to name Thunberg as their \"Person of the Year.\" Trump's tweet read, \"So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!\"\n\nThe criticism of Melania Trump escalated after her husband's attack, as some perceived the first lady's defense of her son, who was mentioned by Stanford University law professor Pamela Karlan during a House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearing, as hypocritical. In response to Karlan's quip, Melania Trump stated, \"A minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics. Pamela Karlan, you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering, and using a child to do it.\"\n\nTIME named Greta Thunberg as their 2019 \"Person of the Year\" earlier this year. The first lady's frequent criticism over the apparent irony in her fronting the \"Be Best\" anti-cyberbullying campaign given her husband's habit of mocking political opponents and others on Twitter has been a recurring theme.\n\nGrisham's statement emphasized the difference between the president and first lady's communication styles, stating, \"It is no secret that the president and first lady often communicate differently\u2014as most married couples do.\"\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama encouraged Thunberg while traveling in Vietnam this week, stating, \"Don't let anyone dim your light,\" and adding, \"Like the girls I've met in Vietnam and all over the world, you have so much to offer us all. Ignore the doubters and know that millions of people are cheering you on.\"\n\nThunberg responded to Trump's attack by changing her Twitter profile description to describe herself as a \"teenager working on her anger management problem.\"",
    " Title: Democratic National Committee Eliminates Superdelegates, Shifts Power to Social Media Activists\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) has announced plans to eliminate superdelegates, elected officials and party elites who traditionally help determine presidential nominees. This move is expected to shift more authority to activists on social media, who are increasingly influencing the party's agenda.\n\nRepresentative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, who was among those arrested during a recent immigration protest, commented on the change, stating, \"We have to pay attention to our base.\" She pointed to a series of special elections and primaries, including that of Rep. Joe Crowley, as evidence of a rising liberal coalition asserting its power. Jayapal added, \"That energy, combined with the real threat of a second Supreme Court justice that could strip away women's reproductive rights and a lot of other rights that people have come to rely on \u2014 I think it is an even bigger call to action.\"\n\nThe current situation within the Democratic Party mirrors the turmoil experienced by Republicans during the first two years of President Obama's administration, when Democrats controlled all branches of government and left the Tea Party-influenced Republican Party to protest ineffectually.\n\nSome Democrats view this moment as a significant turning point, akin to the era following the Vietnam War and Watergate, when a backlash against a controversial Republican president led to a moderate and liberal resurgence. This movement resulted in the gain of dozens of new seats but also initiated a generational shift in party leadership.\n\nFormer Senator Gary Hart of Colorado, who was elected during the Democratic wave of 1974 and was a leader in the effort to reinvent the Democratic Party in the 1980s, believes the party is approaching an overdue moment of self-reflection. According to Hart, the party has failed for years to define a forward-looking vision. The pressure of the midterm election, heightened by the Supreme Court vacancy, could create a new moment of definition.\n\n\"There almost has to be a generational renewal of belief systems,\" said Hart, a two-time presidential candidate, who is now 81. \"When we were in power, under Obama and Clinton, I don't believe party leaders did what should have been done, and that is come up with a manifesto for the 21st century.\"",
    " Title: House Passes $1.37 Trillion Spending Package, Averting Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States House of Representatives has passed a $1.37 trillion spending package, averting a potential government shutdown scheduled for this Friday. The package, which will now move to the Senate for approval before President Donald Trump's signature, includes funding for President Trump's border wall, increased tobacco purchasing age, and funding for gun violence research.\n\nThe spending package, broken down into two bills, marks the first of three significant votes scheduled this week in the House. The remaining votes include a historic vote on two articles of impeachment against President Trump and a new North American trade deal.\n\nPresident Trump has yet to comment on the spending deal, reached after months of negotiations between House and Senate leaders. The administration will retain the ability to reallocate funds from other government accounts, a trade-off since Democrats sought to rein in the administration's power to adjust spending after it was denied by Congress.\n\nThe deal maintains funding for the border wall, one of President Trump's campaign promises, at $1.375 billion, similar to last year's allocation. However, the amount is significantly less than the $8.6 billion the president requested. Some House Democrats remain opposed to the agreement, with the Hispanic Caucus stating that the benefits of the bill do not outweigh the \"serious issues that remain.\"\n\nThe deal includes a 3.1% raise for federal workers, upgrades to election systems, and $25 million in gun violence research after decades of resistance from the gun lobby. House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) stated, \"With higher spending levels in line with the bipartisan budget agreement, we are scaling up funding for priorities that will make our country safer and stronger and help hardworking families get ahead.\"\n\nThe deal also includes a ban on flavored vape products, expected soon, with menthol and vape stores potentially being spared. The increased use of vaping and e-cigarettes among youth has prompted this measure. As of the end of October, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 34 deaths and 1,604 lung injury cases related to vaping.\n\nThe package also includes $22 billion more in funding for the Pentagon and the preservation of restrictions related to abortion. The deal would raise the age to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21, a move that gained support after the increased use of vaping and e-cigarettes.",
    " Title: Social Media and Adolescent Mental Health: A Call for Change\n\nArticle:\n\nA study by the Pew Research Center reveals that 92% of teenagers go online daily, with 24% stating they are online \"constantly.\" However, contrary to popular belief, Facebook is not the preferred social network for most American teens, with only 15% choosing it as their favorite. Instead, 33% prefer Instagram, 20% opt for Twitter, and 19% select Snapchat. The latter app, which allows users to post pictures that disappear after viewing, has been linked to anxiety and depression in adolescents and young adults.\n\nA 2014 National College Health Assessment survey of nearly 80,000 college students in the United States found that 54% of students reported experiencing overwhelming anxiety in the past 12 months, and 32.6% \"felt so depressed that it was difficult to function.\" The study also reported that 6.4% had intentionally harmed themselves, 8.1% had seriously considered suicide, and 1.3% had attempted suicide.\n\nThese statistics are alarming, and the blame is placed on the advent of social technology. The rapid pace of social media can exacerbate the difficulties of growing up, making them more public and potentially leading to anxiety and depression.\n\nTo address this issue, several remedies are suggested:\n\n1. Creating more structured forms of social media that prevent children from diving headfirst into the world of social technology.\n2. Implementing a mechanism for parents and administrators to receive feedback on their children's online activities without infringing on privacy and alerting them to potential dangers.\n3. Incorporating courses on social technology and responsibility into school curricula to educate adolescents about the long-term effects of their online actions.\n4. Reducing the pressure on adolescents to constantly perform and market themselves.\n5. Providing more mental health support and awareness in schools and colleges to address mental health issues before they become critical.",
    " Title: Congressional Leaders Invited to White House Briefing as Government Shutdown Enters Second Week\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - President Donald Trump invited Republican and Democratic congressional leaders to a border security briefing at the White House on Tuesday as the federal government remained partially shut down over the president's demand for funding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe president's invitation, described by congressional sources as a briefing and not a negotiating session, was sent to the top two Democrats and Republicans in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office confirmed that he would attend the briefing, scheduled for Wednesday. It was unclear whether the other leaders would participate, one source said.\n\nThe House and Senate will reconvene briefly on Wednesday to mark the last day of the Republican-controlled 2017-2018 Congress, with no signs of a workable plan to end the shutdown, which is now in its second week. Approximately a quarter of the federal government is shut down, with roughly 800,000 workers affected.\n\nDemocrats, who won control of the House in the November elections, plan to approve on Thursday a two-part spending package meant to end the shutdown. However, its prospects are grim in the Republican-led Senate, which previously approved similar measures on the floor or in committee but has since fallen in line with Trump's demands for funding for the border wall.\n\nThe legislation will set the stage for the first major battle of the new Congress between House Democrats led by Nancy Pelosi and Senate Republicans led by Mitch McConnell.\n\n\"We are giving the Republicans the opportunity to take yes for an answer,\" Pelosi, who is expected to be the House speaker, said in a letter to colleagues released by her office on Tuesday.\n\n\"Senate Republicans have already supported this legislation, and if they reject it now, they will be fully complicit in chaos and destruction of the president's third shutdown of his term,\" Pelosi added.\n\nTrump triggered the shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, by insisting that $5 billion in funding for the border wall be part of any spending measure.\n\n\"Border Security and the Wall'thing' and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let's make a deal?\" Trump tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nTrump considers the wall crucial to curbing illegal immigration, echoing his 2016 presidential campaign pledge. During his run for the White House, Trump insisted Mexico would pay for the wall.\n\nThe Democrats' two-part spending package includes a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Feb. 8 and provide $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security items including technology and cameras.\n\nThe second part of the package would fund federal agencies that are now unfunded, such as the Justice, Commerce, and Transportation departments, through Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year. The House Democrats' measure does not contain the $5 billion Trump wants in wall funding. McConnell has said Senate Republicans will not approve a spending measure not supported by Trump.",
    " Title: Retailers See Strong Black Friday Sales Amid Reduced Inventories\n\nArticle:\n\nRetailers across the United States reported strong sales on Black Friday, with pared-down inventories and less need to slash prices to attract shoppers. The National Retail Federation expects sales for November and December to climb by about 4% to some $682 billion, making 2017 the strongest holiday season since 2014.\n\nBlack Friday sales are expected to come in at around $33 billion, representing a 4.8% advance over Black Friday last year, according to Customer Growth Partners, a market research and analysis firm. Macy's Inc. Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said the retailer had made adjustments based on past years and was well-positioned for the shopping bonanza.\n\nMacy's is offering fewer promotions, Mr. Gennette said. \"We're in good shape,\" he added, but cautioned, \"we've still got five weeks ahead of us\" until Christmas. The average Black Friday advertised discount across 17 categories was 45% this year compared with 48% last year, according to price-tracking firm Market Track LLC.\n\nShoppers found many of the same promotions that were on offer last year, including 30% off at Coach and 50% off at the Gap. Kevin Krause, 27, was first in line outside the Kohl's store in Medford, Ore. on Thanksgiving afternoon. He bought an Xbox One videogame console that was on sale for $189.\n\nAnalysts have been predicting robust holiday sales amid rising wages, low unemployment, and strong consumer confidence. Another bonus, especially in the Northeast, is cooler weather compared with a year ago, when temperatures edged into the 60s.\n\nJena Thomas, a university student shopping with her mother at a Target in Chicago, bought two TVs that she couldn't get earlier at Best Buy. She also splurged on a PlayStation 4 console and videogames. \"I caught up with all my Christmas shopping,\" she said.\n\nTraditional stores continue to grapple with a host of problems including sluggish sales as more shopping takes place online. And there is the broad shift in consumer spending away from apparel and accessories and toward dining, travel, and entertainment.\n\nHowever, a bright spot has emerged: stores, having reduced inventories, aren't sitting on piles of excess goods like they were a year ago. \"Because inventory management was quite good coming out of the third quarter, there's not going to be a need for aggressive promotions in the fourth quarter to clear out unsold goods,\" said Bill Dreher, a retail research analyst with Susquehanna International, a trading firm.\n\nIn an interview earlier this week, Neiman Marcus Group CEO Karen Katz attributed a jump in the luxury retailer's gross margin in the latest quarter to stronger full-priced sales. \"We've gotten our inventory in perfect alignment with our sales,\" she said.\n\nHowever, in the days leading up to Christmas, shoppers have been trained to wait for deals, a practice made easier by online price comparisons. If they hold off on many purchases, retailers will likely have to slash prices more than planned as the season progresses.\n\nIn a Wal-Mart on Long Island Thursday evening, Andre Valadas, a 34-year-old software engineer, said it was hard to snag a discounted Sharp TVs being sold at the store and at a Best Buy across the parking lot. He glanced at his phone often to text with friends looking for a similar deal nearby. \"I hope that if they don't have deals right now they will have them in a few weeks closer to Christmas,\" he said.\n\nBlack Friday is expected to be the third-busiest shopping day of the year, behind the Saturday before Christmas and Cyber Monday, according to Customer Growth Partners. Online sales on Thanksgiving increased 18% to $2.87 billion, and as of 8 p.m. Friday, shoppers had spent $3.54 billion, up 16%. Adobe expects online sales to increase 14% to $107.4 billion for the November-December period, compared with the previous year.\n\nAmazon said Thanksgiving was one of its biggest mobile shopping days, as orders placed through its app increased more than 50% over last year. Best-selling items included Keurig coffee makers and its Echo speaker devices. \"If you go back to the creation of Black Friday, it was this amazing opportunity for customers to get great deals,\" Dorion Carroll, vice president of mobile shopping at Amazon, said earlier this week. \"So they would flock to the stores and all of that would be great, until it wasn't. It got too crowded.\"\n\nA few technical problems popped up on Friday. Nike Inc. customers complained about error messages when using the sportswear maker's website, and Macy's said it experienced a \"slowdown\" with its credit-card system. Both retailers said they were working on the issues. Even so, there are still plenty of shoppers making the post-Thanksgiving pilgrimage to stores.",
    " Title: Female Venture Capitalists Play a Crucial Role in Boosting Female Entrepreneurship\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent trial, Professor Gompers, a paid witness for the defense, stated that investment returns are not solely dependent on an individual's track record but also on the presence of good colleagues. He further noted that, on average, women do not benefit from their male colleagues in the venture capital industry.\n\nVenture capitalists serve as gatekeepers to Silicon Valley, and if they are predominantly white men who studied at institutions like Stanford, it is not surprising that the majority of entrepreneurs fit the same mold. According to a report from Babson College, venture firms with women as partners are three times as likely to invest in a company with a female CEO and twice as likely to invest in one with women on the management team.\n\nThe lack of female investors has a ripple effect. Start-ups' boards are often composed of venture capitalists, leading to a predominantly male composition. A Fortune analysis found that of the 81 start-ups worth more than $1 billion, 5 percent had a female CEO and 6 percent had a woman on the board. Other studies have found that male founders and directors are less likely to hire women as executives and engineers, or pay men and women equally.\n\nBrit Morin, founder and CEO of Brit & Co, stated, \"Honestly, there will be more female entrepreneurs if there are more female venture capitalists.\" Female investors reported that they did not specifically seek to invest in companies founded by women, but because of their networks, they received more pitches from female entrepreneurs.\n\nForty percent of the angel investments made by Sonja Hoel Perkins, a founder of Broadway Angels, have been in companies started by women, a significantly higher proportion than is typical for venture funds. This is also the case with a third of Cowboy Ventures' 30 investments, and more than 40 percent of Aspect Ventures' 13 investments.\n\nTheresia Gouw, a founder of Aspect and a former partner at Accel, stated, \"We are getting a first look at an unfair share of these amazing, oftentimes repeat entrepreneurs, who happen to be female.\" Since more than half of the users of many mobile and social services are women, she added, companies can benefit from having female investors evaluate their products and serve on their boards.",
    " Title: Ongoing Transfers Reduce Guantanamo Prison Population\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is yet to be closed, contrary to a promise made by President Obama during the early days of his administration. However, detainees are being released. In May, five Taliban prisoners were swapped for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Since the November midterm elections, there has been a new batch of transfers from Guantanamo, and more releases are in the works.\n\nSeven low-level detainees have been moved to other nations this month, reducing the number of inmates at Guantanamo to 142. More than half of the remaining detainees are also approved for some kind of transfer.\n\nDavid Rothkopf, CEO of the FP Group which publishes Foreign Policy magazine, states, \"The Obama administration came in with some stated goals with regard to dismantling Guantanamo that they have not been able to follow through on thus far, and we are six years in, so I think they're feeling the pressure.\"\n\nLaura Pitter, from advocacy group Human Rights Watch, comments, \"It does seem like there is a renewed effort to reinvigorate the transfers out of Guantanamo.\" Pitter notes that transfers stalled after the prisoner swap for the release of Sergeant Bergdahl, with GOP lawmakers expressing outrage over the administration's failure to provide the required 30 days notice of that transfer.\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel, in a statement to the House Intelligence Committee, emphasized his responsibility for signing off on all prisoner transfers from Guantanamo. Nearly five months passed without further transfers, a period that coincided with the rise of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, and a new House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon's statement that continuing such releases was unwise.\n\nAt a recent hearing, McKeon asked, \"Secretary Hagel, isn't this in conflict with your policy of stemming the flow of terrorists?\" Hagel replied, \"The intelligence community assessed that more than 90 percent of those detainees had not intended to or had in fact, we had not received credible evidence of recidivism.\"\n\nTen days later, Hagel announced he was stepping down. He had already notified Congress of more transfers. However, a new Congress run entirely by Republicans could potentially stall the new drive to empty Guantanamo.",
    " Title: Senate Leaders Call for Full, Clean Repeal of Obamacare After Repeal-and-Replace Bill Fails\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a late-night development on Monday, President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have called for the full and clean repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The call comes after four Republican senators withdrew their support for the repeal-and-replace bill, leaving McConnell without the 50 votes necessary to pass the Obamacare rewrite.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released a statement at 11:48 p.m., stating, \"Regrettably, it is not apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure Obamacare will not be successful. So, in the coming days, the Senate will vote to take up the House bill with the first amendment in order being what a majority of the Senate already supported in 2015 and that was vetoed by then-President Obama: a repeal of Obamacare with a two-year delay to provide for a state transition period to a patient-centered health care system that gives Americans access to quality, affordable care.\"\n\nFour Republican senators, including Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine, had previously opposed the Senate's second repeal-and-replace bill. They were joined by Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas on Monday.\n\nPresident Trump had previously tweeted on June 30, \"If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!\"\n\nThe plan to pass a clean repeal bill was initially supported by conservatives, including Sen. Paul and Heritage Action, who believed the horse-trading necessary to accomplish both repeal and replace at the same time would hobble the effort. Their plan was to push for a two-year window where congressmen and senators could craft replacement legislation after Obamacare's fate was set.\n\nDemocrats, who have vowed to torpedo any GOP effort to repeal Obamacare, might then be pulled to the negotiation table, enabling Washington to pass a bill with support from both parties. However, the likelihood of bipartisan support is still low, given the current atmosphere in Washington, the parties' widely differing agendas, and the polarized mood of the parties' supporters.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Paris Accord Stance May Soften as Tillerson Suggests Possibility of Remaining in Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson has indicated that the United States may remain in the Paris Agreement on climate change, contradicting previous statements from the White House. Tillerson stated that the U.S. would stay in the agreement \"if we can construct a set of terms that we believe is fair.\"\n\nHis comments come after the White House earlier denied reports of a softening stance on the accord. In June, President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the pact, citing the need to protect American interests. Trump had portrayed the agreement as one that would hinder the U.S. economy while benefiting countries like China and India.\n\nSpeaking to US network CBS, Tillerson suggested the U.S. might not leave the accord at all. When asked if there was a chance the U.S. could stay in the accord, Tillerson replied, \"I think, under the right conditions, the president has said he's open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others, on what we all agree is still a challenging issue.\"\n\nThis statement aligns with reports on Saturday suggesting Trump had softened his attitude towards the agreement. After a meeting of environment ministers, the EU's top climate official, Miguel Arias Canete, said Trump officials had indicated the U.S. would not renegotiate the Paris accord but \"try to review the terms on which they could be engaged under this agreement.\"\n\nHowever, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders later stated, \"There has been no change in the United States' position on the Paris agreement.\" Sanders added, \"As the president has made abundantly clear, the United States is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favorable to our country.\"\n\nNational Security Advisor H.R. McMaster echoed Sanders' words more closely when he appeared on ABC's This Week program on Sunday. \"He left the door open to re-entering at some later time if there can be a better deal for the United States,\" McMaster said.\n\nHowever, even an improved deal is likely to be a hard sell to Trump's base support, many of whom are vehemently opposed to the 2015 agreement. The Paris accord commits the U.S. and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures \"well below\" 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and \"endeavor to limit\" them even more, to 1.5\u00b0C. Opponents say withdrawing from the accord is an abdication of U.S. leadership on a key global challenge.",
    " Title: San Jose Mayor Proposes Mandatory Liability Insurance for Gun Owners\n\nArticle:\n\nSan Jose, California's mayor, Sam Liccardo (D), has announced a proposal that would require all gun owners in the city to carry liability insurance for their firearms. The proposal, if enacted, would cover accidental discharges and actions taken by third parties who borrow, steal, or obtain the guns through other means.\n\nMayor Liccardo stated, \"We have to solve problems. While this is far from a complete solution, it is something we can do to reduce the harms of firearms, without waiting for Congress to take action.\"\n\nThe proposal is being referred to as a \"harm reduction\" approach, modeled after existing insurance requirements for automobiles and tobacco consumption. Mayor Liccardo compared the idea to the requirement of motorists to carry automobile insurance and the subsequent encouragement of safe driving behavior. He also likened it to taxing tobacco consumption to discourage risky behavior and subsidize public health costs generated by smoking-related illnesses and deaths.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) praised the move in a Monday tweet, calling it \"another tremendous step\" in addressing the high costs of gun violence. He questioned, \"If you need to have insurance to drive an automobile and follow safety guidelines, then why shouldn't you need insurance to operate and keep a gun safely?\"\n\nOpponents of the proposal argue that it would be an onerous burden on people legally exercising their Second Amendment rights. City council member Johnny Khamis stated, \"The move could be seen by gun owners who are doing everything legally as a punishment.\"\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) responded to the proposal as \"another tax on law-abiding gun owners\" in a statement. NRA spokesperson Amy Hunter stated, \"Criminals are already ignoring California's more than 800 gun laws, so it's doubtful many of them would rush out and get liability insurance.\"\n\nTwo victims of the recent shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival, which took place in California, were children from San Jose: 13-year-old Keyla Salazar and 6-year-old Stephen Romero. Mayor Liccardo called the idea a \"harm reduction\" approach meant to emulate other models already in effect.",
    " Title: Trump Jr. Emails Reveal Meeting with Russian Lawyer Was Part of Russian Government's Support for Trump Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest son of President Donald Trump, was informed ahead of a June 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer that material damaging to Hillary Clinton that he was offered was \"part of a Russian government effort to aid his father's candidacy,\" according to a report by The New York Times on Monday evening.\n\nTrump Jr. published the emails detailing the meeting on Twitter Tuesday morning, shortly before the Times was set to publish them. In the messages, he was told by publicist Rob Goldstone, who set up the meeting, that \"This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\"\n\n\"If it's what you say, I love it,\" Trump Jr. replied.\n\nThe latest report comes after the White House spent Monday defending Trump Jr. following another Times report that the meeting last summer was intended to get damaging information about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In a statement Sunday, Trump Jr. said he did not know who he was meeting with beforehand, but had been told the person \"might have information helpful to the campaign.\" He said the meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya yielded no useful details.\n\nThe meeting was also attended by Trump's then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort\u2014who would later briefly serve as campaign manager\u2014and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who now serves as a White House senior adviser.\n\n\"Don Jr. did not collude with anybody to influence the election,\" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Monday. \"The only thing I see inappropriate about the meeting was the people that leaked the information on the meeting after it was voluntarily disclosed.\"\n\nSanders added during the daily press briefing, which was not televised, that \"the people that leaked the information on the meeting after it was voluntarily disclosed\" was inappropriate.\n\nAfter dismissing such a meeting as routine opposition research gathering that typically happens during campaigns\u2014although typically such meetings would not happen with a foreign government\u2014Trump Jr. also tweeted Monday that he would be happy to \"pass on what I know\" to Senate and House Intelligence Committees investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 elections and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. That statement came after Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins said the president's son needs to speak to the committee.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., told reporters at the Capitol on Monday that he \"absolutely\" wanted to talk to Trump's son, calling it part of a \"continuing pattern we've seen since the election of Trump campaign and Trump administration officials who have conveniently forgotten meetings with Russians.\"\n\n\"If I was a campaign manager and had been contacted by what may be an agent of a foreign power and was told that agent may have damaging information about a potential candidate, I think I would remember that meeting,\" Warner said. \"And I think it's also a little strange, as a candidate, if my son or son-in-law met with an official or an agent of a foreign power I think I'd probably want to hear about that information.\"\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway defended the president's son on CNN Monday morning, emphasizing that there was \"no action taken. Nothing\" that resulted from the meeting.\n\n\"Don Jr. has very explicitly stated he did not even know the name of the person with whom he was meeting,\" Conway said. \"He agreed to the meeting based on a contact from the Miss Universe Pageant.\" That contact was music publicist Rob Goldstone, who told the Washington Post that he had arranged the gathering.\n\nPolitico reported earlier Monday that Trump Jr.'s actions and statements \"put him potentially in legal cross hairs for violating federal criminal statutes prohibiting solicitation or acceptance of anything of value from a foreign national, as well as a conspiracy to defraud the United States,\" and he, Manafort, and Kushner \"may have also exposed themselves to future blackmail threats,\" according to legal experts.\n\nTrump Jr. has hired New York attorney Alan Futerfas to represent himself in matters regarding the Russia investigations, Reuters reported on Monday. The Daily Caller reported that Futerfas has previously represented Nikita Kuzmin, a Russian national who was found guilty of creating a malware virus that infected over 40,000 U.S. computers, including ones at NASA.\n\n\"In my view, this is much ado about nothing. During this busy period, Robert Goldstone contacted Don Jr. in an email and suggested that people had information concerning alleged wrongdoing by Democratic Party front-runner, Hillary Clinton, in her dealings with Russia,\" Futerfas told the Times following the Monday evening story. \"Don Jr.'s takeaway from this communication was that someone had information potentially helpful to the campaign and it was coming from someone he knew. Don Jr. had no knowledge as to what specific information, if any, would be discussed.\"",
    " Title: Cory Booker Announces Presidential Campaign, Cites Vulnerability and Strength\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Jersey Senator Cory Booker announced his candidacy for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination on Friday, emphasizing vulnerability and strength in his speech.\n\nIn a press conference, Booker expressed his thoughts on strength, stating, \"What is real strength? Is it bombast? Is it swagger, braggadociousness? Is it strut? No, I think strength is seen in vulnerability. It's seen in those people who stood before fire hoses and armed troopers unarmed.\"\n\nBooker further discussed his campaign, expressing his intentions to offer a spirit of love, kindness, grace, and decency, in addition to his policy ideas. He concluded by expressing his faith in America and his readiness to compete in the primary race.\n\nThe announcement came after weeks of speculation about Booker's intentions, with his delayed entry into the race becoming a running joke among Democratic operatives. Initially, it was believed that Booker would announce in December, but his entry was delayed. The entry of other candidates, such as Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, further fueled the speculation.\n\nBooker's team stated that the delay was due to a strategic decision to take more time to build and finesse their organization and plan. The team emphasized that the benefits of moving more quickly would not have outweighed the benefits of having more time to prepare.\n\nThe announcement was made on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and Booker spent the day in South Carolina, a state that is expected to play a crucial role in the primary race. The timing of his announcement and his visit to South Carolina had led to assumptions that he was trying to box out Harris, who is also African-American and is seen as a strong competitor in the primary race. However, Booker's team insists that the timing was a strategic move and not an attempt to compete with Harris.",
    " Title: Californian Secessionists Rally on Independence Day, Push for State Split or Secession\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia secessionists, led by the Yes California independence campaign, also known as Calexit, are rallying at the state capitol in Sacramento on Wednesday, advocating for a separate California and urging Trump supporters to leave the state. The Fourth of July, traditionally celebrated with picnics and parades by many Americans, is being viewed by Calexit as a day to stand against the \"American occupation of California.\"\n\nCalexit, which is collecting signatures to place a secession measure on the 2020 ballot, has generated controversy with its efforts to separate California as a separate country. Billionaire Tim Draper generated the most significant attention in April when he qualified his three-Californias measure for the November ballot. This initiative, now named Proposition 9, aims to divide California into three more manageable states: Southern California, Northern California, and California, each holding major cities like San Diego, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, respectively.\n\nProposition 9 has shown little support in the polls, but Draper maintains the proposal is gaining momentum. \"It started at 13 percent in favor and then it went to 17 percent in favor and now you said 27 percent in favor,\" Draper said. \"What happens is as people start thinking about it, they say, yeah, I'd like to see my kids have a better education, yeah I'd like to have better infrastructure, yeah, I'd like to have lower taxes, and I think you could have all that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Fourth of July holds special significance for New California, which seeks to split the state along rural-urban lines, following procedures outlined in Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution. About 200 members of New California fanned out Tuesday to read the organization's latest \"grievance against the state of California\" on the steps of 18 county court and government buildings.\n\nNew California co-founder Paul Preston said, \"The Founding Fathers laid down their grievances in the Declaration of Independence, and that's the process we're following. It's really kind of exciting to see the Declaration of Independence utilized again.\" New California issued its own declaration of independence on Jan. 15 and has since relayed 24 grievances, one per week, as it seeks to gain county support and ultimately persuade the state legislature to divide the state.\n\nIn a separate movement, the State of Jefferson, which has filed a federal lawsuit in search of a two-state solution, also shares similar goals. Spokesman Terry Gherardi said, \"As we celebrate the 4th of July and our independence, the 23 Counties of the State of Jefferson remind everyone, the importance of equal representation for all citizens in the 58 Counties of California and other states, we the people of Jefferson also seek our independence from the oligarchy governing the State of California, forming the new State of Jefferson.\"\n\nThe tone is notably different at Calexit, where organizers Louis Marinelli and Marcus Ruiz Evans have framed their independence campaign as a reaction to American imperialism and the Trump administration. Calexit's Fourth of July message criticized the \"ancestors of those undocumented immigrants from the United States who settled in California without invitation, decimated the local population through disease and genocide, stole the natural resources from under their feet, and declared California an American territory.\" Calexit aims to qualify a ballot measure that would direct California's governor to work with Congress on separating the state from the rest of the nation.",
    " Title: Vice President Pence Announces 20 Million Antibody Tests Per Month for Economic Reopening\n\nArticle:\n\nVice President Mike Pence announced on Monday that 20 million antibody tests are now being produced monthly, a key component in reopening the economy. During the White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing, Pence stated that beyond the new 15-minute tests by Abbott Laboratories, a new antibody test, which may be FDA-approved in a few days, will be produced at the rate of 20 million tests a month.\n\nPence also mentioned that commercial laboratories, which have been producing hundreds of thousands of tests each week, are not utilizing 20% of Roche's high-speed testing capacity and 75% of Abbott Laboratories' m2000 systems' capacity. If governors and state labs were to activate these existing machines, testing capacity would reportedly double overnight.\n\nThe Vice President's comments may refer to Abacus Pharma International (API), a company that produces a coronavirus antibody test called \"COVID-Rapid.\" The test, a simple blood test that can return results in 15 minutes, has a 100% accuracy for detecting old infections but is not designed to diagnose COVID-19. Tens of thousands of tests are currently in a warehouse in Pompano Beach, waiting to be distributed. Puerto Rico has already ordered 3 million tests, and the company also plans to donate 10,000 to the city of Miami. API claims it will have the capacity to make 20 million tests a month.\n\n\"We're excited to be able to contribute,\" said API CEO Vincent DeGennaro. \"This is not about selling tests for us, this is about getting people back to work and helping repair our damaged economy and to try and minimize the impact the disease can have in our community here in Miami.\"\n\nEarlier in the press conference, Pence highlighted Dr. Deborah Birx's efforts in expanding testing capabilities nationwide. \"Dr. Birx has been leading an effort for the task force from early on on rapidly expanding testing,\" Pence said. \"It was early on that the president formed that public-private partnership with commercial labs and as we stand here today more than 2.5 million tests have been performed and when we add in the estimates of labs that we have to assume with reasonable projections have not yet reported into the CDC, we think that number could be closer to 3 million tests that have been performed.\"\n\nPence also mentioned the new 15-minute test by Abbott Laboratories, stating that they are working closely with the company to rapidly increase the availability of cartridges. Abbott is producing approximately 50,000 cartridges a day, with FEMA acquiring an initial supply and distributing them to the states. The Vice President also mentioned efforts to distribute what is being made and work with other suppliers to create additional cartridges.\n\nThis is a breaking news story, please refresh the page for updates.",
    " Title: Fort Worth Police Officer Shoots and Kills Black Woman in Her Home, Family Seeks Transparent Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 A white Fort Worth police officer shot and killed a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, 28, inside her home on Saturday, following a call about an open front door. The incident has sparked calls for a thorough investigation and transparency from the family of the victim and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nAccording to attorney Lee Merritt, who represents Jefferson's family, the officer \"didn't have time to perceive a threat\" before opening fire. Merritt stated that the bodycam video, which was released by the Fort Worth Police Department, does not show the officer shouting \"Gun, gun, gun\" before firing.\n\nJefferson was watching her 8-year-old nephew when she was killed, her family told KXAS television. The Fort Worth Police Department stated in a statement that officers saw someone near a window inside the home and that one of them drew his duty weapon and fired after \"perceiving a threat.\" The bodycam video released by police shows two officers searching the home from the outside with flashlights before one shouts, \"Put your hands up, show me your hands.\" One shot is then fired through a window.\n\nJefferson's sister, Amber Carr, expressed her grief and frustration, stating, \"It's another one of those situations where the people that are supposed to protect us are actually not here to protect us.\" Carr added, \"You know, you want to see justice, but justice doesn't bring my sister back.\"\n\nAn aunt, Venitta Body, stated that the family does not understand why Jefferson was killed. \"It's like from the moment we got the call, it's been more and more inconceivable and more confusing,\" Body said. \"And there has nothing been done in order to take away that confusion.\"\n\nThe Fort Worth Police Department has placed the officer, who has been on the force since April 2018, on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation. The officer's name has not been released, and he is scheduled to be interviewed about the fatal shooting on Monday.\n\nAt a brief news conference at police headquarters, Fort Worth Police Lt. Brandon O'Neil confirmed that the officer did not announce he was police before he fired the fatal shot and that his failure to do so is part of the department's investigation. O'Neil also confirmed that Jefferson's 8-year-old nephew was in the room with her when she was shot.\n\nJames Smith, who called a police non-emergency number about the open door, told reporters he was just trying to be a good neighbor. \"I'm shaken. I'm mad. I'm upset. And I feel it's partly my fault,\" Smith said. \"If I had never dialed the police department, she'd still be alive.\"\n\nSmith stated that Jefferson and her nephew typically lived with an older woman, who has been in the hospital. \"It makes you not want to call the police department,\" he said.\n\nIn an audio recording of Smith's call that was released by police, the neighbor said it was \"not normal\" for the house to leave its front door open for hours at that time of day.\n\nMerritt stated that Jefferson's family expects \"a thorough and expedient investigation.\" The Fort Worth Police Department stated it released bodycam footage soon after the shooting to provide transparency, but that any \"camera footage inside the residence\" could not be distributed due to state law. However, the bodycam video released to media included blurred still frames showing a gun inside a bedroom at the home. It's unclear if the firearm was found near the woman, and police have not said that the officer who shot her thought she had a gun. The police statement released Saturday said only that officers who entered the residence after the shooting found a firearm. Police did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Sunday.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday called on the Justice Department to investigate. \"The killings of unarmed Black Americans have got to end,\" Sanders tweeted. \"Atatiana Jefferson should be alive.\"\n\nThe shooting comes less than two weeks after a white former Dallas police officer was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted of murder in the fatal shooting of her black neighbor inside his own apartment. Amber Guyger, 31, said during her trial that she mistook Jean's apartment for her own, which was one floor below Jean's. Merritt also represents Jean's family.",
    " Title: Mueller Subpoenas Trump Organization for Documents, Including Russia-Related Materials\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has issued a subpoena to the Trump Organization for documents, including some related to Russia, according to a report by the New York Times on Thursday. The details of the subpoena were not available, and the Trump Organization played down the significance of any subpoena, with a lawyer stating that the company has been cooperative with the special counsel's investigation since July.\n\nMueller is investigating Russian attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. election and potential collusion by Trump aides. Russia has denied U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that it meddled in the election, and U.S. President Donald Trump has stated there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow officials. Mueller has charged several Trump associates and more than a dozen Russians.\n\nPeter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment on the Times report about a subpoena, which is the first known time Mueller has demanded materials directly related to Trump's businesses. The S&P 500 ended slightly lower on Thursday in choppy trade, with strong jobs and manufacturing data balanced by the Times report on Mueller's subpoena.\n\nNew York lawyer Alan Futerfas, who represents the Trump Organization in the Russia probe, stated, \"This is old news, and our assistance and cooperation with the various investigations remains the same today.\" Futerfas also represents Donald Trump Jr. and other Trump Organization officers and employees.\n\nCongressional committees are also investigating Russia and the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. The White House declined to comment specifically on the report and referred questions to the Trump Organization. \"We're going to continue to fully cooperate. Out of respect for the special counsel, we're not going to comment,\" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.",
    " Title: Israeli Airstrikes Disrupt Muslim Holiday in Gaza as International Efforts Intensify for a Ceasefire\n\nArticle:\n\nIsraeli jets targeted three Hamas sites in Gaza on Monday, marking a disruption to a relative lull in the war-torn territory during the start of the Muslim holiday, Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. The strikes followed an almost 12-hour pause in fighting and came as international efforts intensified to end the three-week conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe U.N. called for an \"immediate\" cease-fire. Israel's military stated that it struck two rocket launchers and a rocket manufacturing facility in central and northern Gaza after a rocket hit southern Israel early Monday. The rocket caused no damage or injuries.\n\nEarlier, the Israeli military reported that it had not conducted any attacks in Gaza since 9:30 p.m. on Sunday, but troops on the ground were continuing efforts to destroy the cross-border tunnels constructed by Hamas for attacks inside Israel. The military opened artillery fire on Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza in response to the rocket fired at Ashkelon.\n\nMuslims began celebrating Eid al-Fitr on Monday, but there was fear and mourning instead of holiday cheer in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian families huddled inside their homes, fearing more airstrikes, while those who came to a cemetery in Gaza City's Sheik Radwan neighborhood to pay traditional respects at their ancestors' graves gathered around a large crater from an airstrike a week ago that had broken up several graves.\n\nAn emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council called for \"an immediate and unconditional humanitarian cease-fire.\" While it was the council's strongest statement yet on the conflict that has already killed 1,030 Palestinians, 43 Israeli soldiers, and three civilians on the Israeli side, it was not a resolution and therefore not binding.\n\nPalestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour expressed his disappointment, stating that the council should have adopted a strong and legally binding resolution a long time ago demanding an immediate halt to Israel's \"aggression,\" providing the Palestinian people with protection, and lifting the siege in the Gaza Strip so goods and people can move freely.\n\n\"You cannot keep 1.8 million Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip in this huge prison,\" Mansour told reporters. \"That is a recipe for disaster. It is inhumane, and it has to be stopped and it has to be lifted.\"\n\nIsraeli U.N. ambassador Ron Prosor also criticized the statement\u2014though from a very different perspective\u2014saying it lacked balance because it did not mention Hamas, the firing of rockets into Israel, or Israel's right to defend itself.\n\nIsrael says it started its Gaza operation on July 8 to stop the rocket fire from the coastal territory and intensified it on July 17 to neutralize Hamas cross-border tunnels built to carry out attacks on Israeli territory.\n\nThe pressure for a cease-fire followed new attacks launched by Israel and Hamas on Sunday despite the back-and-forth over proposals for another temporary halt to the fighting. The Security Council urged Israel and Hamas \"to accept and fully implement the humanitarian cease-fire into the Eid period and beyond.\" It said this would allow for the delivery of urgently needed assistance.\n\nThe council's presidential statement also called on the parties \"to engage in efforts to achieve a durable and fully respected cease-fire, based on the Egyptian initiative.\"\n\nOn Sunday, President Obama telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express his concern over the mounting Palestinian casualties. The White House stated that Obama reiterated that Israel has a right to defend itself and condemned Hamas' rocket attacks. Obama said a lasting peace will ultimately require a demilitarized Gaza and dismantling of terror groups. The U.S. president also pushed for an immediate, unconditional cease-fire that would allow Israeli and Palestinian civilians to return to normalcy.\n\nInternational diplomats have hoped that a temporary lull in the fighting could be expanded into a more sustainable truce to end the bloodshed.",
    " Title: Merck CEO Resigns from President's Manufacturing Council in Response to Charlottesville Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nMerck chairman and CEO Kenneth Frazier has resigned from President Trump's American Manufacturing Council, citing the need for U.S. leaders to reject expressions of hatred, bigotry, and group supremacy. In a statement, Frazier emphasized the strength of the U.S. stems from its diversity and the contributions made by individuals of different faiths, races, sexual orientations, and political beliefs.\n\n\"Our country's strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths, races, sexual orientations, and political beliefs,\" Frazier stated, without mentioning Trump by name.\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry, and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" he continued. \"As CEO of Merck, and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\"\n\nIn response, Trump tweeted, \"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\"\n\nFrazier previously served as the chairman of a commission that investigated the pedophilia scandal at Pennsylvania State University. The commission's report found that Penn State administrators failed to take action to stop Jerry Sandusky, a football coach convicted of sexual abuse.\n\nTrump faced backlash this weekend for denouncing the violence in Charlottesville, where one person died and numerous more were injured in clashes between white supremacists and counterprotesters. Trump's initial statement did not directly place blame on any particular group, stating, \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides \u2014 on many sides.\"\n\nThe White House sought to clarify Trump's position on Sunday, stating, \"The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court Confirmation Process Transformed: Ford's Allegations and Kavanaugh's Denial Lead to Dramatic Shift\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rapid turn of events, the Supreme Court confirmation process for Brett Kavanaugh has evolved from a seemingly certain confirmation to a contentious dilemma. Initially, when only an unnamed accuser emerged with vague allegations from Kavanaugh's high school years, the Republicans showed no signs of slowing the confirmation process. However, the emergence of Christine Blasey Ford, who came forward to The Washington Post, has significantly altered the landscape.\n\nFord's lawyer, in statements on two morning shows, confirmed that Ford is willing to testify, creating an unstoppable momentum that has led Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley to invite both Ford and Kavanaugh to testify next Monday. The support of Jeff Flake and Susan Collins for hearings has further solidified this change, making it impossible to revert to Grassley's initial proposal of a phone interview.\n\nKavanaugh, too, has issued an expanded denial and expressed his willingness to testify, effectively rendering Grassley's initial proposal obsolete. President Trump, while praising Kavanaugh, acknowledged the delay in addressing the allegations and expressed a willingness to proceed with the process.\n\nIn the Post interview, Ford detailed her account, stating that Kavanaugh groped her, tried to remove her bathing suit, and covered her mouth when she screamed. Ford described the incident as an attempted rape, with her lawyer, Debra Katz, adding that Ford believes Kavanaugh would have raped her if he had not been severely intoxicated.\n\nThe Post also reported on therapist's notes from 2012, which do not mention Kavanaugh's name but describe an attack by students from an elite boys' school, with four boys involved. Ford attributes this discrepancy to an error by her therapist.\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch suggests that Kavanaugh was not at such a party and may be a victim of mistaken identity. The outcome of the allegations, the ensuing hearings, and the public's response remain uncertain at this point. The serious nature of the allegation, the potential long-term trauma for Ford, and the stellar career Kavanaugh has built since his high school years present complex questions for lawmakers and the public. Kavanaugh maintains his innocence, and any determination of his guilt could potentially be seen as a lie on his part as an adult. The upcoming testimony is expected to captivate the nation under the glare of television lights.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Agreement Reached on VA Health Care Legislation to Address Scandals and Improve Services\n\nArticle:\n\nThe leaders of the House and Senate Veterans Affairs committees have reached a tentative agreement on legislation aimed at improving veterans' health care and addressing the numerous issues plaguing the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The proposed bill, if passed, would authorize at least $17 billion in spending over the next three years to rectify the veterans' health program.\n\nThe agreement includes funding to facilitate prompt appointments for veterans with VA doctors and to hire additional medical staff, such as doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals. The plan also grants the VA secretary the authority to immediately dismiss senior executives and provides employees with streamlined appeal rights.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate veterans panel, had proposed a bill last week that would cost approximately $25 billion over three years. In response, Rep. Jeff Miller (R-Fla.), the House veterans committee leader, proposed a plan to approve $10 billion in emergency spending, with a promise of additional spending in future years.\n\nThe differences between the two lawmakers threatened to derail negotiations last week, but they negotiated over the weekend and produced the plan announced on Monday. The leaders of both parties in both chambers will now need to gauge the support of their respective caucuses for the plan, which still requires approval from the House and Senate.\n\nThe agreement comes amid widespread national outrage over problems within the VA, such as the case of 18 veterans who died while on a secret waiting list for care at the VA facility in Phoenix. An inspector general's report in May found that roughly 1,700 veterans in Phoenix were on an unauthorized list, with some waiting as long as 115 days for treatment.\n\nThe VA Secretary, Eric Shinseki, resigned shortly after the release of that report. The Obama administration has stated that it needs approximately $17.6 billion to hire thousands of doctors, nurses, and other health professionals, lease new facilities, and upgrade its computers to reduce the backlog of veterans awaiting care at VA hospitals and clinics.\n\nThe proposed legislation includes funding to give veterans who cannot get a VA appointment the option of receiving non-VA care, funding for the VA itself, and authority for the VA secretary to immediately fire corrupt or incompetent senior executives. The plan also includes funding for construction projects to improve safety or patient access, computer enhancements, and additional staff to address the agency's backlog of benefits claims.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Compares President Trump to Richard Nixon, Criticizes Administration Policies at Wellesley College Commencement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn her third commencement address at Wellesley College, former First Lady and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton did not shy away from criticizing the current administration. During her speech, she made several allusions to President Trump, comparing his presidency to that of Richard Nixon, and took aim at various controversies surrounding the Trump administration.\n\nClinton, who previously delivered the commencement speech at Wellesley in 1969 and 1992, spoke about the dangers of leaders who manipulate facts and attack their critics. \"When people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,\" she said. \"That is not hyperbole, it is what authoritarian regimes throughout history have done... They attempt to control reality.\"\n\nThe former Secretary of State also criticized the Trump administration's budget blueprint, describing it as \"an attack of unimaginable cruelty on the most vulnerable among us\u2014the youngest, the oldest, the poorest, and hard-working people who need a little help to gain or hang on to a decent, middle-class life.\"\n\nClinton warned the graduating students that they are \"graduating at a time when there\u2019s a full-fledged assault on truth and reason.\" She cited examples of people denying scientific facts, spreading conspiracy theories, and sowing division among the public.\n\nOne specific example she mentioned was the controversy surrounding the size of the crowd at President Trump's inauguration. In January 2017, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer claimed that Trump's inauguration was \"the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.\" However, side-by-side images seemed to contradict this claim, leading to widespread media scrutiny. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway attempted to defend Spicer by referring to \"alternative facts\" about the crowd size.\n\nFollowing Clinton's speech, Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel issued a statement accusing Clinton of using \"partisan talking points\" and suggesting that her comments were a \"stark reminder why [she] lost in 2016.\"",
    " Title: Macedonian Group Launches Initiative to Counter George Soros' Influence\n\nArticle:\n\nA new initiative called Stop Operation Soros (SOS) has been launched in the Balkan nation of Macedonia with the aim of countering the influence of globalist billionaire George Soros. The group, which calls on \"free-minded citizens\" to join, claims that Soros-funded non-government organizations have monopolized civil society in Macedonia and used their influence to suppress dissenting views.\n\nIn a press conference on Tuesday, SOS co-founder Nikola Srbov accused the Open Society Foundation, operating under the Soros umbrella, of using its funding and personnel to support violent processes in Macedonia. He stated that this is unacceptable and goes beyond the principles of civic organizing.\n\nThe Open Society Foundation was established by Soros in the 1980s with the stated goal of helping former Soviet bloc countries transition from communism. However, Srbov and others claim that the foundation is used to destabilize governments and foment discontent within countries.\n\nThis is not the first time that Macedonia has taken action against Soros. Earlier this month, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced that the Hungarian government would begin cracking down on any organizations linked to Soros. In December, Orban stated, \"In every country, they will want to displace Soros. In the coming year, Soros and his forces will be squeezed out.\"\n\nIn 2014, Soros openly admitted on CNN that the OSF was involved in the violent overthrow of Ukraine's government, which resulted in Russia banning Soros and his NGOs from the country the following year, citing him as a \"security threat\" to the former Soviet nation.\n\nAs nationalism continues to rise around the world, it is reasonable to assume that this will not be the last instance a European country takes action against Soros and his organizations. The specific details of the SOS initiative and its impact on Macedonia's civil society remain to be seen.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Discusses 2020 Race, Clinton Relationship, and Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate for 2020, stated on Friday that he has not sought advice from former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton regarding the current race and has no plans to meet with her. In an interview on \"The View,\" Sanders expressed that he and Clinton have \"fundamental differences.\"\n\nWhen asked about potential meetings with Clinton, Sanders responded, \"I suspect not.\" This statement comes amid reports that Clinton has met with several 2020 hopefuls to offer advice on the race.\n\nIn 2016, Sanders joined a crowded field of Democratic candidates, and his defense of democratic socialism drew criticism from allies of President Donald Trump and other conservatives. However, Sanders enters the 2020 race largely free of the characterizations as an idealistic fringe candidate, as he was three years ago.\n\nIn her book, \"What Happened,\" Clinton placed blame on Sanders for contributing to her 2016 loss, arguing that he detracted several would-be voters. The apparent tension between the two was evident in Sanders' Friday interview.\n\n\"Hillary has not called me,\" Sanders said. \"Look, we have differences,\" he continued, trailing off before conceding, \"Hillary has played a very important role in modern American politics.\"\n\nDespite the ideological differences, Sanders expressed support for other Democratic candidates, stating his main objective in 2020 is to vote out Trump. He added that he would support any candidate the Democrats choose to do so.\n\n\"I hope to be the Democratic nominee and have the support of the whole Democratic Party behind me,\" Sanders said. \"If I am not and somebody else is, I will support that candidate because what's most important is that Trump be defeated.\"\n\nSanders campaigned for Clinton in 2016 after losing the party's nomination.",
    " Title: Conservative Scholars Debate Paid Family Leave Compatibility with Conservative Principles\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - The debate on paid family leave has taken center stage in the political arena, with the Democratic party advocating for comprehensive legislation, and the Republican party yet to coalesce around a unified stance. This week, the Ethics and Public Policy Center hosted an event titled \"Is Paid Family Leave Compatible with Conservative Principles?\" to discuss the issue.\n\nThe event's first panel featured a debate on the title question. Aparna Mathur, a scholar in economic policy at the American Enterprise Institute, and Kristin Shapiro of the Independent Women's Forum argued in favor of paid leave, while Rachel Greszler, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, and Veronique de Rugy, a research fellow at the Mercatus Center, opposed the idea.\n\nThe opposition from Greszler and de Rugy primarily stemmed from slippery-slope concerns, expressing doubts that even a limited parental-leave program would not expand to cover other forms of leave, increasing the size and scope of the federal government. They argued that proposals, such as Shapiro's, to allow new parents to collect some of their Social Security benefits after the birth or adoption of a child, would eventually become a large-scale, costly program.\n\nShapiro and Mathur, on the other hand, maintained that paid parental leave is popular with most Americans and warned that if conservatives refuse to propose their own solutions, they will be left behind as the public coalesces around the expansive Democratic solution. Shapiro also argued that a conservative plan would be a pro-life policy, helping those most in need and reducing infant mortality, particularly for low-income families who don't already have paid leave through their employers.\n\nThe second panel of the morning featured policy advisers from three Senate offices outlining the differences between the two Republican proposals for paid leave. The CRADLE Act, sponsored by Senators Joni Ernst (Iowa) and Mike Lee (Utah), would permit new parents to receive one, two, or three months of paid-leave benefits in exchange for postponing their Social Security benefits for two, four, or six months. The New Parents Act, from Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Mitt Romney (Utah), allows new parents to use some of their Social Security benefits to finance up to three months of parental leave but also allows parents to take benefits even if they were not employed at the time of a child's birth (so long as they had a sufficient earnings history).\n\nRepresentatives Dan Crenshaw (Texas) and Ann Wagner (Mo.) are co-sponsoring the New Parents Act in the House. Caleb Orr, a policy adviser for Rubio, explained the distinction between the two bills by noting that requiring a set period of leave to obtain the benefit, as the Lee-Ernst bill would do, might discourage at least some families or parents from choosing to take leave at all, which would undermine the goal of the policy.\n\nThe event highlighted the ongoing debate within the Republican party regarding paid family leave and the conservative principles that should guide any potential legislation. As of now, only four Republican senators have signed on to a particular parental-leave policy, but supporters of the idea point to Ivanka Trump's interest and argue that now is the time for conservatives to gain public support before Democrats beat them to it.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Vacancy and the Test of Divided Government in the American Political System\n\nArticle:\n\nThe death of Justice Antonin Scalia has presented a significant challenge to the American political system, as it tests the ability of divided government to function effectively in today's more polarized political climate. In the past, divided government has shown the capacity to govern, as demonstrated by the unanimous approval of President Ronald Reagan's nomination of Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme Court in 1988, despite a divided party control of the government.\n\nHowever, in the wake of Scalia's death, senior Republicans have stated that they will not consider a nomination from President Obama, despite his almost year remaining in office. This stance was most notably expressed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who argued that the vacancy should not be filled until a new president is elected.\n\nThe American people have already expressed their preference for Scalia's replacement through their votes, reelecting Barack Obama in 2012. However, they also elected Mitch McConnell as majority leader in 2014. Both leaders' claims of democratic legitimacy are valid, but the American political system lacks a mechanism for resolving the conflicting mandates.\n\nThis lack of resolution is a common issue in political systems, as noted by the late sociologist Juan Linz. Linz argued that, aside from the United States and Chile, few other presidential governments have managed to maintain constitutional continuity for over a century. Chilean democracy, however, broke down in the 1970s.\n\nLinz attributed the American political system's strength to the lack of clear ideological distinction within its parties, making compromise easier. However, in recent decades, the political parties have become increasingly distinct, with liberals clustered in the Democratic Party and conservatives in the Republican Party. This level of party polarization is unprecedented in American politics.\n\nThe inability of the divided political system to fill a Supreme Court nomination during presidential election years is a cause for concern. If this inability persists, it may indicate a narrowing of the space for effective governance due to party polarization. This could potentially lead to a serious crisis, as suggested by Matt Yglesias in his essay on these underlying forces.\n\nDivided government is a common occurrence in American politics and has not historically signaled disaster for the system's ability to solve problems. If it does so now, the country will, over time, pay a serious price for a political system that no longer fits its political parties. The future of the American political system remains uncertain, as the answer Republicans are currently providing\u2014that the nomination should not be filled\u2014may set a strange precedent and potentially lead to further political instability.",
    " Title: Trump Criticizes NATO Nations for Insufficient Defense Spending\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's criticism of NATO and its member nations regarding their defense spending has been a recurring theme in his speeches. In a recent address at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, he emphasized that the U.S. supports NATO but expects all members to contribute their fair share to the alliance.\n\n\"We strongly support NATO; we only ask that all of the NATO members make their full and proper contributions to the NATO alliance, which many of them have not been doing\u2014many of them have not been even close,\" Trump said.\n\nAccording to the article, Trump's criticism is based on the fact that many NATO countries do not meet the agreed-upon defense spending target of 2% of their GDP. The article also points out that the military capabilities of many NATO nations are significantly lower compared to the Tampa Police Department.\n\nThe article also provides historical context, stating that the U.S. has historically shouldered a significant portion of the defense burden for NATO countries, while many of these countries have relied on American service members and taxpayers to defend them. The article suggests that European countries often prioritize extensive and expensive welfare programs over their own defense.\n\nThe article also mentions that this issue is not a new one, with the U.S. having obliged its young men to serve in uniform to ensure the defense of Western Europe while many European countries did not have national service. The article also notes that some European countries, such as the Netherlands, have unionized armies, and questions the effectiveness of their military capabilities.\n\nThe article also mentions that in the 1960s, Europe had been rebuilt and was nearly as prosperous as the U.S., but chose not to use its resources for defense. The article also notes that European countries spend less on their own defense than Imelda Marcos spent on shoes.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that Trump is not telling NATO to leave, but rather to shape up and do the honorable thing by meeting their defense spending obligations. The article also suggests that European officials who attempt to make their countries responsible for their defense may face opposition from their own citizens. The article also notes the decline in the military capabilities of some NATO countries, such as the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom.",
    " Title: Senate's Better Care Reconciliation Act: A Market-Based Approach to Healthcare\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Better Care Reconciliation Act, the latest health-care bill unveiled by Senate Republicans, has received mixed reactions from both political sides. The proposal, as drafted, preserves key features of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) while addressing some of its flaws.\n\nCritics on the right, such as Senator Rand Paul and Americans for Prosperity, have criticized the plan as a watered-down version of ObamaCare. Meanwhile, many liberals have denounced Better Care as an unmitigated evil. However, a closer examination of the bill reveals that it shares many similarities with the Republican Party's go-to health-care policy expert, Avik Roy's, plan.\n\nThe bill's passage would have significant implications, but Republicans could make similar normative claims about the ACA itself. While the ACA has helped millions of Americans, it has also left millions uninsured and many more with higher premiums and deductibles than in 2009, when Democrats promised their plan would deliver the opposite.\n\nThe left's default position is that the ACA's shortcomings are due to Republican obstructionism before its passage and subsequent refusal to cooperate. Former President Obama, in a statement criticizing the Senate health-care bill, noted that while the ACA represented a significant step forward, it was not perfect. He expressed a willingness to support Republicans if they could present a better plan that covered as many people at less cost.\n\nThe Better Care Reconciliation Act, like the ACA, is a market-oriented plan that acknowledges the trade-offs involved in such an approach. If some bureaucratic hurdles and government largesse are removed from the health-care market, as many conservatives desire, some people will lose coverage, and others will see an increase in their out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe bill also recognizes the government's role in situations where the market, if left to its own devices, has merciless implications. It largely preserves the protections the 2009 law established for Americans with pre-existing conditions and provides reinsurance for insurers who might have balked at doing so. This was a humane and worthwhile achievement, for which Democrats deserve credit, even if they are criticized for leaving millions of Americans uninsured.\n\nOn Monday, the Congressional Budget Office released its score of the bill, which found that passage of the legislation would result in an additional 22 million Americans being uninsured in 2026, compared to projections based on the current law. The logic underlying this projection was debatable, but its political implications are clear-cut. The Democrats who touted ObamaCare as a plan that would make comprehensive health insurance affordable to the average American are out of power, at least for the time being. However, they may regain control of Congress in 2018, and we can all look forward to seeing them unveil their secret plan.",
    " Title: Huffman Urges Calm on Superdelegate Issue, Warns of Election Consequences\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Jared Huffman (D-CA) called for voters to remain calm about the superdelegate system during a visit to his constituency in California's second congressional district on Saturday. Huffman, a superdelegate who has endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, represents a district that is likely to support Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT).\n\nIn a speech to approximately 120 supporters at the Bayside Grange event hall in Humboldt County, Huffman emphasized party unity and criticized the ongoing election season as \"crass,\" \"juvenile,\" and \"depressing.\" He also warned that the makeup of the Supreme Court and its decisions on issues such as abortion, campaign finance reform, and climate change are \"hanging in the balance.\"\n\nHuffman urged voters to consider the potential consequences of a President Donald Trump, stating, \"There are fundamental different directions this country will take depending on the outcome of this election.\" He also emphasized the importance of the election, stating, \"We have an opportunity to make this an absolute landslide for Democrats.\"\n\nRegarding the superdelegate system, in which members of Congress and party officials are free to vote for whomever they choose in the primary, regardless of the results of the primary in their state, Huffman sought to reassure a wary progressive constituency. Currently, Hillary Clinton holds a narrow lead in delegates chosen by the electorate, but a wide lead in superdelegates.\n\nEarlier in his speech, Huffman criticized the Westlands Water District of the Central Valley for what he called \"bad ideas that are designed to take away our water.\" Last week, Huffman and several other California House Democrats called for congressional hearings into the Central Valley water agency's recent settlement with the federal government over drainage for its farms.\n\nIn response to Huffman's comments, Westlands Water District deputy general manager Johnny Amaral stated, \"There is way more to the Trinity River issue than [Huffman] is letting on.\" Amaral added, \"What was on the menu tonight [at the Huffman event]? Salad? Vegetables? Fruit? Meats? Nuts? All of it came from farmers in the Westlands Water District. A thank-you would have been sufficient.\"",
    " Title: Treasury Inspector General Discloses IRS Probe Known to Obama Administration in 2012\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a testimony on Friday, J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, revealed that senior Treasury officials were aware in June 2012 that investigators were looking into complaints from tea party groups alleging harassment by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This disclosure indicates that Obama administration officials were aware of the probe during the heat of the presidential campaign.\n\nDuring the hearing, both George and ousted IRS head Steven Miller testified. Miller, who faced intense questioning from Republican lawmakers, acknowledged agency mistakes in targeting tea party groups for special scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status. However, he insisted that agents broke no laws and that there was no effort to cover up their actions.\n\nThe revelation has stoked the criticism of many Republicans, who are assailing the administration amid a sudden spate of other controversies, including the Benghazi attack and the government's seizure of Associated Press telephone records.\n\nIn his testimony, George stated that he informed the department's general counsel about his investigation on June 4, 2012, and Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin was informed \"shortly thereafter.\" However, George clarified that these discussions were not to inform them of the results of the audit but to inform them of the fact that the audit was being conducted.\n\nAfter the hearing, inspector general spokeswoman Karen Kraushaar said George \"informed Department of Treasury officials that we were looking into the IRS's handling of applications for tax-exempt status, partly due to allegations raised by conservative organizations.\"\n\nThe Treasury Department issued a statement on Friday stating that officials first became aware of the actual results of the investigation in March of this year, when they were provided a draft of George's report, a standard practice.\n\nGeorge's disclosure was made before the House Ways and Means Committee in the first of several congressional hearings on the matter. Miller, who spoke publicly about the controversy for the first time, was contrite as he apologized for the actions of agents who singled out conservative political groups for additional, often burdensome scrutiny.\n\nHowever, the hearing turned prickly when Miller insisted he did not deceive Congress, though he repeatedly failed to reveal the controversy last year when he was asked about it by lawmakers\u2014even after he had been briefed.\n\n\"I did not mislead Congress or the American people,\" Miller said.",
    " Title: Mia Love's Defeat in Utah House Race Highlights Republican Challenges in Attracting Minority and Women Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse candidate Mia Love, who was seen as a promising figure for the Republican Party, lost her race in Utah's 4th Congressional District to Democrat Jim Matheson on November 6. Love's defeat, which occurred in a deep-red state, has been identified as a significant indicator of the challenges faced by the Republican Party in appealing to minority and women voters.\n\nLove, a black Republican who delivered a prime-time convention speech and received support from Mitt Romney, lost to Matheson by a narrow margin of approximately 1 percentage point. However, Love won only 27 percent of the Hispanic vote compared to Matheson's 71 percent, a disparity that mirrors the presidential race between Romney and President Obama.\n\nThe defeat of Love, who represents the growing diversity within the GOP, underscores the party's need to attract more support from minority voting blocs. In the 2012 elections, Hispanics made up 10 percent of the electorate, and Republicans won a smaller percentage of the Hispanic vote than they did in 2004 with George W. Bush, who won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote.\n\nAnother concern for the Republican Party is their ability to appeal to women voters. Females made up roughly 53 percent of the electorate this cycle, and roughly 55 percent of them voted for Obama. The controversial remarks made by Senate candidates Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana, who both made comments about rape and/or pregnancy that were used by Democrats to portray GOP candidates as a threat to women, have been identified as a significant factor in this trend.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the Republican Party is taking steps to analyze the 2012 elections and develop strategies to broaden their base. Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has ordered a full analysis of the elections that will include talking to campaign volunteers and outside groups. The audit will focus on key voting blocs such as women, younger voters, and Hispanics.\n\nThe Republican Party is also considering comprehensive immigration reform, with House Speaker John Boehner urging Obama to come up with a plan and Senate Lindsey Graham proposing a plan similar to those being put forward by Democrats. Meanwhile, Romney has suggested that the administration went too far in appealing to Latinos and other groups, accusing the president of winning favor with \"gifts.\"\n\nSome Republicans, such as Florida Sen.

    " Title: GOP Tax Cuts Advance Despite Deficit Concerns: Unpaid-For Measures Approved by House Ways and Means Committee\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy, the House Ways and Means Committee, controlled by Republicans, has voted to advance hundreds of billions in tax cuts, adding to the federal deficit. The committee approved six tax breaks on Tuesday, at a cost of $310 billion over the next decade.\n\nThe vote was almost entirely along party lines, with the committee's Republican chairman, Dave Camp, leading the charge. The approved tax breaks include the research and experimentation deduction, a credit that helps small businesses with major equipment costs, and the break for businesses earning rent and interest overseas.\n\nRepublican opponents argue that these tax breaks have been passed year after year without offsetting their costs, and that the jobs generated by these tax breaks are worth the added deficit. However, Democrats and some fiscal conservatives have criticized the move, citing a perceived double standard in the GOP's approach to tax cuts and spending.\n\nChuck Marr, director of tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, stated, \"It's a clear double standard, particularly when you hold up unemployment.\"\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, maintain that their decision to prioritize tax cuts over deficit reduction is consistent with their long-standing position. Sarah Swinehart, spokeswoman for Camp, said, \"Pay-fors are for spending. New spending. That's his position.\"\n\nThe six tax breaks approved on Tuesday were part of a larger group of 55 tax breaks that expired at the end of 2013 and have been waiting for congressional renewal. The full House is expected to vote on all six tax credit bills, with multiple GOP sources telling CNN that they expect all bills to receive votes on the House floor. The exact timing is still being worked out.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Lawmakers Unveil Immigration Proposal Amidst Government Funding Impasse\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan group of 48 lawmakers, evenly split by party, have unveiled a proposal to address the ongoing immigration standoff in Washington. The group, known as the Problem Solvers Caucus, aims to include their immigration-border security outline in a budget deal that has been elusive due to the impasse on immigration and other issues.\n\nThe caucus has been working since last fall to find a solution for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children from deportation. President Donald Trump decided in September to terminate the program by March 5.\n\nThe Problem Solvers Caucus' proposal bears resemblance to an offer from a bipartisan Senate group led by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) and Dick Durbin (D-Illinois), which was rejected by Trump and deemed dead in the Senate by GOP leadership.\n\nWhile the White House unveiled its own proposal last week, offering a pathway to citizenship for nearly 2 million undocumented immigrants, it contains other sweeping immigration changes that have faced immediate resistance from the left.\n\nThe success of the Problem Solvers Caucus proposal remains uncertain, but the bipartisan group has been negotiating for months in the hope that if enough rank-and-file members can show consensus across the aisle, it could gain traction with leadership as a viable option as funding talks continue without success. The latest short-term government funding is set to expire on February 8.\n\nIn the deal, qualifying young undocumented immigrants would have a 10- to 12-year pathway to citizenship, provided they have a clean criminal record and have paid taxes. The border security piece of the deal would allocate the President's request for this coming fiscal year: $1.6 billion for physical barriers, such as walls and fencing, and $1.1 billion for technology and other measures. It would also appropriate money for drug screening, border access roads, and personnel, and authorize a study on adding fees to related activities that can then be spent on border security.\n\nTo address the other two \"pillars\" of the White House's demands - ending the diversity lottery and curtailing family migration - the bill would eliminate the diversity visa but create a new merit-based visa for underrepresented countries with education, work, and language requirements. Half of the visas would also go initially toward allowing recipients of Temporary Protected Status to stay in the U.S. after the Trump administration ended their protections.\n\nThe bill would prevent parents who brought their children illegally to the U.S. from being sponsored for citizenship by those children once they become citizens, but would give them three-year legal work permits to stay in the U.S. without citizenship.",
    " Title: South Korea's Successful Containment of COVID-19 Compared to the U.S. Disaster\n\nArticle:\n\nSouth Korea, a country with a population of 51 million, effectively contained the COVID-19 outbreak within a month. The daily new cases fell from 800 to fewer than 100 in the first two weeks of March. As of this morning, the nation reported zero new domestic infections for the third consecutive day.\n\nIn contrast, the United States, with a population approximately six times larger, has experienced a significant number of COVID-19 fatalities. In mid-March, the U.S. and South Korea had the same number of coronavirus-caused fatalities, approximately 90. However, as of April, South Korea lost a total of 85 souls to COVID-19, while the U.S. lost 62,000\u2014an average of 85 deaths every hour.\n\nThe stark contrast between the two countries' responses has led some commentators to attribute South Korea's success to an ancient culture of collectivism and Confucianism. However, this observation is not only racially insensitive but also oversimplifies the factors contributing to South Korea's success.\n\nThe South Korean government and its citizens have learned from their past experiences with public health crises. In 2002, the SARS outbreak killed several hundred people in East Asia. In 2009, the H1N1 influenza, which likely originated in Mexico, spread to more than 1 million people globally and killed several hundred South Koreans. From these epidemics, South Korean public-health officials recognized the necessity of early testing and the importance of isolating new patients to prevent secondary infections.\n\nThe 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak created the playbook that the country has used to break the back of COVID-19. The South Korean government's response to MERS involved extensive testing, contact tracing, and quarantining of infected individuals and their close contacts. This approach, combined with public education and transparency, has been instrumental in South Korea's success in containing the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nIn conclusion, South Korea's ability to effectively contain the COVID-19 outbreak is a result of its past experiences with public health crises and the government's swift and comprehensive response. The country's success serves as a model for other nations to learn from and adapt to their own circumstances.",
    " Title: First U.S. Case of Ebola Confirmed, Health System Prepared for Isolation and Control\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced on Tuesday the first confirmed case of Ebola in the United States. The patient, who traveled from Liberia, developed symptoms upon arrival in the U.S. However, there is no evidence that anyone on the patient's flights from Liberia to the U.S. was exposed to the virus.\n\nSince the outbreak began in Africa, the CDC has consulted with state and local health departments on nearly 100 cases involving travelers who returned from West Africa and showed symptoms that might have been caused by Ebola. Of those cases, 14 were considered to be truly at risk. Specimens from 13 were tested, and Ebola was ruled out in all 13 cases.\n\nThe U.S. has a strong healthcare system and dedicated public health professionals working to ensure the case will not threaten the community at large or the nation. A person who is sick from Ebola virus disease can be cared for in U.S. hospitals with the patient isolated in a private room with a private bathroom, and contact with them is highly controlled. Every health care worker must meticulously follow every single infection control protection recommended.\n\nPublic health officials are also identifying people who have had close personal contact with the newly diagnosed patient and will follow up with them for 21 days, the longest known incubation period for Ebola. If they develop any signs of the disease, those people will be isolated, tested, and cared for.\n\nThe CDC has been preparing for this day, working around the clock with local and state health departments to enhance surveillance and laboratory testing capacity, provide recommendations for health care infection control and other measures to prevent disease spread, and deliver guidance and tools for health departments to conduct public health investigations.\n\nAlthough the CDC cannot promise that they can stop the disease at just one case, they are confident that the right steps are being taken to stop Ebola in its tracks in the U.S. It is essential to remember that the U.S. must be relentless in stopping the spread of Ebola in West Africa, as that is the only way to truly and completely protect the health security of America and the world.",
    " Title: Former FBI Deputy Director McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein Allegedly Discussed Removing President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Monday, President Donald Trump accused Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe of pursuing an alleged \"illegal and treasonous\" plot against him. The allegations stem from discussions about secretly recording the president and potentially invoking the 25th Amendment, which allows for the removal of a president if they are deemed mentally unfit.\n\nMcCabe, in promotional interviews for his forthcoming book, told CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" that Rosenstein was \"absolutely serious\" when he suggested recording Trump in the days following the firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Trump responded to the comments, calling McCabe a liar and accusing top DOJ and FBI officials of orchestrating a \"deranged\" plan.\n\nWhile Trump fumed at McCabe, the former FBI deputy director claimed he never seriously considered Rosenstein's offer to secretly record the president. McCabe said he did discuss the matter with the FBI's then-general counsel, James A. Baker. Last fall, as reported by Fox News, Baker told lawmakers during a closed-door deposition that McCabe and Page had told him details of the meeting where Rosenstein made the comments. Baker reportedly told congressional investigators he took the word of McCabe and Page \"seriously.\"\n\nMcCabe told CBS News that \"I think the general counsel had a heart attack\" when he told him of Rosenstein's plan. \"And when he got up off the floor, he said, 'I, I, that's a bridge too far. We're not there yet,'\" McCabe added. Days later, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to oversee the bureau's investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.\n\nRosenstein has repeatedly denied pursuing or authorizing the recording of the president and has also denied McCabe's suggestion that he had broached the idea of invoking the 25th Amendment. The Justice Department echoed both denials in a statement released last week, saying Rosenstein \"was not in a position to consider invoking the 25th Amendment.\"\n\nHowever, McCabe said in the interview, \"Rod raised the [25th Amendment] issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other Cabinet officials might support such an effort.\" He added that he believed Rosenstein was \"counting votes or possible votes\" to remove Trump from office.\n\nFox News reported Sunday that Baker, in his testimony to Congress, provided even more details about the alleged 25th Amendment discussions, saying two Cabinet officials were \"ready to support\" such an effort.",
    " Title: US Democrats' Use of Kente Cloth in Congress Sparks Controversy and Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the death of African American George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer, the United States Congress proposed legislation to reform the police. However, the attire of some Democratic lawmakers during the announcement of the proposed reforms has become a topic of discussion on social media.\n\nOn Monday, several Democratic lawmakers, including Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, were seen wearing kente scarves, a colorful geometric cloth originating from Ghana. The Congressional Black Caucus, a group that meets to pursue legislative goals around greater equality for black people, provided the scarves, according to NBC News reporter Leigh Ann Caldwell.\n\nKaren Bass, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, explained the significance of the kente cloth, stating, \"The significance of the kente cloth is our African heritage, and for those of you without that heritage who are acting in solidarity.\" She further added, \"That is the significance of the kente cloth - our origins and respecting our past.\"\n\nKente cloth has been used in the US to reflect a pride in African heritage, including at graduation ceremonies for students in historically black fraternities or sororities. Modern kente is characterized by intricately woven and richly colorful geometric designs, often seen in bold shades of yellow, blue, green, red, and orange.\n\nThe kente cloth is associated with the Ashanti people in central Ghana and is linked with special occasions as it is expensive to make. The skills of the finest weavers are reserved for the use of Ashanti royalty, and certain patterns are reserved for the king. Otumfuo Osei Tutu II is the current king, or Asantehene, who ascended to the throne in 1999. He is a revered figurehead who adjudicates in disputes and is closely involved in local issues. However, like other traditional leaders, he is barred by the constitution from taking part in Ghanaian politics.\n\nThe use of kente cloth by the Democrats has sparked a debate on social media, with some finding it a symbol of solidarity and pride, while others view it as a distraction from the proposed police reforms. Some celebrities, such as the drummer for the Roots, Questlove, and singer John Legend, have commented on the trending topic on Twitter.\n\nHowever, the reaction in Ghana has not been as noticeable, with some Ghanaians viewing it as an opportunity to promote the cloth. On the other hand, Kenyan writer Nanjala Nyabola sees the Democrats' use of kente as an insult to Africans, stating, \"We are not your props.\"\n\nSome critics in the US argue that the focus on the kente cloth is diverting attention from the proposed police reforms, with one tweeter saying, \"Now is NOT the time to learn the history of kente cloth. I assure this too is a distraction.\"\n\nThe Democrats' proposed Justice in Policing Act of 2020 aims to reform the police in America to make it easier to prosecute officers for misconduct, ban chokeholds, and address racism. As she unveiled the bill, Mrs. Pelosi read the names of black men and women who have died at the hands of police in recent years.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Republicans, who control the US Senate, will support the proposed legislation. US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that \"the Radical Left Democrats want to Defund and Abandon our Police. Sorry, I want LAW & ORDER!\"",

The parliament passed a motion rejecting \"disparaging ad hominem statements by U.S. officials which do a disservice to bilateral relations,\" according to Reuters.\n\nThe symbolic move followed comments made by Peter Navarro, the White House National Trade Council director, who said there is a \"special place in hell\" for any leader who engages in bad faith diplomacy with Trump. A number of other Trump officials and the president himself also criticized Trudeau following the Group of Seven (G-7) summit in Canada last weekend.\n\nTrump refused to sign the G-7 joint agreement after Trudeau severely criticized Trump following the international summit. Trump officials have suggested that Trudeau double-crossed Trump by criticizing him on television after he left the gathering. Trump took to Twitter to criticize Trudeau, stating, \"PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, \u2018US Tariffs were kind of insulting\u2019 and he \u2018will not be pushed around.\u2019\"\n\nTrump added, \"Very dishonest & weak. Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!\" Canadian lawmakers also approved a motion that supports the Canadian steel and aluminum industry that has been impacted by Trump's massive tariffs, according to Reuters.\n\nPrime Minister Trudeau kept a low profile on Monday after the verbal sparring and was not in the House of Commons during the parliament's unanimous vote.",
    " Title: Primary Challenges to President Trump: An Analysis of the Likelihood and Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent announcement of former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh's primary challenge to President Donald Trump has sparked debate over the President's vulnerability to a primary challenge. However, historical data suggests that primary challenges to sitting presidents are rare and often unsuccessful.\n\nIn the last 70 years, only three presidents faced muscular primary challenges in the modern primary era: Gerald Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980, and George H.W. Bush in 1992. All three went on to lose the general election. It is important to note that these presidents were under 75% approval with members of their own party, while President Trump currently enjoys overwhelming intraparty support, with 88% approval in the latest Gallup poll.\n\nHead-to-head polls of the Republican primary give Trump massive leads over any primary challengers. He leads former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld, who was the first notable candidate to jump in the race, by anywhere from 60 to 85 points, and he even leads high-profile hypothetical challengers like Utah Senator Mitt Romney and former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley by up to 80 points.\n\nWhile these facts do not seem to deter challengers, it is unclear if their primary goal is to beat Trump or to spur a conversation about the party's direction. In addition to Walsh and Weld, former South Carolina Representative Mark Sanford is considering jumping in. The success of these candidates in terms of their impact on the party's direction, rather than their chances of winning the primary, is a topic of debate.\n\nThe potential success of these primary challengers in terms of their impact on the party's direction is a topic of debate. My colleague Geoffrey Skelley devised a scale for rating the \"success\" of presidential primary challengers, from 1 (no-name candidates) to 5 (the as-yet hypothetical candidate who manages to successfully topple a sitting president). Right now, I would think that Walsh, Weld, and potentially Sanford are somewhere between Levels 1 and 2.\n\nThe success of these primary challengers in terms of their impact on the party's direction is a topic of debate.

Right now, I would think that Walsh, Weld, and potentially Sanford are somewhere between Levels 1 and 2. They are known commodities and could put together a professional campaign apparatus, but it seems unlikely that they will attract as much support as Pat Buchanan did against Bush in 1992, the model for a Level 2 primary challenge.\n\nThe risk of Republican challengers splitting the anti-Trump sentiment in the party into even smaller pieces is also a concern. For example, a HarrisX national poll from May, when Trump and Weld were the only notable Republicans in the race, gave Trump a 73-7 lead. But HarrisX's latest national poll, the first to include Walsh, puts Trump at 76%, Walsh at 5%, and Weld at 3%. Any additional candidates who jump into the race saying they want to \"stop Trump\" may make it harder to do just that.\n\nIn conclusion, while primary challenges to President Trump are rare and often unsuccessful, the recent announcement of Joe Walsh's primary challenge has sparked debate over the President's vulnerability to a primary challenge. The success of these primary challengers in terms of their impact on the party's direction, rather than their chances of winning the primary, is a topic of debate. The risk of Republican challengers splitting the anti-Trump sentiment in the party into even smaller pieces is also a concern. The most important takeaway from Walsh's and other primary challengers' campaigns may be the level of anti-Trump sentiment in the party, rather than the President's chances of losing the primary.",

Bush, the 41st President of the United States, passed away peacefully on Friday at the age of 94. In an interview on Fox News Sunday, former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Secretary of State and Treasury James Baker joined anchor Chris Wallace to reflect on Bush's life and career.\n\nDuring the discussion, Baker revealed details of Bush's final hours. He described Bush's passing as \"gentle and peaceful,\" stating that arrangements were made for all of his children to call in to say their goodbyes. In his last words, Bush expressed love to his son, former President George W. Bush, who had called in to say, \"Dad, I love you. I will see you on the other side,\" to which Bush responded, \"I love you.\"\n\nThe New York Times provided additional details, reporting that Bush had been fading in the last few days, spending most of his time sleeping. On Friday morning, his longtime friend and former Secretary of State, James A. Baker III, arrived at his Houston home to check on him. Bush suddenly grew alert, asking, \"Where are we going, Bake?\" to which Baker replied, \"We're going to heaven.\" Bush responded, \"That's where I want to go.\" He passed away barely 13 hours later, surrounded by friends, family, doctors, and a minister.\n\nOutgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan announced that Bush will lie in state at the Capitol rotunda from 7:30 pm on Monday until Wednesday morning. The public is invited to pay their respects from Monday, December 3, at 7:30 pm ET until Wednesday, December 5, at 7:00 am ET.\n\nSeveral touching tributes to Bush have emerged since his death, including an editorial cartoon depicting him reuniting in heaven with his beloved wife and the daughter they lost at a young age. The cartoon went viral, bringing tears to many eyes.\n\nBush, a war hero, Congressman from Texas, US Ambassador to the United Nations, Republican National Committee Chairman, Director of the CIA, Vice President, and President, will be remembered for his extensive record of public service. A handwritten note he wrote to his successor, Bill Clinton, on Inaugural Day 1993, expressing well-wishes, has also circulated online.",
    " Title: \"Republican Leadership Embraces Counter-Punch Tactics in Kavanaugh Confirmation Process\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic turn of events, the United States Senate has confirmed Brett Kavanaugh as the 114th Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. The confirmation process, marked by allegations of sexual assault, has been a significant display of political maneuvering and counter-punch tactics.\n\nDemocrats, led by Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA), attempted to delay the confirmation process, but their efforts were unsuccessful. The party, in an attempt to discredit Kavanaugh, promoted a leaked letter alleging sexual assault against Christine Ford in 1982. However, the accuser's four witnesses could not corroborate her story, leading to the fall of the allegations.\n\nThe Democratic Party's strategy was met with resistance, as the FBI conducted an investigation, but it concluded within days with no new evidence. The process was widely criticized, with many viewing it as a national disgrace orchestrated by the left.\n\nPresident Trump, known for his counter-punching style, expressed admiration for Kavanaugh's defense and defiance during his testimony before the Judiciary Committee. Trump's approach, which was initially met with criticism, seems to have influenced Republican leadership, who have adopted a more assertive stance in response to Democratic Party attacks.\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) was verbally attacked by anti-Kavanaugh protestors in the Senate building, a response that was met with a wave of his hand and a comment about being ready for them when they grow up. Similarly, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley (R-IA), criticized the media for their bias against Kavanaugh, citing instances where pro-Kavanaugh individuals were denied interviews while the media focused on those opposed to the nominee.\n\nThe confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh marks a significant victory for President Trump, demonstrating the effectiveness of his counter-punch tactics and the newfound assertiveness of Republican leadership in the face of Democratic Party attacks.",

The march, organized by civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton, will bring together the families of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, two black men whose deaths at the hands of police have sparked nationwide protests.\n\nIn a statement, NAACP President and CEO Cornell William Brooks expressed the purpose of the march, stating, \"This march is one of many demonstrations to show Congress, the country, and the world that we will not stand down until systemic change, accountability, and justice in cases of police misconduct are served.\"\n\nThe march will commence with a rally at Freedom Plaza, located just a block from the White House. The event will honor the memory of Eric Garner, who died in July after police attempted to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes on Staten Island, and Michael Brown, who was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Grand juries in both cases declined to indict the white officers involved.\n\nRev. Sharpton, addressing a crowd in anticipation of the march, asked, \"Why are we going to Washington?\" He continued, \"Because all over the country we all need to come together and demand this Congress deal with the issues, that we need laws to protect the citizens in these states from these state grand jurors.\"\n\nA recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that 57% of Americans believed a New York City grand jury should have indicted police officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Garner, who was seen in a cell phone video with his arms around Garner's neck, and could be heard gasping, \"I can't breathe.\" The grand jury's decision in Staten Island led to protests in New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Atlanta. On Thursday, congressional aides in Washington walked off their jobs in protest.\n\nGwen Carr, Garner's mother, expressed her support for the upcoming march, stating, \"I am so proud that everybody is doing what they have just done. Keep on doing it but just do it in peace.\" The mother of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was shot and killed by police last month, will also attend the event. In that incident, a 911 caller told dispatchers a gun Tamir was pointing at people outside a recreation center in Cleveland, Ohio, was likely not real. Police said Tamir had an airsoft gun, which shot pellets but resembled a semi-automatic pistol, and did not follow orders to put his hands up.\n\nThe protests, which began in Ferguson, Missouri, were ignited by demonstrations following a grand jury's decision not to indict officer Darren Wilson in the August shooting death of Michael Brown. In Ferguson, demonstrators burned buildings, looted stores, and smashed police cars.",
    " Title: Democrats Restore References to God and Jerusalem in Platform Amid Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocrats have reinstated references to God and Jerusalem as Israel's capital in their official party platform following a contentious floor fight at their convention on Wednesday. The debate, marked by shouts and boos, has sparked criticism and raised questions about party unity and the Democrats' stance on religion and Israel.\n\nThe platform committee head, former Ohio Governor Ted Strickland, initially described the move as a \"clarification\" rather than an \"error.\" However, President Obama's deputy campaign manager, Stephanie Cutter, contradicted this in an interview with a media outlet, stating that Obama personally intervened to restore the references.\n\nRashida Tlaib, a member of the Michigan delegation and the state's House of Representatives, criticized the process, calling it \"irresponsible\" and \"wrong.\" She argued that the party did not have the votes to change the language and was \"shammed.\"\n\nThe visuals from the floor, showing delegates shouting down the convention chairman as he called the vote, are likely to be used by Republicans to portray Democrats as hostile to religion and Israel. The Republican campaign used the scene to question the party's unity, stating, \"After yesterday's convention floor fight over Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the mention of God in the platform, it's pretty hard to call this 'a unified party.'\"\n\nRep. Sander Levin (D-Mich.) pushed for the restoration of the Jerusalem language, stating he had spoken to several people close to the president without specifying whether he spoke to the president himself.\n\nThe battle marked the biggest platform fight in either party's convention so far and signaled Democrats' concerns that the prior language could have been politically damaging in a tight election year.\n\nThe change in the section referencing God effectively restored language that had been in the 2008 platform. The updated text now reads: \"We need a government that stands up for the hopes, values, and interests of working people, and gives everyone willing to work hard the chance to make the most of their God-given potential.\"\n\nThe initial 2012 platform language stated: \"We gather to reclaim the basic bargain that built the largest middle class and the most prosperous nation on Earth -- the simple principle that in America, hard work should pay off, responsibility should be rewarded, and each one of us should be able to go as far as our talent and drive take us.\"\n\nThe change came after both Mitt Romney and GOP running mate Paul Ryan criticized the omission. Romney described the omission as the \"party veering further and further away into an extreme wing that Americans do not recognize.\"\n\nDemocrats also reinstated a section stating that Jerusalem \"is and will remain the capital of Israel. The parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations. It should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.\" This is consistent with Obama's personal stance, though the administration's stance is for the status to be worked out between the Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz stated that the changes were made \"to maintain consistency with the personal views expressed by the president and in the Democratic Party platform in 2008.\" She noted that administrations of both parties have said the status of Jerusalem should be negotiated by the Israelis and Palestinians.",

He had the WEAKEST recovery since the Great Depression, despite Zero Fed Rate & MASSIVE quantitative easing.\"\n\nThe president continued, \"NOW, best jobs numbers ever, Had to rebuild our military, which was totally depleted. Fed Rate UP, taxes and regulations WAY DOWN. If Dems won in 2016, the USA would be in big economic (Depression?) & military trouble right now. THE BEST IS YET TO COME. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!\"\n\nThe Trump campaign also issued a statement criticizing Mr. Obama's tweet, stating that Mr. Trump \"reversed the floundering Obama/Biden economy\" following \"the worst economic recovery in modern history.\"\n\n\"By contrast, though, deregulating, lowering taxes, and supporting free-market policies, President Trump has created the hottest economy on record, with unemployment hitting generational lows and all-time lows for African Americans, Hispanics, the disabled, veterans, and many other hard-working Americans,\" Trump campaign national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, according to Fox News.\n\n\"Paychecks are growing at the fastest pace in a decade and twice as fast for low- and middle-income Americans,\" she continued. \"It's no wonder Democrats seek to take credit for the Trump economy after eight years of betraying blue-collar workers and inflicting pain upon the middle class as Americans everywhere suffered.

    " Title: Senate Democrats Approve Budget After Late-Night Vote, Facing Internal Disagreements\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Democrats passed their first budget in four years early Saturday morning, but the vote was close, with a 50-49 margin. The budget proposal, which underwent a marathon session of amendments, exposed internal divisions among Democrats, particularly among lawmakers facing re-election who criticized the plan's failure to address the deficit.\n\nSen. Mark Begich, a moderate Democrat from Alaska, was among those who opposed the Senate's plan due to its high deficit. \"While I am happy that Congress is finally talking seriously about our fiscal crisis, this budget did not go far enough,\" Begich said. \"Alaskans expect us to finish the job and make this staggering deficit manageable. Passing this problem off to our children is not an option.\"\n\nThe Democratic budget includes $975 billion in new taxes, matched by an equal amount of spending reductions primarily from health programs, defense, and reduced interest payments as deficits decrease more than previously anticipated. The deficit over the next decade never dips below $400 billion and would hover at or near $600 billion by 2023. This would add $7.3 trillion to the national debt over that period, according to Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions.\n\nHouse Republicans also faced defections, with ten Republicans opposing House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's 2014 plan earlier this week. However, the Republicans' budget resolution passed with a more comfortable margin in the House than the Democrats' did in the Senate. The four Senate Democrats who voted against the Democrats' bill were Kay Hagan, D-N.C.; Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Mark Pryor, D-Ark.; and Begich.\n\nPresident Obama is expected to release his own 2014 budget next month, which will be closely watched for signs of engagement with Republicans in negotiations or a more confrontational approach. The Democratic and Republican plans will not clear Congress in their current form and are merely blueprints that do not appropriate money.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans will now enter into hard bargaining, making sacrifices if they are to settle on a bona fide budget rather than passing stopgap spending bills to fund the government year after year. The White House reiterated its displeasure with the House Republican plan, which does not call for tax hikes on the wealthy.",
    " Title: Apple Challenges Court Order to Assist FBI in Breaking into Encrypted iPhone\n\nArticle:\n\nApple has announced its intention to contest a federal magistrate's order compelling the tech giant to help the U.S. government access data on an encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the shooters involved in the deadly December 2015 San Bernardino terror attack. In a statement published on Apple's website, CEO Tim Cook expressed concerns about the implications of the order, stating that it has far-reaching consequences beyond the immediate case.\n\nIn the statement, Cook acknowledged the FBI's good intentions but expressed concern about the government's request to create a \"backdoor\" to the iPhone. He stated, \"We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good. Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create.\"\n\nThe order, issued by U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym, marks a significant victory for the Justice Department in a technology policy debate that pits digital privacy against national security interests. A federal agent involved in the San Bernardino terror investigation told Fox News that the phone's carrier, Verizon, would not be able to provide authorities with the necessary information.\n\nFBI Director James Comey told members of Congress last week that encryption is a major problem for law enforcement who \"find a device that cannot be opened even when a judge says there is probable cause to open it.\" The ruling on Tuesday is linked to the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil since the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in a December 2 shooting at a holiday luncheon for Farook's co-workers. The couple later died in a gun battle with police.\n\nFederal prosecutors told the judge in Tuesday's court proceeding that investigators cannot access a work phone used by Farook because they do not know his passcode and Apple has not cooperated. Under U.S. law, a work phone is generally the property of a person's employer. The judge told Apple to provide an estimate of its cost to comply with her order, suggesting that the government will be expected to pay for the work.\n\nIn his statement, Cook said, \"This moment calls for public discussion, and we want our customers and people around the country to understand what is at stake.\" Apple has provided default encryption on its iPhones since 2014, allowing any device's contents to be accessed only by the user who knows the phone's passcode. Previously, the company could use an extraction tool that would physically plug into the phone and allow it to respond to search warrant requests from the government.\n\nThe ruling by Pym requires Apple to supply highly specialized software the FBI can load onto the county-owned work iPhone to bypass a self-destruct feature, which erases the phone's data after too many unsuccessful attempts to unlock it. The FBI wants to be able to try different combinations in rapid sequence until it finds the right one.\n\nIt is not immediately clear what investigators believe they might find on Farook's work phone or why the information would not be available from third-party service providers, such as Google or Facebook. Investigators think the device may hold clues about whom the couple communicated with and where they may have traveled.\n\nFarook was not carrying his work iPhone during the attack. It was discovered after a subsequent search. It was not known whether Farook forgot about the iPhone or did not care whether investigators found it. The phone was running the newest version of Apple's iPhone operating system, which requires a passcode and cannot be accessed by Apple, unlike earlier operating systems or older phone models. San Bernardino County provided Farook with an iPhone configured to erase data after 10 consecutive unsuccessful unlocking attempts. The FBI said that feature appeared to be active on Farook's iPhone as of the last time he performed a backup.\n\nThe judge did not spell out her rationale in her three-page order, but the ruling comes amid a similar case in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Investigators are still working to piece together a missing 18 minutes in Farook and Malik's timeline from December 2. Investigators have concluded they were at least partly inspired by the Islamic State group; Malik's Facebook page included a note pledging allegiance to the group's leader around the time of the attack.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates' Responses to Orlando Shooting Contrast in Tone and Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, presumptive presidential nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton offered contrasting responses, each reflecting their distinct political stances and approaches to addressing terrorism and gun violence.\n\nAs details about the motive behind the early morning rampage at a gay nightclub in Orlando remained unclear, both candidates began to weigh in. By the end of the day, authorities were still investigating the circumstances that led Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old American citizen from Florida, to open fire, killing 50 people and critically wounding dozens more.\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, expressed his condolences on Twitter, stating, \"When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?\" Later, he took credit for his stance on radical Islamic terrorism, saying he appreciated the congratulations for being right on the issue. In a more provocative response, Trump suggested that President Barack Obama should step down, a statement that exceeded typical Republican criticism of Obama's approach to extremism.\n\nTrump's comments, while often criticized for being jarring and crass, have resonated with some voters who believe Obama has been constrained in his response to terror threats due to political correctness. \"We can't afford to be politically correct anymore,\" Trump declared on Sunday. He canceled a rally scheduled for Monday but planned to proceed with a speech in New Hampshire, shifting the focus from his case against Clinton to national security.\n\nHillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, adopted a more measured tone in her initial comments. She also made her first remarks on Twitter, writing, \"As we wait for more information, my thoughts are with those affected by this horrific act.\" Like Obama, Clinton tends to avoid early missteps, even if it leaves her appearing overly cautious. On Sunday, she waited for the president to declare the shooting an \"act of terror\" before doing the same.\n\nClinton and Obama postponed plans to campaign together in Wisconsin, a decision driven by both political considerations and the expectation that the president would need to oversee the government's response to the shooting. Clinton, however, planned to continue with solo campaign stops in Ohio on Monday and in Pennsylvania on Tuesday.\n\nClinton did not shy away from the possibility of a link to international terrorism in her statement, though she used vague language. She has made stricter gun control legislation a central theme of her presidential campaign and was more direct in raising the shooting as an example of the nation's failure to keep guns \"out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals.\" Federal authorities later confirmed that Mateen had purchased at least two firearms legally within the last week or so.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the Orlando shooting on the trajectory of the general election campaign remains uncertain. If current trends hold, there may be more deadly mass shootings in the U.S. before voters head to the polls in November. Other unforeseen events will likely also shape the race over the next five months, as the 2008 economic collapse did in the closing weeks of that year's presidential campaign.\n\nHowever, as voters begin to seriously consider Clinton and Trump as their next commander in chief, Sunday's shooting left little doubt that the choice between the two candidates is stark.",
    " Title: Obama Anticipates Immigration Bill on Senate Floor Next Month, Discusses Upcoming Trips to Mexico and Costa Rica\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama expressed optimism about the upcoming immigration reform in interviews with two major Spanish-language broadcast television networks, Telemundo and Univision, on Wednesday. According to Obama, a group of lawmakers are close to finalizing the details of their proposal, and he expects a bill to be ready for the Senate floor next month.\n\nIn the interviews, conducted in English and aired in dubbed Spanish, Obama stated, \"My expectation is we'll see a bill on the floor of the Senate next month.\" He also expressed confidence that, if a bill is introduced in April, it can be passed before the end of the summer.\n\nHowever, the president acknowledged that one key issue still needs to be resolved: the construction of a guest worker program for the future. The senators are reportedly debating details such as the wages for low-skilled guest workers and the annual number of workers allowed into the country.\n\nThe eight senators, four Democrats and four Republicans, who released the framework for their plan in January, are said to be confident that they will unveil the highly anticipated immigration bill early in the week of April 8, when Congress returns to work.\n\nRegarding concerns that the debate over guest workers might derail reform efforts, Obama told Telemundo, \"I disagree that it's threatening to doom the legislation... I think there is commitment among this group of Democratic and Republican senators to get this done.\"\n\nIn addition to discussing immigration reform, Obama also touched on his upcoming trips to Mexico and Costa Rica. He stated, \"I'm really looking forward to the opportunity to visit Mexico. I'm going to be there in early May.\" He emphasized that the relationship between the U.S. and Latin American countries is not limited to border issues or drug cartels, but also encompasses commerce, trade, and energy.",
    " Title: Rep. Eric Swalwell Continues to Claim Trump-Russia Collusion Despite Mueller Report\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Eric Swalwell (D-CA) has continued to assert that there was collusion between President Trump's campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, despite the recent release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report that found no such collusion.\n\nDuring an interview on Fox News, Swalwell was asked about the debunked Steele dossier, a document that was largely unverified and has been discredited. Swalwell maintained that nothing in the dossier had been disproven. This assertion was met with disbelief by Fox News host Martha MacCallum, who asked, \"Are you serious?\"\n\nIn a separate interview on MSNBC, Swalwell stated that he is ready for President Trump to sue him if he continues to assert that there was collusion. Swalwell also claimed that the only person who has made false statements about Russia is Donald Trump.\n\nRepresentative Devin Nunes (R-CA), who was chair of the House Intelligence Committee, was on Fox after Swalwell's interview and criticized his Democratic colleague for his continued focus on the Russia collusion narrative. Nunes suggested that Swalwell should have used his interview to discuss other issues, as over 2,500 subpoenas were issued and 500 witnesses were interviewed during the investigation, and there was no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion.\n\nSwalwell is not alone in his continued focus on the Russia collusion narrative. Many members of the Democratic Party and their allies in the media have been criticized for their obsession with the issue, even after the Mueller report's summary all but torpedoed the dossier's credibility.\n\nUPDATE: During an interview with Chris Matthews, Swalwell still maintained that Trump is a Russian agent.",
    " Title: Trump's Border Wall Promise Faces Skepticism as Funding Negotiations Stall\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, candidates often make promises to win voter support. One such promise, made by Donald Trump, was the construction of a wall on the southern border to stop illegal immigration. However, the likelihood of this promise being fulfilled is becoming increasingly uncertain.\n\nIn a recent interview, conservative commentator and early Trump supporter Ann Coulter expressed her disillusionment with President Trump's commitment to the border wall. Coulter, who wrote the book \"In Trump We Trust\" and whose book \"Adios, America\" informed the Trump campaign's immigration policy, stated that she would not vote for Trump's reelection in 2020 if the wall is not built.\n\nThe border wall was a key issue during the government shutdown negotiations last week. Trump had demanded $5 billion for border wall construction, and threatened a government shutdown if the funding was not provided. However, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in an interview with Fox News, seemed to indicate a willingness to compromise on the $5 billion demand, suggesting a potential shift of funds from other sources for wall construction.\n\nCoulter's stance is a reflection of the growing skepticism among Trump's supporters regarding his commitment to the border wall. Without the wall, Coulter stated, \"Trump will just have been a joke presidency who scammed the American people, amused the populists for a while, but he\u2019ll have no legacy whatsoever.\"\n\nThe border wall was a central campaign promise for Trump, and its lack of progress has raised concerns among his supporters. The threat of a government shutdown was the only leverage the White House had to force Democrats to go on record opposing the wall. However, it appears that the White House may have given up this leverage without a fight.\n\nWith Democrats set to take control of the House in January, there is little chance of securing funding for the border wall in the near future. If the White House does not make the border wall a priority, it is unlikely to be built. And if Ann Coulter's assessment is correct, Trump may not have another opportunity to fulfill this campaign promise.",
    " Title: Migrant Caravan Seeking Asylum in US Halted at Mexico-US Border\n\nArticle:\n\nDozens of migrants traveling in a caravan to seek asylum in the United States have been stopped at the border near San Diego, according to US border officials. Approximately 150 people, many traveling with children, were informed that the border crossing was full. The status of the Central American migrants, whether they will be allowed in later or turned back, remains uncertain, but the group appears to be staying put.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has labeled the caravan a threat to the safety of the US. The group has been a frequent target for the US president, who has argued in his tweets that it demonstrates the need to tighten immigration laws.\n\nThe caravan set off for the US on March 25 in southern Mexico, near the Guatemala border, and at one point numbered more than 1,000 people. The group traveled by bus, train, and on foot during its 2,000-mile (3,200km) trek to the US border, with many stating they were fleeing persecution and violence in their home countries.\n\nAs of now, no members of the group have been processed by the US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) at the San Ysidro crossing. Some members were allowed to cross a long bridge that led to US processing buildings but had to stop outside. In a statement, CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said, \"we have reached capacity at the San Ysidro port of entry.\"\n\nUnder US immigration law, inspectors have the power to quickly deport individuals who do not have the proper travel or visa documents at the time that they request entry or if the inspector believes that the person requesting entry has committed fraud or misrepresented the truth. However, if an individual expresses a fear of return to his or her home country, they will not be immediately deported but instead be detained until they undergo a \"credible fear interview.\"\n\nThe aim of the interview is for the asylum officer to try to establish if the asylum request is based on a fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political beliefs, or membership of a particular group. If the officer finds that the individual has a chance of proving fear of persecution, the applicant is referred to a judge.\n\nThe patience of the many children among the migrants was striking, although perhaps weariness was the real explanation. One little girl stood quietly as a woman fixed the child's hair for an interview at the border, which could determine the direction of her life. A small boy in an oversized checked coat sucked his fingers and gazed around at the crowd as he sat on a man's shoulders.\n\nConstructing a \"big, beautiful wall\" along the Mexican border was a signature campaign promise for Mr. Trump, but so far, the plan to erect a new physical barrier has been thwarted by lawmakers and appears to have stalled. A major government spending bill which he signed last month included $1.2bn for the border wall - far short of the $25bn the White House sought. And there were strings attached to the funding Congress did approve. Most of it can only be used to repair stretches of the border where there already is a wall, not to build new segments.\n\nLast month, the Pentagon confirmed Mr. Trump had held \"initial\" talks with Defense Secretary James Mattis about using some of the Pentagon's budget for constructing a wall. However, Democratic Senators Dick Durbin and Jack Reed wrote to the defense secretary on Monday saying his department had \"no legal authority\" to use its funds for such a purpose.\n\nIn December, US Border Patrol announced arrests at the southern border had fallen to their lowest level since 1971, apparently indicating that fewer people were attempting the crossing.",
    " Title: Trump Campaign Advisers Criticize Candidate's Debate Performance, Express Concern for Second Debate Preparation\n\nArticle:\n\nDonald Trump's advisers have reportedly criticized his performance during the first presidential debate, with some describing it as \"erratic\" and expressing concern for his preparation for the upcoming debate in St. Louis. According to a report by The New York Times, campaign aides and advisers, who spoke anonymously to the media, were frustrated and discouraged by Trump's performance during the debate.\n\nThe sources reportedly criticized Trump for stopping his attacks on Hillary Clinton on trade and character issues and instead growing erratic, impatient, and subdued as the night went on. The advisers also expressed concern that Trump was not meticulously prepared for the debate, with some suggesting that there were too many people in the room during the preparation sessions, and that the team had not agreed internally on the best strategies.\n\nThe report also mentioned that Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, who are not unabashed Trump fans, provided debate advice by phone. The advisers are reportedly using the press to send a message to Trump that he needs to change his approach for the second debate.\n\nTrump's supporters have expressed anger over the media coverage portraying him as having lost the debate, according to Twitter feedback. However, a story in which some of Trump's own advisers are anonymously quoted as saying he was \"erratic\" in a debate watched by 84 million people does not help the cause.\n\nThe report comes as Trump is in an extremely competitive race against Clinton and could potentially win the presidency. The campaign advisers plan to more rigorously prepare Trump for the next debate, but there is concern about whether he will be open to practicing meticulously.\n\nThe report also mentions a separate issue involving former Democratic National Committee Chair Howard Dean, who suggested that Trump might have a cocaine problem. Dean's comments have been criticized as smear merchandising, and MSNBC's Joe Scarborough has called on Dean to apologize.\n\nFinally, the article also mentions a testimony by a former Chris Christie ally, David Wildstein, who claimed that Christie laughed when Wildstein told him the George Washington Bridge lanes were being closed as an act of political retaliation. The former presidential candidate has denied the allegations.",
    " Title: California Golf Course Conserves Water Through Innovative Methods\n\n Article:\n\n In the drought-stricken state of California, the golf industry, with an estimated value of $6 billion and nearly 130,000 employees, is often criticized for watering vast expanses of grass while residents are urged to reduce their water usage and farmers struggle with depleted wells. However, some golf courses, such as The Resort At Pelican Hill in Newport Coast, south of Los Angeles, are taking steps to conserve water.\n\n Stephen Friedlander, vice president of golf at Pelican Hill, explains their water conservation efforts: \"When people say, 'Well, that golf course is watering their grass,' if they are talking about Pelican Hill, yes we are, and we're using reclaimed water. And we're using reclaimed water in a very specific, measured way.\"\n\n Pelican Hill differentiates itself by using warm-season Bermuda grass, which requires less water and grows slower, in a large, 10-acre area. In non-playing areas, the course uses native bushes that do not require water. Despite the course's upscale image, Friedlander assures that players paying over $300 for a round should not notice any differences in the greens and fairways due to the course's advanced irrigation system.\n\n The irrigation system allows course managers to monitor and control irrigation from their smartphones, enabling them to water specific areas without overwatering others. Pelican Hill claims to save 50 million gallons of water each year through these measures, using recycled water.\n\n Another unique aspect of Pelican Hill's water conservation is the capture and use of rainwater. Rain that falls on buildings, pavement, and cart paths is collected in course reservoirs, which also serve as the course's major water features. Underground, there are giant cisterns that hold millions of gallons of runoff water from the course.\n\n \"As it turns out, because our cistern system and the lake systems are so large, ever since the work was done, no stormwater has left the golf course,\" says Sat Tamaribuchi, who designed the course's conservation system.\n\n Steve Friedlander, a golf pro at Pelican Hill, acknowledges that a golf course in a wealthy town like Newport Coast has a strong incentive to save water. However, he emphasizes that water conservation is not just a California issue: \"If you're in the golf industry and you're not a water quality and management person, then what are you doing?\"\n\n This suggests that golfers should not feel guilty about playing golf, at least in terms of water consumption, as long as courses like Pelican Hill continue to innovate and implement water-saving measures.",
    " Title: Justice Ginsburg's Health Status and Supreme Court Appointments\n\nArticle:\n\nSupreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, has been a prominent figure in the court and a champion for women's rights. Originally from New York, she is known for her Brooklyn accent and self-deprecating humor, often referring to herself as \"this little tiny woman.\"\n\nOver the summer, a documentary about her life was released, and Hollywood is currently producing a movie based on her life story. In recent years, she has gained popularity on social media with her own meme and the nickname \"Notorious R.B.G.\"\n\nDuring the Obama administration, there were calls for Justice Ginsburg to step down to allow President Obama to appoint her successor. However, these calls were not heeded, and the Democrats lost control of the Senate in the 2014 midterm elections, which prevented them from confirming a new Supreme Court justice.\n\nIn 2016, when Justice Antonin Scalia passed away, President Obama nominated Merrick B. Garland, a centrist appellate judge, to replace him. However, the Republican-led Senate refused to consider his nomination, leading to a 5-to-4 split between conservatives and liberals on the court. President Trump later appointed Neil M. Gorsuch to replace Justice Scalia.\n\nIn a 2013 interview, Justice Ginsburg stated that she would not base her retirement plans on who was currently in the Oval Office, and that she would remain on the court \"as long as I can do the job full steam, and that, at my age, is not predictable.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement. He was a critical swing vote, often voting with the court's conservatives but at times embracing liberal views in major cases. President Trump and Republican allies had hoped Justice Kennedy would step down to allow a more conservative justice to be appointed while Senate Republicans were in the majority. He was replaced by Justice Kavanaugh, one of his former clerks. The Kavanaugh nomination proceedings were the most contentious in decades, and the justice was confirmed in the closest Senate vote since the 19th century.\n\nAs of Thursday, a hospital spokeswoman has directed questions about Justice Ginsburg's condition to the Supreme Court's press office. The specifics of her health status remain unavailable at this time.",
    " Title: Republican Elites Maintain Support for Trump Despite Leaked Audio of Sexual Assault Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the release of an audio recording in which Donald Trump boasted about sexually assaulting women, several Republican elites expressed outrage. Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus stated, \"No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, who described himself as \"sickened\" by Trump's comments, added, \"I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called Trump's remarks \"repugnant\" and \"unacceptable in any circumstance.\"\n\nDespite these strong condemnations, Priebus, Ryan, and McConnell did not withdraw their endorsements of Trump. Some less prominent Republicans, such as Rep. Jason Chaffetz and Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, have withdrawn their support.\n\nThe article goes on to discuss the long history of Trump's controversial and often misogynistic comments, including his recent defense of these remarks in debates against Hillary Clinton. The article also highlights a number of other controversial statements Trump has made during the campaign, such as characterizing Mexican immigrants as \"rapists,\" suggesting that Sen. John McCain was not a war hero, and proposing a ban on an entire religious group entering the US.\n\nThe article questions whether it is surprising that Republican elites are continuing to support Trump in light of his history of controversial comments. The article concludes by stating that, given Trump's long history of racist, sexist, and bigoted comments, it may not be surprising that GOP elites are willing to accept him as the face of the party and potentially the next president of the United States.",
    " Title: Coronavirus Resurgence in U.S. Sends Infections to Record Levels Across South and West\n\nArticle:\n\nA resurgence of the coronavirus is causing a significant increase in cases across the United States, with hospital administrators and health experts warning that the current situation is a result of a combination of complacency and a public tired of staying at home.\n\nAccording to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University, the U.S. recorded a one-day total of 34,700 new confirmed COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, June 24, 2020, marking the highest level since late April. While newly confirmed infections have been declining in early hot spots such as New York and New Jersey, several other states set single-day records this week, including Arizona, California, Mississippi, Nevada, Texas, and Oklahoma. Some of these states also broke hospitalization records, as did North Carolina and South Carolina.\n\n\"People got complacent,\" said Dr. Marc Boom, CEO of the Houston Methodist hospital system. \"And it's coming back and biting us, quite frankly.\"\n\nThe virus has been blamed for over 120,000 U.S. deaths\u2014the highest toll in the world\u2014and more than 2.3 million confirmed infections nationwide. On Wednesday, the widely cited University of Washington computer model of the outbreak projected nearly 180,000 deaths by Oct. 1.\n\nCalifornia reported over 7,100 new cases, and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said he would withhold pandemic-related funding from local governments that disregard state requirements on masks and other anti-virus measures. Florida's single-day count surged to 5,500, a 25% jump from the record set last week.\n\nIn Texas, which began lifting its shutdowns on May 1, hospitalizations have doubled, and new cases have tripled in two weeks. Gov. Greg Abbott told KFDA-TV the state is facing a \"massive outbreak\" and might need new local restrictions to preserve hospital space.\n\nThe Houston area's intensive care units are nearly full, and two public hospitals are running at capacity, Mayor Sylvester Turner said.\n\nHouston Methodist's Boom said Texans need to \"behave perfectly and work together perfectly\" to slow the infection rate.\n\n\"When I look at a restaurant or a business where people...are not following the guidelines, where people are just throwing caution to the wind, it makes me angry,\" he said.\n\nJust 17 percent of intensive-care beds were available Wednesday in Alabama\u2014including just one in Montgomery\u2014though hospitals can add more, said Dr. Don Williamson, head of the Alabama Hospital Association.\n\n\"There is nothing that I'm seeing that makes me think we are getting ahead of this,\" he said.\n\nIn Arizona, emergency rooms are seeing about 1,200 suspected COVID-19 patients a day, compared with around 500 a month ago. If the trends continue, hospitals will probably exceed capacity within the next several weeks, said Dr. Joseph Gerald, a University of Arizona public health policy professor.\n\n\"We are in deep trouble,\" said Gerald, urging the state to impose new restrictions on businesses, which Gov. Doug Ducey has refused to do.\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, an infectious-disease expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, said he worries that states will squander what time they have to head off a much larger crisis.\n\n\"We're still talking about subtlety, still arguing whether or not we should wear masks, and still not understanding that a vaccine is not going to rescue us,\" he said.\n\nThe Texas governor initially barred local officials from fining or penalizing anyone for not wearing a mask as the state reopened. After cases began spiking, Abbott said last week that cities and counties could allow businesses to require masks. So did Arizona's Ducey, who is a Republican, as is Abbott.\n\nSome business owners are frustrated that officials didn't do more, and sooner, to require masks.\n\n\"I can't risk my staff, my clientele, myself, my family and everybody else in that chain just because other people are too inconvenienced to wear a piece of cloth on their face,\" said Michael Neff, an owner of the Cottonmouth Club in Houston. He closed it this week so staffers could get tested after one had contact with an infected person.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, ordered people to wear masks in public as the daily count of hospitalizations and new cases hovered near records. In Florida, several counties and cities recently enacted mask requirements.\n\nIn a sign of the shift in the outbreak, New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey announced they will ask visitors from states with high infection rates to quarantine themselves for 14 days. In March, Florida issued such an order for visitors from the New York City area, where cases were soaring.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department took aim at Hawaii's quarantine requirement for visitors, saying it discriminates against out-of-state residents. The Hawaii attorney general's office says there's no merit to the government's arguments and a related lawsuit from out-of-state property owners.\n\nCases also are surging in some other parts of the world. India reported a record-breaking one-day increase of nearly 16,000 cases. Mexico and Iraq hit new highs as well.\n\nBut China appears to have tamed a new outbreak in Beijing, again demonstrating its ability to mobilize vast resources by testing nearly 2.5 million people in 11 days. China, where the virus emerged last year, reported 19 new cases nationwide Thursday. While up from the day before, there was no sign of further geographic spread.\n\nWorldwide, over 9.4 million people have been confirmed infected, and nearly 500,000 have died, by Johns Hopkins' count.",
    " Title: Trump Denies Collusion Amidst Legal Troubles and Allegations of Unfit Conduct\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rally on Aug. 21, Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, reiterated his denial of Russian collusion, a claim that has become a recurring theme in his speeches. This denial came just hours after his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to several crimes, including tax evasion, bank fraud, and illegal campaign contributions. Cohen admitted to making six-figure payments to silence women during the 2016 election at Trump's behest, and he testified that Trump ordered him to circumvent the campaign-finance reporting system to make these payments.\n\nTrump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was also found guilty on eight felony tax and bank fraud charges the same day. Despite these legal setbacks, Trump persisted in denying collusion, a charge that, while it may be ancillary in the context of the ongoing investigations, has been a central focus of the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nThe specifics of Trump's knowledge regarding a meeting between Trump surrogates and Russian representatives, which took place in Trump Tower before the election, remain unclear. However, Trump's behavior since the investigations began has provided ample evidence of unfit conduct.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of Trump's behavior is his propensity for lying. Trump has been accused of lying about his involvement in Donald Trump Jr.'s statement regarding the Trump Tower meeting, lying about his knowledge of Michael Cohen's payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, and bullying and harassing law enforcement officials to halt investigations into him.\n\nPerhaps the most striking example of Trump's dishonesty was his public support of Russian President Vladimir Putin's denial of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, despite the U.S. intelligence community's findings to the contrary. This stance has been compared to blaming a scale for causing weight gain.\n\nWhile Trump may not have colluded with Russia, his behavior since the investigations began has lent credence to the possibility of his guilt. His uncontrollable compulsion to lie has led to the construction of a reality that is increasingly at odds with the truth. As Mark Twain once said, \"In what way has the president set a high example?\"\n\nIn the end, the real scandal isn't collusion; it is Donald Trump himself.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes $850 Billion Stimulus Package to Address Economic Impact of Coronavirus\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has announced plans to seek approval from Congress for an approximately $850 billion emergency stimulus package to mitigate the economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak. A senior administration official confirmed the proposal on Tuesday.\n\nThe official emphasized that the proposal is a tax proposal, not a spending stimulus, contradicting Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer's (D-NY) characterization of it as a spending stimulus. The Washington Post reported that the stimulus package could include a payroll tax cut and is expected to allocate about $50 billion to aid the airline industry specifically.\n\nDuring a Tuesday afternoon press briefing, President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also stated their intention to distribute direct payments to Americans as part of the proposal. Trump suggested the administration was considering a payroll tax cut, but also exploring other methods to swiftly provide funds to citizens.\n\nMnuchin stated that the administration aimed to distribute cash payments to Americans within the next \"two weeks,\" but did not specify the amount of the one-time payments.\n\n\"We're looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,\" Mnuchin told reporters at the White House.\n\nTrump has advocated for a payroll tax cut as a means of assisting those experiencing economic hardships due to the virus. On Monday, the president also stated that his administration would \"back the airlines 100 percent\" and would \"very strongly\" consider the industry's request for $50 billion in assistance.\n\nMnuchin is expected to present the stimulus package to Senate Republicans on Tuesday. He indicated that the proposal would also include payments to small businesses and loan guarantees to specific industries, such as airlines and hotels.\n\nSchumer, meanwhile, is expected to reveal a proposal outlining approximately $750 billion in spending to address the economic repercussions of the virus.\n\nIf approved, the stimulus package would mark the third legislative action taken by Congress to address the economic consequences of the virus, which has affected more than 4,000 people in the United States, caused significant stock market volatility, and led to school, business, and other closures across the country.\n\nThe news of the proposal was announced a day after the House passed a comprehensive package aimed at aiding American families impacted by the virus, which received support from President Trump.",
    " Title: Mason City Schools Teacher Expresses Concern Over Supreme Court Confirmation Process\n\nArticle:\n\nMaria Mueller, an Advanced Placement U.S. Government teacher in the Mason City Schools District, has expressed concern over the current Supreme Court confirmation process and its impact on students' understanding of the U.S. government.\n\nIn a statement, Mueller emphasized the importance of observing the Constitution at work, stating that witnessing the checks and balances established by the Founding Fathers is a valuable learning experience for her students. She cited the confirmation process of a Supreme Court justice as a vivid example of these checks and balances.\n\nRecently, Senator Rob Portman met with Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland but has announced his intention to block a vote on the nominee. This decision has been a topic of discussion in the media, with Portman stating that the confirmation should wait until after the upcoming presidential election.\n\nMueller expressed her hope that her students would have the opportunity to witness the Senate fulfilling its constitutional responsibility of advice and consent in the confirmation process. However, she expressed concern that the current political climate, marked by polarization, may not accurately represent the spirit of politics as described by Aristotle, who believed that politics is a noble endeavor that helps people understand themselves and relate to others.\n\nIn his March 18 Enquirer op-ed, Portman stated that waiting for a \"less partisan\" atmosphere would give the nominee more legitimacy and preserve the institutional credibility of the Senate and the court. Mueller, however, argued that delaying the confirmation process perpetuates the hyper-partisan atmosphere, rather than fostering spirited problem-solving.\n\nPortman has also suggested that the Senate's duty to give advice and consent is optional, comparing it to deciding to have dessert after dinner. Mueller found this comparison problematic, stating that neglecting clearly defined job expectations is not appropriate in any profession.\n\nMueller expressed concern that the blurring of truth in modern politics undermines students' trust in the government and their leaders. She urged Senator Portman to fulfill his duty as a public servant and set an example for students. If he continues to obstruct the confirmation process, Mueller fears he risks discrediting those who strive to prepare students to become the next generation's honorable leaders.\n\nIn conclusion, Mueller implored Portman to reconsider his position, stating that his actions could potentially undermine the students' trust in the government and the Constitution, and could suggest that the Founding Fathers' words are secondary to modern partisan politics.",
    " Title: Midterm Election Outlook: GOP Senate Prospects Improve, House Gains for Democrats Moderate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe midterm election landscape has undergone significant changes in the past six weeks, particularly in the Senate and House races. According to the Cook Political Report, led by analyst Charlie Cook, the most likely outcome for the Senate is a Republican net gain of one to three seats, moving the GOP up to either 52 or 53 seats. A shift of one seat or no net change is also possible, while a Democratic gain of two seats and a majority is considered long odds.\n\nIn the House, Democrats remain heavily favored to capture a majority, but their chances of a significant gain of 40-50 seats have diminished. In suburban-oriented districts, where most competitive House races are located, things remain challenging for Republicans. However, the more rural and small-town districts, with substantial numbers of Republicans, conservatives, and Trump backers, are now fully engaged, moving some of those districts back from the edge of competitiveness.\n\nIn the Senate, the most endangered incumbent is Democrat Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who has committed a series of unforced errors, including publicly identifying women as survivors of assault without their consent. Her 'no' vote against Justice Kavanaugh and her handling of the subsequent ad scandal have further damaged her chances.\n\nIn the New Jersey Senate race, national Democrats are growing anxious about scandal-plagued Bob Menendez's status. To counteract this, Hillary Clinton is reportedly raking in money for Menendez's campaign.\n\nIn the Arizona Senate race, a statistical review shows Republican Martha McSally on the rise, despite the media's efforts to run interference for her opponent, Kyrsten Sinema. A controversy arose when the Washington Post mischaracterized an accurate line of criticism from McSally, leading to calls for the article's deletion.\n\nIn a humorous twist, the Free Beacon team created a mashup ad featuring Kyrsten Sinema's damage control commercial and her various attacks against her own state. The ad, titled \"Elect me Senator, you crazy meth heads,\" has garnered attention on social media.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush Announces Exploratory Committee for Presidential Run, Faces Challenges Within Republican Party\n\nArticle:\n\nJeb Bush, the former Florida governor, announced on Tuesday the formation of an exploratory committee to pursue a run for the presidency in 2016. Historically, individuals who take this step typically declare their candidacy later.\n\nAccording to recent polls, Bush is among the top contenders for the Republican nomination. The McClatchy-Marist poll places him and Mitt Romney in the lead with 19 and 15 percent respectively, while a PPP poll positions Bush ahead of Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Paul Ryan, Rand Paul, and Ted Cruz.\n\nHowever, Bush does not have an insurmountable lead, and his candidacy may face challenges within the Republican Party. The article notes that his support for Common Core, comprehensive immigration reform, and his past consideration of tax increases as part of an overall budget reform package may not sit well with some in the party.\n\nDespite these potential disadvantages, Bush is expected to receive significant support from donors, bundlers, and those involved in independent expenditure. The article suggests that Bush will likely be the best-funded candidate in the Republican field, given the importance of independent expenditure political action committees in the last presidential election.\n\nShould Bush make it to the general election, he will face Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee. The article suggests that both candidates represent the center of their respective parties and are practical politicians. The debate between them could potentially result in agreement on several issues, something not seen in decades.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that Jeb Bush's entry into the race could provide the Republicans with their strongest candidate and possible nominee, and the American people with the prospect of the best debate and dialogue in a long time. The author, who knows both Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, describes them as considerate people committed to the broader interests of the American people, regardless of political party.",
    " Title: White House Dismisses Anecdotal Evidence of Obamacare's Impact on Job Growth and Part-Time Employment\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has dismissed anecdotal evidence suggesting that the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is negatively impacting job growth and the number of hours employees are working. Jason Furman, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisors, stated, \"We are seeing no systematic evidence that the Affordable Care Act is having an adverse impact on job growth or the number of hours employees are working... Since the ACA became law, nearly 90 percent of the gain in employment has been in full-time positions.\"\n\nHowever, concerns about taking on full-time staff and potential increased business costs due to the Affordable Care Act are prevalent among executives at staffing and payroll firms. Employers argue that part-time workers offer flexibility, allowing them to quickly offer full-time work when the economy improves, while keeping costs under control during economic downturns. The law, which requires employers with 50 or more full-time workers to provide healthcare coverage or incur penalties, is a frequently cited factor in requests for part-time workers, according to executives at several staffing firms.\n\nA decision to delay the mandate until 2015 has not significantly affected hiring decisions, they added. United Parcel Service Inc. plans to remove thousands of spouses from its medical plan due to the Affordable Care Act, citing it as a major reason for the decision. This move comes as many analysts downplay the Affordable Care Act's effect on companies like UPS, noting that the move reflects a long-term trend of shrinking corporate medical benefits.\n\nA potential issue arising from the Affordable Care Act is a \"quirk\" that could financially penalize some workers and their families. This quirk means that for some people, it will be more economical for their employer not to offer health insurance subsidies for them and their families, and for the entire family to instead purchase insurance with government subsidies on the Obamacare state health exchanges. This situation has been criticized as a \"catch-22,\" as low-wage workers offered \"affordable\" coverage at work may still find the rates out of reach, rendering them ineligible for government subsidies and potentially uninsured.\n\nA glut of people entering the exchanges due to employers dropping health coverage could cause logistical problems, increased costs, and breach of trust for workers and families who were promised they could keep their existing healthcare arrangements. This issue is currently under debate, with some citing anecdotal evidence and others relying on statistical analysis to support their arguments.",
    " Title: U.S. Army Trial of Maj. Nidal Hasan Begins for 2009 Fort Hood Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Army began the trial of Major Nidal Hasan on Tuesday for his role in the deadly attack on deployment-ready soldiers at Fort Hood on Nov. 5, 2009. In his opening statement, Major Hasan, who has long sought to declare his guilt, stated, \"The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter.\"\n\nHasan is accused of opening fire at a training center, resulting in the deaths of 13 individuals and injuries to numerous others. He was shot by a responding police officer and is now partly paralyzed from that injury.\n\nThough the final verdict is expected to be a conviction, the trial, which could last months, is significant to the military-justice system, the victims and their families, and the still-unresolved question of whether the attack was an act of terrorism. The trial's first day made those stakes clear.\n\nThe U.S. armed services have not carried out an execution since 1961. Eleven of 16 military death-penalty cases during the past 30 years have been overturned, leaving five soldiers at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., still awaiting execution.\n\nMilitary-justice experts say Col. Tara Osborn, the presiding judge, has gone to great lengths to ensure the verdict and sentence in this trial survive any appeals. For example, in the long run-up to the much-delayed trial, Hasan pleaded with the court to let him acknowledge his guilt, but Colonel Osborn, given that the prosecution is seeking the death penalty, denied that request. She has also allowed Hasan to defend himself, giving him wide legal leeway.\n\n\"This is one case they\u2019re absolutely determined to [not be brought down on appeal]. Since military capital punishment has been so plagued and riddled with errors, they\u2019re trying to learn from those mistakes [with the Hasan case], and they\u2019re going to [try to get a conviction] pretty much how long it takes, and whatever resources they take,\" David Frakt, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh, told the Monitor earlier this summer.\n\nThe scene at the readiness center was one of terror and mayhem, with unarmed soldiers trying to flee and hide behind desks and tables. Now, victims face the prospect of taking the stand to explain what they saw, and then being cross-examined by the man on trial for unleashing the fury of bullets against them.\n\nOsborn's ruling that Hasan can defend himself has been widely seen as an insult to survivors and the families of those who died. Delays in the trial have also worn on possible witnesses and the broader military community in Texas and beyond.\n\nYet at least some of the 30 victims scheduled to testify say they are anxious to help convict a man they see as a traitor.\n\n\"I\u2019m not going to dread anything. That\u2019s a sign of fear,\" injured Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford told the Associated Press. \"That man strikes no fear in my heart. He strikes no fear in my family. What he did to me was bad. But the biggest mistake that he made was I survived. So he will see me again.\"\n\nOn its first day, the trial shed light on the motives for the attack. Although President Obama on May 23 said that Hasan\u2019s act may have been \u201cinspired by larger notions of jihad,\u201d the Obama administration has defined the attack as an act of workplace violence.\n\nIn his opening statement Tuesday, Hasan said, \"Evidence will show I was on the wrong side of America's war and I later switched sides. We in the mujahideen are imperfect beings trying to establish a perfect religion.\u2026 I apologize for any mistakes I have made in this endeavor.\"\n\nOne of the prosecutors, Lt. Col. Steve Henricks, said of Hasan, \"He did not want to deploy [to Afghanistan] and he came to believe he had a jihad duty to murder soldiers.\" Hasan, Colonel Henricks said, wanted to \"kill as many soldiers as he could.\"\n\nGovernment officials say that starting in 2008 Hasan sent more than a dozen emails to Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric whom the U.S. killed with a drone strike in 2011.\n\nIn a pretrial motion, Hasan told Osborn that he had acted in defense of \"the leadership of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the Taliban\" by targeting U.S. soldiers ready to be deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. However, she said he could not use that defense in court. Legally, experts say, it would be impossible to prove, since there was no evidence that the particular soldiers he targeted posed any direct risk to Taliban leaders.\n\nThe issue is more than semantic. Victims are ineligible for some Army benefits because their injuries are not classified as \"combat related.\" Meanwhile, Hasan is still collecting a pension.\n\nIf classified as a terrorist attack, the Fort Hood shootings would be the deadliest on U.S. soil since 9/11. The shootings fit a shift in the war on terror after 9/11, in which plots against the American homeland were most often carried out by self-radicalized \"lone wolves.\"",
    " Title: President's Immigration Plan and the Latino Community: An Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the run-up to the presidential election, the incumbent is attempting to garner support from the Latino community, particularly in states like New Mexico and Colorado, by proposing a plan to grant work permits to young immigrants who meet certain criteria. However, the number of young people under 30 who are currently being pursued and deported is unclear.\n\nAccording to data, 16% of individuals aged 25 and under are among those who would potentially benefit from this plan. The President's proposal comes amid historically high unemployment levels among young people, with approximately 14.8% of the youth labor force unemployed in 2020.\n\nThe President's plan has been criticized for being a broken promise, as he has previously pledged to address this issue but has not done so during his term. The President's decision to prioritize healthcare reform over immigration reform has been a point of contention.\n\nThe President's plan was reportedly a response to pleas from Democratic senators. However, the plan has been criticized for potentially creating more competition in an already struggling cohort of the labor market. The President's proposal comes after two years of a Democrat majority, during which he could have pursued serious immigration reform but did not.\n\nThe plan has also been criticized for potentially hindering the passage of a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican, was reportedly working on a legislative solution to address the issue, but the President chose to pursue a more politically advantageous approach.\n\nThe President himself has acknowledged that the executive action is not a permanent solution, stating that it is not his to take. The analysis provided sets aside the President's controversial use of executive power, which has been criticized as a power grab detrimental to the separation of powers.\n\nCritics argue that the President's actions are self-serving, with the primary goal of winning over the Latino vote rather than addressing the issue in a meaningful and permanent way. The contrast between the President's approach and that of former President Reagan, who prioritized bipartisan cooperation, is highlighted in the analysis.",
    " Title: Republican Lawmakers Disrupt Impeachment Inquiry Proceedings, Delay Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary's Testimony\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development on Thursday, nearly two dozen Republican lawmakers, led by Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, disrupted a closed-door deposition of Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Laura Cooper as part of the impeachment probe into President Donald Trump. The chaotic scene, which delayed Cooper's testimony by hours, marked a new and more confrontational phase of the GOP attack on House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California and the Democratic impeachment investigation, according to Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb of CNN.\n\nThe Republican lawmakers, who flouted House rules to make a political point, entered a secure room, a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), where the closed hearings are taking place and where cellphones are not allowed. Some had to clarify that their tweets, which originally purported to be inside the facility, were actually posted from outside by staff members. They were brought pizza, which is allowed. They left at 2 p.m. for votes.\n\nThe most effective Republican gripe about the impeachment process thus far has been about process. There was no vote to kick things off. There have not yet been open hearings or transcripts released. The argument goes that if this is a trial, the President has been robbed of due process.\n\nIt's important to remember that Republicans who sit on the committees that are running the impeachment inquiry are in the hearings during testimony. However, it's certainly not an open process, and Trump does not have attorneys there.\n\nThe Constitution says very little about how the impeachment process should play out, and the courts have tried to stay out of it. But the trial phase will come later, in the Senate, if it gets to that. Democrats like Schiff have promised there will eventually be open hearings during the process.\n\nTrump's use of the term \"no quid pro quo\" in relation to the impeachment inquiry has been a topic of discussion. The term \"quid pro quo\" does not appear in the Federalist Papers, where Alexander Hamilton expanded on impeachable offenses, or in initial news stories about the whistleblower complaint. However, Trump had been using the term \"no quid pro quo\" with regard to Ukraine long before the whistleblower complaint was public and before any of the published reports about his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThis newsletter will focus on this consequential moment in US history.",
    " Title: President Trump Threatens to Deploy Military, Invokes Insurrection Act Amid Ongoing Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech in the Rose Garden on June 1, 2020, President Donald Trump threatened to deploy the U.S. military to restore order in American cities if mayors and governors fail to do so. The president's remarks came amid ongoing protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nTrump addressed the George Floyd case, calling it a \"brutal death,\" and the legal process underway in Minneapolis, stating, \"justice will be served.\" He also acknowledged the biggest victims of the disorder as people living in poor communities, the role of Antifa and looters in causing the mayhem, and the need to act vigorously to stop it.\n\nThe president's authority to send in the military under the Insurrection Act is well-established. Contrary to popular belief, the Posse Comitatus Act does not prohibit the use of federal troops for domestic law enforcement, but rather restricts such use when there is no statutory authorization. If the president determines that \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages\" are making it impossible to enforce the laws in a state, he can act.\n\nInvoking the Insurrection Act would not constitute imposing a dictatorship or waging a war on the American people, as it has been used in the past during incidents such as the Los Angeles riots in 1992, the riots in 1968, and to enforce federal desegregation law in 1957.\n\nHowever, it is unclear whether, as a practical matter, Trump could invoke the Insurrection Act over the objections of state and local officials. Having competing authorities trying to police the same out-of-control streets is not a formula for success.\n\nMinnesota has called out the National Guard, and Minneapolis, the first city to experience these disturbances, has been relatively calm for three straight nights. New York has avoided calling the Guard, and New York City was a scene of rioting and looting on Monday night. Cities need to impose early curfews, vigorously enforce them, and call out the National Guard if they have any doubt that the police can handle the situation on their own.\n\nTrump's language about \"dominating\" the streets was correct, but his performance was marred by his photo-op in front of St. John's church. The president's visit to the historic church after it was set on fire over the weekend was understandable, but the incident should have been more carefully considered to involve something more meaningful than waving a Bible in the air. If it is true that protestors were cleared away from the church to make way for the photo-op, it was a petty and foolish use of government authority.\n\nThe nation could be on the cusp of a full-blown crisis if the riots continue. It would be much better if our leaders, including the president, acted more responsibly in response.",
    " Title: Task Force Formed to Examine Extremist Groups in Britain; Two Arrested on Suspicion of Arson in Grimsby Mosque\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the brutal slaying of British soldier Lee Rigby in London, the British government has announced the formation of a task force to examine the dynamics behind extremist groups in the country. The group, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, will have a general focus on extremist groups but will primarily focus on Islamist extremists, according to a statement from Downing Street.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain has urged the task force to look at \"extremism from all quarters\" while forming an effective strategy. The council's secretary-general, Farooq Murad, stated, \"We must be vigilant and ensure we do not inadvertently give into the demands of all extremists: making our society less free, divided, and suspicious of each other. Lessons from the past indicate that policies and measures taken in haste can exacerbate extremism.\"\n\nThe formation of the task force comes after the brutal killing of Rigby near the Royal Artillery Barracks in southeast London, which shocked people across the United Kingdom. The incident also triggered a far-right-wing street demonstration in northern England, where irate protesters called for Muslims to leave Britain.\n\nLate Sunday, a mosque caught fire in the city of Grimsby on the country's east coast, and police arrested two men on suspicion of arson. The blaze coincided with inciting messages on social media \"by a small minority of individuals,\" according to Humberside County police. The men are currently in custody.\n\nNine people have been arrested in connection with the Woolwich attack, including three men who were taken into custody Saturday and another on Sunday. The three arrested Saturday were released early Monday on bail, police said. The men were being held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder, according to the Metropolitan Police.\n\nTwo men arrested at the scene of the killing are now under guard in South London hospitals after being shot in a confrontation with police. Britain's MI5 intelligence agency will report the results of a preliminary investigation into the suspects this week to the Intelligence and Security Committee, government sources said. The report is expected to be confidential.\n\nTwo women who were arrested Thursday were released shortly thereafter without charge. Addressing the crowd Saturday in Newcastle, far-right English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson said that Rigby's killing should be a wake-up call to British citizens. \"We can not allow this soldier's death to be in vain,\" Robinson said. \"We are the only ones who dare say it. When did the truth become hate speech?\" Police estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 people attended the rally, with a counter demonstration drawing a few hundred people, police said. Rigby's family visited the scene of his death on Sunday.",
    " Title: Global Temperatures Projected to Reach Critical Milestone in the 2030s, According to U.S. Climate Scientists\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo of the U.S. government's leading climate scientists have predicted that global temperatures will continue to rise over the next decade and will reach a critical milestone in the 2030s. The climate change that made the 2010s the hottest decade in recorded history will persist unabated in the 2020s, and by 2035, global temperatures will reach a critical level of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the scientists said.\n\nDeke Arndt, climate monitoring chief for NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, stated, \"Notwithstanding some sort of major, major geophysical event, it would be almost certain that the [next] decade will be warmer than the previous. It's almost certain that we would break one annual record during the process.\"\n\nGavin Schmidt, head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, added, \"The global warming trend line since the 1970s has been quite close to linear. Extrapolate forward and you would imagine we would cross 1.5 degrees around 2035.\"\n\nThe Paris climate accord aims to keep global temperatures from rising by 1.5 C or more to avert the worst climate catastrophes, such as rampant sea-level rise and more destructive wildfires, floods, and storms. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated last year that the window to limit warming to 1.5 C will close around 2030.\n\nThe scientists' report, released yesterday by NASA and NOAA, reached a conclusion similar to other climate agencies such as the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, which stated last week that 2019 was the second-hottest year since record-keeping began in 1880. The hottest year is 2016.\n\nWarming patterns are especially acute in the Arctic, which is heating up three times as quickly as the rest of the planet, Arndt said. At the same time, the amount of sea ice in the Arctic is falling, triggering sea-level rise and contributing to global warming.\n\nThe researchers attributed the recent trends to human-induced climate change caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions. \"Climate change in the past had nothing to do with human activity,\" Schmidt said, referring to warming that occurred thousands and hundreds of thousands of years ago due to Earth's orbit or massive asteroids or volcanic eruptions. \"That explanation fails in the 20th century because we know there hasn't been an asteroid and hasn't been a massive volcano.\"\n\nThe report was reprinted from Climatewire with permission from E & E News, which provides daily coverage of essential energy and environmental news at www.eenews.net.",
    " Title: Chicago Teachers Union Strike Prompts School Closures in Nation's Third-Largest School District\n\nArticle:\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 A massive teachers' strike in Chicago, the nation's third-largest school district, is set to begin Thursday, October 17, 2019, following months of negotiation between the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and Chicago Public Schools (CPS) failing to resolve disputes over pay, benefits, class size, and teacher preparation time. The strike, Chicago's first major walkout by teachers since 2012, has prompted the city to preemptively cancel classes.\n\nThe CTU, with approximately 25,000 members, confirmed Wednesday night that they would not return to their classrooms on Thursday. The union's demands include improved pay, smaller class sizes, and more time for teacher preparation. The strike will also affect 7,000 support staffers, whose union also failed to reach a contract agreement.\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot expressed disappointment over the union's decision to strike. She stated that the city had offered a 16% pay raise over a five-year contract, as well as language in the contract addressing \"enforceable targets\" on class size and increasing staffing levels for positions such as nurses, librarians, and social workers. However, the union's demands are estimated to cost an unaffordable $2.5 billion per year, according to Lightfoot.\n\nUnion leaders disputed Lightfoot's characterization of the city's willingness to concede to their demands on several issues, including class sizes. The city has agreed to make substantial changes on some of the union's top priorities, but the union's negotiators have issued additional demands, including a reduction of 30 minutes in the morning instructional time, a demand that Lightfoot has deemed unacceptable.\n\nCommunity organizations have been preparing for days to welcome students, offering programs such as a $100 per day camp for elementary school kids at the Shedd Aquarium, all-day programs run by the Boys & Girls Club of Chicago, and safe havens in churches and community centers. The YMCA of Metro Chicago expects the highest demand for its all-day programs for children between the ages of 5 and 12, who are too young to stay home alone but whose parents may oppose sending them to schools unstaffed by teachers.\n\nParents and community groups are scrambling to prepare for the strike, with some parents facing difficult decisions, such as single parents and those with inflexible schedules. The city's public libraries also are planning programs for students during the strike.",
    " Title: The Affordable Care Act: A Look at Its Passage and the Current Legal Challenge\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted in 2010, was a law that, due to modern partisan ideology, was primarily drafted and passed during a period of Democratic supermajority in Congress. The end of this Democratic supermajority has led to the current challenges the law faces, such as the ongoing case of King v. Burwell, which questions the interpretation of a specific phrase in the ACA and the federal government's ability to subsidize federal health exchanges.\n\nRepresentative Darrell Issa, in a tweet on November 7, 2014, stated, \"The sloppy and rushed nature of the process that created # Obamacare is rightly catching up to it.\" However, the ACA's passage was not necessarily rushed compared to most major bills. While initial congressional deliberations began in April 2009, President Obama signed the legislation an entire 11 months later in March 2010.\n\nDuring this period, Democrats advocated for expedited timetables to push the legislation through. Notably, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi broke her pledge to post the final legislative language of the ACA 72 hours in advance of the final vote. This unposted language is now at the heart of the Halbig v. Burwell case.\n\nOnce Scott Brown was elected in a special election in Massachusetts and broke the Democrats' supermajority, the Democrats had to resort to unconventional means for passing the bill. As Bernstein writes, \"ordinary fixes\" could not be implemented due to the unconventional passage method.\n\nThe ACA's policy focus on the individual mandate, guaranteed issue, and community rating (mandate/CR/GI system) was a point of contention for Republicans in 2010, who believed this system would worsen the American health care system. President Obama, in 2008, ran against this form of a health care system, and some Republicans had previously favored this type of system, but this is largely irrelevant to the current debate.\n\nThe Democrats' decision to exclude Republicans from the ACA drafting process early on has led to strong Republican opposition. By committing to the mandate/CR/GI system, Democrats also committed to strong Republican opposition, and had to commit to using reconciliation and eschewing \"ordinary fixes\" when the GOP gained the filibuster ability earlier than Democrats had hoped. Republicans have had no obligation to help Democrats fix the drafting errors in the legislation they crafted.",
    " Title: Sri Lanka's Gotabaya Rajapaksa Appoints Brother Mahinda as Prime Minister\n\nArticle:\n\nSri Lanka's newly-elected President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has named his brother, Mahinda, as prime minister, consolidating the influence of the Rajapaksa family in the South Asian nation. Mahinda, a former two-term president himself, is set to be sworn in as prime minister on Thursday following the resignation of Ranil Wickremesinghe after his party suffered a significant defeat in the weekend's presidential polls.\n\nThe Rajapaksa brothers are credited with ending Sri Lanka's 26-year-long civil war by brutally crushing the Tamil Tigers, with the security services they controlled accused of war crimes and multiple human rights abuses. Mahinda, aged 74, will be sworn in by his younger brother Gotabaya, aged 70. Two other brothers, Basil and Chamal, are also active in politics.\n\nPrime Minister Rajapaksa will have his cabinet appointed shortly after taking his oath of office, according to spokesman Vijayananda Herath. Gotabaya served as defense secretary under Mahinda during his decade as president, which ended in January 2015.\n\nWith Mahinda taking over as prime minister, Sri Lanka will for the first time have two brothers at the helm. During the first Mahinda presidency, the eldest brother, Chamal, was the speaker of the Sri Lankan parliament.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe formally announced his resignation, paving the way for the Rajapaksas to form a minority government ahead of snap elections, expected around April next year.\n\nIn his address to the nation, Wickremesinghe, 70, said he informed the new president of his intention to resign on Thursday, allowing a new minority government to be formed. Wickremesinghe's party put forward Sajith Premadasa in the presidential election but was soundly beaten by Gotabaya in a highly divisive election in the island nation of 21.6 million.\n\nLocal media reported that Rajapaksa, of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), would soon name an interim cabinet to govern the island until the next parliamentary election. A former war-time defense minister, Rajapaksa won the presidency by a significant margin in Saturday's vote, defeating former housing minister Premadasa, the candidate of Wickremesinghe's United National Party (UNP)-led coalition.\n\nNeither the UNP nor the opposition SLPP has an absolute parliamentary majority to form a government. Mahinda is expected to seek the post of prime minister in the next parliamentary election.\n\nIn the lead-up to the presidential vote, Rajapaksa's campaign emphasized his credentials as the defense secretary who brought an end to the bloody civil war between government forces and Tamil rebels. The new president has pledged to fight corruption and improve security in the wake of a series of bombings on Easter Sunday that killed more than 260 people. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) armed group claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\nRights groups have long called for investigations into alleged rights abuses committed during the Rajapaksas' previous terms in power, including United Nations allegations that more than 40,000 people were killed by security forces in the final days of the country's civil war in the north, as Tamil rebels took shelter among civilians. The new president also faces a civil suit in the United States for allegedly ordering the torture of a Tamil man and several others when he was the defense secretary.",
    " Title: Al Qaeda Core Weakened, but Affiliates Remain Active in Multiple Countries\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent debate, former U.S. President Barack Obama stated that al Qaeda's core leadership has been severely weakened, with the majority of its key players killed in recent years. This assertion was echoed by the current National Counterterrorism Director, Matt Olsen, who declared that al Qaeda's core is a shadow of its former self.\n\nHowever, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney argued that al Qaeda has spread to at least a dozen countries, posing an enormous threat to global security. This claim seems to be supported by the ongoing activities of al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen, North Africa, and other Middle Eastern countries.\n\nOne of the most concerning developments is the growth of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen. When Obama took office in 2009, AQAP was a newly formed affiliate, but it quickly became a more powerful al Qaeda franchise, plotting attacks outside Yemen's borders.\n\nNotable incidents attributed to AQAP include the failed 2009 attempt to kill the Saudi prince who ran the country's counterterrorism campaign, the 2009 attempt by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight as it approached Detroit on Christmas Day, and plans to blow up cargo planes destined for the United States in 2010 and to put a suicide bomber aboard a passenger aircraft earlier this year, which were thwarted by U.S. and allied intelligence services.\n\nThe Arab Spring has resulted in fundamental changes in many parts of the region, but the continued instability and fledgling governments also provide opportunities for terrorists. Al Qaeda is seeking to take advantage of the unrest in some areas, establishing safe havens and recruiting extremists where security is diminished.\n\nLarge swaths of Libya and Mali, for instance, have become safe havens for extremists, some associated with al Qaeda. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which operates in northern Africa, is one of the groups taking advantage of the situation. AQIM has acquired weapons from Libya this year, kidnapped Westerners, and continues its support to Nigerian-based Boko Haram.\n\nThe unrest in Syria has also provided an opportunity for al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), which has extended its reach into the war-torn nation. Although AQI's presence in Syria is considered small, intelligence officials worry it will grow as the chaos continues.\n\nDespite the weakening of al Qaeda's core leadership, the regional affiliates remain active, particularly in Yemen and North Africa, where the threat to Western interests and plotting against the homeland remain strong. The continued instability in the Middle East and North Africa, coupled with the resurgence of extremist groups, underscores the need for a comprehensive strategy to combat extremism and terrorism.",
    " Title: Obama's Negotiating Style Shows More Combative Approach in Fiscal Cliff Talks\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's negotiating style during the ongoing fiscal cliff discussions has shown a more combative approach compared to his previous, more conciliatory style. This shift in approach can be traced back to the lessons Obama learned from his hard-fought victory in the 2012 election.\n\nAfter his re-election, Obama's newfound confidence and resolve not to be swayed by a recalcitrant Republican Party stem from the nature of his convincing November win over Mitt Romney. The president's victory was secured by supporters following his perceived poor performance at the Denver debate, which instilled in him a greater sense of confidence and a resolve not to be outmaneuvered by the GOP, as he was during the 2011 debt ceiling debate.\n\nAccording to interviews with staffers and friends for \"The End of the Line,\" an eBook published in collaboration between \u2588\u2588\u2588 and Random House, Obama's new toughness is rooted in the significance of his 2012 victory. His legacy was at stake, and he is now determined to extract bipartisanship from the Republicans, a commitment he feels he owes to the people who voted for him.\n\nOne of Obama's top aides stated, \"There's no doubt that he found this one to be sweeter than the last one. It was weighing on him how much was at stake, how much of his entire legacy was on the line. His legacy had not been determined by the previous four years; that wouldn't matter to history. It was all about the outcome on Election Day.\"\n\nWith the election now in the history books, those around the president view him as a resilient and popular figure who can potentially unify the country, if only the opposition will cooperate.\n\nWhen the book's authors asked David Plouffe, Obama's most influential political adviser, whether the campaign's organizational success could be replicated with other Democrats, he responded emphatically. \"The organization doesn't exist without belief in the candidate... they turned out for Barack Obama,\" he said. \"It was all because of him.\"\n\nHowever, the euphoria from Election Day has proven to be short-lived. The White House has been thrust into a repetitive partisan battle, making any talk of a new \"mandate\" seem implausible. Romney was a formidable opponent Obama had prepared for extensively for nearly two years. A fractious, collapsing GOP House majority leaves him in a more precarious and uncertain position, at least in the short term.\n\nSo far, Obama has maintained a tough stance, refusing to provide specifics on spending and entitlement cuts, and threatening GOP leaders\u2014whose popularity is waning\u2014with the bully pulpit of his inauguration and State of the Union speech. However, many Hill Democrats, accustomed to seeing Obama compromise, remain cautiously optimistic.\n\nA top Senate Democrat, who is apprehensive about the administration's overtures to the GOP on entitlement reform, expressed a measured optimism: \"So far, so good. [But] we'll see how this shakes out.\"",
    " Title: Susan Rice's Changing Story on Unmasking Incident Raises Questions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe situation surrounding Susan Rice's involvement in the unmasking of Donald Trump or his associates during the Obama administration has become a topic of debate, with Rice's changing narrative raising questions about the allegations.\n\nInitially, Rice stated that she was unaware of any such incidents and was learning about them from news reports. However, following reports by Fox News and Bloomberg, Rice broke her silence on MSNBC, asserting that requesting the identities of Americans picked up on foreign intercepts was a common and necessary part of her job. She denied that these requests were made for political purposes.\n\nRice's shift from professed ignorance to claiming that her actions were not improper has sparked a series of questions. Did Rice seek the identities of Trump associates solely for intelligence reasons, or did she have political motivations? Did she leak any of the findings, or cause them to be leaked? Rice denied leaking anything related to her successor, Michael Flynn, whose false denials about contacts with the Russian ambassador led to his dismissal by President Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post and New York Times have downplayed the allegations, with the Times depicting them as something circulating in conservative media. Some critics on the right argue that these outlets are covering for Rice. ABC, NBC, and CBS did not cover the allegations on Monday's evening newscasts, while the \"CBS Evening News\" quoted a former official as saying Rice did \"nothing improper or political.\"\n\nThe media's handling of the story has been a subject of criticism, with some outlets unwilling to confirm the allegations due to a lack of verifiable evidence. This has led to a dilemma regarding whether to publish stories based on other outlets citing unnamed sources when one's own reporters cannot verify the information.\n\nSome media outlets, such as CNN, have been criticized for their dismissive attitude towards the allegations. Anchor Don Lemon told viewers that suggesting the Trump team was spied on illegally was an insult to their intelligence and an attempt to misinform the American people. CNN's national security correspondent, Jim Sciutto, also dismissed the allegations, stating that the Bloomberg scoop on Rice was \"largely ginned up, partly as a distraction from this larger investigation.\"\n\nCritics argue that Sciutto's dismissal of the allegations is problematic, given his previous role as a diplomat in the Obama State Department from 2011 to 2013. Some believe that he should have recused himself from covering the story due to potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThe media's response to the story has been polarized, with some outlets more interested in proving a Russia/Trump conspiracy and others more interested in proving an Obama surveillance conspiracy. Despite the lack of hard facts, it would be beneficial for the same standards to be applied to both parts of this complex story.",
    " Title: Thousands Protest President Trump's Visit to the United Kingdom\n\nArticle:\n\nThousands of protesters are demonstrating in London during President Donald Trump's visit to the United Kingdom. According to CNBC, over 60 protests are scheduled to take place throughout Trump's four-day working visit, with estimates of 50,000 to 100,000 people participating in the demonstrations.\n\nProtesters began gathering on Friday morning, carrying signs and placards criticizing the president for his policies and rhetoric. One protester has gained attention on social media for dressing up as a \"Trump Dalek,\" a reference to a feared fictional race from the popular British television program \"Doctor Who.\"\n\nIn addition, a blimp depicting Trump as a baby was flown over Parliament Square.\n\nDespite Trump's statement on Thursday that he believes London citizens \"like [him] a lot,\" he later expressed feeling \"unwelcome\" in London due to the planned protests. Trump told The Sun newspaper, \"I used to love London as a city, but when they make you feel unwelcome, why would I stay there?\"\n\nTrump's schedule only includes one night in London and aims to avoid the planned protests. In January 2017, over 1 million people in the U.K. signed a petition demanding Trump's visit be canceled following his executive order blocking refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.",
    " Title: Chicago Mayor Distances City, Police Department from Racially-Charged Photo\n\nArticle:\n\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has distanced the city and the Chicago Police Department from a racially-charged photo that surfaced this week, which depicts two former police officers in a pose reminiscent of hunters with an African-American man lying on the ground with deer antlers on his head.\n\nThe photo, believed to have been taken between 1999 and 2003 at a Chicago police station, was published in the Chicago Sun-Times after a Cook County judge declined to keep the photo out of the public eye. The photo features officers Timothy McDermott and Jerome Finnigan, who are both white, kneeling over an unidentified African-American drug suspect.\n\nMayor Emanuel stated, \"That photo does not represent the values of the city of Chicago that we all share in common. It does not represent the values of the Police Department.\"\n\nThe publication of the photo comes as Chicago, like many other big cities in the USA, is grappling to repair damaged relations in the African-American community. Earlier this month, the city council approved an unprecedented reparations package for mostly African-American victims who were tortured by police officers under the control of former police commander Jon Burge.\n\nFrom 1972 through 1991, the suspects were subjected to mock executions, electric shock, and beatings with telephone books as their interrogators flung racial epithets at them. A Chicago Police Department review board ruled in 1993 that Burge's officers had used torture. He was fired.\n\nIn April, the city approved a $5 million payout to Laquan McDonald, a black teenager fatally shot 16 times by police last fall. Last month, Superintendent Garry McCarthy announced a listening tour to meet with residents and community leaders to mend strained relations between police and minority communities.\n\nThe officers in the antler photo were part of a disgraced special unit that was accused of robbing drug dealers and other individuals of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Finnigan is serving a 12-year prison sentence for robbery and home invasion after pleading guilty in 2011.\n\nMcDermott was not charged with any criminal wrongdoing, but was fired from the police department last year based on the photo. The Chicago Police Board, which oversees disciplinary matters, voted 5-4 to fire McDermott. The dissenting board members thought a suspension was a more appropriate punishment.\n\nMcDermott has sued to reverse his dismissal. In an internal affairs investigation, he described the incident as a youthful indiscretion. \"I was asked to join the photo and I did so without exercising proper judgment,\" McDermott said according to the transcript. \"I made a mistake as a young impressionable police officer who was trying to fit in. I wish I could go back and change this split second decision.\"\n\nThe photo came to the attention of the CPD after federal prosecutors gave the photo to police in 2013 after Finnigan had been sentenced to prison. The department sought to keep the image out of the public eye, arguing they wanted to protect the privacy of the suspect shown in it, but a judge refused to hide the picture in March. The Sun-Times obtained the image in the court file. Police were never able to identify the suspect, who was never charged.\n\n\"As the superintendent of this department, and as a resident of our city, I will not tolerate this kind of behavior,\" McCarthy told the Sun-Times. \"I fired one of the officers and would have fired the other if he had not already been fired by the time I found out about the picture.\"",
    " Title: Cruz Wins All Colorado Delegates Amid Trump's Controversy Over Caucus Process\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) secured all 34 delegates from Colorado in the Republican presidential race this weekend, despite the state not holding a traditional primary election. The move has sparked controversy and criticism from Donald Trump, who took to Twitter on Sunday, calling the results \"totally unfair.\"\n\nIn August, Colorado Republican leaders canceled the party's presidential straw poll to avoid binding delegates to a candidate who might not survive until the Republican National Convention in July. Instead, Republicans selected national delegates through a caucus process, which put the election of national delegates in the hands of party insiders and activists, leaving approximately 90% of the more than 1 million Republican voters on the sidelines.\n\nTrump, in a series of tweets, expressed his displeasure with the results, stating, \"How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger \u2013 totally unfair!\" and \"The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!\"\n\nHowever, it was the Trump campaign that chose not to compete in Colorado, citing a system that favored party insiders as their reason for not getting involved. In contrast, the Cruz campaign had been in Colorado for months, working to round up endorsements in the state and win over delegates.\n\nRep. Ken Buck (R-CO), Cruz's state chairman, stated, \"Over 100 people have been working since last year, to get people out to caucuses to elect people to the convention. Now we are in the process of seeing a return on our investment.\"\n\nWhether or not one agrees with Colorado's decision last year to cancel its traditional caucus is a separate issue. Cruz won fair and square by working within the process and rules that were established, his campaign spokeswoman noted.",
    " Title: Pelosi and Fellow Democrats Differ on Impeachment of President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has stated that it is \"not worth it\" to attempt to impeach President Donald Trump, citing potential division within the country as a primary concern. In an interview with the Washington Post, Pelosi expressed that there should only be an impeachment effort if there is \"something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan.\"\n\nHowever, Pelosi also expressed her belief that Trump is unfit to be president, stating, \"Are we talking ethically? Intellectually? Politically? What are we talking here? All of the above. No. No. I do not think he is... I mean, ethically unfit. Intellectually unfit. Curiosity-wise unfit. No, I do not think he's fit to be president of the United States.\"\n\nReaction from fellow Democrats on Pelosi's rejection of impeachment is mixed. Some Democrats believe there is not enough evidence against the president or public support for impeachment, while others are not giving up their push to impeach him.\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Examiner that she disagrees with the speaker, stating that Pelosi's view could change if something is revealed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nOther members of the party, such as Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), are already pushing for impeachment. Waters, the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, is probing Trump's finances and has stated that she believes there is enough evidence to impeach Trump.\n\n\"The Constitution gives us the authority and the responsibility to decide whether a president is acting in the best interest of his country... I believe we have everything needed to basically impeach Trump,\" Waters recently stated on MSNBC.\n\nWaters has also been vocal on Twitter, stating, \"For the faint of heart, who've been waiting for every 't' to be crossed and every 'i' to be dotted, now is the time to demonstrate your patriotism. Support impeachment!\"\n\nFreshman congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) has also expressed her support for impeaching Trump, publicly calling him a \"motherf***er\" and announcing plans to introduce a resolution for the Judiciary Committee to move on investigating grounds for impeachment.\n\n\"Today, I announced that later this month, I will be introducing a resolution to have the Judiciary Committee move on investigating grounds for impeachment. Our democracy must be protected,\" Tlaib tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, the left-wing media is not giving up on their hopes of impeaching Trump. MSNBC's Chris Matthews stated, \"Some argue that the push for impeachment (of President Trump) is ahead of schedule. I think a stronger argument can be made it's behind schedule.\"",
    " Title: Federal Judge Clarifies: Government Can Mandate School Attendance, but Not Provide Education\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal judge has ruled that the government can compel attendance at schools, but cannot be forced to provide an education there. In a case originating from Detroit, Judge Stephen Murphy III of the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, dismissed a lawsuit accusing Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and other state officials of depriving students of a right to education or even basic literacy while the city was under emergency management.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that this lack of education violated their Due Process and Equal Protection rights under the 14th Amendment. The State of Michigan contended that the complaint, a demand for \"access to literacy,\" was not constitutionally recognized. The judge agreed, though he expressed sympathy for the students, and dismissed the case.\n\nWhile the dismissal has sparked outrage and the plaintiffs have vowed to appeal, it should not come as a surprise. Courts have been hesitant to define what constitutes a \"right\" to education, though they have allowed the government to enforce school attendance. A Supreme Court case from 1973, San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, determined that the U.S. Constitution did not establish a \"fundamental right to education.\"\n\nIn this case, the plaintiffs argued that they were not receiving any education at all. However, the question remains whether this argument is distinct enough to contradict previous precedents. The Supreme Court has stated that a good or service's importance does not determine whether it is a fundamental right.\n\nThe judge noted that courts have ruled there is no fundamental right to water or sewer service, and the Due Process Clause does not compel the state to protect a child from an abusive parent or a bully in school. Therefore, the state cannot be affirmatively ordered to provide students even the basic level of education to achieve literacy.\n\nThis ruling does not imply that the judge's decision is incorrect. If courts were to mandate schools to provide a certain level of education, numerous lawsuits would likely follow as individuals argue over what constitutes that level of education. The ongoing culture war within the education system about what schools should teach further complicates matters. The last thing we need, according to the judge, is for the courts to become embroiled in determining those boundaries.\n\nHowever, people should take away from this ruling the importance of competition and choice in driving school improvement. If courts cannot mandate schools to provide a certain level of education, parents and students must be free to choose other schools. Education should be a marketplace, the judge argued, citing evidence that charter schools and other school choice options lead to public school improvements.\n\nIf the courts lack the authority to force schools to provide a certain level of education, it is crucial that parents have access to school choice to decide what is best for their children.",
    " Title: Muslims in India and Bangladesh Celebrate Subdued Eid al-Fitr Amid COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nMuslims in India and Bangladesh observed a muted Eid al-Fitr on Monday, marking the conclusion of the holy month of Ramadan under the influence of the coronavirus pandemic. The three-day holiday, which typically involves travel, family gatherings, and feasts after weeks of dawn-to-dusk fasting, was marked by home prayers, quieter celebrations, and concerns about the virus and the impact of lockdowns and other restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19, the highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\nIn New Delhi, outside the iconic Mughal-era Jama Masjid, closed as part of a ban on religious congregations, security officers patrolled the streets, and almost all shops were closed, except for a sweets shop. Police made rounds on motorbikes, and a mini police camp stood just outside a gate.\n\n\"It's been 1,400 years since the Islam religion was founded... even our elders could never imagine that we will have to celebrate Eid in such a way,\" businessman Shehzad Khan told The Associated Press news agency. He stated that money typically spent on new clothes for Eid was sent to the poor, who have lost their livelihoods due to the virus and the measures taken to contain it.\n\n\"That money we have given them so that they too can celebrate Eid with us,\" Khan said.\n\nIn Bangladesh, authorities discouraged mass prayers in open fields, which normally attract tens of thousands. Devotees could join prayers at mosques while maintaining safe distances. On Monday morning, those praying in the country's more than 300,000 mosques wore masks, and many wore gloves as well.\n\nIn Dhaka's main Baitul Mokarram mosque, thousands joined the prayers in phases as authorities allowed them to enter in groups, and prayers were held every hour. Many waited in lines for more than an hour to enter the premises.\n\n\"This is a new experience. We never felt like this,\" government official Abdul Halim told The AP news agency after attending the prayer. \"I did not bring my two sons for the prayers, they are staying home. My family could not visit my parents this time.\"\n\nAcross the two countries, government and religious leaders appealed to Eid celebrants to follow lockdown norms and maintain a safe physical distance. India has reported over 138,000 cases and 4,000 deaths, placing it among the world's largest coronavirus outbreaks. It has eased its strict lockdown in recent weeks, including allowing domestic flights to resume starting Monday.\n\n\"Eid Mubarak!\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted. \"May this special occasion further the spirit of compassion, brotherhood, and harmony. May everyone be healthy and prosperous.\"\n\nNew cases and deaths from COVID-19 are rising in Bangladesh, which has confirmed 35,585 cases and 501 deaths. Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina offered Eid greetings but emphasized the need to maintain health guidelines and for individuals to stay safe.\n\n\"Your safety is in your hands. Remember that if you remain safe, you are also keeping your family, neighbors, and the country safe,\" she said in an address to the nation.",
    " Title: Politicians Opt for Fiscal Binge as Bipartisan Spending and Tax Cuts Loom\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement made by former speechwriter for President Richard Nixon, William Safire, it was revealed that Nixon was often urged to take the \"easy way\" in his speeches, only to reject such advice in favor of making the right decisions. This anecdote serves as a backdrop for the current political landscape, where the difficulty of removing benefits from voters is contrasted with the ease of providing them.\n\nAccording to Robert Bixby, executive director of The Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan budget watchdog, the political logic behind this trend is simple: \"You get what you want. We get what we want. And the future will pay for it.\" This dynamic is further emphasized by Marc Goldwein, senior policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, who warns of the high risk of irresponsibility.\n\nThe article suggests that the failure to repeal Obamacare will not deter politicians from pursuing tax cuts and infrastructure spending, potentially leading to a fiscal binge that caters to the immediate interests of all parties, at the expense of future generations. The proposed tax cuts, infrastructure bill, and increased spending on projects like road and airport renovation could lead to a significant increase in the national deficit, a concern that is seemingly disregarded by many in Washington.\n\nThe article also touches upon the possibility of tax reform, with President Donald Trump indicating a move towards tax reform after the failed healthcare overhaul. However, the article suggests that Republicans may not be deterred by anything short of a comprehensive overhaul, and will likely settle for tax cuts if a comprehensive reform is unattainable.\n\nThe article further discusses the potential for a border adjustment tax, a proposal that could generate enough revenue to offset the losses from other changes, but is unlikely to be approved due to its potential to raise consumer prices and its complexity. The path of least resistance, according to the article, involves dropping the proposal and not bothering to pay for the tax cuts.\n\nThe article also highlights the challenges in finding savings to pay for the tax cuts, as cutting tax breaks cherished by millions or curtailing outlays are unpopular options. The article also mentions the possibility of cutting spending in entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but notes that Trump, as a candidate, had promised not to go after Social Security and Medicare.\n\nThe article concludes by discussing the potential for increased spending on infrastructure and jobs bills, with both parties expressing interest in such legislation. However, the article warns that this spending, while it may stimulate growth in the short term, could lead to a further enlargement of the national debt and a greater burden on future generations. The article suggests that this approach, while politically appealing, is not the responsible way forward.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts Shifts Role as Swing Vote in Recent Decisions\n\nArticle:\n\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts' role as the court's new swing vote has become increasingly apparent in recent weeks, as he has been the deciding justice in several high-profile 5-4 decisions. In Monday's decision in June Medical Services v. Russo, Roberts sided with the liberal members to rule against a Louisiana law restricting who can perform abortions, upholding precedent from a similar case in 2016 in which he was on the other side. This followed his vote in rejecting the Trump administration's attempt to rescind DACA and his vote in a 6-3 decision that prohibited employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nIn a recent school choice case, Roberts sided with the conservatives, delivering a win for the school choice movement on Tuesday. However, Monday's decision in June Medical Services v. Russo marked a significant victory for reproductive rights, as the Supreme Court confirmed the decision to get an abortion as a constitutional right.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the decision a \"major victory for reproductive rights,\" while Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, observed a similar trend in Roberts' decisions but was less enthusiastic about it. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., celebrated Monday's ruling while pointing out that it went against Republican political preferences.\n\nRoberts' history of separating himself from the court's conservative contingent in key cases goes back years. In 2012, by siding with the liberal wing and reinterpreting an individual mandate as a tax, he allowed ObamaCare to be found constitutional. Additionally, last year he joined with liberals again in shutting down the Trump administration's efforts to add a citizenship question to the census.\n\nPresident Trump called the recent decisions \"shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives.\" Trump indicated that he was not confident in the current makeup of the court, despite the majority of justices being Republican appointees.\n\nJustices Anthony Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor, both recent examples of swing vote justices, were appointed by President Ronald Reagan. Justice David Souter, who was chosen by President George H.W. Bush, often sided with the court's liberal contingent. In 1992's landmark Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court upheld the right to an abortion in a 5-4 decision. All five majority votes \u2013 O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, John Paul Stevens, and Harry Blackmun -- were appointed by Republicans.\n\nDespite the attention to Roberts' recent left-leaning votes, he has on many occasions remained with conservatives in 5-4 decisions. According to statistics compiled by SCOTUSBlog, the court's October 2018 term featured 17 cases that resulted in 5-4 decisions where all four liberal justices voted together. Of these, Roberts turned out to be a deciding vote in 10 of them, sticking with his fellow conservatives seven times and voting with liberal justices three times.\n\nThe Supreme Court still has nearly a dozen cases left to decide this term, with several having significant political implications. Their issues include whether states can force members of the Electoral College to vote in accordance with the state's popular vote, and whether President Trump's tax returns can be released to House committees or Manhattan prosecutors.",
    " Title: Worldwide Threats to Free Speech Amidst the Coronavirus Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the global coronavirus pandemic, liberal democratic institutions and values are under threat from potential authoritarian power grabs, often referred to as \"corona coups.\" One of the first casualties, as history has shown, is freedom of speech. This current attack on free speech, however, is particularly dangerous as it not only targets \"fake news\" related to the coronavirus, but also criticism of inadequacies in hospitals by healthcare workers.\n\nThe term \"fake news\" gained prominence during the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, leading to a surge in concern and pressure on social media platforms to \"fight fake news.\" Despite the ongoing debate about the actual impact of \"fake news\" and \"Russian interference,\" many mainstream politicians attribute their loss of votes and power to populists to the spread of such misinformation.\n\nRecent calls for the suppression of \"fake news\" have intensified with the coronavirus crisis, providing an opportunity for populist leaders to pass draconian new laws under the guise of preventing misinformation. One of the most extreme examples comes from Hungary, where the parliament, without facing an actual emergency, has passed \"emergency measures\" to grant far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n \"dictatorial powers.\" Under these measures, anything deemed \"fake news\" is punishable by up to five years in prison, effectively silencing independent media in Hungary.\n\nAnother concerning development is the suppression of free speech from healthcare workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus fight. These individuals are best informed about the situation and could potentially counteract fake news. However, in some countries, including the UK and the U.S., healthcare workers are being silenced over issues such as protective equipment shortages. In the U.S., private hospitals are prioritizing their brand and profits over the health of their patients and staff, threatening termination for those who speak out about the lack of protective gear.\n\nCensoring healthcare professionals is not only a violation of free speech but also poses a danger to the broader community. These individuals risk their lives daily to help others, particularly if their employers do not provide them with adequate protective gear.\n\nThe irony lies in the fact that some of the same politicians who support or allow the censorship of healthcare professionals in their own countries have been vocal critics of China's approach. For instance, British cabinet minister Michael Gove and U.S. Representative Michael McCaul have accused China of failing to stop the spread of coronavirus and of orchestrating one of the worst cover-ups in history, respectively.\n\nTo avoid repeating the mistakes made in China and to protect the health and lives of healthcare workers, it is crucial to resist these attacks on free speech and unnecessary authoritarian measures during the coronavirus crisis. Free speech not only makes us safer as citizens but also as patients, even during a health crisis.",
    " Title: Texas Senator Ted Cruz Announces Early Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz has officially announced his candidacy for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, making him the first major candidate to declare his intention to run. The announcement, made via a midnight tweet and video, comes earlier than most presidential candidates' unofficial spring costume declarations, a move that aligns with Cruz's bold and unconventional political style.\n\nCruz, who has been a controversial figure in the Republican party since his 2012 Senate campaign, has not been a frontrunner in the party's 2016 discussions. However, he maintains an undeniable appeal to the party's base voters, who are influential in primary elections, particularly in red states.\n\nThere are at least five reasons for Cruz to make his move as the first major candidate, according to political analysts.\n\n1. Cutting through the noise and confusion created by the expanding GOP field: Cruz's early announcement aims to give the media a relatively fresh face to focus on, helping him stand out amidst the growing list of potential candidates.\n\n2. Raising funds: Cruz's campaign faces a significant challenge in fundraising. By launching a full-fledged campaign early, Cruz can begin actively soliciting donations, particularly from his home state of Texas, which is a significant source of political funding.\n\n3. Skipping the exploratory committee phase: Cruz's decision to forego the exploratory committee phase eliminates the usual pre-campaign formalities, positioning his bid as more serious and reinforcing his image as a straightforward candidate.\n\n4. Bolstering his bid for the conservative activists' support: Cruz's early announcement serves to establish himself as a leader among the party's conservative activists, helping him stand out from other potential candidates vying for the same support.\n\n5. Maximizing media exposure: Cruz's early announcement allows him to test the political market and maximize his media exposure, even if not all attention is positive. Cruz thrives on controversy and uses it to bolster his image as a crusader for conservative causes.\n\nThe presidential nominating game, it is said, has two winners: the presidential nominee and the running mate. Cruz's early announcement may serve to discourage some of his natural rivals on the right and eclipse some of the lesser-known candidates. Even if Cruz's candidacy does not succeed, the early announcement ensures he will have had 10 months of formal candidacy, providing ample opportunity to test the political market and maximize media exposure.",
    " Title: \"The Importance of Nuanced Political Discourse in a Divided America\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent election, philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre's description of modern politics as \"civil war carried on by other means\" resonates deeply. The United States continues to grapple with political disagreements, but the question looming in the background is whether the nation will maintain a \"modest unity\" or slip into a darker period of division.\n\nThe nature of Donald Trump's campaign and the subsequent reaction to him have raised the stakes. Some reactions include cathartic rants, insisting \"there's no such thing as a good Trump voter,\" and equating critiques of identity politics with endorsements of white nationalism. As the less qualified person ever to hold the presidency, Trump's erratic Twitter diplomacy, sensitive reactions to late-night comedy, and undisciplined remarks have raised concerns about his judgment and temperament.\n\nHowever, some failures weaken political power and sideline political agendas, while others result in international crises and catastrophic loss of life. Insisting \"he's not my president\" and excoriating anyone willing to work for him puts the nation on a path toward the wrong kind of failure.\n\nInstead of simply blaming others or pledging unqualified resistance, those uncomfortable with the state of the country and the prospects of a Trump administration might first look inward. Rather than denouncing this impending presidency out of hand, we could begin by asking concretely and individually how we should become more engaged in our politics.\n\nFor some of us, this will involve voicing dissent and monitoring from afar. For others, it will involve risky partnerships with those ascending to power. All of us could stand to extend a little grace to those who pursue either dissent or partnership for the sake of maintaining our modest unity. Those focused on dissent might recognize prudential limits to their posture, forgoing absolute resistance to publicly support sensible nominees who do not share all of their politics but who will help govern effectively.\n\nMoreover, it is essential to remember that not all political opponents are the face of evil, the belly of racism, or the pit of depravity. Critics of Trump rightly denounced his caricatures of \"the blacks\" and his unconscionable flirtation with a \"Muslim registry.\" However, we should also question the elitist rage now targeting and demonizing \"working-class whites\" or \"white evangelicals,\" as though the responsibility for the fate of the country now rests solely with some category of people constructed by exit polls.\n\nAnyone still confident that \"those people\" are the proximate cause of Trump's victory might think more carefully about the 28% of Latino voters or the 13% of black male voters who cast their ballots for Trump. Or spend a few minutes reading interviews with Trump voters. Resist the urge to read only those stories that confirm your priors, and you'll encounter gay Millennial women, Muslim immigrants, and disabled veterans who voted for him. This election, like all elections, is a complicated story.\n\nThe more we neglect political nuance and the more we simply blame \"those people\" for the current state of affairs, the less likely we are to see in others a shared humanity, to say nothing of a shared project of self-governance. For the sake of our modest unity, we can do better. We must do better.\n\nWe must remind ourselves that people\u2014and voters\u2014are more complex than labels. We must speak, write, and tweet with care, depth, and nuance. We must avoid the lazy thinking that encourages stereotyping. We might also try to listen to what \"those people\" have to say. Too often, we expect them to hear what we have to say without bothering to return the favor.\n\nAlong the way, we might come to see that \"those people\" are \"our people,\" too. And that politics, as MacIntyre reminds us, is still far preferable to the alternative. John Inazu, the Sally D. Danforth Distinguished Professor of Law and Religion at Washington University in St. Louis, is the author of \"Confident Pluralism: Surviving and Thriving Through Deep Difference.\"",
    " Title: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Seeks Full Scope of Mueller's Russia Investigation Document from Justice Department\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, has requested the Justice Department to provide a document detailing the full scope of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. In a letter sent to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on May 18, Grassley stated that the special counsel's team recently provided an unredacted copy of the memo, which Rosenstein wrote on Aug. 2, 2017, to Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman who was indicted for bank and tax fraud related to his work in Ukraine.\n\nGrassley argued that Congress, like the Judiciary, is a separate branch of government with its own constitutional duties that often require access to Executive Branch information. He stated that the interests of the committee relate to both legislative and oversight responsibilities.\n\nMueller's team has argued that he did not have the jurisdiction to investigate areas not related to possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Manafort's lawyers have also questioned the timing of the memo, which Rosenstein wrote nearly three months after Mueller was appointed special counsel.\n\nGrassley also expressed interest in the timing of the Rosenstein memo, asking, \"The August Memorandum states that it addresses the special counsel's authorization as of the date he was appointed. Why was this memorandum not drafted until August 2017?\"\n\nGrassley has been a supporter of the Mueller investigation, and he has publicly warned President Trump against taking steps to shut down the investigation or fire Mueller. He stated, \"As I have said numerous times, that investigation should be free to follow the facts wherever they lead without any improper outside interference. However, that does not mean that it is immune from oversight or that information about the scope of its authority under existing Department regulations should be withheld from Congress.\"",
    " Title: Crowdfunding Campaign Raises Over $3 Million to Oppose Sen. Susan Collins in 2020 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Sen. Susan Collins' announcement that she would vote \"yes\" on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a crowdfunding campaign has raised over $3 million to support her opponent in the 2020 election. The campaign, initiated by three activist groups, including Be A Hero Team, Maine People's Alliance, and Mainers for Accountable Leadership, has been criticized for potentially attempting to bribe Collins into voting against Kavanaugh.\n\nThe donation page, titled \"Either Sen. Collins VOTES NO on Kavanaugh OR we fund her future opponent,\" went down briefly on crowdfunding website crowdpac.com Friday afternoon due to \"overwhelming\" traffic. The groups are also raising money on the website ActBlue and claim that donations are coming in every three seconds.\n\nSen. Collins' decision to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, following a nearly 45-minute speech on the Senate floor, has drawn criticism from protesters and praise from the GOP. The campaign organizers stated, \"Susan Collins has betrayed the people, and especially the women and survivors, of Maine.\" They added, \"For years she has claimed to be an independent, a different kind of Republican, but today she shattered that facade forever.\"\n\nThe organizers have pledged to \"never let her forget\" this decision and are committed to defeating Collins in 2020. They argue, \"Maine deserves a Senator who would recoil at the idea of confirming a proven liar, an emotionally unstable partisan, to the Supreme Court.\"\n\nDuring her speech on the Senate floor, Collins discussed various issues, including Obamacare, same-sex marriage, and abortion rights, and stated that Kavanaugh's record and pledges before Congress were sufficient to secure her vote. She also addressed the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford, stating that the allegations \"fail to meet the'more likely than not' standard.\"\n\nA watchdog group, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), has asked the Justice Department to investigate the campaign against Collins out of concern that the donated money may have been an attempt to bribe Collins' vote, which is considered illegal if \"the payments are made in return for an explicit promise or undertaking by the official to perform or not to perform an official act.\"",
    " Title: Iran-Backed Militias Continue Attacks on U.S. Outposts in Iraq, According to U.S. Officials\n\nArticle:\n\nIran-backed militias have reportedly continued to wage attacks on American outposts in Iraq, according to James Jeffrey, the Trump administration's special representative for Syria engagement and special envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS.\n\nIn a briefing, Jeffrey stated that the United States has experienced targeted strikes by Iran-backed militia groups seeking to create unrest in Iraq since the U.S. forces killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. In the weeks since Soleimani's death, Iran-backed militants have scaled down their attacks but have continued to launch strikes at U.S. positions in Iraq.\n\nJeffrey described the attacks as \"a few shellings of coalition\u2014or bases where coalition forces are located.\" He added that, with the exception of several incidents at the American embassy compound a few days ago, these attacks have been intermittent and similar to what the U.S. has experienced in their years in Iraq.\n\nWhen asked if these attacks have been orchestrated by Iran, Jeffrey responded, \"We think so.\"\n\nThe United States, while still engaged in the fight against the ISIS terror group in Iraq, remains primarily focused on protecting American forces in the region from retaliatory strikes by Iran. \"The focus of our forces right now is force protection,\" Jeffrey said. \"They suffered first 11 quite serious attacks from Iranian-supported militias, who are by and large parts of the Iraqi security system, then the assault on the embassy, then the two Iranian long-range intermediate missile strikes on our forces in Erbil and Ayn al-Asad. So in a situation like that, obviously, the commanders are going to focus, as they have so successfully, on force protection. And as the threat diminishes, they\u2019ll review that.\"\n\nIn addition to the threat posed by Iran, U.S. officials remain concerned about the potential resurgence of ISIS following major territorial defeats in the past year. \"The risk of the resurgence of ISIS is a very big problem,\" Jeffrey said. \"We have emphasized that ever since the physical caliphate was defeated along the Euphrates in March of last year. We are very concerned about the number of forces there and how they coordinate among each other. The Iraqis are concerned about that. Our SDF partners in northeast Syria are concerned about that. The Turks are concerned about that because they now have forces in the northeast. Everyone is looking into this and watching it closely.\"",
    " Title: Dr. Rick Bright Warns of Potential Darkest Winter in Modern History Amidst Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nDr. Rick Bright, the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), testified before a House subcommittee on Thursday, warning that without better planning, 2020 could be the darkest winter in modern history due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBright, who was removed from his post last month, urged lawmakers to take \"simple but critical steps\" to control the pandemic and prevent a disastrous second wave of infections this winter. He emphasized the need for widespread testing, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine, while striving to develop a cure.\n\nIn his testimony, Bright stated, \"Our window of opportunity is closing... I fear the pandemic will get worse and be prolonged... Without better planning, 2020 could be the darkest winter in modern history.\"\n\nBright also expressed his belief that a Covid-19 vaccine is a question of when, not if, but cautioned that \"12 to 18 months is an aggressive schedule and I think it will take longer than that\" to manufacture a vaccine.\n\nIn his opening statement, Bright supported Tuesday's Senate testimony by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert and a member of the White House coronavirus task force. He urged increased public education about handwashing, social distancing, and appropriate face coverings.\n\nIn his written testimony submitted ahead of Thursday's hearing, Bright warned that without clear planning and quick action, the coming winter will be the darkest in recent history. He also described \"dismissive\" HHS leadership, stating that his warnings about the need to ramp up production of ventilators, personal protective equipment, and testing swabs in anticipation of a pandemic were ignored.\n\nBright also claimed that he was \"cut out of key high-level meetings to combat COVID-19.\" In April, he filed a whistleblower complaint over his removal from the top BARDA job, alleging that he resisted a White House push to promote and fund the now-discredited antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential coronavirus remedy over more promising solutions.\n\nThe Office of the Special Counsel has concluded that there are \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that Bright was retaliated against and should be reinstated to his former job as BARDA director. During Thursday's hearing, Republicans focused more on defending President Trump's promotion of hydroxychloroquine than on getting to the bottom of the circumstances surrounding Bright's removal.\n\nIn a statement released Thursday, Bright's lawyers reportedly found a \"substantial likelihood of wrongdoing\" in his removal. The hearing was marked by attacks on Bright from some Republican lawmakers, while administration officials attempted to undercut his testimony. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, for instance, stated, \"While we are launching Operation Warp Speed, he is not showing up for work.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Decision on DACA Program Sparks Controversy, Leaves Future Uncertain\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in six months has sparked controversy, with the move largely satisfying neither supporters nor opponents of the policy. The DACA program, established by former President Barack Obama in 2012, allows certain individuals who were brought to the United States illegally as children to remain in the country and work legally.\n\nThe media has been critical of Trump's decision, with the DACA program being one of the few issues this year on which they have been consistently aligned against the president. The climate change agreement is a close second, but that is more abstract compared to the 800,000 young immigrants who have become integrated into American society through the DACA program.\n\nTrump, during his campaign, had promised to end the DACA program. However, he has shown ambivalence towards the issue, with statements such as, \"We think the dreamers are terrific,\" made as recently as Friday. In 2011, Trump expressed support for those who had been in the country for 20 years, stating, \"I don't believe in that [sending them out of the country].\"\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced the administration's decision to end the DACA program on constitutional grounds on Tuesday. Sessions, a leading anti-illegal immigration voice, took no questions from reporters. The administration's decision comes in response to a lawsuit filed by numerous state attorneys general.\n\nThe administration is immediately halting any new applications, but existing DACA recipients will not be deported for at least six months. This six-month delay has been portrayed by some pundits as Trump passing the decision to Congress. However, the administration's decision to end the program is not reversible, and no new applications will be accepted during this period.\n\nThe future of the DACA program remains uncertain, with Democrats ratcheting up the pressure on Trump and Republicans to find a solution. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi described Trump's decision as \"ready to break the hearts and offend the morals of all who believe in justice and human dignity.\"\n\nThe notion that Congress, which has struggled to agree on many issues, will rescue the program over the next six months may be wishful thinking. The DACA program's future will likely depend on the ability of the president and Congress to find a compromise on immigration reform, a task that has proven difficult in the past.",
    " Title: Immigrant Rights Activists Convene on Capitol Hill to Demand Action on Immigration Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nTens of thousands of immigrant rights supporters will gather on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to demand action on immigration reform, a key issue in the ongoing legislative debate. The rally comes as negotiators struggle to finalize legislation that would legalize the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., rewrite the system for future legal immigrants, and bolster enforcement at the borders and the interior.\n\nActivists have been organizing similar protests since 2003, with the goal of highlighting the growing immigrant rights movement in the U.S. This year, activists will lobby their members of Congress before gathering on the West Lawn to demonstrate their political influence.\n\nGustavo Torres, executive director of Casa de Maryland, an advocacy group that is helping organize the rally, stated, \"We have been here before. But this time is different. We are different. Washington is different. Politicians learned their lesson this past election cycle.\"\n\nThe immediate goal of the marchers is to pressure Senate and House negotiators to finalize the details of the legislation. Activists will demand a simple and quick legalization process and argue against the need for additional border security measures or increased deportations.\n\nThe rally on Wednesday will also serve to demonstrate the growing political power of the immigrant rights movement, which has been ascending for years but finally forced lawmakers to take notice after the 2012 elections. Jorge-Mario Cabrera, director of communications at the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, said, \"Our vote, along with the stars aligning in our favor in Congress, leads us to be very optimistic about the impact our presence in D.C. will have this week.\"\n\nIn 2003, with the Bush administration backing away from immigration reform after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, activists staged the Immigrant Worker Freedom Rides, in which hundreds of immigrants traveled from city to city to make the case for legalization. The rides served as a key early test of the emerging coalition, as religious leaders, labor unions, and minority rights activists joined together to boost immigrant rights groups.\n\nMassive marches in the spring of 2006 grabbed national headlines, as up to 5 million supporters turned out in cities across the nation to protest a House Republican bill that would have cracked down on illegal immigration and imposed penalties on those deemed to be aiding illegal immigrants. The rallies made headlines for their sheer size, including an estimated 500,000 at a Los Angeles rally on March 25. However, they also earned bad publicity after some participants carried foreign flags, particularly Mexican flags, spurring a backlash among voters.\n\nDouglas Rivlin, who worked for the National Immigration Forum at the time, said those rallies served for many Americans as a first glimpse at the power of the movement. \"The marches, just as the debate, probably hardened some positions on each side, but I think for the vast majority in the middle there was an awakening that there was this huge issue out there they hadn't paid much attention to,\" said Mr. Rivlin, who now works for Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, one of the movement's leaders.\n\nIndeed, it was soon after the 2006 marches that senators struck a deal on a legalization bill and brought it to the Senate floor, where it passed 62-36. However, they were unable to hammer out a compromise between their broad legalization and House Republicans' crackdown bill. A year later, senators tried again\u2014only to see their bill fall to a bipartisan filibuster.\n\nThe issue simmered, serving as a dividing line in the 2008 election, with then-candidate Barack Obama promising to make immigration a top priority in his first year in the White House. Mr. Obama won the election but turned instead to health care, angering Hispanic voters who felt betrayed. The anger was boosted by the president's push to step up deportations.\n\nIn 2010, activists again staged a mass rally\u2014this time on the Mall in Washington, where many had harsh words for Mr. Obama. \"It was an important moment in sending the signal to Democrats again that this was an issue that was not going away, and kept the pressure on Democrats to deal with immigration in 2010,\" Mr. Rivlin said.\n\nWary of losing Hispanic voters in 2012, Mr. Obama granted tentative legal status to most young adult illegal immigrants last year\u2014something he had for years said he lacked the authority to do. The president also vowed that if he was re-elected he would renew his efforts to pass a broad legalization bill. Now, activists say that promise is due, and the rally Wednesday will serve as a reminder of the power the movement can bring.\n\n\"This is a point of escalation, and the show of force in my mind is the overall effort that began the day after the election in 2012,\" said Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, which is helping organize the rally. Alfonso Aguilar, president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, which advocates for legalization from the conservative side, said the rallies have served a purpose, but he said they work best when they target both sides. He said that means being willing to criticize Mr. Obama on enforcement as well as Republicans who oppose legalization and pushing for action on all sides of the immigration equation, including a guest-worker program for future foreign workers. \"Put pressure on both sides,\" he said. \"Put pressure on Republicans, but put pressure on Obama as well.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Group of U.S. Lawmakers Urge Obama to Provide Lethal Arms to Ukraine\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan group of top U.S. lawmakers, including House Speaker John A. Boehner and key members of the Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, and Intelligence committees, have called on President Obama to provide lethal American arms to Ukraine in a letter sent Thursday. The lawmakers argue that Congress has already granted permission for such transfers, and they urge the President to act swiftly to counter Russian aggression.\n\nIn the letter, the lawmakers assert that Ukraine represents a significant geopolitical test for the U.S., and that inaction could result in a loss for the nation. They describe the ongoing conflict in Ukraine as more than just a component of Russian strategic ambitions, but as a violation of international law, a challenge to the West, and an assault on the post-World War II international order.\n\nCongress passed a law last year allowing for the transfer of defensive military equipment to Ukraine, and Ukrainian officials have recently provided the Pentagon and President Obama's national security staff with a list of military equipment they require. However, despite having the necessary authorization, President Obama has yet to take advantage of this provision.\n\nVice President Joseph R. Biden spoke with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Thursday, expressing concern over continued separatist attacks against Ukrainian forces and civilian areas despite a cease-fire agreement. The lawmakers argue that the cease-fire has been abused by Russian-backed separatists, who have used it to consolidate their positions and push Ukrainian forces out of the territory.\n\nThe lawmakers urge President Obama to act quickly on arms transfers, stating that a decision on the matter is already overdue. They acknowledge President Obama's desire to coordinate with Europe, but they argue that his approach has not been effective in influencing European leaders. The lawmakers call on the President to take a more assertive role in challenging Russian aggression and to lead Europe in upholding the international order.\n\nSome analysts have expressed concern that providing lethal arms to Ukraine could provoke a stronger response from Russia, which is backing separatists in the eastern part of the former Soviet republic. President Obama has been cautious in his approach, viewing the decision on arms as a delicate balancing act. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland testified before the House on Wednesday that the issue is whether to increase the lethality of the aid provided, and whether such aid would escalate the conflict or serve to strengthen Ukraine's defensive capabilities.\n\nPresident Obama's top military advisers have reportedly weighed in favor of providing lethal aid, with Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey stating that Ukraine's geographic proximity to Russia and its size give Russia an advantage in the conflict. Dempsey also noted that certain capability gaps in Ukraine's military put their forces at a disadvantage, and that the U.S. should explore opportunities to provide the necessary capabilities to Ukraine.\n\nThe stakes, according to the lawmakers, go beyond Ukraine and include the Baltic countries that are part of NATO. An attack on these countries would trigger NATO's collective defense pact, which requires all member countries to step up in defense.",
    " Title: AllSides Dictionary Aims to Provide Balanced Definitions of Controversial Terms\n\nArticle:\n\nA new online dictionary, the AllSides Dictionary, has been created by AllSides, a news hub that offers guidance on the potential political bias of articles and news providers. The dictionary aims to provide balanced definitions of 400 controversial terms, revealing how they are perceived differently by people with different political perspectives.\n\nThe AllSides Dictionary includes definitions for terms such as \"abortion,\" \"Black Lives Matter,\" \"truth,\" and \"white privilege.\" Phil Neisser, one of the editors of the dictionary and a professor in the department of politics at the State University of New York at Potsdam, believes the dictionary can help students become more rounded in their understanding of controversial topics.\n\nNeisser stated that universities are places of potential conflict, where students from different political perspectives come together. He believes the dictionary can help build mutual understanding in society by encouraging students to engage in conversations with people who have different political views.\n\nMikhail Lyubansky, another contributor on the project and a teaching associate professor in the department of psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, also sees the dictionary as a means to get students to think differently. Lyubansky teaches a course on race and believes the dictionary can help students understand the perspectives of people who think differently about race-related ideas.\n\nProfessor Neisser pointed out that although the dictionary has clear educational potential, it is \"one thing to have a dictionary and hope people read it, and another thing to require people to read it who are taking a class.\" He also noted that the dictionary \"should be something that grows.\"\n\nThe dictionary definitions provided by Professors Neisser and Lyubansky reveal the challenges they faced in finding the right words to describe viewpoints that are not their own and in capturing the spirit and nuance of each particular political orientation. The definitions were based on courses they have been teaching for many years and their engagement with both progressive and conservative discourses on social media.",
    " Title: QAnon: A Conspiracy Theory Gaining Popularity Among President Trump's Supporters\n\nArticle:\n\nA fringe conspiracy theory known as QAnon has gained traction among some supporters of President Donald Trump, as evidenced by attendees at his recent rally in Florida donning QAnon-themed apparel. The theory, which originated on the 4Chan and 8Chan internet message boards, posits that a person known as \"Q\" is a high-ranking government official who is about to expose a cabal of pedophiles, globalists, and celebrities who secretly control America.\n\nThe central premise of QAnon is that President Trump is on the verge of exposing this cabal, and that a \"deep state\" has been in control for decades. Q's posts, which are often cryptic and open to interpretation, are believed to be a kind of parallel history that ties together various events, such as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the prevalence of mass shootings, and the existence of ISIS.\n\nQAnon believers also hold the belief that President Kennedy was set to reveal the existence of the secret government before his assassination, and that President Reagan was shot on the orders of the deep state. They also believe that all presidents since Reagan, with the exception of Trump, have been deep state agents.\n\nAccording to QAnon lore, the military recruited Trump to run for president, and the deep state, which controls the media, has attempted to smear him through \"fake news\" and unfounded allegations of collusion with Russia. The deep state's efforts, however, have been unsuccessful, as Trump is winning and is on the verge of arresting the leaders of the deep state and sending them to Guantanamo Bay. This process is referred to as \"The Storm\" and is seen as a kind of Judgment Day in which the evildoers are punished and the faithful are redeemed.\n\nQ's posts are often vague or incomprehensible, but QAnon followers are eager to decipher them. Last year, for example, Q posted a photo of an unnamed island chain, and QAnon adherents tried to prove that the photo must have been taken on Air Force One, which in turn meant that Q was traveling with the president. The Q posts are known as \"breadcrumbs,\" and the people who try to figure out what they mean are called \"bakers.\"\n\nQAnon has gained a following among some celebrities, including Roseanne Barr and former Red Sox pitcher and current right-wing radio host Curt Schilling. The name \"WWG1WGA,\" which Barr tweeted in June, is a rallying cry for QAnon followers and refers to Q-level clearance at the Energy Department. The true identity of the person behind the Q posts is unknown.",
    " Title: Congressional Impasse Leads to Government Shutdown, Healthcare Law Implementation Continues\n\nArticle:\n\nCongressional Republicans and Democrats are at an impasse over the funding of the government, with the former refusing to approve funding unless the latter agrees to alter the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. President Obama criticized this stance in a Rose Garden address, stating, \"They're shutting down the government over an ideological crusade to deny affordable health care to many Americans.\"\n\nThe president's remarks followed a meeting with 12 individuals who have benefited from the Affordable Care Act's changes to health insurance coverage or plan to enroll in coverage through the new insurance marketplaces that went online today. Obama condemned Republicans for making the dismantling of the health care law the \"centerpiece of their agenda.\"\n\nThe government shutdown, which left nearly 800,000 federal employees out of work without pay this morning, and more than a million other \"essential\" employees on the job with many of their paychecks delayed, is the result of this impasse. National parks and war memorials are closed, and some government services are operating at reduced staffing levels.\n\nWith the next, potentially disastrous deadline - the debt ceiling - looming, Obama urged lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling, warning, \"it'd be far more dangerous than a government shutdown, as bad as a shutdown is; it would be an economic shutdown.\"\n\nOn the first day of the health insurance marketplaces' opening to accept new enrollment, Obama acknowledged that the online system was experiencing \"glitches\" due to unexpected high demand. He compared these initial problems to issues with Apple's rollout of a new operating system.\n\nIn response to the government shutdown, House Republicans are considering approving smaller spending bills that would fully fund veterans programs, the National Park Service, and the District of Columbia. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rejected this strategy, stating, \"We cannot and we will not be forced to choose between the parks and cancer research.\"\n\nRepublicans argue that Democrats are the ones refusing to negotiate over funding the government, as previous presidents and Congresses have done in the past. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stated, \"Democratic leaders in Congress finally have their prize, a government shutdown that no one seems to want but them.\"\n\nDespite the Republican strategy to put the brakes on the health care bill, the law was implemented, starting today, regardless of the government shutdown. The impact of the shutdown, however, is being felt in other ways, with national parks closed to the public, Federal Housing Administration home loans delayed, and courts in Washington stopping the issuance of marriage licenses and performing weddings.\n\nThe political consequences of this impasse could be grave for both parties in Congress, but especially for Republicans. According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Monday, 63 percent disapprove of Republicans' handling of the budget debate compared to 50 percent who disapprove of Obama's handling of the situation.\n\nSarah Binder, an expert in Congress and legislative politics and a professor at George Washington University, stated, \"We underestimate some of the networks within which lawmakers will find themselves back home.\"",
    " Title: \"American Sniper's Depiction of Chris Kyle and the Broader Issues of Delusion and Violence in Clint Eastwood's Work\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe film \"American Sniper,\" based on the life of Chris Kyle, has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of the real-life American sniper. However, this article will argue that the film's issues extend beyond the representation of Kyle, delving into the larger problems of the film and its director, Clint Eastwood.\n\nTwo key moments in Eastwood's public appearances highlight the director's troubling representation of a dark and disturbing feature of the GOP mindset. In 2005, at the National Board of Review dinner, Eastwood threatened filmmaker Michael Moore, stating that he would kill Moore if he showed up at his door with a camera. This statement, made in response to Moore's documentary on the Iraq War, \"Fahrenheit 9/11,\" reveals a disturbing attitude towards free expression and those with differing political views.\n\nIn 2012, at the Republican National Convention, Eastwood delivered a bizarre, improvised monologue to an empty chair, which was supposed to represent an invisible Barack Obama. This performance, watched by more than 30 million Americans, left many bewildered and struggling to make sense of it.\n\nThese two events, taken together, help explain what's wrong with \"American Sniper.\" They illustrate the combination of delusion and aggressive violence that governs too much of GOP politics.\n\nThe film draws a direct link between the events of 9/11 and the war in Iraq, forgetting that the war in Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. This connection is delusional, as not one of the 9/11 attackers was in any way connected to Iraq. The 9/11-Iraq link is a common link in public perceptions of those on the right who watch Fox News, and it is one that makes sense to Eastwood and those who think like him.\n\nThe second problem is the culture of violence. The film portrays Kyle wrestling with some of his kills, but still very clearly divides the world into categories. Iraqis are almost all depicted as \"wolves,\" even women and children. Kyle's first two kills are a young boy and his mother, who posed a threat and thus needed to be killed. The film fails to consider the fact that the war was based on false justifications, or that those in Iraq might have seen U.S. soldiers as invaders in their homeland. The logic of war is completely unquestioned, making this the most simplistic war film nominated for an Oscar in decades.\n\nThe lack of nuance, context, and subtlety in the film should not surprise us. It is a terrifying glimpse into a GOP mindset that couples delusion with violence. \"American Sniper\" is not just about a sniper, but also about an attitude that threatens to destroy any chance in our nation for political compromise and productive debate. And that's what makes this movie really disturbing.",
    " Title: National and State Polls Show Romney Leading Obama in Final Presidential Debate Pre-Debate Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the third and final 2012 presidential debate approaches, foreign policy takes center stage. However, foreign policy is not the top concern for voters this year. According to a cross-section of polls, Republican challenger Mitt Romney has established a modest lead over President Barack Obama nationally and in critical battleground states.\n\n1. Rasmussen and Gallup: Both Rasmussen and Gallup daily tracking polls show Romney in the lead among likely voters. Rasmussen's edge is two points (49% for Romney and 47% for Obama), while Gallup shows a larger cushion (51% for Romney and 45% for Obama). For the third consecutive day, Rasmussen's swing state tracker shows Romney ahead by a handful of points (49% for Romney and 46% for Obama).\n\n2. NBC/WSJ: This national survey, which has been less favorable to Republicans in recent months, shows a 47% tie between the two candidates.\n\n3. Politico/GWU: Romney has a slight lead in this poll for the first time, at 49% for Romney and 47% for Obama. The partisan sample is D+4, which might overstate Democrats' turnout edge by a hair. In the poll's swing state sub-sample, Romney leads by the same margin, but hits the 50% mark.\n\n4. Monmouth University: Romney leads Obama by three points (48% for Romney and 45% for Obama). The sitting president's 45% is the bigger result. Romney carries independents handily on every major question, including a 52% to 33% lead in head-to-head, a +22 favorability rating compared to Obama's -15, and a 57% to 34% lead on the economy and jobs.\n\nIn the Monmouth poll, Romney also leads on Medicare and Social Security (53% for Romney and 33% for Obama), budget and deficits (57% for Romney and 29% for Obama), and foreign policy (49% for Romney and 39% for Obama).\n\nFresh state polls show Romney ahead in Colorado (50% for Romney and 46% for Obama), Iowa (47% for Romney and 47% for Obama), and Ohio (48% for Romney and 48% for Obama). The first two surveys are from Rasmussen, while the Ohio data is from Angus Reid.\n\nIn the Gravis Marketing poll, Romney leads Obama by 19 points among independents (52% for Romney and 33% for Obama), and holds 92% of his base compared to Obama's 87%. Obama is underwater in job approval (44% approval and 50% disapproval), and independents disapprove of him overwhelmingly (31% approval and 58% disapproval).\n\nAnother Ohio poll released today by Quinnipiac shows Obama ahead by 5 points, but Romney gaining ground. Despite its ludicrous D+9 breakdown, the survey shows Romney gaining.\n\nUPDATE: More red flags for Team Obama from the NBC/WSJ poll. A large majority of voters say that if Obama is re-elected, they want to see him dramatically alter his policies.\n\nUPDATE II: Another Ohio poll shows the race exactly tied.",
    " Title: American Missionary Among 28 Killed in Terrorist Attack in Burkina Faso's Capital\n\nArticle:\n\nAn American missionary, identified as Mike Riddering, was among at least 28 people killed in a terrorist attack in the capital of Burkina Faso that ended on Saturday. The attack occurred at the Hotel Splendid and the nearby Cappuccino Cafe in Ouagadougou, where the terrorists set fire to several cars.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the other victims were six Canadians, two French, two Swiss, and a Dutch citizen. Mike Riddering, 45, had traveled to the capital from the orphanage he and his wife Amy worked at in Yako, a town about 60 miles northwest of Ouagadougou.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Saturday, Amy Boyle Riddering, Mike's wife, wrote, \"My best friend, partner in crime and love of my life. The best husband ever. An amazing father to his children and a papa to everyone. My heart is so heavy and I am having trouble believing he is gone. Mike was an example in the way he lived and loved.\"\n\nTwo of the attackers were women, according to President Roch Marc Christian Kabore, as reported by the Associated Press. Three of the terrorists, believed to belong to a local al-Qaeda affiliate, were killed in the assault on the Hotel Splendid. A fourth attacker was killed nearby at the Hotel Yibi.\n\nThe raid to end the siege was mounted after dozens of French special forces arrived overnight from neighboring Mali. One U.S. military member was embedded with French forces at the scene, and the United States was working to help provide France with surveillance and reconnaissance support, according to a U.S. senior defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nThe terrorist group known as AQIM, or al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, claimed responsibility for the attack online as it was unfolding, according to SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S.-based organization that monitors jihadists' online activity.\n\nIn a message posted in Arabic on the extremists' \"Muslim Africa\" Telegram account, the group said fighters \"broke into a restaurant of one of the biggest hotels in the capital of Burkina Faso, and are now entrenched and the clashes are continuing with the enemies of the religion.\" Fighters who spoke by phone later \"asserted the fall of many dead Crusaders,\" AQIM said, according to SITE.\n\nThe same group is believed responsible for a similar siege at an upscale hotel in Bamako, Mali, in November that left 20 dead. While Burkina Faso, a largely Muslim country, has largely been spared the violence wracked by Islamic extremist groups in Mali, a Romanian national was abducted last April.\n\nThe attacks follow growing tension in Burkina Faso in the wake of a coup attempt by presidential guards that collapsed in September. The newly installed government of President Kabore recently issued an arrest warrant for Guillaume Soro, the head of the National Assembly in neighboring Ivory Coast, for his alleged involvement in the failed coup attempt.\n\nIn addition, Kabore broke with the past Wednesday by picking a cabinet packed with ministers who had not served under the previous administration of Blaise Compaore, who was president for 27 years. Compaore went into exile in Ivory Coast after being ousted in an uprising in 2014.\n\nIn a separate development, an Australian doctor and his wife were kidnapped on Friday night by extremists in Burkina Faso's north near its border with Mali, according to President Kabore. The ministry had originally identified them as Austrian. The couple was abducted in Djibo, the capital of the northern Soum province. The had been living in the region since 1972, volunteering in health services, a local journalist told AP.\n\nDenmark's Crown Princess Mary had been scheduled to visit Burkina Faso later this month on an official visit to visit women's rights and health groups. Danish Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen said the country is assessing whether it will be safe for her to make the trip, AP reported.",
    " Title: Congressional Members Prioritize Media Appearances Over Governing Duties\n\nArticle:\n\nThe role of members of Congress is being redefined, with some willingly forgoing their legislative responsibilities for the allure of television appearances on networks like MSNBC and Fox News, according to a Commentary essay by Yuval Levin.\n\nThe essay, titled \"Congress is Weak Because Its Members Want it to be Weak,\" argues that the 21st century's technologies enabling transparency have had both positive and negative effects. The increased visibility of politics has led to a shift in focus from actual governing and the necessary compromises it entails, to performance art-like grandstanding and posturing as brave truth-tellers condemning the perceived dysfunction of their own institution.\n\nThis tendency among legislators to prioritize media exposure over legislative work is identified as the true dysfunction. When nearly every member seeks to be a cable- or local-TV star rather than a lawmaker, it is no wonder that little actual legislating gets done. As Levin notes, even controlling both chambers and having a Republican president poised to sign anything they send up, the Republican Congress has achieved very little. They passed a tax cut, but concerning other priorities they campaigned on for years\u2014reforming the health-care system, adjusting the immigration laws, and confronting the entitlement crisis\u2014they have done nothing and seem to have no plans.\n\nAs for the chief job of Congress, developing a budget, neither chamber has even considered a budget resolution for the first time in 40 years. And while Republican leaders demur, the president is again threatening a government shutdown.\n\nThe essay also highlights the case of Paul Manafort, who is alleged to have sold his political services to sketchy foreign powers, evaded American taxes, and spent millions on luxury items. The president has defended Manafort, who worked for him for a short time, stating that Manafort worked for other prominent political leaders and that the allegations have nothing to do with collusion.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that the founders did not anticipate this shift in focus from governing to media exposure, and that it is likely to outlast the current administration.",
    " Title: Republicans Face Political Quandary Over Deficit Reduction\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublicans, according to political analyst Julian Zelizer, may be wary of a grand bargain to cut the federal deficit due to internal party dynamics. The party is unified by the defining theme of fighting against deficits, but many are aware that entitlement cuts are unpopular in red states, Zelizer notes.\n\nAt the recent Conservative Political Action Convention, Republicans criticized President Obama's budgetary policies and emphasized the need for deficit reduction. Congressman Paul Ryan, with an eye towards 2016, stated, \"Our debt is a threat to this country. We have to tackle this problem before it tackles us. So today, I want to make the case for balance. That case, in a nutshell, is that a balanced budget will promote a healthier economy.\"\n\nHowever, for many reasons, Republicans do not seem to genuinely want a \"grand bargain\" over deficit reduction, according to Zelizer. Deficit reduction is an issue that the party likes to discuss more than it has an interest in actually addressing.\n\nDeficit reduction has become a unifying theme for Republicans since the 2010 elections, providing a common ground for various conservative factions. Without deficit reduction as a central issue, the party's internal divisions become more apparent, including neoconservatives versus realists on foreign policy, social conservatives versus libertarians, proponents of immigration reform and hard-line anti-immigration activists, and fiscal conservatives versus supply-side economists.\n\nIf deficit reduction loses its prominence as an issue due to a deal between the president and Congress, Republicans will have less to unite over and more time to fight among themselves. President Obama could potentially follow President Bill Clinton's example in 1996, when he signed a historic welfare reform bill, effectively taking away one of the main issues that the GOP had used to attack Democrats for decades.\n\nA genuine deficit reduction deal would require Congress to accept some form of revenue increase, which goes against the Republican party's fiscal orthodoxy, as many experts agree that no matter how many spending cuts are implemented, eliminating deficits would require a combination of tax increases and loophole-closing reforms.\n\nIf President Obama were to agree to a grand bargain that included deep cuts in entitlement spending, the political backlash against the Republican party could be intense, especially in red states and districts where elderly voters rely on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. The political backlash from Republican voters against substantive cuts, as proposed by Congressman Paul Ryan, could be severe.\n\nIn summary, while Republicans are vocal about the need for deficit reduction, they may not be willing to accept the political and economic consequences of a grand bargain that includes revenue increases and entitlement cuts. The party's internal divisions could become more apparent if deficit reduction is no longer a central issue, and President Obama could potentially capitalize on this opportunity, as President Clinton did in the late 1990s.",
    " Title: Top 2016 Presidential Prospects Raise Over $86 Million for Campaign Committees\n\nArticle:\n\nPolitical outfits associated with top prospects for the 2016 presidential election have raised at least $86 million for committees that could support their campaigns, according to a recent analysis of campaign reports and interviews with allies. The funds were raised for state and federal reelection campaign committees, leadership PACs, super PACs, and nonprofit groups created to boost pet causes.\n\nIn the Democratic party, Hillary Clinton is attracting significant support from major donors and top campaign operatives, but potential rivals are also assembling campaign-style operations. Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, for instance, recently hired a top New York fundraiser to solicit big checks from Wall Street.\n\nThe early money is crucial in the Citizens United era, as prospective candidates need a stable of rich allies to bolster their efforts before the campaign starts and fend off attacks from opponents. Paul Begala, a top strategist to Priorities USA, a super PAC and sister nonprofit group, likened the process to planting a tree, stating, \"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is today. And this is 20 years ago. This is why we\u2019re starting now.\"\n\nThe 2016 Democratic presidential nomination is widely considered Hillary Clinton's for the taking. The infrastructure that has arisen around her, without her involvement or any surefire indication that she is even going to run, dwarfs anything any other Democrat could possibly muster and is unique in the annals of modern campaign finance.\n\nClinton's inner circle has been keeping close tabs on a network of groups that together form a sort of Hillary shadow campaign. These groups combined to raise more than $12 million in 2013 to build a voter database and a grass-roots army, and later to air ads for a presumptive 2016 run.\n\nOn the Republican side, Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio, along with Representative Paul Ryan, are stretching the potential of hard-dollar fundraising through innovative joint committees that merge their various accounts and increase the maximum size of the donations they can accept to $10,000 a pop. Rubio and Ryan, favorites of GOP establishment donors, raised $8 million and $4.8 million last year, respectively, through their various accounts. Both men spent heavily on digital operations and ads defending their political stances.\n\nCruz, a favorite of the anti-establishment tea party, pulled in $4.1 million primarily from small donors, but he has worked to make inroads with deeper pockets who could subsidize a 2016 presidential run. Supporters of Texas Governor Rick Perry, who raised $5.6 million into a super PAC supporting his 2012 campaign for the GOP nomination, recently transferred $200,000 in leftover cash into a nonprofit expected to set the stage for another presidential campaign.",
    " Title: Democratic Debate Highlights No Distinguishable Differences on Immigration Between Clinton and Sanders\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic debate held on Wednesday at Miami Dade College primarily focused on immigration, border security, and legalization, with the first hour being almost entirely dedicated to these topics. The debate, hosted by Univision and moderated by Latino journalists, was marked by pandering to Latino voters and promises to use executive power on their behalf, which could potentially impact the Democratic nominee, likely Hillary Clinton, in a general election.\n\nIn terms of immigration policy, there was little discernible difference between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Both candidates expressed sympathy for the plight of illegal aliens and stated their intention to establish a pathway to citizenship, even if it meant bypassing Congress and using executive orders. The candidates avoided using the term \"amnesty,\" but the result of any \"pathway\" for illegals is inevitably amnesty.\n\nOn the issue of deportations, both candidates deviated from standard Democratic National Committee talking points and promised lawlessness. When pressed by the moderators, Clinton suggested that deportations would end for all \"non-criminal\" illegal immigrants if she were to become president. Sanders appeared to agree.\n\nThe implications of such a promise are significant: if only serious criminals are to be deported, would everyone else who comes to America or is already here illegally be allowed to stay? What about newly arrived illegals? Do they not have families too? And what precedent would it set for the country if the commander in chief felt entitled to ignore a huge body of existing federal law?\n\nIn their efforts to outdo each other as champions of illegal immigrants, who have in fact broken U.S. federal law, Clinton and Sanders seemed to entertain the idea that it is possible to secure our borders without enforcing laws against a vast majority of illegal entrants. They were not just peddling amnesty on that stage, they were in effect dabbling in open borders.",
    " Title: Trump's Executive Order on Anti-Semitism and Its Potential Impact on Campus Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's recent executive order has sparked controversy, with concerns that it may be used to suppress criticism of Israel on college campuses. The order directs federal agencies to consider the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism, which includes speech critical of Israel.\n\nIn a speech before the Israeli American Council, President Trump made several anti-Semitic remarks, including calling American Jews \"not nice people\" who would vote Republican to protect their wealth. This has led to skepticism about Trump's motives regarding the executive order.\n\nThe executive order has been criticized for potentially expanding ongoing efforts to suppress free speech on college campuses, particularly regarding pro-Palestinian protests. The Trump Administration has already launched several investigations into pro-Palestinian speech on college campuses under Title VI, and the executive order could escalate these efforts.\n\nThe IHRA's definition of anti-Semitism includes speech that is protected by the First Amendment, such as claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor. Kenneth Stern, the lead author of the definition, has stated that it should not be applied to higher education.\n\nHowever, the executive order only directs agencies to consider the IHRA's list as evidence of discriminatory intent in cases of overt anti-Semitism with an ethnic component. It does not mean that criticism of Israel alone would trigger a Title VI investigation.\n\nThe impact of the executive order is unclear, as it mostly reaffirms the federal government's long-standing interpretation of Title VI to encompass some anti-Jewish bias. It is also unclear whether the order will have any significant impact on the pro-Palestine movement on college campuses or impose an unwanted classification on American Jews.\n\nThe main question about the strike on Qassem Soleimani is strategic, rather than legal or moral. Soleimani was a powerful leader, but he was not a terror kingpin, and his death does not decapitate anything. The only reason to kill Soleimani is to enter a new war that the United States can win. However, there is no sign that anyone in power, least of all the president, has thought past the action itself, leading to concerns about the strategic implications of the strike.\n\nIt is crucial that influential Republican senators remind President Trump of his promise to keep America out of foreign quagmires and keep him from stumbling further into war with Iran.",
    " Title: Media's Preferred Candidates Struggle in 2020 Democratic Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Democratic presidential nomination process narrows down to a binary choice between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, it is worth reflecting on the performance of the media's preferred candidates in the 2020 race.\n\nThe New York Times' dual endorsements for Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) had minimal impact, much like the points in the improvisational comedy show \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\". Similarly, the media's enthusiasm for South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, early interest in Beto O'Rourke, and adoration for Senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) failed to resonate with the majority of American voters outside the Acela corridor.\n\nInstead, Democratic voters consistently expressed interest in the former vice president and the iconoclastic runner-up from the 2016 Democratic race. Before the actual primaries, Biden consistently led in polls, and Sanders performed well. The primaries followed this pattern, with early wins for Sanders and a comeback surge from Biden.\n\nThe idea that any other candidate had a particularly likely shot at the nomination was often perceived as pundit-driven misdirection from a class of commentators who were more interested in presenting more interesting, intersectional characters, as they themselves are more interested in identity-based diversity than the rest of the country.\n\nThe media's support for Warren was so strong that Matt Yglesias, a writer for Vox, felt compelled to write a post explaining why she was losing, despite her popularity among Vox's readership. Yglesias described Vox's audience as \"a graduate of or student at a selective college (which also describes the staff and our social peers)\" and lamented that \"if you assigned me the job of serving a less-educated audience, I'd probably need to think about how to change things up.\" He is correct; outside the Vox bubble, there was little interest in the kind of cultural progressivism represented by Warren.\n\nAt present, Biden and Sanders are in a battle for delegates, with both candidates having a good shot at the nomination. However, this was true a year ago as well. They were both better-known and better-liked than many in the media seemed to grasp, and an endless series of magazine covers, fluff pieces, and editorial board endorsements aimed at other candidates could not make any difference whatsoever.",
    " Title: White House Denies Allegations of Russian Connection in Trump Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus has stated that high-ranking U.S. intelligence officials have assured the administration that no members of President Trump's campaign had contact with Russian spies. The assertion was made during an interview on \"Fox News Sunday\" in response to reports suggesting otherwise that have dominated news coverage for several days.\n\nPriebus claimed that the top levels of the intelligence community have assured him that the story is inaccurate and grossly overstated. He described the allegations as \"complete garbage\" and expressed frustration over the constant speculation, stating, \"To accuse an organization of being in constant contact with Russian spies is outrageous.\"\n\nThe allegations of a Russian connection began shortly after Trump's election victory in November. Democrats have used the story to question the legitimacy of the election results. Since then, the story has become the focus of major news organizations and has prompted calls for investigations into Russian email hacking during the campaign and potential links to Trump.\n\nThe news reports, some based on anonymous sources within the intelligence community, have alarmed the White House and top Republican lawmakers who believe leaks are emanating from Obama loyalists within the government. At a press conference last week, Trump himself ruled out any ties to Russia, stating, \"I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia.\"\n\nRep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, has bolstered the president's argument by saying Obama administration holdovers appear to be illegally leaking information designed to damage Trump. Nunes stated, \"We do have people in the last administration, people who have burrowed in, perhaps all throughout the government, who clearly are leaking to the press\u2014and it is against the law.\"\n\nThe Washington Post story revealed that Michael Flynn, whom Trump had chosen as national security adviser, misled White House officials about his conversations with the Russian ambassador during the transition. As a result, Flynn was forced to resign. The White House insists that Flynn's downfall was failing to tell Vice President Mike Pence that the discussion included recent U.S. sanctions against Russia, not because of illegal or improper conduct for a national security adviser.\n\nNunes also stated that the problem started with Obama-era holdovers, not a rift between Trump and the intelligence community, as some news organizations reported. He emphasized that the rank-and-file people in the intelligence agencies are not paying attention to what is going on in Washington.\n\nPriebus described the constant focus on the Russian connection as \"fake news\" and expressed frustration over the media's focus on the issue, stating, \"All I'm saying is if you're going to come out with a story that says Russian spies are talking to your campaign\u2014oh my God\u2014I think you should in most cases actually have a named source.\" He also highlighted the administration's accomplishments, such as the repeal of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the signing of a coal bill, the nomination of Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, and deregulation of the federal government.",
    " Title: Democratic Strategy for 2020 Election: Balancing Progressive Policies and Swing State Appeal\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic party is expressing concern as the 2020 presidential election approaches, with a year still remaining before the vote. The focus is not on predicting which Democrat will win or lose, but rather on the strategy required for a Democratic candidate to secure at least some of the battleground states that President Trump won in the last election.\n\nThe Times poll indicates that Senator Bernie Sanders, who supports policies like raising taxes on the rich, addressing political corruption, providing universal day care, and guaranteeing healthcare to all, is leading Trump by two points in Michigan. An anti-establishment, populist approach that emphasizes bread-and-butter issues can garner broad popular support.\n\nThe 2018 midterm elections saw Democrats win by running a populist campaign, focusing on reducing health care costs and helping ordinary families. They avoided supporting unpopular progressive policy dreams, such as mandatory Medicare and border decriminalization. The 2020 presidential candidates are being criticized for ignoring the lessons of 2018.\n\nHowever, to win over voters outside the liberal spectrum, candidates must demonstrate their concern for winning the votes of those who do not consider themselves very liberal. Some argue that Senator Elizabeth Warren's efforts to persuade Iowa voters and high-information Democrats nationally that she is not too extreme or shrewish to be president may not translate to a larger audience.\n\nOthers contend that Warren's stance, which includes promising to 'fight' rather than compromise and insisting on the most radical health-care plan ever proposed by a major-party nominee, is turning off the very voters she would need in key swing states. The Democratic party risks nominating a candidate with less appeal than Hillary Clinton in these crucial swing states, leading to a loss.\n\nVice President Joe Biden has a head start with the moderate or conservative half of the Democratic electorate due to his established identity. However, a newer moderate Democrat lacking that identity faces challenges in building a national constituency. The only avenue that has seemed to be open for a candidate to break into the top has been to excite activists, who are demanding positions far to the left of the median voter.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that Warren and Sanders are still close enough to Trump that they can compete, and new events, like a recession or another scandal, could erode Trump's base. However, the party should view its position a year before the election with real fear.\n\nIn a separate but related development, the impeachment inquiry against President Trump is underway. While there is no explicit quid pro quo proposal in the current evidence, the context and circumstances are expected to become the focus of the investigation. The article suggests that the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid does not weaken the evidence, as circumstantial evidence can be enough to support impeachment. Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.",
    " Title: Trump's Actions and Potential Impeachable Offenses Detailed in Article of Impeachment\n\nArticle:\n\nThe second impeachment article against former President Donald Trump, which detailed his efforts to leverage the federal government for personal gain, draws parallels with President Nixon's abuse of power. This article focuses on Trump's alleged misuse of investigatory powers, as opposed to the previous article's focus on obstruction of Congress.\n\nTrump has been accused of repeatedly calling for investigations against his political opponents, both publicly and privately with aides. For instance, as documented in the Mueller report, he pressured then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate Hillary Clinton, stating, \"You'd be a hero.\" This behavior has been criticized for violating the constitutional rights of American citizens and undermining the credibility of the judicial system.\n\nThe Constitution prohibits the president from profiting off the office by accepting \"emoluments.\" However, Trump continues to own his hotels, allowing politicians, lobbyists, and foreigners to enrich him and curry favor with him by staying there. On Sunday, Attorney General William Barr personally paid for a 200-person holiday party at Trump's hotel in downtown Washington.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled House has been criticized for its handling of these allegations. According to Bob Bauer, an NYU law professor and former White House counsel, the lack of oversight hearings is \"astonishing.\"\n\nIn the 2016 election, $280,000 in undisclosed hush-money payments during the final weeks of the campaign is not a typical campaign-finance violation. Given the close margin of victory (decided by fewer than 80,000 votes across three swing states), the silence these payments bought may have influenced the election's outcome.\n\nWhile the president has wide latitude to issue pardons, Trump has reportedly encouraged people to break the law (or impede investigations) with a promise of future pardons. This practice is not explicitly mentioned as an impeachable offense, but it has raised concerns about the integrity of the legal system.",
    " Title: Bobby Jindal Urges Republicans to Rethink Strategy, Emphasize Growth and Outreach\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a sharp rebuke to his own party, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal called on Republicans to reconsider their approach to politics and voters during the Republican National Committee's Winter Meeting on Thursday. Jindal, who is considered a potential contender for the 2016 presidential race, urged Republicans to move away from a focus on government bookkeeping and austerity, and instead, boldly showcase the benefits of free-market policies.\n\nJindal criticized the Republican Party's obsession with government number crunching, stating that it is not the solution to the nation's problems. He emphasized the need for Republicans to compete for every vote, regardless of political affiliations, and to reject the notion that demography dictates voter behavior.\n\nIn a notable reference to the 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's controversial comments about voters, Jindal said, \"We must compete for every single vote: the 47 percent and the 53 percent and any other combination of numbers that adds up to 100 percent.\"\n\nJindal also criticized Romney's comments in a November interview with CNN, stating that one of the seven points for the Republican Party's future is to demonstrate that Republicans like voters. He further criticized Romney's comments about certain voter demographics during a closed-door fundraiser.\n\nJindal's remarks come as the Republican National Committee has directed a five-member panel, known as the \"Growth and Opportunity Project,\" to identify winning political strategies, particularly in the area of minority outreach.\n\nJindal's speech was laced with criticism of Democrats, including a jab at the economic stimulus programs of President Barack Obama's administration and the Solyndra scandal. However, he was also critical of the Republican Party, stating that they have not only lost elections but also lost issue arguments with Democrats.\n\nJindal called for a shift in the ambition of the conservative movement from managing government to growth. He criticized the notion that a well-prepared spreadsheet, power point presentation, or TV ad would solve the party's problems.\n\nJindal was elected last year to lead the Republican Governor's Association. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus will be up for re-election as RNC chairman on Friday. Jindal joked that Priebus should not use the Romney campaign's voter turnout technology, ORCA, for his election.",
    " Title: Chicago Loses Second Amendment Case Over Gun Range Restrictions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe city of Chicago has lost another Second Amendment case, this time over its attempt to make it virtually impossible for private gun ranges to operate within the city. The latest lawsuit stems from Chicago's recalcitrance in complying with the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago.\n\nThe McDonald decision overturned the city's virtual ban on firearms. In response, Chicago enacted a series of city ordinances that were so restrictive that they were intended to make it difficult to purchase, own, or carry a gun. Many of these ordinances have been challenged in court.\n\nThe city's latest loss came in Ezell v. City of Chicago, a case that has come before the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals twice. Chicago lost the first round in 2011, when the court found that the city's complete ban on shooting ranges violated the Second Amendment.\n\nIn response to that loss, the city passed a new ordinance, described by the Seventh Circuit as \"an elaborate scheme of regulations.\" The range ordinance was so restrictive that only 2.2 percent of the city's entire acreage was \"even theoretically available\" for a gun range. The court noted that the commercial viability of any of these parcels was so questionable that no shooting range yet exists in the city of Chicago.\n\nRhonda Ezell, the plaintiff in the first case, along with several other Chicago residents, the Second Amendment Foundation, and the Illinois Rifle Association, went back to court and won again.\n\nAt issue were three zoning provisions that:\n\n1. Allowed gun ranges only as special uses in manufacturing districts.\n2. Prohibited gun ranges within 100 feet of another range or within 500 feet of a residential district, school, place of worship, or multiple other places.\n3. Barred anyone under the age of 18 from even entering a shooting range.\n\nThe only facilities exempted from these provisions were gun ranges operated by law-enforcement agencies and private security firms, of which there are 11 in Chicago.\n\nThe majority opinion was written by Judge Diane Sykes, one of the judges listed as a possible Supreme Court pick by Donald Trump. Judge Ilana Rovner wrote a partial dissent. The majority concluded that the zoning provisions on manufacturing districts and the distance rule are so restrictive that they \"severely limit [ ] Chicagoans' Second Amendment right to maintain proficiency in firearm use via target practice at a range.\"\n\nIn trying to defend these restrictions, the city \"raised only speculative claims of harm to public health and safety,\" Sykes wrote. There was no valid reason to restrict gun ranges to manufacturing areas as opposed to commercial areas, which is where other cities zone gun ranges. The city also had to admit that many of the existing gun ranges operated by law enforcement and private security firms do so safely near schools, churches, parks, and stores.\n\nThe city tried to argue that gun ranges cause secondary harmful effects such as gun theft, fire hazards, and airborne lead contamination. But, Sykes noted, Chicago \"produced no evidentiary support for these claims beyond the speculative testimony of three city officials.\" Moreover, she wrote, the city \"failed to establish that target practice is wholly unprotected as a matter of history and legal tradition in the founding era or when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.\"\n\nAlso rejected was the city's claim that no one under 18 has a Second Amendment right. Again, Sykes wrote, it was \"an extraordinarily broad claim\" and the city \"failed to back it up.\" In fact, the city's own witness \"agreed that the age restriction is overbroad because teenagers can safely be taught to shoot, and youth firearm instruction is both prudent and can be conducted in a safe manner.\"\n\nThe key to this decision was the court's conclusion that \"the core individual right of armed defense\" that the Supreme Court recognized in the McDonald and Heller decisions \"includes a corresponding right to acquire and maintain proficiency in firearm use through target practice at a range.\" Thus, contrary to the city's arguments, the Second Amendment does protect the citizen's right to practice at a gun range.\n\nThe court affirmed that the city of Chicago has a right to \"regulate the construction and operation of firing ranges to address genuine risks to public health and safety.\" But the city failed to justify any of the \"risks\" it claimed to be addressing with the gun-range ordinance.\n\nHopefully, this latest loss will cause Chicago to stop trying to restrict the Second Amendment rights of its residents. But given its defiant behavior since the original McDonald case was decided, that may be a forlorn hope.",
    " Title: Macron's Trip to the US: A Test of Influence on Global Liberal Order and European Unity\n\nArticle:\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's first presidential trip to the United States has sparked a flurry of interest, as the leader known for his speeches about Europe seeks to navigate the complex relationship with the 71-year-old U.S. President, Donald Trump. The power dynamics between the two leaders, who represent contrasting ideologies, have been a topic of discussion, with Macron's influence on global liberal order and European unity at stake.\n\nMacron's visit to the U.S. is framed by the narrative of French exceptionalism, emphasizing France's unique importance in the world. The trip offers an opportunity for a French president to share the global stage with the leader of the world's most powerful country, a scenario that appeals to Gallic pride.\n\nThe contrasting styles and ideologies of Macron and Trump have added intrigue to the encounter. As the U.S. grapples with the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, some in liberal America have sought solace in Macron, viewing him as a potential savior for the liberal order and European unity. Macron's recent speeches on Europe, warning of the dangers of nationalism and the importance of a united Europe, have resonated with many in the U.S.\n\nHowever, the question of Macron's ability to influence Trump on issues such as Iran, trade, and climate change remains uncertain. Macron's European plans and centrist ideology have been the subject of debate, with some dismissing them as doomed or disingenuous.\n\nMacron's European ambitions are not only dependent on his domestic reform agenda but also on his ability to raise his profile in Washington and draw credibility from that in Europe. Macron is aware that his presidency was made possible by the 1958 Gaullist constitution, which allows for the circumvention of established parties and the rise of an outsider.\n\nMacron's road to Europe, in this historical context, goes through Washington, as he seeks to navigate the complex relationship with the U.S. and position himself as a leader who can protect Europe from strategic, economic, and ideological threats. The outcome of Macron's trip to the U.S. will be closely watched, as it may determine the future of the global liberal order and European unity.",
    " Title: Trump to Roll Back Obama-Era Clean Power Plan, Signals New Direction for EPA\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump will visit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Tuesday, where he is expected to sign an executive order that will initiate the process of rolling back the Obama-era Clean Power Plan. The visit marks a significant step in EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's efforts to restore the EPA to its original, limited authorities.\n\nIn an interview with an unspecified news outlet, Pruitt stated, \"We're going to roll back those things that were unlawful, we're going to roll back those things that were an overreach, we're going to roll back the steps taken by the previous administration.\" The EPA's federal building, where the meeting will take place, is situated across the street from the Trump International Hotel, which was previously the Old Post Office building.\n\nThe executive order will not only review the Clean Power Plan but also change Obama-era executive orders on climate change and carbon emissions regulations. This shift represents a dramatic departure from Obama's legacy, which prioritized a regulatory agenda focused on climate change.\n\nPruitt expressed optimism about the president's visit, stating that it signaled a new set of priorities for the agency. During Trump's tenure, Pruitt plans to sign a series of rules and procedures to reform the EPA.\n\nRescinding the Clean Power Plan, Pruitt explained, was a reflection of the Trump administration's approach to regulatory reform. Under the Obama administration, Pruitt claimed that the oil, coal, and natural gas industries were subjected to a \"regulatory assault\" that led to job losses across the country.\n\nPruitt believes that regulatory uncertainty has been a significant impediment to economic growth. He stated, \"I think the greatest impediment we've had on economic growth is regulatory uncertainty.\" Trump, he explained, understands that the regulatory process has become so complex that it hinders companies from investing and growing.\n\nPruitt's philosophy aligns with the Trump administration's goal to reduce the federal government's overbearing bureaucracy in order to stimulate economic growth. He stated, \"We have situations here, and this is not just unique to the EPA, it's other agencies at the federal level as well that do permitting, where it takes eight or nine years to get a permit to do something. Well, that's not a decision, that's obstructionism.\"\n\nPruitt aims to restore confidence among businesses and workers in the energy industry, particularly in coal, natural gas, and oil. He stated, \"Agencies at the federal level are part of the executive branch, they exist to enforce the law, not make the law.\"\n\nPruitt described his philosophy as \"EPA originalism,\" and his goal is to refocus the agency toward Congress's original authorities. This shift in focus is intended to send a different message to the industries regulated by the EPA.\n\nPruitt believes that the agency should return its focus to tackling big environmental cleanup projects. He plans to address the 1300 hazardous \"superfund sites\" designated by the agency as priority areas for cleanup. Many of these sites, he noted, have been on the national priority list for 30-40 years, which he considers a sign that they are not being addressed effectively.\n\nThe executive order will not repeal the EPA's Endangerment Finding on CO2 emissions, but Pruitt expressed openness to addressing it in the future. He stated, \"I think that if there are petitions for reconsideration for the endangering findings, we'll have to address those at some point.\"\n\nPruitt led the legal charge against the EPA as the Attorney General of Oklahoma, suing the agency 13 different times. He has a reputation for challenging environmentalist priorities, but some critics have questioned his stance on climate change.",
    " Title: Putin Expresses Concern Over U.S.-Russia Relations, Threatens No Contact with Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has expressed concern that ongoing investigations in the United States are hindering improved relations with Moscow. In a speech at an economic forum in St. Petersburg, Putin stated, \"We are hostages to this internal strife in the United States.\" He added, \"I hope that it will end some day and the objective need for the development of Russian-American relationships will prevail.\"\n\nDuring the forum, attended by world leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Putin also announced his intention to step down from his post in 2024, adhering to the Russian constitution's ban on anyone serving two consecutive presidential terms. However, Putin's pledge does not necessarily mean he will retire, as he previously stepped down after two terms to become prime minister before returning to the presidency in 2012.\n\nPutin criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, stating, \"What should it be punished for, then?\" The move has also strained relations between Washington and Europe. Putin also criticized U.S. sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.\n\nThe Russian president bemoaned the \"chaotic\" situation of economic punishment and said the \"sanctions baton\" is being used more often in the world, not just toward Moscow. Putin also took a jab at Macron over Europe's rift with Trump regarding Iran, stating, \"Don\u2019t you worry, we will help ensure your security.\" Macron responded on a serious note that France and its allies could stand for themselves.\n\nIn addition to his comments on U.S.-Russia relations and the Iran nuclear deal, Putin also addressed the ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, stating that the situation is \"as though everyone is playing football, but at the same time, they are applying judo rules to it [the match].\" Putin added, \"It's neither football, nor judo. It's just chaos.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Surpasses 3 Million Coronavirus Cases as Infections Surge in More Than Half of States\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States surpassed 3 million confirmed coronavirus cases on Wednesday, according to data from the John Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. The U.S. reported 3,009,611 cases at midday on Wednesday, with Tuesday marking a record of 60,000 new cases.\n\nCalifornia and Texas both reported over 10,000 new cases in a single day, shattering previous records. Arizona, Florida, and South Carolina have led the world in new cases over the last seven days, according to data from the New York Times.\n\nHospitals in Florida have run out of beds in their intensive care units, despite Gov. Ron DeSantis' continued downplaying of the situation and refusal to release critical information about hospitalizations. Florida recorded more than 15,000 new COVID-19 cases in one day, the highest single-day increase in any state.\n\nExperts previously predicted a summer lull in infections, but that never materialized. Many states, facing pressure from business leaders and the White House, rushed to reopen without fully anticipating the impact on new infections.\n\nWhite House coronavirus task force coordinator Deborah Birx stated in a Sirius XM interview on Tuesday that states ignored guidelines put in place by federal and local public health officials and \"stepped on the gas\" while reopening, causing this new surge.\n\nAfter calling on governors to reopen state economies, the Trump administration has now shifted its attention to pressuring schools to fully reopen in the fall. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released guidance for safely reopening schools, but President Trump tweeted his displeasure with his own public health agency on Wednesday, stating the guidelines were too burdensome and \"expensive.\"\n\nTesting capacity is being strained in those states with the largest number of new infections, and supply chain issues that plagued the country early in the pandemic have resurfaced.\n\nWhile Trump and other administration officials have latched onto a declining fatality rate as a sign of progress, Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, said focusing on that one statistic is a \"false narrative.\"\n\n\"There's so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus, don't get yourself into a false complacency,\" Fauci said.\n\nDeaths are a lagging indicator in an outbreak, and will rise as people generally don't die until weeks after they become sick. In addition, many of the newly infected have been young people, who generally tend to be healthier.\n\n\"But that doesn't mean that you could not get seriously ill,\" Fauci said.",
    " Title: Reliance Industries Launches JioMart, Moves Closer to Competing with Amazon in Indian E-commerce Market\n\nArticle:\n\nReliance Industries Ltd., an Indian conglomerate controlled by Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, has started testing its online shopping portal, JioMart. This move signifies a step towards Ambani's goal of establishing a digital platform to compete with e-commerce giants such as Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.'s Flipkart Online Services Pvt. in India.\n\nJioMart, currently available in three neighborhoods surrounding Mumbai, offers more than 50,000 grocery products, free home delivery, and a lenient return policy. The portal, labeled as \"the nation's new store,\" is a prelude to how Reliance Industries is expanding its consumer offerings, pivoting towards newer businesses.\n\nWith the launch of JioMart, Reliance Industries enters the e-commerce market, which KPMG predicts will grow to $200 billion by 2027. Ambani, who is 62, is investing billions of dollars in a series of small acquisitions to realize his online retail ambitions. These newer businesses, including telecommunications and retail, are expected to contribute 50% of Reliance Industries' earnings in a few years, up from the current 32%.\n\nAmbani's previous project, requiring nearly $50 billion of capital expenditure, is already showing signs of success. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., the group's wireless carrier started in 2016, is India's No.1 operator today and has more than 350 million users. The company entered the world's second-largest market by subscribers with free calls and cheap data, forcing some incumbents to exit or merge with rivals.\n\nAmbani aims to replicate this success in online retail, terming it \"new commerce.\" In August, he stated his goal is to \"completely transform\" India's unorganized retail market, which accounts for 90% of the nation's industry.\n\nAmazon and Walmart face competition from this tech-enabled partnership, as Ambani plans to link producers, traders, small merchants, consumer brands, and consumers through JioMart. After beta trials with thousands of merchants across the country showed promise, Reliance Industries is now preparing to roll out the platform on a larger scale.\n\nReliance Industries has also unveiled a plan to create a $24 billion digital-services holding firm and has vowed to list the new businesses within five years. Investors have responded positively, with Reliance Industries shares soaring 36% this year, compared to the 15% advance in the benchmark index. The gains have added more than $15 billion to Ambani's wealth, making him the wealthiest person in Asia with a net worth of almost $60 billion, according to the Billionaires Index.",
    " Title: Uninsured Americans Decrease by About 25 Percent Due to Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nThe number of uninsured Americans has decreased by approximately 25 percent this year, according to various private sector surveys and a government report. This equates to eight million to eleven million people who have gained health insurance.\n\nOf these newly insured individuals, it appears that more than half have enrolled in Medicaid, particularly in states that expanded eligibility for the government health care program for lower-income residents. The remaining individuals have enrolled in private health plans through the new state insurance marketplaces.\n\nIn addition to the recent changes, three to four million people, primarily young adults, became newly insured through provisions of the Affordable Care Act that took effect before this year.\n\nDan Witters, the research director of the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, which has been surveying Americans about their health insurance status since 2008, stated, \"There's no question it's come down.\" Gallup has recorded a drop in the percentage of American adults without insurance from 18 percent in mid-2013 to 13.4 percent by the end of May. These results are consistent with other polls.\n\nThe reduction in the uninsured population is still a topic of debate, with some considering it a success and others viewing it as a disappointment. When the health care law passed in 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that by 2017 about 32 million more Americans would gain insurance through the law. Due to policy changes, the budget office's current estimate is now lower, about 26 million people. The nation appears to be at least a third of the way to that target.\n\nDetailed demographic data from large government surveys, which are generally considered the most reliable, lag behind the private surveys. However, a few trends are clear. Most notably, Medicaid expansion has significantly impacted the reduction in the uninsured population. States that expanded their programs have seen a substantially larger reduction in their uninsured population than states that did not expand.\n\nCritics have raised concerns about the sustainability of the coverage gains, with worries that some people may have signed up and then cycled out of coverage quickly due to failed premium payments, or that many of the health plans people bought covered too few doctors or required too high a payment out of pocket to provide meaningful access to coverage.\n\nOver the next four years, the law is projected to expand coverage to millions more Americans. However, it is expected that about 30 million people will remain uninsured even after several years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Some of this is by design, as people in the country illegally are excluded from coverage under the law. Additionally, about four million low-income Americans are caught in a policy gap in those states that have not expanded Medicaid.",

They ought not to be just codified in their communities, but make sure that all their kids are learning to speak English.\"\n\nThe response to Brokaw's comments was swift and critical. Aura Bogado, an investigative immigration reporter at Reveal, described his remarks as a \"deeply racist rant.\" Julio Ricardo Varela, the founder of LatinoRebels.com, called the comments \"xenophobic.\"\n\nLiberal commentator Maria Cardona described Brokaw as \"a little out of touch\" and insisted that \"Latinos absolutely assimilate.\" However, many Hispanics do not speak English, contradicting Cardona's assertion.\n\nBrokaw's fellow panelist on \"Meet the Press,\" Yamiche Alcindor, argued that the idea that Americans can only speak English is \"troubling.\" She added that \"Spanish and other languages were always part of America.\"\n\nHowever, the Founding Fathers did not speak or write in Spanish, and those who cannot speak, understand, read, and write English will likely face challenges in advancing socially, economically, or politically in the United States.\n\nWithin a few hours of the backlash, Brokaw issued an apology on Twitter, stating that his remarks were \"offensive to many\" and that he never intended to disparage any segment of society. He also apologized to Yamiche Alcindor, despite their contradictory views on assimilation.\n\nOn Fox News, Geraldo Rivera argued that Hispanics are assimilating at a faster rate than any other ethnic group in U.S. history. However, data from the Census Bureau shows that the fraction of U.S. households answering yes to the question of speaking a language other than English at home has risen steadily over the last three decades, reaching 22 percent in 2017.\n\nMany of those who speak another language at home claim they also speak English well or very well, but further studies have shown that is not the case. Nearly half were found to speak English at a level below basic, also known as functional illiteracy.\n\nThe American Community Survey enables the Census Bureau to track the number of households who self-report that they speak a language other than English at home. In 39 U.S. counties, a majority of residents report that they speak a language other than English at home.\n\nBrokaw's sons, John and Andy Schlafly, lead the continuing Phyllis Schlafly Eagles organizations with writing and policy work. Phyllis Schlafly (1924-2016) was a conservative activist and author who opposed the Equal Rights Amendment and was a prominent figure in the anti-feminist movement.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Faces Challenges in Steering Tax Reform and Year-End Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner is facing the task of steering reluctant Republicans toward a year-end tax reform deal and a broader budget agreement. The focus in Washington is on the top rates for upper-income households, but before any tax reform, two critical questions need to be addressed: the revenue target and the standard of progressivity that will govern the revised code.\n\nThe 1980s tax reformers did not initially aim to eliminate the preferential treatment for capital gains; the capital gains rate ended up at 28 percent, nearly double what Mitt Romney has been paying and 8 points higher than what President Barack Obama wants. The 1986 tax reform effort, as counsel to the Joint Tax Committee, David Brockway testified in September, demonstrated that the same pressures will be even greater on any reform effort now.\n\nThe speaker's office admits that neither the revenue target nor the aggregate revenue commitment has been determined yet. Until these questions are answered, all the Washington talk is primarily speculation. Friday's White House meeting offers a fresh start, but Obama will have to show more give on the spending side of the ledger if he expects Boehner to steer reluctant Republicans toward a year-end deal.\n\nThe White House will have to address two contentious issues to change the tone: reforms in the food stamp program and action on a long-discussed change in the inflation index used to adjust government benefits as well as tax brackets. Each option risks the ire of certain groups, but thoughtful people in both parties can agree that long-range changes are needed.\n\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has developed a model for a new CPI that eases the impact on the most elderly Social Security recipients and still saves about $150 billion over 10 years. In the case of food stamps, Obama bears responsibility for having turned a nutrition program into an economic stimulus machine. Reforms here could also make it easier to advance a long-delayed farm bill that promises billions in additional savings by ending an outdated system of direct cash payments to producers.\n\nThe House Agriculture Committee leadership got little credit for trying, but a bipartisan plan was developed that would have set a new national standard for food stamps to replace the patchwork quilt that has developed as cash-strapped governors bent the rules to help low-income families\u2014all at federal expense.",

The program, which is expected to benefit 150,000 individuals, is set to roll out on Monday, according to The New York Times.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom announced the program in a statement, stating, \"Every Californian, including our undocumented neighbors and friends, should know that California is here to support them during this crisis.\" The $75 million program is funded by taxpayer dollars and will be conducted by phone to minimize in-person contacts. The maximum amount awarded per household is $1,000.\n\nApplicants must demonstrate that they are unauthorized, jobless due to the pandemic, and do not qualify for unemployment programs or stimulus checks. The state has directed the funding to 12 nonprofit organizations, who will be responsible for evaluating applicants and distributing aid.\n\nOver 2 million unauthorized immigrants reside in California, according to the California Public Policy Institute, and they constitute around 9% of its labor force. Many work in low-wage jobs in hotels and restaurants, which have been heavily impacted by the pandemic.\n\nHouse Democrats approved a $3 trillion coronavirus spending package on Friday, which includes a provision that would allow unauthorized immigrants left out of the initial wave of $1,200 stimulus checks to qualify for a direct federal payment with their Taxpayer Identification Numbers. However, the legislation is facing opposition from Republicans, who have declared the Heroes Act dead on arrival in the Senate and consider the legislation mostly symbolic.\n\nAround 11 million unauthorized immigrants reside in the US, according to the Pew Research Center.",

Dan Pfeiffer, a senior White House adviser, emphasized that 90% of Americans support the President's proposal to expand background checks for citizens purchasing guns.\n\nPfeiffer, in interviews on Fox News Sunday and ABC's This Week, urged Republicans to support what he termed as \"common-sense measures.\" He stated, \"You can\u2019t get 90 percent of Americans to agree on the weather.\"\n\nPfeiffer expressed concern over a potential Republican filibuster, which he believes is obstructing the passage of significant and meaningful gun-reform legislation. He said, \"It can get done, but what\u2019s it\u2019s going to require is for Republicans not to filibuster.\"\n\nSen. John McCain (R-AZ) may be a potential ally in this endeavor, as he suggested his party should not filibuster gun-control debates. McCain stated, \"Everybody wants the same goal, which is to keep the guns out of the hands of criminals and people who are mentally disabled.\"\n\nFormer Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-AR), now the director of the National Rifle Association's National School Shield Task Force, advocated for armed guards in schools to protect teachers and students. Hutchinson argued, \"Whatever you do, even if you have universal background checks, bad guys are going to get guns, and it\u2019s not going to diminish the need for security in schools.\"\n\nHowever, Pfeiffer criticized the NRA's suggestions, which are supported by many Republicans, arguing that more guns would escalate the situation. He said, \"There is no one who\u2019s looked at these issues who thinks that that is the best response.\"\n\nPfeiffer concluded, \"We should do more to make our schools safe, absolutely, but that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t also take common-sense measures that are supported by the majority of Americans.\"",

The referendum, expected to have a significant impact regardless of the outcome, is taking place with a historically high turnout of 4,285,323 registered voters at 2,608 polling stations across the country. The result is expected early on Friday morning.\n\nThe question posed to voters is simple: \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\" Public opinion polls suggest a close vote, with the outcome uncertain. British Prime Minister David Cameron, in an emotional appeal, warned that a vote for independence would lead to a \"painful divorce.\" He acknowledged the unpopularity of his conservative government among more liberal-minded Scots, stating, \"If you don't like me\u2014I won't be here forever. But if you leave the U.K., that will be forever.\"\n\nPresident Obama and former President Bill Clinton have also weighed in, urging a \"no\" vote. Alex Salmond, the leader of the campaign for independence, cast his ballot in his home village of Aberdeenshire. He expressed optimism, stating, \"We're in the hands of the people of Scotland, and there's no safer place to be than in the hands of the Scottish people.\"\n\nThe outcome of the vote is being closely watched in other independence-minded regions of the world, including Quebec, Catalonia, and Kashmir. Leighton Andrews, the public services minister for Wales, predicted \"radical\" constitutional change for the U.K. as a direct result of the vote. He stated, \"I think it will have major implications for the U.K. regardless of the result of the referendum.\"\n\nThe referendum is a significant event in Scottish and British history, and the outcome will shape the future of Scotland and the United Kingdom.",
    " Title: Former Pentagon Official's Criticism of Whistleblowing System Sparks Calls for Justice Department Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, former CIA head David Petraeus, when asked about Edward Snowden, stated that Snowden should be prosecuted. Snowden, in response, has called for a whistleblower shield after a new Pentagon source's account undermines the idea that the inspector general's office offers a safe route for whistleblowers.\n\nJohn Crane, who supervised the whistleblower-protection unit of the Pentagon inspector general, has provided a detailed account in Mark Hertsgaard's book, \"Bravehearts: Whistle-Blowing in the Age of Snowden.\" Crane's account suggests that the inspector general's office, meant to aid whistleblowers, may instead put them in danger.\n\nOne of the cases Crane discusses is that of Thomas Drake, an NSA employee who took his concerns about warrantless surveillance to the inspector-general's office after the 9/11 attacks. Crane suspects that instead of protecting Drake, his identity was passed to the justice department.\n\nThe stakes for an inquiry at the US justice department, set to launch on 1 June, are high. The future of national security whistleblowing depends on the outcome. Will it follow Snowden's model or Drake's?\n\nSnowden told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that there are no examples of whistleblowers who have faced no retaliation after disclosing classified information. Many in US national security circles dismiss Snowden as a traitor, a spy, or a Russian stooge. Others acknowledge that episodes like Drake's indicate the institutional deck is stacked against an insider seeking to warn of the dangers to freedom represented by bulk surveillance carried out by the US intelligence apparatus.\n\nCrane, who lost his career for defending Drake, is conflicted about Snowden. He hopes that the US justice department inquiry will deter future Snowdens and convince them that they can work within the system. However, some, like Jesselyn Radack, a prominent whistleblower lawyer who represented Crane and Drake, are skeptical that the inquiry will yield the necessary reforms.\n\nTom Devine, another of Crane's attorneys, believes the inquiry is a step necessary to save a broken whistleblower system. Once the inquiry ends, probably next year, the office will alert Congress and the White House and post its work product online, providing a foundation for long-term efforts for reform.\n\nOne of the routes supposedly open to Snowden would have been to go to Congress. The problem with this is that the critical figures in Congress already knew about the scale of mass surveillance but did not act. It was left to Snowden to make his flight to Hong Kong.",
    " Title: FBI Investigation into Alleged Russian Connections in Trump Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nFBI officials declined to comment on Monday regarding the ongoing investigation into potential links between the Russian government and the 2016 Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Intelligence officials have stated in interviews over the past six weeks that apparent connections between some of Trump's aides and Moscow initially prompted the broad investigation. However, they have emphasized that Trump himself has not become a target of the investigation, and no evidence has emerged linking him or his associates directly to Russia's election operations.\n\nAt least one part of the investigation has involved Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign chairman for much of the year. Manafort, a veteran Republican political strategist, has had extensive business ties in Russia and other former Soviet states, particularly Ukraine, where he served as an adviser to the ousted president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. The focus in Manafort's case was on his ties with a kleptocratic government in Ukraine\u2014and whether he had declared the income in the United States\u2014and not necessarily on any Russian influence over Trump's campaign, one official said.\n\nIn classified sessions in August and September, intelligence officials briefed congressional leaders on the possibility of financial ties between Russians and people connected to Trump. They focused particular attention on what cyberexperts said appeared to be a mysterious computer back channel between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, one of Russia's biggest banks, whose owners have longstanding ties to Putin.\n\nFBI officials spent weeks examining computer data showing an odd stream of activity to a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank. Computer logs obtained by The New York Times show that two servers at Alfa Bank sent more than 2,700 \"look-up\" messages\u2014a first step for one system's computers to talk to another\u2014to a Trump-connected server beginning in the spring. However, the FBI ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, such as a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts.\n\nThe most serious part of the FBI's investigation has focused on the computer hacks that the Obama administration now formally blames on Russia. That investigation also involves numerous officials from the intelligence agencies. Investigators have become increasingly confident, based on the evidence they have uncovered, that Russia's direct goal is not to support the election of Trump, as many Democrats have asserted, but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine America's standing in the world more broadly.\n\nThe hacking reflected an intensification of spy-versus-spy operations that never entirely abated after the Cold War but that have become more aggressive in recent years as relations with Putin's Russia have soured.",

His death was not unexpected, as he had stepped down as first minister in January due to a scandal involving his coalition partner, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). However, McGuinness stated that he was stepping down for health reasons and would not seek re-election.\n\nThroughout his life, McGuinness was a controversial figure due to his past as an IRA commander. In the latter half of his life, he transitioned from a violent revolutionary to a statesman. For many Irish people in their late 30s, McGuinness was known as one half of a double-act with Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams during the early years of the peace process in the 1990s. McGuinness was often referred to as the \"sinister minister\" during this time.\n\nIn the latter part of his career, McGuinness became deputy first minister of Northern Ireland and worked alongside unionist leaders such as Ian Paisley, who was known as \"Dr. No\" due to his refusal to speak to Irish republicans for three decades. McGuinness and Paisley were later referred to as \"the Chuckle Brothers\" due to their apparent camaraderie.\n\nMcGuinness's tactics changed from violence to politics, with the ballot box replacing the gun, and symbolic measures taking on more and more significance. In 2011, he ran for the presidency of Ireland but did not win. Despite this, McGuinness's stock rose in the years following his political career, while Adams's stock fell.\n\nMcGuinness's IRA membership was not a secret, and he admitted his membership. Unlike Adams, who has been dogged by accusations of authorizing the murder of Jean McConville, one of the most controversial killings in the Irish conflict, McGuinness's past was viewed in a more sympathetic light, particularly as he was from and active in Derry during the Bloody Sunday massacre in 1972, when 26 unarmed civilians were shot, 14 of them fatally, by British soldiers.\n\nMcGuinness's IRA membership was not a secret, and a photographer who had been in a rival republican group once showed the author a letter, dated from the 1970s, that described the young IRA commander in Derry as a likely future major player. McGuinness's journey from gunman to statesman was real, and his legacy proves that even in this era of post-modern \"plural narratives\" and \"fake news,\" brute facts and truth still matter.",
    " Title: Senate Confirms Loretta Lynch as Attorney General, First Black Woman to Hold Post\n\nArticle:\n\nSenators have confirmed Loretta Lynch as the new Attorney General, defeating an early filibuster attempt on Thursday morning. The final vote is scheduled for later in the afternoon, marking a significant milestone in civil rights history.\n\nLoretta Lynch, a federal prosecutor in New York, will replace Eric H. Holder Jr. and become the first black woman to hold the top law enforcement post in the country. She cleared the filibuster with a 66-34 vote, with Republican opposition primarily directed at President Obama, whose policies she will be tasked with defending.\n\nThe opposition to Ms. Lynch stems from President Obama's clashes with Congress over immigration, health care, and environmental policy. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who voted against Ms. Lynch, expressed concerns about her stance on the president's executive action on immigration.\n\nPresident Obama nominated Ms. Lynch following the 2014 elections, hoping for quick action. However, Democrats delayed action on her during the lame-duck session of Congress, believing she would easily clear when the GOP took control in January. Instead, she languished as both sides clashed over abortion-funding provisions in a bill against human trafficking. An agreement this week cleared that snag, setting up the final Lynch vote.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the delays as a black mark for Republicans, whom they accused of thwarting civil rights history. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, stated, \"At long last this embarrassment for the Senate is over and this triumph for the American people will occur.\"\n\nLoretta Lynch grew up in a North Carolina still grappling with civil rights issues. She was the valedictorian at her high school but was denied sole recognition due to her race. She graduated from Harvard College and obtained her law degree from Harvard Law School. She has twice served as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York\u2014first under President Clinton and beginning again under President Obama.\n\nNone of her opponents questioned her qualifications, and she has headed some of the Justice Department's highest-profile cases, including terrorism prosecutions and the case against former Rep. Michael Grimm, a New York Republican who resigned his seat and pleaded guilty.\n\nThe opposition to Ms. Lynch primarily stems from her defense of President Obama's policies, particularly his executive actions, which have drawn fierce pushback from Republicans. At her confirmation hearing, Ms. Lynch defended the Justice Department's legal reasoning underpinning Mr. Obama's deportation amnesty programs and refused to second-guess the president on a series of other actions.\n\nRepublicans also demanded to know how Ms. Lynch would be different from Mr. Holder, who has repeatedly clashed with the GOP, accused Mr. Obama's opponents of being motivated by race, and withheld documents from Congress\u2014resulting in him being the first attorney general in history to be held in contempt of Congress.\n\nAt her confirmation hearing and in written responses to follow-up questions, Ms. Lynch insisted she would be different from Mr. Holder, though the only area she specifically identified where she might draw distinctions was on her willingness to be transparent.\n\nDemocrats said opposing Ms. Lynch because she defended the president was a troubling precedent to set. Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, stated, \"This defies common sense... You must vote against a nominee for the Cabinet of the duly elected president of the United States because she agrees with the duly elected president of the United States? Think of the consequences of that vote. Think what that means to the future of advise and consent in the Senate.\"\n\nHowever, Republicans argued that her agreement with Mr. Obama went beyond normal bounds and suggested she would not be the independent officer they insisted the attorney general needs to be. They contrasted her with Sally Quillian Yates, whom Mr. Obama nominated to be deputy attorney general and who cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee on an 18-2 vote Thursday morning, just minutes before the filibuster vote on Ms. Lynch.\n\nMs. Yates, who is white, is a prosecutor in Georgia, and had strong support of that state's two Republican senators, which helped her nomination. During her confirmation hearings, she generally defended the president's policies but did say she viewed the role of the Justice Department as being an independent constitutional authority whose clients are the American people, not the president or Congress.\n\n\"This may seem to some like a small point,\" said Sen. Charles E. Grassley, Iowa Republican and chairman of the committee, who helped shepherd Ms. Yates's nomination through the panel but said he was opposing Ms. Lynch.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Release Revised Obamacare Replacement Bill, Uncertainty Remains\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a revised version of their plan to replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), Senate Republicans have dropped some tax cuts for the wealthy, allowed for more insurance policies with limited coverage, and increased funding to fight the opioid addiction epidemic. However, it remains unclear whether the changes are sufficient to win over moderates concerned about the bill's cuts to Medicaid and private insurance subsidies, or whether conservatives are satisfied with the bill's repeal of enough of the Affordable Care Act's taxes and regulations.\n\nThe revised bill retains taxes on investment income and high earners imposed by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). It no longer eliminates the ACA's limit on executive pay that insurance companies can write off as a corporate tax deduction. The bill still repeals other ACA taxes, including those on tanning beds, sectors of the health care industry, and on high-cost employer-provided insurance plans.\n\nThe bill would still provide subsidies to reduce the cost of premiums, but these subsidies could be reduced for some individuals. The income limit for subsidies would be lowered slightly and would become less generous. People with tax-advantaged Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) can use their HSA contributions to pay for premiums, instead of just for health services and products as they can now.\n\nThe bill would allow anyone to buy catastrophic plans, including those who qualify for subsidies. These plans have low premiums but high deductibles and limited benefits.\n\nIf an insurer offers plans that meet the ACA's requirements, including covering minimum benefits and not charging sicker people more, the insurer could receive funding to help cover the cost of sick customers. However, it's unclear whether the funding would be enough to keep the plans affordable. Because insurers would also be able to sell plans that don't meet the ACA's requirements, this could segment the market into sick and healthy people, potentially increasing costs for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe bill would not change the ACA's rule that dependent children can stay on a parent's plan until age 26. However, enhanced federal funding for the low-income adults who became newly qualified would be phased out, ending after 2024. Federal support for traditional Medicaid would also still be scaled back.\n\nThe revised bill does include changes to the way hospitals are paid by the federal government to help cover the bills of the uninsured, which are expected to increase. If a state has a health emergency, the extra spending needed would not count toward the state's new limit on federal Medicaid dollars.\n\nThe bill still effectively removes the ACA's requirement that most people buy insurance by eliminating the tax penalties for failing to do so. Those who have a gap in their insurance coverage would have to wait six months before they can re-enroll.\n\nThe bill would still end the ACA's penalties for larger employers who do not offer insurance to workers. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said fewer employers will offer coverage if that change is made.\n\nThe revised bill increases funding to states for addiction services, including $45 billion instead of the $2 billion in the initial version. However, it could still fall short of what's needed.\n\nAs in the original version, insurance plans sold through the exchanges could not cover abortion services. There's an exception for abortions performed to save the life of the mother, or to end a pregnancy that resulted from rape or incest. The bill would also continue to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funding for a year. GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska oppose this provision.",
    " Title: Republican Congressman Justin Amash's Call for Impeachment of President Trump Based on Mueller Report\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican Congressman Justin Amash of Michigan has stated that President Donald Trump's actions, as detailed in the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, constitute \"impeachable conduct.\" The House of Representatives defines impeachable conduct, and this point seems to be a subject of debate among Trump's supporters and critics.\n\nAmash's assertion, which makes him the first Republican legislator to publicly support this view, has received mixed reactions. Senator Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential nominee, praised Amash's \"courageous statement\" but disagreed with his conclusion, arguing that there are insufficient elements to establish a case for obstruction of justice.\n\nHowever, the Mueller report suggests that at least some of Trump's attempts to interfere with the investigation of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election could be considered obstruction of justice. These attempts include Trump's efforts to stop the FBI investigation of his former national security adviser, repeated demands for Mueller's removal, pressuring White House Counsel Donald McGahn to deny Trump's attempts to fire Mueller, urging his attorney general to take control of the Russia investigation and limit its scope, and discouraging witnesses from cooperating with it.\n\nMueller's report also makes it clear that the president cannot obstruct justice by exercising his constitutional powers, which include control of the Justice Department. However, this does not cover Trump's attempts to influence the testimony of witnesses such as McGahn, his former lawyer Michael Cohen, and his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n\nThe fact that Trump's efforts to impede federal investigations were mostly unsuccessful does not exonerate him, as attempted obstruction is also a crime. Furthermore, the report did not find evidence that anyone in the Trump campaign illegally conspired with Russian agents, but Trump's actions could still be seen as an abuse of power that betrays the public trust.\n\nAmash argues that impeachable offenses extend beyond provable statutory violations to abuses of power that betray the public trust. Trump's own lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has admitted that it would be \"unthinkable\" for Trump to pardon himself, which could lead to immediate impeachment.\n\nWhile both parties seem to agree that impeachment might be politically unwise given the current political climate, the decision to tolerate presidential behavior that potentially obstructs justice could send a significant message about the standards of presidential conduct that Congress is willing to accept.",
    " Title: Senate Overcomes Filibuster, Advances Kavanaugh Nomination Amidst Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate overcame a Democrat-led filibuster on Friday, moving Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh one step closer to confirmation. The 51-49 vote saw one defection from each party, resulting in a 50-50 tie that was broken by the Vice President, allowing Kavanaugh to clear the procedural hurdle. A final confirmation vote is scheduled for Saturday, but its outcome remains uncertain.\n\nThe vote was a significant milestone for Republicans, who viewed it as an opportunity to send a message of unity amidst deep political divisions and partisan rancor. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stated, \"We know the Senate is better than this. We know the nation deserves better than this.\"\n\nFour senators were undecided leading up to the vote: Republican Sens. Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, and Lisa Murkowski, and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. Murkowski joined Democrats in the filibuster, but the other three voted to end debate and advance to a final vote. Collins, however, has indicated that her vote Friday morning was only to overcome the filibuster, and she will announce her final stance on confirming Judge Kavanaugh later in the day.\n\nDemocratic leaders criticized the confirmation process, accusing Republicans of rushing the judge through too quickly, questioning his conservatism, and suggesting that President Trump chose Kavanaugh to shield himself from legal troubles related to the special counsel's Russia probe. They also cited the recent sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat at the center of the confirmation battle, stated, \"Based on all the factors we have before us, I do not believe Judge Kavanaugh has earned this seat.\" However, Democrats acknowledged that they would likely have faced similar opposition to any pick made by President Trump.\n\nRepublicans had initially hoped to have Kavanaugh on the high court in time for the justices' new session, which began earlier this week. However, last-minute sexual assault allegations disrupted this schedule, necessitating new hearings and an updated FBI investigation.\n\nThe hearing and the FBI probe did not appear to resolve the deep divide among Americans regarding Kavanaugh's credibility. Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh's chief accuser, alleges he assaulted her at a high school party in 1982. Witnesses identified by Ford have refuted her story, and Kavanaugh has vehemently denied her claim.\n\nDespite this, support for Ford remains strong, particularly among anti-Trump activists who view Kavanaugh's confirmation as an opportunity to deal a significant blow to the president. They also fear that Kavanaugh's conservative views could shift the court's balance and lead to right-wing activism.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Kavanaugh's nomination has sparked protests both inside and outside the Senate, with hundreds being arrested inside congressional office buildings on Thursday. For Democratic senators, there was little they liked about the judge or the process.\n\nDespite the production of a record number of documents for review, millions of pages were not produced, leading to suspicions that significant information remains hidden. Democrats also complained about Kavanaugh's behavior during the confirmation hearings, citing his angry denunciation of the allegations against him as non-judicial.\n\nFriday's vote to overcome the filibuster sets up a final vote on Saturday, although there are potential complications. One Republican senator plans to attend his daughter's wedding on Saturday, which could affect the timing of the vote. Additionally, Sen. Jeff Merkley is pursuing a lawsuit to request a judge to intervene and order the release of more documents from Kavanaugh's past, which the Oregon Democrat hopes will delay the confirmation process.",
    " Title: U.S. Loses Leverage in Syria Chemical Weapons Negotiations, According to Rep. Mike Rogers\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, CNN - Republican Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, argued Sunday that the United States lost its leverage in the negotiations over chemical weapons in Syria, giving Russia a strategic advantage. If Congress had authorized the president to strike Syria, things would have looked more favorable for the U.S., according to Rogers.\n\nRogers, speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" said, \"I think [the president's] hand would have been strengthened significantly if Congress would have given him the authority for a surgical strike to degrade [Syria's] chemical weapons use and he look like a commander in chief.\"\n\nRogers criticized the president for failing to adequately explain why an attack against Syria would be in the United States' security interests. He stated, \"All of that confusion allowed Putin to step in and fill the void.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the U.S. and Russia reached a deal on a framework that would allow Syria to hand over control of its chemical weapons. The deal, however, does not include a threat of military force should Syria fail to follow through with giving up its stockpiles.\n\nRogers told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley, \"Not one ounce of chemical weapons came off the battlefield, but we've given up every ounce of our leverage when it comes to trying to solve the broader Syrian problem, because we've taken away a credible military threat.\"\n\nRogers warned of the \"indecisiveness\" of the Obama administration in the past few weeks, stating that it \"gave the diplomatic advantage\" to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California was less pessimistic about the diplomatic deal, calling it a \"very positive step.\" Schiff acknowledged it's been an \"ugly\" process and it's going to be \"tough\" to ensure Syria follows through, but he said it's \"the best pathway we've seen in the last couple years.\"\n\nOn Putin, Schiff downplayed the Russian president's strategic abilities, saying he's less like a master chess player and more like \"a lawyer who lost control of his client.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama, in an interview that aired Sunday, said he's not concerned with criticism of his handling of the Syria situation, stating that Washington tends to make judgments based on style rather than substance.\n\nObama said, \"We know that, 'cause that's exactly how they graded the Iraq War - until it ended up\u2026 blowing up in our face.\" He added, \"I'm less concerned about style points, I'm much more concerned about getting the policy right.\"\n\nWatch State of the Union with Candy Crowley Sundays at 9am ET.

    " Title: \"Economic Recovery and the 2016 Presidential Election: An Analysis of Obama's Legacy and Clinton's Loss\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe article discusses the economic recovery under President Barack Obama and the 2016 presidential election, focusing on the role of the economy in the election outcome and the legacy of Obama's policies.\n\nThe article asserts that the economy, under Obama's administration, has recovered more quickly and strongly than other wealthy countries following the 2008 financial crisis. It is noted that Donald Trump, the eventual winner of the 2016 presidential election, will inherit an economy that is vastly different from the one Obama inherited in 2009.\n\nThe article argues that Obama's policies, such as the stimulus, making the tax code more progressive, protecting consumers and the environment, and ensuring greater access to healthcare, contributed to the strong job and wage growth. It is suggested that the Republican Party, and not Trump, should not be given credit for the economic improvements achieved under Obama's policies.\n\nThe article also discusses the role of Hillary Clinton's campaign in the 2016 election, stating that Clinton lost the election due to a small number of votes in three states. It is noted that Clinton's campaign chose to focus more on Trump's bigotry rather than on the economy and her plans to help the economically vulnerable.\n\nThe article concludes by emphasizing the importance of the economy in future elections and the need for Democrats to focus on the economy and talk about their record of creating an economy that works for the majority of Americans. It is suggested that Republican policies cause economic messes and benefit the wealthy, while Democratic policies help the economically vulnerable and create an economy that benefits the 99%.\n\nThe article also mentions Ian Reifowitz, the author of \"Obama's America: A Transformative Vision of Our National Identity.\" The article does not provide specific details about the book or its content.",
    " Title: Obama and Romney Disagree on U.S. Troop Presence in Iraq During 2012 Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring Monday night's presidential debate, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama disagreed on the U.S. troop presence in Iraq. The nearly nine-year war in Iraq remains a contentious issue, and the candidates' claims were examined.\n\nThe Status of Forces Agreement signed in 2008 called for U.S. troops to withdraw from Iraqi cities by 2009 and leave the country entirely by the end of 2011. Obama, who opposed the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq while still a state legislator in Illinois, ran for president on a platform of ending that war. However, his administration, which took office after the agreement was signed, tried to negotiate with Iraq to keep between 3,000 and 5,000 American troops in the country to help train Iraqi security forces.\n\nObama stated during the debate that Romney wanted more troops in Iraq, but Romney, who supported the invasion, said Obama wanted to keep U.S. troops there longer but couldn't get the Iraqis to agree. Romney said, \"There was an effort on the part of the president to have a Status of Forces Agreement, and I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on.\"\n\nRomney also stated that Obama's approach to keeping troops in Iraq was precipitous, and he believed a larger force should have remained in Baghdad. In December 2011, with the final pullout looming, Romney told Fox News Sunday that the Obama administration was ending the American presence \"in a precipitous way, and we should have left 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 personnel there to help transition to the Iraqis' own military capabilities.\"\n\nThe last U.S. convoy left Iraq in December 2011, and Obama touted that as a promise kept, saying Americans would be leaving \"with their heads held high.\" The president has also emphasized this point during his re-election campaign. However, Romney has consistently criticized the Obama administration for its failure to reach a deal with the Iraqi government on keeping those troops there.\n\nIn December 2011, with the final pullout approaching, Romney stated that the \"costly gains\" made in Iraq were slipping away. He said, \"The president tried -- and failed -- to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains.\"\n\nBoth candidates' statements are based on factual events. The Obama administration did attempt, unsuccessfully, to extend the presence of a scaled-back U.S. training mission in Iraq, while Romney has said Washington should have kept a considerably larger force in Baghdad.

    " Title: Sioux Tribes in South Dakota Refuse to Remove Coronavirus Checkpoints on Reservation Roads\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Sioux tribes in the U.S. state of South Dakota are maintaining their coronavirus checkpoints on roads that pass through their reservations, despite a request from Governor Kristi Noem to remove them. In a letter sent to several tribal leaders last week, Governor Noem stated that the checkpoints were illegal. However, the Sioux tribes argue that these checkpoints are necessary to prevent the virus from entering their reservations, as their limited healthcare facilities would not be able to handle an outbreak.\n\nCurrently, only essential travel is allowed into the reservations for individuals who have not traveled from a Covid-19 hotspot. Those entering must also complete a health questionnaire. Governor Noem has threatened to take the Oglala Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes to federal court if they do not comply with her demand to remove the checkpoints.\n\nIn response to the governor's letter, Harold Frazier, chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe, stated, \"We will not apologize for being an island of safety in a sea of uncertainty and death.\" He added, \"You continuing to interfere in our efforts to do what science and facts dictate seriously undermines our ability to protect everyone on the reservation.\"\n\nOglala Sioux President Julian Bear Runner stated that Governor Noem's decision \"threatened the sovereign interest of the Oglala people.\" The main purpose of the checkpoints, according to Mr. Frazier, is to monitor and track the virus. He told CNN, \"We want to ensure that people coming from 'hotspots' or highly infected areas, we ask them to go around our land.\"\n\nThe reservations are ill-equipped to deal with a coronavirus outbreak, with the nearest critical care facilities three hours away. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe only operates an eight-bed facility on the reservation and has no intensive care unit for the 12,000 people that live on the reservation.\n\nSouth Dakota is one of a handful of U.S. states that have not issued stay-at-home orders to their residents. As of Sunday, there were 198 cases of Covid-19 among Native Americans in the state, according to state health department figures quoted by CNN. The state has more than 3,500 confirmed cases and at least 34 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. has the highest number of virus deaths and cases in the world, but it also has one of the biggest populations and widespread testing.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Review Constitutionality of Independent Payment Advisory Board in Obamacare Case\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to review a case challenging the constitutionality of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a health care rationing agency established under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The case, Coons v. Lew, argues that IPAB's broad authority to control Medicare costs and implement price controls, levy taxes, and take actions related to the Medicare program without presidential, congressional, or judicial oversight, represents the most extreme consolidation of government power in American history.\n\nThe IPAB is tasked with controlling Medicare costs, and the law grants it broad authority to implement price controls, levy taxes, and take actions deemed \"related to the Medicare program.\" The law makes this group of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats immune from control by the president, Congress, or the courts.\n\nThe law requires IPAB to publish annual \"recommendations\" for controlling Medicare spending, but these recommendations automatically become law without the president's signature, and the law bars Congress from stopping them unless Congress presents an alternative plan that can meet IPAB's spending reductions. The law even prohibits Congress from abolishing IPAB outside of a short window in 2017, and repeal must be supported by an unprecedented supermajority. Furthermore, the law blocks the courts from reviewing IPAB decisions.\n\nThe administration argues that IPAB is not a danger because Obamacare explicitly prohibits it from rationing health care. However, the law does not define \"rationing care,\" and it is unclear whether IPAB's actions would qualify as rationing if they set the price of a lifesaving surgery so low that no doctor would perform it or taxed a drug or device so much that no patient could pay for it.\n\nProponents argue that it was necessary to surrender Congress' role in setting Medicare policy because Congress cannot stand up to the political pressure it receives when members try to cut Medicare spending and services. However, in the case of IPAB, the cure is argued to be far more dangerous than the disease.\n\nThe Constitution's authors intended public pressure to be a key feature of the constitutional government, not a bug, because it serves as an important check on power. Legislators are responsible to their constituents and checked by the other branches of government, but bureaucrats face no such accountability.\n\nEarlier this year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed this challenge to IPAB's constitutionality, stating that because President Obama has not yet appointed anyone to IPAB, it would decline to rule until IPAB flexes its muscles. The unconstitutional lawmaking process itself, though, not any particular edict, must be reviewed.\n\nObamacare states that if the president does not appoint anyone to the board, the secretary of health and human services\u2014a single unelected official\u2014gets to exercise IPAB's vast powers alone. The president's failure to act, therefore, only worsens IPAB's already egregious violations of the Constitution. Given IPAB's unprecedented immunity from control by any of the three constitutional branches of government, if the court does not act now, it may be too late to decide the case later.\n\nChristina Sandefur, a senior lawyer at the Goldwater Institute, argues that the Supreme Court should take up the IPAB case. Never before has Congress gone to such an extreme length to relinquish so much power over such an important matter to an agency that is not answerable to the American people.",
    " Title: Russian National Charged for Conspiring to Interfere in 2018 Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nA Russian national, Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova, has been charged by the U.S. for conspiring to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections, according to the FBI and the Department of Justice. Khusyaynova, a 44-year-old from St. Petersburg, is alleged to have participated in a conspiracy to \"sow discord in the U.S. political system and to undermine faith in our democratic institutions.\"\n\nThe government claims that the conspiracy is part of a 2016 influence operation that dates back to at least May 2014. Khusyaynova, who is the chief accountant of \"Project Lakhta,\" reportedly oversaw a $35 million budget from 2014 to 2018, covering expenses related to activists, social media advertising, and promoting news postings on social networks. The Justice Department states that the proposed operating budget for 2018 alone was over $10 million.\n\nJohn Carlin, former head of the Justice Department's National Security division and author of \"Dawn of the Code War,\" told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Russia is spending millions to undermine American democracy. \"We're under attack now, and our elections are at risk,\" he said. \"There is no way this is taking place without the knowledge of Putin himself.\"\n\nThe indictment describes a large-scale operation overseen by a management group, with several departments, including graphics and design, analysis, search engine optimization, IT, and finance. The conspiracy allegedly attempted to appear as American political activists, hiding the fact that they were Russian. The operation \"inflamed passions\" on various topics, including immigration, gun control, the Confederate flag, race relations, LGBT issues, the Women's March, and the NFL national anthem controversy.\n\nThe conspiracy provided guidance to social media writers, suggesting that people of color who are LGBT are \"less sophisticated\" than those who are white. The indictment also states that infographics \"work well among LGBT and their liberal allies,\" but not so well with conservatives.\n\nPresident Trump, when addressing the news with reporters on Thursday, stated that it had nothing to do with his campaign. \"It had nothing to do with my campaign,\" the president said. \"All of the hackers and all everybody that you see\u2014nothing to do with my campaign. If they're hackers, a lot of them probably liked Hillary Clinton better than me.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, in a rare joint statement, the nation's top law enforcement and intelligence agencies issued a warning against ongoing campaigns by Russia, China, and other foreign actors, including Iran, to undermine confidence in democratic institutions and influence public sentiment and government policies. The statement noted that there had not been any evidence, to date, of a compromise or disruption of election infrastructure.",

He argued that these challenges were more critical than the issue of illegal immigration.\n\n\"We don't need to create artificial crises,\" Mr. Sanders said. \"We have enough real crises.\"\n\nPresident Trump is scheduled to visit McAllen, Texas, on Thursday, while Democrats plan to bring up a series of bills this week to reopen shuttered parts of the government, including the Internal Revenue Service to allow tax refunds to be paid and the Agriculture Department to ensure food assistance and farmer support payments can be made.\n\nThe Treasury Department and the I.R.S. will be addressed first on Thursday, followed by the Agriculture and Interior Department programs, including national parks, on Thursday, and transportation and housing programs on Friday.\n\n\"We are going to, daily, urge and take efforts to open up the government,\" said Representative Steny H.

I did a bad thing.\" Dyson responded, \"A very bad thing.\"\n\nMaher acknowledged the harm caused by the slur, stating, \"That word, I do not care who you are, has caused pain.\" He added that his apology was \"sincere\" and that he regretted using the word, regardless of any malice intended.\n\nThe entire conversation between Maher and Dyson can be watched below.\n\nLater in the show, hip-hop artist turned actor Ice Cube addressed Maher's use of the racial slur. Ice Cube said, \"When I hear my homies say it, it doesn't feel like venom. When I hear a white person say it, it's like a knife.\"\n\nLast weekend, Maher issued an apology in which he admitted \"the word was offensive\" and expressed regret for using it. HBO called the comment \"inexcusable and tasteless\" and announced they would edit that part out for future airings of the episode.\n\nHowever, the fallout did not stop. Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) canceled his appearance on Friday's episode. He was to have appeared in the same post-monologue, single-guest interview in which Sasse participated.\n\nIn an interview that aired Thursday on SiriusXM's Family Politics, Franken, who still considers Maher a friend, said, \"He's been around long enough to know that that's not a word white people can use. It just is not. And he should have known that.\" Franken added that he did not want to be associated with the controversy before appearing on the show.",
    " Title: Psychological Research Suggests News Media Reinforces Selection Biases in Politics and Race\n\nArticle:\n\nA growing body of psychological research indicates that news media may inadvertently reinforce selection biases in politics and race, leading to less empathy and understanding among different groups of people. This selection bias, according to researchers, is not a result of an explicit desire to hate, but rather a more insidious fact that it seems correct.\n\nDavid Pietraszewski, a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, explains that when people express opinions that reflect different political parties, our minds automatically and spontaneously assign them to rival coalitions. This phenomenon, he says, is due to our needs for certainty and sameness, which can overshadow our ability to consider alternate possibilities.\n\nIn a recent study published in the journal Cognition, Pietraszewski and a team of evolutionary psychologists found that politics and race demarcate the groups people form the most, and in a mutually exclusive way. If politics divide people, race does not play a significant factor unless it causes people to form groups.\n\nJohn Tooby, study co-author and professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, notes that successful politicians like Benjamin Disraeli, Arnold Schwarzenegger, or Barack Obama need not be ethnically the same as the majority of their supporters. \"Coalition is the real coin of the evolved mind, not race,\" Tooby said.\n\nTemple Northup, an assistant professor at the University of New Hampshire's Jack J. Valenti School of Communication, argues that the brain's susceptibility to picking sides may not deserve blame. Instead, he suggests that the quality of our thoughts is only as good as the information it's fed.\n\nNorthup recently investigated the extent to which news media can influence people's implicit racial bias. In several studies using the Implicit Association Test (IAT), he found that reading a newspaper about poor race relations or watching a newscast about foreign tension increased people's implicit bias on the IAT. This did not mean people were strictly racist, but it did reveal hints of the news' influence.\n\nNorthup concluded that given that long-term exposure to media stereotypes seems to influence evaluations of African-Americans and foreigners, more research investigating this implicit effect is needed. Among other duties, news organizations have a responsibility to inform with neutrality, not just in how they cover stories but what it is they're covering. The emerging research suggests that goal is seldom achieved.\n\nAccording to Pietraszewski, consumers of news have a simple and effective way to avoid the traps of ugly selection biases: cooperation. By crossing the previously formed boundaries, people can reduce racial discrimination and political polarization. \"Reducing racial discrimination or political polarization will be no easier or harder than changing patterns of cooperation,\" Pietraszewski said.",
    " Title: Washington State Legalizes Marijuana Use, but Driving Under the Influence Remains Illegal\n\nArticle:\n\nAs of Thursday, the possession and use of marijuana is legal in the state of Washington. However, driving under the influence of marijuana is not. This fine line is a topic of discussion among law enforcement and prosecutors.\n\nSeattle Deputy City Attorney Craig Sims stated, \"I don't feel we are in uncharted territory -- I know we are.\" Possessing marijuana is now legal in Washington, Colorado, and 17 other states for medical use. Unlike alcohol, there is no national legal limit for marijuana. Some states have a zero-tolerance policy, while others, like Colorado and California, leave it up to the discretion of the arresting officer.\n\nResearch shows that marijuana can cause dizziness, slowed reaction time, and affect coordination and judgment. Drivers under the influence of marijuana are more likely to drift and swerve, according to research in the Netherlands.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol drug recognition expert Sgt. Tyler Eccles explained, \"First and most important is an inability or reduced ability to divide one's attention.\" He also noted that those driving under the influence of marijuana have a reduced ability to perceive time and distance.\n\nSupporters of legalization argue that marijuana is less debilitating than alcohol, and that marijuana smokers are more aware of being impaired than those who drink. This debate was prominent in Colorado this summer, which considered adopting a standard of five nanograms per milliliter of blood, above which would have qualified as DUI-D, or driving while under the influence of drugs.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration states that peak THC concentrations are reached during the act of smoking, and within three hours, they generally fall to less than 5 nanograms. However, researchers say THC is stored in body fat and can remain detectable weeks after use in heavy pot smokers.\n\nIn Colorado, the pot lobby successfully argued that innocent people could be found guilty based on prior use and show no signs of impairment. The legislature there agreed and defeated the bill. In Washington state, advocates knew the ballot measure would only pass with voters, especially those in conservative eastern Washington, with the 5-nanogram standard.\n\nSims stated, \"Because we are early on in the research phase, it is very difficult to tell if that 5-nanogram level will change, similar to how DUI standards have evolved over the years.\" He added, \"There absolutely needs to be some public education campaign to educate John Q. citizen on the effects of marijuana.\"\n\nThe exact amount of marijuana needed to reach five nanograms is unknown, as THC concentrations vary based on where and how the marijuana is grown, and how much is consumed. Eccles stated, \"People always want to know how much does it take to reach five nanograms. That is nearly impossible to determine.\"\n\nIn practical terms, in Washington, police will still have to observe signs of impaired driving before pulling someone over. Drivers will likely undergo some type of field test. If the officer believes the driver is impaired, they would be taken to a hospital where blood would be drawn. Tests above five nanograms would automatically subject the driver to a DUI conviction. With no priors, they may receive a day in jail and a fine.",
    " Title: Colorado Baker Faces Third Legal Attack Over Refusal to Bake Cake for Gender Transition Celebration\n\nArticle:\n\nJack Phillips, a baker in Lakewood, Colorado, is facing a third legal action after declining to bake a cake for a gender transition celebration. The U.S. Supreme Court previously ruled that Colorado's Civil Rights Commission had acted with \"religious hostility\" in targeting Phillips for his refusal to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple in 2017.\n\nAutumn Scardina, the complainant in the second action against Phillips, is the individual behind the third legal attack. Scardina, who is also a lawyer, requested a birthday cake to celebrate her gender transition.\n\nThe legal doctrine of \"public accommodations\" was initially used to address racial segregation during the civil-rights era. However, the author argues that the situation of gay Americans in the 21st century is not comparable to that of African Americans in the 1940s. The author suggests that accommodating religious principles of those with traditional views of marriage in this matter requires only a \"trivial and largely symbolic concession.\"\n\nThe author criticizes the legal actions against Phillips as harassment and coercion, stating that the goal is not to integrate gay Americans into civil life but to bully and force dissidents into conformity. The author labels this harassment as \"persecution\" and calls for legal and political measures to stop it.\n\nThe article concludes with a call for maturity from a few people in Colorado, suggesting that the ongoing legal actions against Phillips are unjust and unwarranted.",
    " Title: US Implements Ban on Certain E-Cigarette Flavors Amid Health Concerns for Teens\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has implemented a nationwide ban on mint and fruit-flavored e-cigarette cartridges, following concerns regarding the increasing vaping prevalence among teenagers. The ban applies to these flavors offered in cartridge-based e-cigarettes, including popular pods sold by Juul.\n\nMenthol and tobacco flavors, as well as fruit flavors delivered in other ways, will still be allowed. The action has been under consideration for over a year, with several states passing similar rules. South Korea, India, and Brazil are among the numerous countries that have announced sweeping vaping bans, while others, like China, have imposed restrictions.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar stated that the Trump administration aims to offer adults an alternative to traditional cigarettes while addressing growing addiction to e-cigarettes among teenagers. He said, \"By prioritizing enforcement against the products most widely used by children, our action today seeks to strike the right public health balance.\"\n\nAccording to US health regulators, 55 people have died, and more than 2,500 people have been hospitalized with injuries linked to vaping. Investigators believe vitamin E acetate, which is sometimes added to marijuana vaping products, is playing a role in the crisis.\n\nIn September, President Trump announced the US would ban all e-cigarette flavors except tobacco, but the administration softened its stance after industry pushback. \"We have to protect our families. At the same time, it's a big industry. We want to protect the industry,\" Mr. Trump said this week.\n\nJuul, the largest e-cigarette company in the US, had already withdrawn its flavored pods from the market, but Thursday's action compels competitors to make a similar move within 30 days. Advocates for stricter rules have expressed concerns that teens may switch to menthol if other options are eliminated. However, officials stated they would take action against menthol and tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes if the Food and Drug Administration observes a rise in their use among teens.\n\nThe US also recently increased the age for purchasing tobacco products to 21. E-cigarettes are also subject to these rules.",
    " Title: Social Security Benefits Projected to Reduce by 23% by 2034\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Social Security Administration has warned that by 2034, the payroll taxes collected will be sufficient to pay only about 77% of scheduled benefits. This impending crisis, often referred to as an \"economic tsunami,\" is a result of the declining ratio of workers to beneficiaries and the increasing number of Social Security beneficiaries.\n\nAccording to the Trustees of Social Security, the problem is fueled by two factors. First, from now until 2034, the ratio of workers paying taxes to support each Social Security beneficiary will decline significantly from 3:1 to 2:1. In 1970, this ratio was nearly 4:1. Second, by 2034, the total number of beneficiaries is projected to reach 87 million\u201441% more than the number in 2017.\n\nThe issue is particularly relevant to Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, as they account for a significant portion of the beneficiaries. In 2019, there will be 72 million Baby Boomers. Beginning in 2026, the so-called \"bulge years\" will occur, when all Boomers, including the youngest born in 1964, will have turned 62 and be eligible to collect retirement benefits.\n\nIn 2034, when the oldest Boomers turn 88, the \"bulge\" is projected to burst, and only 77% of benefits can be paid. This reduction has the potential to significantly impact the nation, especially considering that Social Security is the government's second-largest annual budget expense at $967.5 billion, surpassed only by Medicare/Medicaid at $1.085 trillion.\n\nThe cost of Social Security is projected to increase to $1.166 trillion by 2022, surpassing Medicare/Medicaid. Meanwhile, Social Security's liability is currently $17 trillion but is projected to grow to $24 trillion by 2022. The liability of Medicare/Medicaid, on the other hand, is currently $27.8 trillion and is expected to increase to $28.4 trillion by 2022.\n\nThe answer, according to the article, is bold leadership while the economic tsunami is still offshore. The article also notes that other government benefit programs, such as disability benefits, may also be forced to cut smaller monthly checks in the ensuing decades. The question is when and how the elected leaders will break the news to the American people, as Congress refuses to take any action to reform Social Security.",
    " Title: Russian Warplanes Enter Ukrainian Airspace: Pentagon Calls for De-escalation\n\nArticle:\n\nRussian military aircraft have reportedly entered Ukrainian airspace multiple times within the past 24 hours, according to a Pentagon official who described these incidents as \"small probes.\" Army Col. Steve Warren, Pentagon spokesman, stated Friday evening that these incursions constitute a \"handful of incidents\" into Ukrainian airspace.\n\nCol. Warren told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the Pentagon is urging Russia to take immediate steps to reduce tensions along the Ukraine border. \"We call on the Russians to help deescalate the situation and not contribute to the deepening of this crisis,\" he said.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Mr. Warren reported that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel had attempted to contact Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu regarding the escalating tension between the two countries, but to no avail. Mr. Shoigu expressed concern among Defense Department officials after he announced Thursday that Russia planned to engage in a new series of military exercises near the Ukraine border. The military move, Mr. Shoigu said, is in response to ongoing NATO training exercises in Poland and the death of at least two pro-Russia insurgents in eastern Ukraine.\n\nCurrently, Ukraine reportedly has \"a broad array of forces aligned along the Ukrainian border,\" Col. Warren said. Meanwhile, Ukraine's acting Defense Minister Mikhail Koval has stated that neither Russian troops nor aircraft have crossed into Ukraine during a military exercise. He made this comment while speaking to reporters on Saturday, according to the InSerbia Network Foundation website.\n\nA separate Defense Department official declined to comment on Mr. Koval's contradicting statement. The Daily Beast is reporting that high-level contact between the Obama administration and the Kremlin has ceased. The last known conversation between President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin was on April 14, according to The Daily Beast.\n\nHowever, Col. Warren told The Times that the relationship between the United States and Russia has not yet frozen over. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey reportedly spoke with his counterpart, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia Gen. Valery Gerasimov, on the same day.",
    " Title: Commerce Department Reduces Tariffs on Canadian Newsprint Imports, but Publishers Call for Complete Abolition\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Commerce Department has announced a rollback of the tariff it imposed on newsprint imported from Canada, reducing the rate by as much as a third. The new tariffs range from 8 percent to 20 percent, down from the initial 30 percent imposed in May.\n\nPublishers, however, are still advocating for the complete abolition of the tariffs, arguing that they are causing harm to the printing and publishing sectors, as well as local communities. David Chavern, president and CEO of the News Media Alliance, an umbrella industry group, stated, \"These import duties on newsprint have already caused job losses in the printing and publishing sectors and have resulted in decreased news coverage in local communities.\"\n\nPaul Boyle, head of Stop Tariffs on Printers & Publishers (STOPP), echoed this sentiment, saying, \"It's a step in the right direction, but these tariffs are still causing damage and need to be repealed to protect newspapers.\"\n\nNewsprint, the second biggest cost to publishers after workers, is now close to $800 a metric ton, according to Boyle. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette is one of the largest big-city dailies to take a dramatic step in response to the paper hike, reducing its print edition to five days from seven.\n\nOther papers are also reducing the number of pages, chopping the trim size, and in some cases, dropping Sunday comics. The tariff is also affecting advertisers, who are printing fewer circulars to insert into papers, Boyle said.\n\nBoyle argued that the financial harm to US paper mills is not due to Canadian paper, but rather a decade-long shift to digital advertising. He also noted that North American newsprint demand has decreased by 75 percent from 2000 to 2018. With tariffs forcing publishers to use less paper, demand will further erode, potentially harming the very paper producers the tariffs are intended to protect, Boyle warned.\n\nThe International Trade Commission is expected to hand down a ruling on the tariffs on Aug. 28, and Boyle is hoping for a complete abolition of the tariffs.",
    " Title: Obama Nominates First African-American for Second Term Cabinet as Transportation Secretary\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's choice for transportation secretary, Anthony Foxx, will be the first African-American pick for his second term cabinet. The nomination was announced on Monday, following criticism for the lack of diversity within his administration's initial cabinet picks.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Foxx, who is currently the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, would bring to two the number of African-Americans currently heading Cabinet agencies under Obama, joining Attorney General Eric Holder. In his first term, two other African-Americans \u2013 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk and EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson \u2013 served in Obama's Cabinet.\n\nThe White House highlighted Foxx's achievements in opening a new runway at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport and his role in championing a new streetcar system in the city. He also played a significant part in organizing last summer's Democratic National Convention without any major logistical issues.\n\n\"As mayor of one of America's most vibrant cities, Anthony Foxx knows firsthand that investing in world-class infrastructure is vital to creating good jobs and ensuring American businesses can grow and compete in the global economy,\" the White House official said.\n\nThe nomination of Foxx is expected to help dispel the image of Obama naming only white men to top posts in his administration. The criticism began earlier this year, when the first cabinet picks of Obama's second term \u2013 Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew \u2013 were all white men.\n\nAfter taking heat, Obama named several women to prominent roles, including Sylvia Mathews Burwell as director of his budget office and Mary Schapiro as the chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, groups like the Congressional Black Caucus criticized the lack of African-American nominees, with Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, stating that Obama \"has once again overlooked his most loyal constituency.\"\n\nObama himself disputed the notion that his inner circle was lacking diversity, urging patience at a news conference in January. \"I'm very proud that in the first four years we had as diverse, if not more diverse, a White House and a Cabinet than any in history,\" he said on January 14. \"And I intend to continue that, because it turns out that when you look for the very best people, given the incredible diversity of this country, you're going to end up with a diverse staff and a diverse team.\"\n\n\"I think until you've seen what my overall team looks like, it's premature to assume that somehow we're going backwards,\" he added later. \"We're not going backwards, we're going forward.\"",
    " Title: Chinese State-Controlled Newspaper Spends Nearly $19 Million on U.S. Advertising and Printing Expenses Over Four Years\n\nArticle:\n\nChina Daily, an English-language newspaper controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, has paid American newspapers nearly $19 million for advertising and printing expenses over the past four years, according to documents filed with the Justice Department. The outlet has paid more than $4.6 million to The Washington Post and nearly $6 million to The Wall Street Journal since November 2016, the records show.\n\nThe newspaper has published paid supplements called \"China Watch\" in both The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal. These inserts, designed to resemble real news articles, often contain a pro-Beijing spin on contemporary news events.\n\nFor instance, a September 2018 insert touted an initiative pushed by Chinese President Xi Jinping with the headline: \"Belt and Road aligns with African nations.\" The same insert ran a story titled \"Tariffs to take toll on U.S. homebuyers\" that asserted that U.S. tariffs on Chinese lumber would raise the cost of building homes in the United States.\n\nIn addition to The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, China Daily paid for advertising in several other newspapers, including The New York Times ($50,000), Foreign Policy ($240,000), The Des Moines Register ($34,600), and CQ-Roll Call ($76,000). The outlet spent a total of $11,002,628 on advertising in U.S. newspapers, and another $265,822 on advertising with Twitter.\n\nChina Daily also paid out more than $7.6 million to newspapers and printing companies for its newspaper for U.S.-based readers, the Justice Department\u2019s filings show. The Los Angeles Times, The Seattle Times, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The Chicago Tribune, The Houston Chronicle, and The Boston Globe are all listed as clients of China Daily. The Chinese outlet paid the Los Angeles Times $657,523 for printing services, according to the FARA filings.\n\nThe Justice Department has required China Daily to disclose its activities semi-annually under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) since years. The most recent filing, which China Daily submitted on June 1, is the first to include detailed breakdowns of payments to American news outlets. The outlet disclosed those expenditures for the period between November 2016 and April 2020.\n\nIt is unclear if China Daily submitted the more detailed filings under pressure from the Justice Department or on its own. Pro-democracy groups have long warned about the Chinese government's attempts to push propaganda through American news outlets. Freedom House and the Hoover Institution have both drawn attention to China Daily's paid inserts in reports on the Chinese government's efforts to influence the media.\n\nChina Daily and other Beijing-controlled propaganda mills have come under intense scrutiny amid the coronavirus pandemic. Chinese government officials have tried to divert blame for the spread of the virus to the United States and other Western nations. Many of the regime-controlled outlets, including China Daily, have echoed the communist leaders' talking points.\n\nChina Daily has slowed its advertising expenditures in recent months, the filings show. China Daily last paid The Washington Post for advertising in December 2019. Its payments to The Wall Street Journal have been less than half their average amount since February 2020, the documents show. China Daily did not respond to a request for comment.",
    " Title: U.S. Senators Attempt Temporary Funding Bill to End Government Shutdown; Trump Demands Border Wall Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators made a renewed effort on Thursday to end a partial month-long government shutdown through a temporary funding bill, but President Donald Trump demanded a \"down payment\" for a border wall that Democrats reject. After the Republican-led Senate failed to advance two measures to reopen shuttered agencies, Democratic and Republican lawmakers urged quick passage of a three-week, stopgap funding bill to create time for talks on border security.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said such a measure would only work \"if there is a large down payment on the wall.\" However, a spokesman for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Senate Democrats had made clear to Republicans that \"they will not support funding for the wall.\"\n\nTrump, who sparked the shutdown with his demand for $5.7 billion in funding for the U.S.-Mexico border wall, told reporters after the votes in the Senate: \"We have no choice but to have a wall or a barrier, and if we don't have that, it's just not going to work.\"\n\nTrump said that if Schumer and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell come to a \"reasonable\" agreement to end the partial government shutdown, \"I would support it, yes.\" McConnell said late on Thursday that talks were ongoing.\n\nDemocratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump's demand for a large down payment on a border wall \"is not a reasonable agreement.\" The shutdown has left 800,000 federal workers without pay and struggling to make ends meet, as the effects on government services and the economy reverberate nationwide.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham said he had spoken to Trump about a short-term funding bill. \"All of us believe if we have three weeks with the government open, that we could find a way forward to produce a bill that he would sign, that would be good for everybody in the country,\" Graham said on the Senate floor.\n\nEarlier, a bill backed by Trump to end the shutdown by funding the wall and a separate bill supported by Democrats to reopen shuttered agencies without such funding did not get the votes required to advance in the 100-member chamber. Trump has touted Republican unity during the longest shutdown in U.S. history, but in a sign of cracks in that resolve, or just a desire for compromise, six Republican senators voted with Democrats on their measure to reopen government agencies temporarily without money for a wall.\n\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday urged furloughed federal workers to seek loans to pay their bills while adding in a CNBC interview that he could not understand why they were having trouble getting by. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Ross's comment, saying, \"I don't understand why Ross would make the comment as hundreds of thousands of men and women are about to miss a second paycheck tomorrow.\"\n\nTrump and Pelosi have been engaged in a standoff over border security funding, with Pelosi inviting Trump to give his State of the Union address in the House chamber next Tuesday, only to withdraw the invitation later due to the shutdown. Trump conceded late on Wednesday and said he would deliver the speech in the House in the \"near future.\"",
    " Title: Green New Deal: A Look at the Future of Climate Policy and Its Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe agricultural sector accounts for approximately 40% of the land in the United States, with the soil primarily functioning as a food factory. The food system is significantly influenced by the Farm Bill, which spends nearly $15 billion annually on subsidies and $10 billion on conservation measures. This legislation shapes what farmers grow and where, often benefiting large, industrially oriented operations.\n\nTransitioning to a less carbon-intensive food production system is possible through changes in cropping, fertilizing, irrigation, and waste management, practices that are often more suitable for small farming. However, moving in this direction would challenge the status quo of big American agriculture.\n\nThe Green New Deal is one approach to addressing climate change, with its broad ambitions outlining the battleground for future climate policy debates. As reshaping environmental impact necessitates reworking the economy, there will inevitably be competing visions about who should benefit and what kind of economy we should build.\n\nCentrist proposals focus on promoting investment in new technologies, with profits going to private researchers and manufacturers. If Trumpist nationalism survives its climate denialism, it may double down on supporting national energy industries and deny ethical responsibilities of global interdependence by building border walls against climate refugees. To the left of the Green New Deal, there may be louder calls to nationalize fossil fuels to keep them in the ground.\n\nThe idea that environmental policy could be separate from the larger economic order or from debates over fairness is a recent development, a product of a technocratic period in American politics. In 1970, Senator Edmund Muskie, a Democrat from Maine and the lead drafter of the Clean Air Act, argued that \"man's environment\" included \"the shape of the communities in which he lives\" and that \"the only kind of society that has a chance\" was \"a society that will not tolerate slums for some and decent houses for others, rats for some and playgrounds for others, clean air for some and filth for others.\"\n\nFor Senator Muskie, environmentalism meant that no neighborhood or job should be toxic. In the three years that followed, the country adopted the most ambitious and effective environmental legislation in its history, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act. Senator Muskie's approach remains a model of visionary environmental lawmaking.\n\nJedediah Britton-Purdy, a professor of law at Columbia and the author of \"After Nature: A Politics for the Anthropocene,\" is one such voice advocating for a reevaluation of our environmental policies.

    " Title: Islamic Extremists Seize Radisson Hotel in Mali, Dozens of Hostages Taken\n\nArticle:\n\nHeavily armed Islamic extremists seized control of the Radisson Blu hotel in the Malian capital of Bamako on Friday, taking 170 hostages, including 30 hotel staff and 140 guests. At least three hostages were killed during the more than seven-hour siege, and two gunmen were also killed.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, 10 gunmen stormed the hotel, shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" or \"God is great\" in Arabic, before firing on hotel guards. The Malian military, with assistance from United Nations peacekeeping troops, currently have the hotel surrounded.\n\nAs of now, three deaths have been confirmed, with two being Malian and one being a French national, according to CNN. It appears that those who have been released were made to recite Koranic verses first, according to Reuters reports. The gunmen are reportedly making their way through the hotel floor by floor.\n\nThe Rezidor Hotel Group, which operates the Radisson Blu, has stated that the hostages include Turkish Airlines crew members, as well as Chinese, French, and Belgian nationals.\n\nThere has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but this year has seen an increase in jihadist violence across Mali. An attack on a restaurant in Bamako in March was the first time the capital had been attacked in years.\n\nIn 2012, after a coup in Bamako, Mali's north fell under the control of Islamic extremists who took advantage of a Tuareg uprising. In 2013, the French Army took control of the north, and a UN-brokered peace deal was signed with Tuareg separatists.\n\nFrance and other Western nations have been working with the Malian government to prevent the Islamist militants from regaining a foothold in the north. A UN spokesman stated that the Radisson Blu was host to a large delegation of UN workers involved in the ongoing peace process.\n\nIn August, nine people, including four members of the UN mission, were killed in a hotel attack in the central town of Sevare after heavily armed gunmen entered a hotel popular with European military officers. The attack was significant because the popular tourist town was the demarcation line between government-controlled areas of Mali and those that were controlled by Islamist militants, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn August, The \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that there were signs that militants were strategically moving south to places like Bamako, after having been confined to cities such as Timbuktu in the north.\n\nBruce Whitehouse, a Mali expert and associate professor at Lehigh University, told AP, \"It's a troubling sign that the armed Islamist groups are intent on stepping up the pressure both on the Malian government and on the UN and French presence. They want to show they are not just contained within the north and that they're not afraid to confront their primary enemies where they're strongest.\"",
    " Title: Texas Seeks to Exclude Planned Parenthood from Federal Family Planning Funding, Potentially Setting National Precedent\n\nArticle:\n\nTexas is pursuing a request that, if approved by the Trump administration, would allow the state to exclude Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers from receiving some federal family planning dollars. This move could potentially set a precedent for other states to follow.\n\nJennifer Popik, federal legislative director with National Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, stated, \"This would have implications nationwide if this gets approved.\" Popik further explained, \"For an administration with a pro-life focus, this is something they could do to divert funding from Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nThe push in Texas is the latest effort against Planned Parenthood, which stands to lose federal funding for one year under the Republican healthcare bill currently being considered in the Senate. Republicans have long sought to block Planned Parenthood from being reimbursed by the government for medical services. Most of the federal funding is paid out through Medicaid, the healthcare program for the poor.\n\nThe GOP's principal objection to Planned Parenthood is its provision of abortions, though the Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for the procedure. President Trump has indicated his support for efforts to block federal funds to Planned Parenthood. In April, he signed a bill passed by Congress that rolled back an Obama-era rule that banned states from withholding separate federal family planning funds, known as Title X Funding, from providers for political reasons.\n\nTexas is seeking federal Medicaid funding it lost four years ago when it excluded Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers from participating in a family planning program for low-income women who are not otherwise eligible for Medicaid. The Obama administration halted the funding to Texas\u2014about $35 million a year\u2014stating that federal law requires states to allow Medicaid patients their choice of \"any willing provider,\" including those that provide abortions.\n\nIf approved, the program would take effect for five years beginning Sept. 1. The federal comment period is open until Aug. 4, after which the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) would make a decision. If CMS were to approve this waiver and offer federal funding for this program, it would open the floodgates for this to be implemented in other states, according to Kinsey Hasstedt, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, a liberal reproductive rights group.\n\nSince 1972, family planning services have been a mandatory benefit for Medicaid recipients, with healthcare providers reimbursed by the federal government at a 90 percent matching rate, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. In the 1990s, several states, led by California, sought waivers to create programs to serve low-income women not eligible for Medicaid. Now, 26 states have similar family planning programs, which are mostly funded by the federal government.\n\nTwo states\u2014Iowa and Missouri\u2014recently created their own state-funded programs that exclude Planned Parenthood. Republican lawmakers in Iowa agreed this year to give up millions of federal dollars to create a state-run family planning program that excludes abortion providers and their affiliates. Four Planned Parenthood centers in the state are now closed because of the lost funding. Missouri lawmakers, meanwhile, decided in April to reject more than $8 million in federal funding the state was going to receive for its family planning program and will create a state-funded program that bans abortion providers.\n\nThe reduced funding in Texas has led to some negative consequences, including a drop in women receiving services. The state also has the fourth-highest birth rate in the U.S. State officials hope that getting the federal money back will improve the Healthy Texas Women program. However, experts warn that more money will not help the problem, as community health centers in the state are already facing limited resources and facilities.\n\nSara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University, and her colleagues concluded in an analysis that Texas's proposal would diminish access to care for low-income women because health centers cannot grow fast enough to replace services provided by Planned Parenthood and other centers. If the Texas request is approved, the issue could end up in the courts, as federal law states that Medicaid beneficiaries may go to any provider who is \"qualified to perform the service.\" Courts have previously sided with Planned Parenthood in cases where states have tried to block the organization from receiving Medicaid funding.\n\nIn a statement, Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Danielle Wells called the proposal an \"underhanded attempt to cut off care at Planned Parenthood with devastating consequences for our patients.\" Mara Gandal-Powers, senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center, expressed concern about the proposal and its potential impact on women's healthcare access. \"We are very concerned about this proposal and how it might be received by this administration, which has been very hostile to women's health and to women's healthcare providers like Planned Parenthood,\" Gandal-Powers said. \"We're very concerned, but it's hard to go down the road of what might happen.\"",
    " Title: Taylor University Faces Backlash Over Mike Pence's Commencement Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nTaylor University, a small evangelical Christian school, is facing pushback from students and alumni after inviting Vice President Mike Pence to speak at this year's commencement ceremony. Over 3,300 people have signed a change.org petition to rescind Pence's invitation, citing the \"Trump-Pence Administration's policies\" as \"not consistent with the Christian ethic of love we hold dear.\"\n\nOne Taylor graduate expressed their dismay, stating, \"The school should be ashamed... I am physically shaking... I feel personally attacked.\" However, not all alumni agree, and Taylor officials have stated they are standing by their decision.\n\nThe controversy has escalated as South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a Democratic presidential hopeful and an openly gay man, criticized Pence. During an event hosted by the LGBTQ Victory Fund, Buttigieg discussed his sexual orientation, saying, \"If being gay was a choice, it was made far, far above my pay grade... That\u2019s the thing that I wish the Mike Pence\u2019s of the world would understand \u2013 that if you have a problem with who I am \u2013 your problem is not with me, your quarrel sir, is with my creator.\"\n\nKevin Holtsberry, a Taylor alumnus, spoke on \"Fox & Friends\" Monday morning, stating that the outraged alumni and students are mistaking disagreement on political issues with personal attacks. Holtsberry also thanked the school for \"standing firm\" and not pulling Pence's invitation.\n\nDivision among pastors regarding speaking out on hot-button issues was also highlighted, with half of them expressing concerns about offending people. Kevin Holtsberry stated, \"I was very nervous initially that the very vocal overwhelming minority might sort of sway Taylor to take a different stance so I\u2019m very glad they\u2019re taking that solid stance.\"\n\nTaylor University has defended the decision, with President Paul Lowell Haines praising Pence as a \"good friend to the University over many years\" and \"a Christian brother whose life and values have exemplified what we strive to instill in our graduates.\"\n\nIn a statement, Taylor University spokesman, James Garringer, said, \"We look forward to hosting the Vice President next month.\" The university stated that they encourage positive, respectful, and meaningful dialogue within their community.",
    " Title: America's Regime Struggle: A Chart of Dueling Concepts in the Ongoing Cold Civil War\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is currently experiencing a profound divide, often referred to as a \"cold civil war\" or a \"culture war.\" This conflict, according to the Claremont Institute's Angelo Codevilla, is not merely a disagreement over policy but a fundamental disagreement over the meaning of principles such as liberty, equality, and justice.\n\nThe divide can be characterized as a struggle between those who aim to transmit the American regime to future generations and those who seek to transform it fundamentally. The former emphasizes the positive aspects of the \"American way of life,\" acknowledging past failures, while the latter heavily qualifies any affirmation of America as it has existed and criticizes the nation's past and present for perceived flaws.\n\nThe argument over \"first principles\" has been brewing for decades. Traditional American history, which focused on English colonists and their influence, has been replaced with a multicultural narrative that portrays the United States as the result of a \"convergence\" of three civilizations: the Amerindian native culture, European culture, and the civilization of Islamic West Africa. This narrative, often referred to as the \"Atlantic World\" or the \"three worlds meeting,\" has led to a focus on diversity based on race, ethnicity, and gender, rather than equality of American citizenship.\n\nMeanwhile, the promotion of \"global education\" has obfuscated the rights and responsibilities of national citizenship in a constitutional democracy. This new narrative, although historically inaccurate and antithetical to responsible American citizenship, serves the political purposes of its proponents, who aim to delegitimize the concept of Western civilization and deconstruct the American way of life.\n\nSince politics is said to be \"downstream from culture,\" these transformist concepts have slowly and steadily spread to the mainstream media, major corporations, and elected officials. However, Americanism, far from being a \"dirty word,\" is a term that should be proudly embraced, and the fundamental transformation of the country should be resisted.\n\nThe conflict between the transmission and transformation of the American regime continues to heat up. Recent events, such as the city council of Charlottesville, Virginia, canceling Thomas Jefferson's birthday holiday, Nike recalling the Betsy Ross flag sneakers, and the San Francisco School board covering up a painting of George Washington, highlight this ongoing struggle.\n\nTo better understand this contemporary conflict in America over transmitting or transforming the American regime, a chart of 36 dueling concepts has been developed. This chart, examining the \"regime conflict,\" the \"cold civil war\" or the \"culture war,\" compresses the struggle into a table for easy comparison. Americanism forces are beginning to push back against the multicultural Left, which has a large megaphone but little popular support. Americanism is not a dirty word; it's a good thing. We should be proud to say so and say no to the fundamental transformation of our country.",
    " Title: CNN Ferguson Panel Discussion Erupts in Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nA heated discussion on CNN's \"Newsroom\" about the recent shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, turned chaotic on Wednesday as host Brooke Baldwin moderated a conversation between University of Pennsylvania professor and CNN contributor Marc Lamont Hill and conservative radio host Larry Elder. The conversation, initially focused on the mental health of young men of color, escalated into a verbal altercation.\n\nThe discord began when Baldwin asked why the mental health of young men of color was not being discussed, to which Hill responded by stating that the stigma surrounding mental illness and the assumption that black men are prone to violence and irrationality contribute to the dismissal of their mental health issues.\n\nElder, in response, argued that the media and the left perceive racism as a more significant problem in America, citing the attention given to controversial figures like Donald Sterling, Cliven Bundy, and Paul Ryan. Hill interjected, reminding Elder that the initial question was about mental health.\n\nElder continued, suggesting that the left perpetuates the belief in racism to maintain a monolithic black vote and keep the Democratic Party alive. This statement prompted Baldwin to ask if Elder believed that racism was not a major problem in the country. Elder denied this, instead recounting his father's experiences building a small business.\n\nWhen Hill reminded Elder of the original question, Elder responded angrily, questioning why he was being insulted and expressing a desire for a more civil discussion between the two black men. The rest of the interview reportedly contained some good points, but Elder's defensive demeanor persisted.",
    " Title: Fiscal Cliff Deal Fails to Address Overspending, Experts Warn\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate passed a \"fiscal cliff\" deal on January 1, 2013, in a 257-167 vote, marking the end of the 2012 fiscal cliff negotiations. However, critics argue that this deal, rather than solving the issue, merely postpones it. The focus of the negotiations, primarily on taxes for the top 1% or 2% of income earners, has been misplaced, according to experts.\n\nThe real problem, they contend, is not insufficient revenue from taxes but rather overspending. Overspending is defined as spending more than one takes in. The president's tax-the-rich plan, it was argued, would not address the issue, and the last-minute deal cannot avert the principal disaster.\n\nThe deficit for fiscal 2013 is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to exceed $1 trillion for the fifth consecutive year. The revenue generated by the tax increases on high-income earners in the fiscal cliff deal is estimated to be about $60 billion, which is just 6% of the $1 trillion annual deficit.\n\nTo close the gap, income tax rates would need to rise significantly, requiring a tax increase of more than 65% on all taxpayers, including low-, middle-, and upper-income earners, corporations, and others. Such a tax increase would tank the economy and cause incomes and the taxes on them to fall far short of the levels necessary to produce the projected revenue increase.\n\nExperts argue that rapid economic growth, coupled with real, substantive expenditure cuts, is the only practical route to reducing the deficit. The economy will not grow when a massive tax increase is imposed. Growth requires low taxes, which in turn require smaller government. The only way out of the unsustainable fiscal mess, they contend, is to focus on reducing spending and stimulating growth. The looming debt-ceiling debate may be what is needed to turn the focus to the real problem of overspending.",
    " Title: Obama and Kaine Deliver Stinging Rebuttal to Trump at Democratic Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a scorching warm-up for Hillary Clinton's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, President Barack Obama and Vice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine delivered a series of stinging rebukes against Republican nominee Donald Trump. The speeches, delivered on the convention's third night, emphasized the election as a choice between optimism and pessimism, with Obama endorsing Clinton as a tough and tenacious leader.\n\nFraming the election as a choice between two contrasting visions, Obama praised Clinton as a qualified and experienced candidate, stating, \"There has never been a man or a woman \u2013 not me, not Bill, nobody \u2013 more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America.\"\n\nObama's speech, marking a passing of the torch to the woman he defeated for the nomination eight years ago, was delivered shortly after delegates finalized the party's 2016 ticket, nominating Virginia Sen. Kaine for vice president. Kaine, in his acceptance speech, shifted gears in the second half and delivered a broadside against Trump, mocking his New York bravado and questioning his qualifications.\n\nThe speeches intensified attacks on Trump, as they talked up Clinton's qualifications. Obama criticized Trump for lacking plans and facts, stating, \"The Donald is not really a plans guy. He\u2019s not really a facts guy, either.\" He also defended his record in office, declaring he's \"more optimistic about the future of America than ever before.\"\n\nTrump countered on Twitter, stating, \"Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence, and despair.\" The night in Philadelphia was replete with barbed insults, even as the musical acts kept returning to themes of \"love\" and understanding.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Harry Reid called Trump a \"hateful con man\" and \"egomaniac,\" while former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, an ex-Clinton primary rival, gave a fiery speech calling Trump a \"bully racist.\" The sitting vice president, Joe Biden, also went after Trump on all fronts, stating that the billionaire businessman would endanger national security and lacks compassion.\n\nThe focus of the third convention night was heavy on gun control, global warming, and national security, an issue largely absent from the first two nights. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who had considered an independent presidential run before ruling it out, made a late appearance Wednesday, with an endorsement that could help Clinton reach out to vital independents whom Trump also is courting. Bloomberg called Trump a \"dangerous demagogue\" and claimed it's \"imperative\" to elect Clinton.\n\nTogether, the speakers Wednesday set the stage for Clinton to deliver her nomination acceptance speech and close out the convention Thursday night, after becoming Tuesday the first woman in U.S. history nominated for president by a major party. The president's speech Wednesday effectively kicks off Obama's general election role as a chief Clinton surrogate. The New York Times reported that aides mostly have cleared his calendar for October and expect him to be on the trail regularly for Clinton until the election.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Addresses Allegations of Sexual Harassment and Pay Discrimination in 2016 Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has responded to a New York Times report that nearly a dozen female staffers on his 2016 presidential campaign claim to have experienced harassment and their superiors handled their claims improperly. In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Sanders stated that he was unaware of the allegations at the time.\n\n\"I was a little bit busy running around the country, trying to make the case,\" Sanders said regarding his knowledge of the allegations.\n\nSanders noted that if he ran for president again in 2020, he would \"do better next time.\" The progressive senator also added that he was \"very proud of the campaign we ran in 2016.\"\n\nHowever, Sanders acknowledged that his campaign did not handle human resources and addressing the needs of women who felt disrespected or experienced sexual harassment effectively. He stated, \"I am not going to sit here and tell you that we did everything right in terms of human resources, in terms of addressing the needs that I am hearing from now that women felt disrespected, that there was sexual harassment, which was not dealt with as effectively as possible.\"\n\nThe Times report included detailed accounts from several staffers, including one instance where a staffer working in Nevada said a supervisor ran his hands through her hair in a \"sexual way,\" and her reports of the incident were laughed off.\n\nThe report comes just days after more than two dozen alumni of Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign said they sent him a letter requesting a meeting to discuss \"sexual violence and harassment\" that took place while working on the campaign. Sanders' campaign has not yet responded to the letter.",
    " Title: Virginia Governor's Assault Weapons Ban Proposal Fails in Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nVirginia Governor Ralph Northam's attempt to ban the sale of assault weapons has been unsuccessful following opposition from members of his own party. In a committee vote on Monday, senators decided to shelve the bill for the year and task the state crime commission with studying the issue. This outcome was met with applause from a room filled with gun advocates.\n\nFour moderate Democrats joined forces with Republicans in the committee vote, rejecting a bill that would have prohibited the sale of certain semiautomatic firearms, including AR-15 style rifles, and banned the possession of magazines holding more than 12 rounds.\n\nThe bill was a key priority for Northam, a Democrat who has advocated for a comprehensive package of gun control measures. The legislation faced significant pushback from gun owners and gun-rights advocates, who accused the governor and others of seeking to confiscate commonly owned guns and accessories from law-abiding gun owners. Northam has consistently stated that he does not intend to confiscate guns, but argues that banning new sales of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines would help prevent mass shootings.\n\nVirginia has become the focal point of the nation's ongoing debate over gun control and mass shootings. Tens of thousands of gun-rights activists from across the country gathered at the state Capitol and surrounding area in protest, some wearing tactical gear and carrying military-style rifles.\n\nNortham has been successful in passing much of his gun control agenda this year, but has faced challenges with the proposed assault weapon ban. Earlier proposals to ban the possession of AR-15-style rifles or to require owners to register them with state police have been abandoned. The governor had hoped a watered-down version of the bill would win over enough Democratic moderates for passage.\n\nAn estimated 8 million AR-style guns have been sold since they were introduced to the public in the 1960s. The weapons are known for being easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to modify with a variety of scopes, stocks, and rails.\n\nLawmakers in both the House and Senate have already advanced several other gun-control measures and are expected to finalize passage in the coming days. These bills include limiting handgun purchases to once a month, implementing universal background checks on gun purchases, allowing localities to ban guns in public buildings, parks, and other areas, and a red flag bill that would allow authorities to temporarily take guns away from anyone deemed to be dangerous to themselves or others.",
    " Title: Former FBI Director James Comey Urges Vote for Democrats in Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey has called on voters to support the Democratic Party in the upcoming midterm elections, stating that the current Republican-led Congress has failed to uphold the Founders' design of a system where \"Ambition must counteract ambition.\"\n\nIn a tweet on Tuesday, Comey wrote, \"This Republican Congress has proven incapable of fulfilling the Founders' design that 'Ambition must... counteract ambition.' All who believe in this country's values must vote for Democrats this fall. Policy differences don't matter right now. History has its eyes on us.\"\n\nThis call to action follows a Department of Justice Inspector General report from June 2018 that found Comey was \"insubordinate\" and defied authority while he was director of the FBI. The report also revealed that Comey is under investigation for his handling of classified reports about his meetings with President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a previous tweet on Monday, Comey criticized President Trump's handling of the Helsinki summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating, \"This American president stood on foreign soil next to a murderous lying thug and refused to back his own country.\"\n\nIt is important to note that Comey was previously a registered Republican. The full context and implications of Comey's statements should be considered in the broader political landscape.",
    " Title: Impact of Ideological Extremism on Presidential Elections: A Neutral Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent analysis of ideological extremism in presidential elections over the past several decades has concluded that the electoral cost of extremism is \"negligible\" compared to the effects of other economic and political factors. The study suggests that the landslide defeats of Barry Goldwater in 1964 and George McGovern in 1972 were not primarily due to their extreme ideologies but rather their challenging of incumbents who presided over election-year economic booms.\n\nConversely, Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Barack Obama in 2008, who ran in years with economic recessions, won easily despite their moderate policy positions. In the current race, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is leading in the polls despite her \"hard-core liberal\" campaign stands and a voting record to the left of most Senate Democrats. Republican candidate Donald Trump is trailing despite moderating some of his party's conservative stands on issues like social spending and gay rights, with his policy positions likely closer to the \"center\" of the electorate than those of previous Republican presidential candidates.\n\nHowever, many voters who might find Trump's positions appealing have been alienated by his bombast and political inexperience. The study also highlights that the single largest difference in positions between either party's presidential candidates and swing voters over the past three decades has been on the issue of racial policy. On average, Republican candidates have been seen as just six points to the right of the political center on the question of government assistance to African-Americans, while Democratic candidates have been 26 points to the left.",
    " Title: Conservative's Perspective on the 2016 Presidential Election: A Neutral Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2016 presidential election approaches, the American political landscape is witnessing a significant shift with Donald Trump emerging as the presumptive Republican nominee. This development has prompted many on the political right to declare their stance on Trump's candidacy. One such individual, identified as #NeverTrump and #NeverHillary, has shared their views on the upcoming election.\n\nThe individual, who has historically voted for third-party candidates, plans to abstain from voting this November. They express a sense of resignation towards the two major parties and the political system as a whole. If Hillary Clinton were to win the presidency, they anticipate a consolidation of liberal gains in the judiciary, potentially leading to the reversal of pro-life gains on the state level and more battles over religious liberty.\n\nIn the case of a Trump presidency, the individual expresses apprehension, citing Trump's questionable foreign policy judgment and nationalist views on immigration and trade as concerns. They also highlight Trump's shamelessness, ignorance, touchy ego, and freedom from political norms as potential dangers, particularly in the context of a president wielding the awesome powers of the office.\n\nThe individual's stance underscores the complexities and nuances of the 2016 presidential election, reflecting a deep-seated dissatisfaction with both major party candidates and the political system at large. The author's decision to abstain from voting serves as a testament to their desire to send a message of discontent with the status quo, echoing a sentiment shared by many Americans.",
    " Title: Trump to Nominate Conservative Successor for Supreme Court Justice Kennedy\n\nArticle:\n\nA political battle is brewing over the replacement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement from the US top court on Wednesday. Mr. Kennedy, 81, retires on July 31, giving President Donald Trump a chance to cement a conservative majority on the high court for decades to come.\n\nDemocrats argue that the Republican-controlled Congress should wait until after mid-term elections to confirm a successor. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has already cancelled a scheduled recess for the upper chamber in August, suggested Mr. Kennedy's replacement would be confirmed before November's mid-term elections.\n\n\"The Senate stands ready to fulfill its constitutional role by offering advice and consent on President Trump's nominee to fill this vacancy,\" he said on Wednesday. His comments came after President Trump said the process to find a replacement would \"begin immediately.\"\n\nMr. Kennedy made the announcement earlier on Wednesday, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family after 30 years on the top court. Although he was a conservative justice, Mr. Kennedy sided with liberals on certain key votes, including abortion and gay marriage.\n\nThe Senate, which votes to confirm Mr. Trump's nominee, is currently controlled by Republicans with a slim 51-seat majority. However, that could change after mid-term elections in November.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in Fargo, North Dakota on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump warned his supporters that Democrats would \"rewrite the Constitution any way they want\" unless Republicans could quickly confirm a conservative justice. \"We have to pick one that's going to be there for 40 years, 45 years,\" he said of Mr. Kennedy's successor.\n\nThe president has promised to draw names from the same list of 25 conservative candidates from which he picked Justice Neil Gorsuch in February last year. When asked by reporters on Wednesday if he would wait until after the mid-term elections to nominate a successor, Mr. Trump said: \"I think you want to go as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe long-simmering tensions over Supreme Court picks became a political flashpoint in 2016 when the Republicans successfully blocked President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, to replace the late Justice Anthony Scalia. At the time, Republicans said it was unfair to confirm a judge during an election year. Democrats are now pointing to that argument in an effort to halt the confirmation of Justice Kennedy's replacement.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Mr. Schumer, in a televised speech on the floor of the Senate, called for delaying a confirmation vote until after the mid-terms, adding that \"anything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy\" from Republicans.\n\nThe Supreme Court plays a key role in American life and is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. Rather than serving fixed terms, the justices serve for life unless they decide to retire. This makes their appointments particularly significant.\n\nThis week, the court upheld Mr. Trump's travel ban, which covers people from several Muslim-majority countries, in a 5-4 conservative majority ruling. Earlier this month, it ruled in favor of a baker in Colorado who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple.\n\n\"Hopefully we are going to pick somebody who will be as outstanding,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House shortly after Justice Kennedy's retirement was announced. Vice-President Mike Pence said on Twitter that the president would nominate \"a strong conservative, in the tradition of the late Justice Scalia\" who would uphold the \"God-given liberties\" of the constitution.\n\nMr. Kennedy, who is the second-oldest justice on the nine-member US Supreme Court, earned a reputation as a swing vote conservative who supported liberal arguments on key decisions, including the 5-4 rulings that decided same-sex marriage and upheld abortion rights. As a result, news of his retirement has raised fears among pro-choice groups that access to legal abortions in several states could be under threat.\n\nMr. Trump, during his presidential campaign, vowed to attempt to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision legalizing abortion throughout the US. \"If we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that is really what will happen,\" Mr. Trump said during an October 2016 debate with Hillary Clinton.\n\nMr. Kennedy, who was raised in California, was nominated by President Ronald Reagan and began his term in 1988. He voted conservative on issues of campaign finance, voting rights, and gun rights. Mr. Kennedy penned the Supreme Court's first major gay-rights decision in 1996, protecting LGBT Americans from discrimination. In 2015, he authored the landmark opinion which gave LGBT citizens the right to marry, writing: \"They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law and the Constitution grants them that right.\"\n\nAs a justice, he routinely favored personal liberty and the limiting of federal power. Mr. Trump said Mr. Kennedy had \"displayed great vision\" and \"tremendous heart.\" The White House also released a statement thanking Mr. Kennedy for his 30 years of service as a \"tireless voice for individual rights.\"\n\nFrom the list of 25 judges that Mr. Trump has said he would draw from, US media report several front runners. Most candidates are appointees of President George W. Bush, and only one of the supposed top-picks is a woman. Brett Kavanaugh, who is at the top of most lists, is a Washington, DC appeals court judge and was a former clerk to Mr. Kennedy. He represented Mr. Bush during the Florida vote recount in 2000 that won Mr. Bush the presidential election. However, the American Bar Association recently downgraded his qualifications based on a lack of experience and concerns over partisan bias. Amul Thapar, a Kentucky judge handpicked by Mr. McConnell, and Amy Comey Barrett, a former professor at Catholic university Notre Dame, are other likely nominees.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Lifts Ban on Transfer of Military Equipment to Local Police Departments\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration announced on Monday that it will lift the ban on the transfer of surplus military equipment to state and local police departments, a move that was put in place by the Obama administration in 2015. Attorney General Jeff Sessions made the announcement, stating, \"We will not put superficial concerns above public safety.\"\n\nPresident Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Monday reinstating the Pentagon's 1033 program, which was halted by the Obama administration after images of heavily armed police responding to protests in Ferguson, Missouri, shocked the nation. The ban blocked the transfer of armored vehicles, grenade launchers, armed aircraft, bayonets, and guns and ammunition of.50 caliber or higher.\n\nSessions argued that the restrictions went too far and that the program will \"make it easier to protect yourselves and your communities.\" He cited the ongoing rescue efforts in Houston, Texas, as an example of the need for such equipment.\n\nThe ban was part of the previous administration's efforts to re-establish trust between law enforcement and the communities they police, following a string of police-related deaths of black men in Ferguson, Baltimore, Charleston, S.C., and elsewhere. At the time, Obama warned that such equipment cast the police in the role of an \"occupying force,\" deepening divisions with distrustful communities.\n\nTrump has positioned himself as a \"law and order\" president who will restore an American way of life that the administration has warned is beset by worsening violence, including rising levels of violence against law enforcement.\n\nThe announcement comes as the role and conduct of police, particularly where it intersects with issues of race, continues to captivate national interest and spark fierce debate. Critics have accused state police officers in Charlottesville, Virginia, of standing by idly while a white nationalist fired into a crowd during violent clashes between demonstrators earlier this month.\n\nCongress established the 1033 program almost three decades ago as part of the annual defense authorization bill as part of an effort to help local law enforcement pursue drug investigations. However, in 1997, the program was expanded to include all local law enforcement operations, including counterterrorism. More than $5 billion of military equipment has been transferred to police departments since then.\n\nSome law enforcement groups, including the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), have been pushing for the rollback of the Obama-era ban. Supporters of the program argue that the equipment was protective and defensive, and in addition to saving lives and reducing crime rates, saved money by repurposing equipment for which taxpayers had already paid. Sessions argued on Monday that the program also provided first responder and rescue equipment \"like what they're using in Texas right now.\"\n\nCritics, meanwhile, argue that the program allowed police departments to stockpile military-grade equipment and increased the instances of violent encounters. Almost 150 law enforcement agencies were suspended over the six-year period prior to the ban for losing track of equipment, according to ABC News and Fusion. The FOP president, Chuck Canterbury, celebrated the new order in a Monday statement, saying, \"The previous administration was more concerned about the image of law enforcement being too'militarized' than they were about our safety.\"",
    " Title: Facebook Reduces Distribution and Adds Disclaimer to Altered Pelosi Video\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook has issued a statement regarding the controversy surrounding an altered video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that went viral, appearing to show her slurring her words. The social media giant did not remove the video but reduced its distribution and added a disclaimer stating that the video was \"false.\"\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Facebook explained that it removes content that violates its Community Standards but does not have a policy requiring that information posted on the platform be true. The company stated, \"We work hard to find the right balance between encouraging free expression and promoting a safe and authentic community. We believe that reducing the distribution of inauthentic content strikes that balance.\"\n\nFacebook clarified that it does not distribute all content but allows some content as forms of expression. The company stated, \"But just because something is allowed to be on Facebook does not mean it should get distribution. In other words, we allow people to post it as a form of expression, but we're not going to show it at the top of News Feed.\"\n\nThe platform also outlined its methods for combating misleading content. It removes content that violates its Community Standards, reduces the distribution of content that does not directly violate Community Standards but still undermines the authenticity of the platform, and empowers users to decide for themselves what to read, trust, and share by informing them with more context in-product and promoting news literacy.\n\nThe controversy arose amid growing scrutiny of Facebook and other social media companies regarding their handling of content on their platforms. Facebook and Twitter have faced criticism for apparent bias against conservatives and for allowing content promoted by Russians during the 2016 election.\n\nMonika Bickert, Facebook's vice president for product policy and counterterrorism, stated on CNN that the company \"dramatically\" reduced the video's distribution and informed users that the video was false. When CNN's Anderson Cooper pressed Bickert on why the video was not removed, Bickert responded, \"We think it's important for people to make their own informed choice about what to believe. Our job is to make sure that we are getting them accurate information and that's why we work with more than 50 fact-checking organizations around the world.\"\n\nShe added that the company would remove misinformation related to ongoing riots or some kind of threat to physical violence.",
    " Title: Millennials Strongly Support School Choice, National Surveys Show\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo national surveys, conducted eight months apart by different pollsters, have found strong support for school choice among Millennials. In January, Beck Research, on behalf of the American Federation for Children, reported that 75 percent of Millennials support school choice. Yesterday, USA Today released a poll from GenForward with nearly identical results.\n\nIn the GenForward poll, support for vouchers for low-income children is high among Millennials across racial and ethnic lines. Seventy-nine percent of African Americans, 76 percent of Asian Americans, 77 percent of Latinos, and 66 percent of whites support the concept. Charter schools enjoy support from 65 percent of African Americans, 61 percent of Asian Americans, 58 percent of Latinos, and 55 percent of whites.\n\nThis could be a winning issue for Republicans and Democrats willing to seize the moment and push bold reforms. In a Gallup poll from April of this year that gauged public opinion on 15 different policy proposals, federal funding for school vouchers was one of just four that Republicans and Democrats both supported on balance.\n\nLegislative momentum has grown in recent years, with states like Florida, Nevada, Louisiana, North Carolina, Illinois, Arizona, and Wisconsin, among others, enacting or expanding educational choice for K\u201312 students. On the national level, many are working to create an education tax credit that would enable many more children to access the school of their parents' choice. Federal school-choice initiatives are already available in higher education, in the form of grants and loans that a student may use at any eligible college.\n\nTwenty-six states with private-school-choice programs and 44 states with charter schools clearly show the nationwide support for educational choice. Research also shows that school choice works. Eleven of the 17 empirical studies using the random-assignment method, the \"gold standard\" for social-science research, show that students using private-school-choice programs do better academically. Charter-school research from Stanford's Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) shows significantly improved academic results, especially for students in urban charter schools.\n\nFor the Millennial generation, having many educational options make sense. They grew up with abundant options across most aspects of their lives, saw rapid advancements in technology, and distrust institutions. Many of them graduated high school or college during the 2008 financial crisis, and thus struggled to find work after earning degrees they'd been promised would lead to good jobs. Some were forced to move back in with their parents. So why would they continue to trust a bulky, monolithic K\u201312 system that hasn't been truly reformed in generations and produces meager results on international tests?\n\nMillennials do not believe that their five-digit ZIP code should determine whether they go to the good school, the bad school, the best school, or the failing school. With the growing popularity of online and personalized learning that can give them front-row access to some of the best teachers and best courses on the planet, Millennials are naturally inclined to think even more expansively when it comes to what's possible in education.\n\nThe future of education in America could be bright and dynamic, with better outcomes for our students. All we\u2014and our leaders\u2014have to do is choose that future. Tommy Schultz, the national communications director for the American Federation for Children, the nation's largest educational-choice advocacy organization, made this statement.",
    " Title: Study Shows Liberal Democrats More Likely to Strain Friendships Over Political Differences\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent Pew Research Center study indicates that nearly half of liberal Democrats, 47 percent, say that a friend's support for former President Donald Trump would strain their friendship. In contrast, only 13 percent of Republicans say a friend's support for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would have the same effect.\n\nThe poll also shows that among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, 35 percent say a friend's support for Trump would put a strain on their relationship. The study suggests that part of the reason for the imbalance is that liberals tend to live in more homogeneous areas and do not associate with conservatives.\n\nAnother Pew study from last year showed that 47 percent of people who planned to vote for Clinton did not have any close friends who were Trump supporters, while 31 percent of Trump supporters said they did not have any friends who backed Clinton.\n\nThe study also found that 68 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters say they find it \"stressful and frustrating\" to talk to people who have a different opinion of Trump. About half, 52 percent, of Republican and GOP-leaning voters say the same.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked debate and criticism, with some arguing that the results reflect a growing tribalism in American politics. However, the Pew Research Center emphasizes that the study is based on self-reported data and may not fully capture the complexity of real-life relationships and interactions.\n\nThe study's findings come amid ongoing political polarization in the United States, with many Americans reporting that they have fewer friends and acquaintances with opposing political views. The study does not provide insight into the reasons behind this trend, but it suggests that political differences can create significant strain in personal relationships.",
    " Title: White House Press Secretary Corrects Job Creation Claim for African-Americans During Obama and Trump Administrations\n\nArticle:\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders issued a rare correction and apology on Tuesday after providing inaccurate information during a press briefing regarding the number of jobs created for African-Americans during the Obama and Trump administrations.\n\nInitially, Sanders stated that President Donald Trump had created three times as many jobs for African-Americans as former President Barack Obama during his entire eight years in the White House. However, in a tweet, Sanders later clarified, \"Correction from today\u2019s briefing: Jobs numbers for Pres Trump and Pres Obama were correct, but the time frame for Pres Obama wasn\u2019t.\"\n\nAccording to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, when Obama was president, he created nearly 3 million jobs for blacks, about 15 times what Sanders initially claimed. Sanders had attempted to demonstrate that Trump's record with the African-American population was not only great but even better than Obama's, explaining that Trump tripled Obama's job creation record for the black community.\n\nDuring the briefing, Sanders stated, \"This President, since he took office, in the year and a half that he's been here, has created 700,000 new jobs for African-Americans.\" She continued, \"That's 700,000 African-Americans that are working now that weren't working when this President took office. When President Obama left, after eight years in office, he had only created 195,000 jobs for African-Americans.\"\n\nThe claim was made during Sanders' defense of Trump on race after the president was accused of using the N-word on tape and called former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman a \"dog\" on Twitter. The White House Council of Economic Advisers also posted an apology on Twitter, stating there was a miscommunication to Sanders.",
    " Title: New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez's Natural Gas Bill Sponsorship Sparks Ethics Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nMore trouble is looming for Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) as an Associated Press (AP) investigation has revealed that the embattled New Jersey Democrat sponsored legislation that, if passed, would have aided one of his biggest donor's investment in a natural gas vehicle conversion company. The AP report, published on Monday, states that Senator Menendez sponsored a bill to provide tax credits and grants to truck and heavy vehicle fleets that converted to natural gas. The bill could have benefited Salomon Melgen, the Florida eye doctor whose close relationship with Menendez has spurred a Senate ethics investigation. Dr. Melgen is an investor and member of the board of directors of Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp., which designs, manufactures, and sells products to convert diesel- and gas-fuel vehicles to natural gas.\n\nMenendez's backing of the natural-gas bill marks another convergence of interest between the politician and a major donor, and is a concern for the senator. However, political watchers in New Jersey say the bill sponsorship is one part of a larger clean-energy agenda from the senator, who has a history of supporting environmental causes. As such, it is unlikely this latest allegation represents a conflict of interest, says Brigid Harrison, a political scientist at Montclair State University, who predicts that Menendez will survive the latest storm.\n\n\"I'm still not convinced... that this kind of behavior reaches to the status where it becomes enormously problematic in voters' minds,\" says Professor Harrison. \"I'm not seeing any illegality or conflict of interest here.\"\n\nThe bill-sponsorship revelation revives the larger issue of the senator's relationship with Melgen, with recent reports suggesting that Menendez was providing political favors for Melgen in exchange for campaign support. Menendez used Melgen's private jet for two personal trips to the Dominican Republic in 2010, flights that were not reimbursed until three years later, when news reports called the senator's conduct into question. Menendez also intervened in a Medicare billing dispute between Melgen and federal authorities, as well as a port security contract, allegedly in order to protect the interests of his friend and donor, according to news reports. The allegations are compounded by a $700,000 donation Melgen made to Majority PAC, a \"super political-action committee\" created to elect Senate Democrats that ultimately made a $582,500 contribution to Menendez's 2012 reelection campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nMenendez has vehemently denied all allegations of impropriety, including any allegations of conflict-of-interest stemming from this latest report. His office did not respond to calls regarding his sponsorship of the natural gas bill. According to the AP report, Menendez joined Senate majority leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch (R) as a key backer of the natural gas bill. Soon after, Melgen joined the board of directors of Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp. Though his investment in the company is confidential under US Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the company required a minimum investment of $51,500, according to the AP.\n\nUltimately, the bill didn't get enough votes to make it out of the Senate. However, while it was under consideration, a consultant for Gaseous Fuel Systems spent $220,000 lobbying Menendez and other congressional officials, according to interviews and Senate records as reported by the AP. \"There is no evidence that Menendez offered direct help or intervened on behalf of the company or Melgen,\" the AP said in its report. \"Instead, the connection between the two men's interests in natural gas is the latest example of the close symmetry between the senator... and his millionaire backer.\"\n\nEvidence of \"close symmetry\" in this latest development, say analysts, is not enough to topple Menendez. \"Menendez has been involved in clean-energy technology for a long time,\" says Ross Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. \"In light of Melgen's apparently limited and distant role in GFS, I think it is more of a coincidence than anything more sinister. I think it is as likely that Menendez got Melgen interested in converting truck fleets to natural gas as it was the other way around.\"\n\nOther clean-energy initiatives the senator has supported include co-sponsoring legislation aimed at jump-starting offshore wind energy, extending solar energy tax credits, and creating block grants to spur green-energy projects. Menendez recently reintroduced the Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act and Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act, legislation he originally introduced in the 112th Congress to end tax subsidies for the \"Big 5\" oil companies.\n\n\"It isn't that this came out of the blue, it's part of a larger cohesive agenda... to deal with energy issues the country is facing,\" says Harrison of Montclair State University. \"His record is an accurate reflection of his policy concerns, and this is one part of that.\"\n\nAnd though the AP report singled out Menendez, the senator isn't alone in supporting the natural gas bill \u2013 or in sharing a passion with supporters for similar causes. In fact, the House version of the natural gas legislation had 181 co-sponsors. The natural gas industry spends hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying members of Congress, including Menendez and his staff. \"They are not alone in being lobbied,\" says Harrison.\n\nMenendez's ethics controversy has had an impact on his poll numbers, and this latest development may further damage the senator's image. A Quinnipiac University poll found Menendez's approval ratings plummeted 15 percentage points between January and February, as news reports emerged about his relationship with Melgen. His approval rating dropped from 51 percent in mid-January to 36 percent in mid-February. The same poll found only 28 percent of New Jersey voters said the senator was \"honest and trustworthy.\"",
    " Title: Obama Administration to Implement 100% Income Verification for Health Care Subsidies\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration is set to unveil new procedures that will enable the government to verify the income of Americans who seek government subsidies under the federal health care law. Gary Cohen, deputy director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, made this assurance during a hearing with the House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday.\n\nConcerns were raised by Chairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, regarding self-certification of income by enrollees in state health exchanges. The administration would have to cross-check this information much later, when the enrollees file their tax returns.\n\nCohen stated that the government will verify the income of everyone who applies for subsidies on the state-based exchanges, where those without employer-based insurance can shop for private health coverage with the help of premium tax credits. Daniel Werfel, acting director of the IRS, added that the tax credits will be delivered through the health exchanges, not directly to the individual enrollees.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Mr. Camp expressed concerns about the increasing uncertainty and confusion surrounding the Affordable Care Act, with roughly 60 days remaining until state-based insurance markets begin enrollment for coverage that takes effect in January. He cited government accountability reports suggesting the federal government is lagging in its efforts to set up exchanges in more than half the states, and the White House's decision to delay the employer mandate by one year.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius reportedly told the committee that the Obama administration was on track to meet the October 1 deadline for the new health care law, but Mr. Camp stated that evidence shows the opposite is true.\n\nOn Friday, the House is scheduled to vote on a bill that would prevent the IRS from implementing and enforcing the health care law, in response to mounting distrust of the agency following a political targeting scandal in its tax-exempt organizations branch.\n\nWerfel clarified on Thursday that at no time will tax data be displayed to anyone outside of the marketplace itself. Michigan Rep. Sander Levin, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means panel, stated that the hearing had been convened \"under the pretense that House Republicans are interested in learning about the implementation of the landmark law.\" He added that the Republican mission is to \"don't implement, destroy.\"\n\nLevin further questioned the motives of Republicans, stating that they have leaned on outside organizations, including the National Football League, to discourage them from helping to educate Americans about current health insurance opportunities and assistance that will be available through the marketplaces.",
    " Title: Democratic Concerns Emerge Over Obamacare Implementation and Potential Political Backlash\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic senators have expressed concerns about the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, during a caucus meeting with White House officials. The concerns center around the law's impact on small businesses, compliance difficulties, and potential political repercussions if the rollout is messy or if premiums increase significantly.\n\nSenator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), who is up for re-election next year, stated that small businesses in New Hampshire are uncertain about how to comply with the law, and some restaurants are considering reducing workers' hours to avoid the law's requirement to offer health coverage to full-time employees.\n\nSenator Tom Harkin (D-IA), chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on health care, expressed his displeasure with President Obama's decision to use funds from public health prevention programs to publicize the new law.\n\nSenator Benjamin L. Cardin (D-MD) voiced his concern about large rate increases being sought by the largest health insurer in his state, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield. The company has requested premium increases averaging 25 percent for individual insurance policies and about 15 percent for small businesses.\n\nThe White House officials acknowledged these concerns and pledged to address them, according to Senator Shaheen.\n\nRecent reports suggest that Obamacare may be facing growing opposition, with some Democrats expressing concerns about its impact on small businesses and premium increases. The law remains unpopular, and there are growing fears of a potential political backlash in the 2014 midterm elections, similar to the one that followed its initial passage in 2010.\n\nFurther complications have arisen, with reports of problematic elements of the law set to roll out next year, while the supposedly popular aspects were front-loaded for political reasons. The law's implementation and potential political consequences continue to be a source of concern for Democrats.\n\nAdditional issues have surfaced, with Politico describing \"Obamacare fires flaring up all over,\" and Fox's Chris Stirewalt highlighting a problematic and impending Medicaid assessment deadline the administration may miss.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Grows 2.9% in 2018, but Slower Growth Expected in 2019\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States economy grew by 2.9% in 2018, marking its best performance since the Great Recession of 2007-09. However, economists predict slower growth of 2% to 2.5% in 2019 due to the expected fade-out of federal tax cuts and spending increases, a sluggish global economy, and lingering U.S. trade tensions with China.\n\nIn the October-December period, the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6%. This followed an average 3.7% advance in the prior two quarters. For the year, the economy's growth matched its performance since 2015, which was a post-recession high.\n\nConsumer spending grew a sturdy 2.8%, down from 3.5% in the third quarter. The showing was dampened by a surprising 1.2% retail sales decline in December, which some economists question and expect to be revised higher. Incomes also have been rising, with employers adding an average 223,000 jobs a month last year, up from 182,000 in 2017.\n\nBusiness investment increased 6.2%, up from 2.5% in the third quarter, largely because of a big jump in software and research and development. Equipment spending also rose 6.7%. The solid performance defied the drop in stock prices late last year that rattled business confidence, slowing global growth, and President Trump's trade standoff with China.\n\nGovernment spending edged up 0.4% after rising 2.6% in the second quarter. Federal spending increased 1.6%, bolstered by a 6.9% jump in defense outlays, while state and local government spending fell 0.3%. The budget deal Congress passed early last year is boosting government outlays, though the effects are likely to fade by the second half of 2019.\n\nThe nation's trade deficit widened as exports increased 1.6% while imports grew 2.7%. As a result, trade overall was a slight drag on economic growth. China has hit U.S. imports such as soybeans with tariffs in retaliation for broad U.S. tariffs on Chinese shipments. Trump recently delayed plans to increase a 10% tariff on $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25%, raising hopes for a resolution to the impasse.\n\nResidential investment fell for the fourth straight month, slipping 3.5%. While low housing supplies reflect a need for more construction, builders have faced severe worker shortages and higher material costs that have slowed projects. Also, existing home sales slowed noticeably late last year amid higher mortgage rates and home prices, leading many builders to pull back. Both prices and rates have moderated recently, possibly heralding a recovery in housing starts.",
    " Title: Former White House Strategist Steve Bannon Predicts Government Shutdown Over Border Wall Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer White House strategist Steve Bannon has predicted another potential government shutdown before the midterm elections due to President Trump's insistence on funding his long-promised border wall. In an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, Bannon stated, \"I believe the government will actually shut down in the run-up to the election.\"\n\nBannon emphasized the significance of the wall, stating, \"The wall is not just totemic; the wall is absolutely central to his program.\" Although President Trump has claimed that the wall is already being built, Congress has yet to allocate funding for it. To date, only existing fences have been repaired, and several prototypes of a possible wall have been constructed.\n\nIn January, CNN reported that the Trump administration had requested $33 billion to cover the costs of securing the border, with $18 billion allocated for the wall, according to Customs and Border Protection documents obtained by CNN and sent to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In March, Congress passed a $1.3 trillion spending plan that did not include any funds for the wall. The president has been pressing for Congress to revisit the issue this fall.\n\nBannon suggested that President Trump may shut down the government if lawmakers again refuse to allocate funds for the wall. \"I believe that what he's going to do is, as we come up on September 30, if that appropriations bill does not include spending to fully build his wall\u2014not some $1.6 billion for prototypes, I mean to build the southern wall\u2014I believe he will shut down the government,\" Bannon said.\n\nTrump's demand for a wall was a central theme of his 2016 presidential campaign. In his Trump Tower announcement of a White House bid, Trump stated, \"I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.\"\n\nUntil last week, Trump had largely avoided public statements on his demand that Mexico pay for the wall following his insistence on the issue leading to the cancellation of Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto's planned visit to Washington in early 2017. Trump mentioned the wall again last week in his rally in Nashville, prompting another quick response from the Mexican president: \"NO. Mexico will NEVER pay for a wall. Not now, not ever.\"",

The USS Arlington, a warship carrying amphibious vehicles and aircraft, is also joining the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group in the Gulf. Additionally, US B-52 bombers have arrived at a base in Qatar.\n\nThe US has not specified the nature of the potential threats, but Iran has dismissed the deployments as \"psychological warfare\" aimed at intimidating the country. Iran has also suggested it may resume uranium enrichment nuclear activities.\n\nThe US currently has approximately 5,200 troops deployed in neighboring Iraq. The Patriot system is capable of countering ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and advanced aircraft. The USS Arlington's deployment was reportedly brought forward to provide enhanced command and control capabilities.\n\nLast year, US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal between America and Iran, which limited Iran's sensitive nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. In response to the US's economic sanctions, Iran's economy has experienced a sharp downturn, leading to record lows in the value of its currency, a decrease in foreign investment, and protests.\n\nThe Trump administration aims to compel Iran to negotiate a \"new deal\" that would cover not only its nuclear activities but also its ballistic missile program and \"malign behavior\" across the Middle East. Iran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate, including by potentially blocking the Strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of all oil consumed globally passes.\n\nEarlier this week, Iran announced that it had suspended two commitments under the 2015 accord in response to the economic sanctions re-imposed by the US. The European powers remain committed to the Iran nuclear deal but \"reject any ultimatums\" from Iran to prevent its collapse. The real battle for the fate of the Iran nuclear deal is ongoing, with no guarantee of success and a growing risk of conflict.",
    " Title: Differences Between Obama and Netanyahu Rooted in Policy Disagreements, Not Personalities\n\nArticle:\n\nYaakov Amidror, a former national security adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has stated that the differences between the Israeli leader and former U.S. President Barack Obama are more substantive than personal. Amidror noted that while there may be personal issues, the primary cause of their disagreements lies in their differing evaluations of the situation rather than their personal opinions of each other.\n\nGiven their contrasting political ideologies, friction between the liberal Democrat and the conservative Likud leader was inevitable. Critics suggest that Mr. Obama was not adequately sensitive to the nuances of the alliance, and had difficulty understanding Mr. Netanyahu's distrust. Additionally, Mr. Obama's decisions were sometimes worsened by a lack of preparation for the Israeli leader.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Netanyahu chose to interpret Mr. Obama's policies in the most incendiary manner, expressing outrage rather than emphasizing common ground. His suspicions were fueled by visits from Republican lawmakers and conservative patrons, such as casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who had their own criticisms of the president.\n\nWhen they communicate, their conversations are robust and pointed, with Mr. Netanyahu delivering his points bluntly and restraining his \"monumental rage,\" as described by his former ambassador, Michael Oren, in a memoir. Mr. Obama is more reserved but may come off as condescending and rarely lets a point go unchallenged.\n\nA phone call between them can last up to 90 minutes, with Benjamin J. Rhodes, the president's deputy national security adviser, noting that they enjoy debating each other to an extent. Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu first met in 2007, when their aides hastily arranged a meeting at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in a janitor's office. Mr. Netanyahu, then in the opposition, was returning home, while Mr. Obama, running for president, was coming from the campaign trail. According to Rhodes, they \"actually had chemistry.\"",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates Address LGBTQ Issues, Foreign Aid, and HIV/AIDS\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a televised townhall event in Los Angeles, California, on October 10, 2019, eight Democratic presidential candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, discussed LGBTQ issues, foreign aid, and HIV/AIDS. The event, dedicated to LGBTQ issues, was the second major forum during the Democratic nominating campaign, following an event in Iowa last month.\n\nJoe Biden, the front-runner in the Democratic race, addressed his past positions, particularly his vote for a military funding bill that included the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, which banned harassment of closeted gay soldiers but barred those who were out from military service. Biden later backed repeal of that policy and supported same-sex marriage before President Barack Obama, under whom he served as vice president.\n\nBiden pledged to withhold foreign aid from countries that persecute LGBTQ people and establish an office in the State Department to promote LGBTQ rights globally. He also defended his record on LGBTQ issues and criticized efforts to curb LGBTQ rights.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is vying to become the first openly gay U.S. president, spoke about his experience as a gay man, including serving in the military in Afghanistan while closeted. He also addressed the public health rules that bar gay men from giving blood, stating that the policy is based on prejudice rather than science. Buttigieg promised to change the policy if elected president.\n\nU.S. Senator Cory Booker opened the forum, emphasizing inclusion and acceptance. Senator Bernie Sanders, a top Democratic contender, missed the event while recovering from a heart attack.\n\nGay rights advocates have expressed dismay at the Trump administration's record on LGBTQ issues, including a ban on transgender individuals serving in the U.S. military. Lawyers for the Department of Justice argued at the U.S. Supreme Court this week that federal civil rights law does not prohibit employers from firing workers based on their transgender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nAhead of the forum, Buttigieg, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris released plans to secure equality for LGBTQ people. All three support the Equality Act, which would add LGBTQ protections to federal anti-discrimination law. They also vowed to make pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug that helps lower the risk of contracting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), accessible and affordable to all who want it. Buttigieg aims to eliminate the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030, in part by restoring the White House Office of National AIDS Policy that has gone dormant under Trump.\n\nAll three candidates promised to elevate LGBTQ concerns as president. Warren said she would appoint a special envoy at the State Department, while Harris said she would create a White House position, chief advocate for LGBTQ+ Affairs, to coordinate efforts across the entire federal government. Warren, who has risen steadily in the polls to challenge Biden as the frontrunner, drew the biggest applause of the night as she addressed issues most of the candidates agreed on in a down-to-earth way.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Faces Calls to Unseal Documents in Alabama Execution Case\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Supreme Court refused to grant a stay of execution to convicted murderer Christopher Price last week, just hours before his execution by the state of Alabama. The unusual aspect of the case lies in the fact that half of the briefs in the case were blacked out, preventing public view, and virtually all of the record in the case was sealed.\n\nThe Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and NPR have since filed a motion with the Supreme Court, requesting the unsealing of the material that was blocked from public view. The sealed information does not pertain to the defendant's guilt but rather concerns the drugs and execution protocol used by Alabama.\n\nThe Supreme Court has historically been open about its debates regarding the death penalty, but this case marks a departure from that transparency. All deletions were at the insistence of Alabama, according to the reporters' committee. The state provided no explanation for its need for secrecy.\n\nIn the past, the Supreme Court has upheld the right of access to a wide range of judicial proceedings and records, citing that such access \"enhances the quality and safeguards the integrity of the fact-finding process\" and allows \"the public to participate in and serve as a check upon the judicial process\u2014an essential component in our structure of self-government.\"\n\nDefense lawyer Aaron Katz agreed to let the record be closed to the public and press in the lower courts due to time constraints, with the execution date set for May 30. Katz stated, \"You can't afford any sideshow\" in such circumstances. \"You've essentially got to agree to whatever terms the state forces on you to get the information you need to prove your case.\"\n\nThe Reporters Committee is now asking the Supreme Court to unseal the briefs filed in the Supreme Court. Katie Townsend, legal director for the reporters committee, stated, \"Alabama's claim that it needs to keep all that information secret is 'crazy.' How can it be 'that the state gets away with saying to the public, 'We're not going to tell you our legal arguments, or allow you to see our evidence, which goes to the heart of the legal issue'?'\"\n\nMike Lewis, a spokesman for the Alabama attorney general, stated that the state sought to keep the records and arguments secret \"out of concern for the safety of correctional officers as well as inmates.\" However, defense lawyer Aaron Katz has never sought to disclose the names of corrections officers or anyone else involved in the execution.\n\nThe reporters committee points to the availability of appellate records that extend \"far back in the nation's history,\" and to a more recent opinion issued by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. That decision declared that \"the public can not have confidence that the nation's appellate courts issue well-reasoned and fair opinions derived from facts and legal arguments the parties present if the case proceeds with key argument and evidence under seal.\" The circuit court opinion was written by President Barack Obama's failed Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, and joined by his then-colleague Brett Kavanaugh, later appointed to the Supreme Court by President Trump.",
    " Title: Abortion Restrictions and Midterm Elections: A Divisive Issue in U.S. Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the midterm elections, the issue of abortion has become a significant point of contention between the two major political parties in the United States. President Donald Trump and anti-abortion activists have touted recent actions restricting abortion as a means to galvanize Republican voters, while Democrats argue that these actions will hurt, not help, Republican candidates in November.\n\nThe Trump administration recently announced a proposal to ban recipients of federal family planning money from referring patients for abortions or sharing locations with abortion providers. This move, supporters argue, is a direct attack on federal support for Planned Parenthood, which receives millions annually from Title X, a $286 million program that funds organizations providing family planning services to low-income women and men.\n\nAnti-abortion groups, such as the Susan B. Anthony List, have pushed for these changes to energize the grassroots ahead of the midterms, following Congress's failure to defund Planned Parenthood legislatively. On the other hand, Democrats, who refer to the restrictions as a \"gag rule,\" hope to portray the proposal as another example of Republicans taking extreme actions to limit women's healthcare.\n\nGroups on both sides of the abortion debate are pouring millions into the midterms, breaking their own records for campaign spending. Planned Parenthood announced a $20 million campaign targeting eight states in March, the largest such effort it has ever undertaken. The anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List is aiming to surpass this amount, with a goal of raising and spending $25 million. NARAL Pro-Choice America announced its largest-ever midterm investment of $5 million in 19 states this week.\n\nThe stakes in the election are high for both sides. Anti-abortion advocates want more Republicans in the Senate to pass a ban on abortions after 20 weeks, defund Planned Parenthood, and approve any future Supreme Court nominees. Democrats, on the other hand, aim to gain control of both chambers to block such bills and fight back against policy changes from the administration.\n\nIn his year and a half in office, Trump has already given anti-abortion activists several reasons to celebrate. He has banned the use of tax dollars for foreign nongovernmental organizations that provide or promote abortions, broadened exemptions for employers who have moral or religious objections to providing birth control to their employees, and rescinded Obama-era guidance that sought to protect Planned Parenthood from state defunding efforts.\n\nFresh off these victories, anti-abortion groups are openly discussing ways to roll back Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that enshrined abortion rights. However, a January poll from the Pew Research Center showed 69 percent of Americans oppose overturning Roe v. Wade, with 28 percent supporting.\n\nBoth parties claim to have the upper hand, making the election a litmus test for public opinion that could shape the messaging of both parties heading into the 2020 presidential election. The outcome of the midterms could significantly impact the future of abortion policies in the United States.",
    " Title: Trump Expresses Willingness to Engage with North Korea, Criticizes Paris Climate Accord, Dodd-Frank Regulations\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump has expressed his willingness to engage in discussions with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in an attempt to halt Pyongyang's nuclear program. In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Trump also criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in eastern Ukraine, called for a renegotiation of the Paris climate accord, and stated his intention to dismantle most of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations if elected president.\n\nTrump declined to provide specifics regarding his plans to address North Korea, but a meeting with Kim would represent a significant shift in U.S. policy towards the secluded nation. \"I would speak to him. I would have no problem speaking to him,\" Trump said of Kim. Trump also emphasized the economic leverage the United States holds over China and stated that he would apply pressure on Beijing in this regard.\n\nRegarding the Paris climate accord, Trump expressed disapproval, stating that the United States is treated unfairly by the agreement, which mandates carbon emissions reductions for over 170 countries. A renegotiation of the pact would constitute a major setback for the first truly global climate accord, which committed both rich and poor nations to limiting greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTurning to the economy, Trump indicated that he would release a detailed policy platform in two weeks. He stated that the platform would dismantle nearly all of Dodd-Frank, a package of financial reforms enacted following the 2007-2008 financial crisis. \"I would say it'll be close to a dismantling of Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank is a very negative force, which has developed a very bad name,\" Trump said.\n\nThe New York billionaire also expressed concern about a financial bubble within the tech startup industry, stating that tech companies were achieving high valuations without ever turning a profit. Trump also mentioned his desire for a Republican to lead the U.S. Federal Reserve, but stated that he is not an adversary of current chair Janet Yellen. \"I'm not a person that thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job. I happen to be a low-interest rate person unless inflation rears its ugly head, which can happen at some point,\" he said, adding that inflation \"doesn't seem like it's happening any time soon.\"",
    " Title: Jeff Bezos's Minimum Wage Stance Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate surrounding the minimum wage has taken a new turn with the involvement of Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man and the founder of Amazon. The controversy stems from Sen. Bernie Sanders' criticism of Bezos due to some of Amazon's workers' eligibility for food stamps.\n\nInitially, Amazon defended itself, labeling the criticisms as \"inaccurate\" and \"misleading.\" However, the company's stance shifted when it announced plans to pay all its workers at least $15 per hour. This decision was met with approval from some quarters, but it has also sparked concerns about the potential impact on entry-level workers.\n\nCalifornia restaurant manager Merv Crist, in a recent interview, expressed her view that a higher minimum wage could price less-skilled workers out of the job market. She argued that had a higher minimum wage existed when she was a teenager, her labor might not have been worth it to her employer, and she might not have had the opportunity to work her way up the career ladder.\n\nFurthermore, Amazon's announcement that it would lobby for government intervention to enforce the higher wage has raised eyebrows. Critics argue that this move could create an unfair advantage for Amazon over its competitors, particularly smaller businesses that may not be able to afford the higher wage.\n\nThe debate highlights the complexities of minimum wage policies and their potential effects on employment opportunities for less-skilled workers. It also underscores the need for careful consideration when implementing policies aimed at addressing income inequality, as the unintended consequences can sometimes be far-reaching.",
    " Title: Analysis of the 40th Republican National Convention: Romney and Ryan's Post-Convention Bounce in Tight Polls\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 40th Republican National Convention has concluded, and political analysts are examining the poll numbers to determine if Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have experienced a post-convention surge in the closely divided polls.\n\nRomney's convention managers made several strategic decisions. They chose not to revisit the 2008 election, as some conservatives might have preferred. Instead, Romney and Ryan acknowledged the desire for change that motivated many former Barack Obama voters and reflected on his record in office with a sense of sorrow rather than anger.\n\nFormer Democratic Representative Artur Davis eloquently expressed his disillusionment with the president. His speech was so compelling that it would have been inappropriate to air it on MSNBC, as it would have contradicted the cable channel's persistent narrative that Republicans are racists.\n\nThe convention also targeted young voters, who voted 66 to 32 percent for Obama in the last election, with Ryan's reference to twenty-somethings in their childhood bedrooms, \"staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life.\" Additionally, the convention reached out to the significant number of voters who may feel uncomfortable with the idea of Americans rejecting the first black president.\n\nAn unexpected decision was the inclusion of Clint Eastwood at 10:00 Eastern, when the broadcast networks began their hour of coverage. This decision may have been motivated by the desire to address the one reason for rejecting a president: inadequate performance in office.\n\nThe convention was not as tightly scripted as previous conventions, with Clint Eastwood speaking without a teleprompter and Condoleezza Rice delivering her speech in the same manner. In back-to-back speeches, Ann Romney spoke about \"love\" and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie emphasized the importance of respect. This seemed discordant, but the two themes can be reconciled: a leader acts out of love for the people but prefers to be feared rather than loved.\n\nThe convention aimed to humanize Romney by revealing personal details about his and his wife's lives, emphasizing their relatability to the average person. The testimonies of fellow church members about the Romneys' service and caring were particularly moving. The convention floor was almost silent as they spoke, and their testimonies will likely appear in future TV ads.\n\nThe convention also addressed concerns that have undoubtedly surfaced in focus groups. Yes, the candidate is open to women taking a lead role, as they have on his staff. Yes, the candidate did help create businesses that employ tens of thousands and provide goods and services that people found they needed. Yes, Republicans care about education, and education choice, so that disadvantaged children have a chance to move upward.\n\nComing off the convention floor, there were raves about Romney's speech from rank-and-file delegates and limited praise from those with more experience. Not spectacular, they said, but good enough. This is actually high praise, as Democrats expect their presidential candidates to be intellectually dazzling and oratorically thrilling. Republicans, on the other hand, are satisfied if their politicians are competent enough to do the job.\n\nMitt Romney, in selecting Paul Ryan, in staging an inspiring rather than slick convention, and in delivering his acceptance speech, has convinced Republicans in the hall and around the nation, and probably many undecideds, that he is a more than sufficient tool to do the job.",
    " Title: White House Aide David Sorensen Resigns Amid Domestic Abuse Allegations; Second White House Official to Depart Over Abuse Claims in a Week\n\nArticle:\n\nDavid Sorensen, a speechwriter for the White House, has resigned following allegations of domestic abuse from his ex-wife, Jessica Corbett. This marks the second White House aide to resign this week over domestic abuse allegations. The other official, Rob Porter, also denied the accusations made by his two ex-wives.\n\nAccording to a report by the Washington Post, Corbett stated that Sorensen was physically abusive during their marriage. She claimed that on separate occasions, her former husband ran a car over her foot, threw her against a wall, and extinguished a cigarette on her hand.\n\nIn response, Sorensen released a statement denying the allegations, saying, \"I have never committed violence of any kind against any woman in my entire life.\" He added that he was considering legal action but resigned because he \"did not want the White House to have to deal with this distraction.\"\n\nWhite House officials learned of the allegations against Sorensen on Thursday, and deputy press secretary Raj Shah said, \"We immediately confronted the staffer, he denied the allegations, and he resigned today.\"\n\nAllegations of domestic abuse involving two of Porter's ex-wives surfaced on Tuesday. It is alleged that the former White House staff secretary gave one ex-wife a black eye while another filed a restraining order. Porter also denies the allegations.\n\nOn Friday, President Trump paid tribute to Porter, who resigned his White House position on Wednesday. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"We found out about it recently and I was surprised by it, but we certainly wish him well and it's a tough time for him.\" However, Trump did not refer to Porter's accusers.\n\nThe case has put pressure on White House Chief-of-Staff John Kelly, who has denied reports he offered to resign over his handling of the accusations. After initially praising Porter as a man of \"integrity,\" Kelly later released a statement saying he was shocked by the claims and stressed domestic violence was unacceptable.\n\nUS media report that Kelly and other White House officials were aware for several months of the domestic abuse allegations because they were holding up Porter's security clearance application. It is unclear how long it took the White House to act on the accusations facing Mr. Porter.\n\nWhite House communications director Hope Hicks' handling of the controversy has reportedly displeased President Trump. The 29-year-old aide has recently been in a relationship with Porter, a Harvard graduate and former Oxford Rhodes Scholar.\n\nAccording to CBS News, Porter approached White House Counsel Don McGahn in January 2017 to inform him his ex-wives might say unflattering things about him to background check investigators. In June 2017, Porter's preliminary file was sent from the FBI to the White House security office, containing the abuse allegations. In November, McGahn received a call from an ex-girlfriend of Porter alleging physical violence by the aide.\n\nIt is unavailable whether the White House was aware of the extent of the allegations against Porter before Tuesday, as the article does not provide further information on this matter.",
    " Title: Media Bias and Government Influence: A Critical Analysis of News Reporting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a reflection on the state of media, the article discusses the author's concerns about the accuracy and objectivity of news reporting, particularly during natural disasters and political events. The author argues that sensationalism and government-centric thinking are prevalent in media coverage, citing examples such as the breathless coverage of a storm on the East Coast and the closure of government buildings during a weather event, while many private businesses remain open.\n\nThe author also criticizes the New York Times for its headline \"What Happens When You Fight a 'Deep State' that Doesn't Exist?\" The article argues that the deep state, often referred to as the administrative or regulatory state, does exist and is a significant force in shaping policy and stifling innovation. The author claims that the deep state consists of hundreds of new rules issued by regulators and that these rules often work against economic growth and individual freedom.\n\nThe author also takes issue with the Times' portrayal of President Donald Trump's appointee Scott Pruitt as being \"at odds with the established scientific consensus\" on climate change. The author argues that Pruitt's statement that he does not agree that man is the \"primary contributor\" to global warming is not necessarily at odds with the scientific consensus, as there is significant uncertainty in climate measurements and many scientists question the extent to which human activities are responsible for global warming.\n\nThe author also criticizes the media for failing to accurately portray the negative effects of socialism, citing the example of Venezuela's economic crisis. The author argues that socialism, characterized by caps on corporate profits, abolition of property rights, and regulation of car production, is the root cause of Venezuela's misery, but that this is not acknowledged in media coverage.\n\nOverall, the author expresses frustration with the media's tendency to sensationalize events, to overlook the negative consequences of government intervention, and to fail to accurately portray the realities of socialism. The author calls for a more critical and objective approach to news reporting.",
    " Title: Divisions Emerge Over Health Care Repeal as Election Nears\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the midterm elections approach, divisions are emerging among Republicans over the wisdom of repealing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, root and branch. Some Republicans, particularly those facing re-election in swing districts, are suggesting that certain provisions of the law should be retained.\n\nRepresentative Nan Hayworth, an ophthalmologist and a freshman Republican from New York, has proposed a framework for replacement that includes bolstered health savings accounts, the option to purchase insurance across state lines, medical malpractice limits, and a government-subsidized insurance pool for sick people who cannot buy insurance on their own. However, these alternatives have not been broadly aired.\n\n\"We need to start expressing our principles promptly,\" Representative Hayworth said.\n\nIn contrast, during the first repeal vote, a new, vigorous Republican majority was confident that they owed their triumph to voter anger over the health care law. Democrats were on the defensive, with all eyes on which survivors of the 2010 midterm tsunami would switch their votes for the law and embrace repeal. The House voted 245-to-189 to undo President Obama's signature domestic achievement, with three Democrats joining in.\n\nRepresentative Pete Sessions of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said the health care law was passed \"with deception at its core\"\u2014a penalty for those who fail to purchase insurance has been unmasked by the Supreme Court as a tax on the middle class. He believes the issue will be \"probably the biggest driver\" ensuring Republican victory in November, outside of the tax increases that could come next year with the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts.\n\nHowever, his deputy at the Republican Congressional Committee, Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, was more circumspect. \"We\u2019re going to be talking about jobs and economy, but there are lots of elements to that discussion, one of them being health care,\" Mr. Walden said.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, say they will be playing offense. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee started an advertising campaign Monday morning portraying Republicans as controlled by insurance companies and intent on taking away the popular consumer protections in the law. A series of news conferences are planned that will include real-life families whom Democrats say would be harmed by repeal.\n\nBut they will also frame the repeal vote as a political stunt, taking Congress's time away from job-creating legislation. A video to be released Monday will use Speaker John A. Boehner's oft-repeated phrase, \"Mr. President, where are the jobs?\" to mock the repeal exercise.\n\n\"There\u2019s a strong sense that we don\u2019t want to carry on this fight, over and over,\" said former Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia, a Democrat who is running for the Senate. \"Let\u2019s move on.\"\n\nFor Republicans in solidly conservative districts\u2014a majority of Republicans in the House\u2014the repeal vote is a no-cost way to energize the base and prove to angry constituents that the fight has not ended.\n\nRepresentative Patrick McHenry, a Republican from western North Carolina, spoke of \"fire and passion for repeal\" still seething in his district. \"Activist and average folks regularly bring up full repeal,\" he said. \"They\u2019re still keenly aware of it, demand it and understand this law is holding back economic growth.\"\n\nHowever, Republican campaign consultants are more cautious. Those voters are already energized by the prospect of voting against President Obama in November. How a rehashing of the health care debate will affect independent voters is less clear.\n\nDemocrats are driving the narrative that voters are ready to move on. Dan Maffei, a former House Democrat from upstate New York who is campaigning to get his seat back, is using the Supreme Court's decision to push the debate toward improving the health care law he helped pass, not whether it should stay or go. To him, another vote\u2014the 30th this Congress has held to repeal or partially repeal the law\u2014is more evidence of the rut Washington is in.\n\n\"They\u2019re stuck in this eternal recurrence, rerunning the debate on the bill over and over again instead of moving forward,\" Mr. Maffei said.",
    " Title: Union City, New Jersey: The Enduring Legacy of the \"Embroidery Capital of the World\"\n\nArticle:\n\nUnion City, New Jersey, a one-square-mile city with a rich industrial history, has survived the decline of its once-thriving embroidery industry, earning it the title of the \"Embroidery Capital of the World.\" Despite the city's close proximity to New York City and its bustling metropolitan area, it remains largely unnoticed by many passersby.\n\nThe city's transformation into an embroidery hub began at the turn of the 20th century, driven by its geological advantages and proximity to New York's shipping harbors. Union City welcomed immigrants from various European countries, including the Swiss, Germans, Italians, and Irish, and later, Cubans and a diverse array of Latin American communities.\n\nEmbroidery was not the only industry in Union City; breweries, industrial material manufacturers, a giant soap factory, and numerous other goods populated the North Jersey factory ecosystem. However, the city's unique social fabric was woven by the embroidery industry, which brought workers together and created a vibrant, interconnected community.\n\nUnionization in Union City was a gradual process, with the city becoming a hotbed of union activity in the early 1900s. The Teamsters union, which has a legendary reputation for its alleged role in the mysterious disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa, still maintains a presence in the city.\n\nThe collapse of the embroidery industry in Union City, like many other American factory towns, was accelerated by globalization and the implementation of trade agreements such as NAFTA. The city, however, managed to adapt and thrive, with small businesses, New York jobs, and an aggressive push by the municipal government filling the void left by the embroidery industry.\n\nToday, a few embroidery businesses still operate in Union City, producing silk and lace. This is the story of a city that has survived economically following the destruction of its core industry, yet not without loss\u2014the city has lost a critical cultural institution due to business decisions made far beyond its control.\n\nUnion City's story serves as a testament to the resilience of communities faced with the economic consequences of globalization and federal policies. It is a reminder of the far-reaching impact of decisions made at the federal and global level, even when local politicians act in good faith. Yet, it is not a tragedy, nor a rebuke of the local government for growing in the face of external pressures. The alternative was destitution, regression to a ghost town, a fate Union City narrowly escaped in the aftermath of World War II.",
    " Title: Federal Reserve Expected to Raise Federal Funds Rate, Impact on Economy and Stock Prices Discussed\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Reserve is anticipated to increase the federal funds rate following its two-day meeting on Wednesday. This move, which has not occurred since the financial crisis in 2008, could potentially increase the cost of mortgages, slow job creation, and curb stock prices, but not always.\n\nThe impact of the Fed's tightening largely depends on whether a higher federal funds rate causes an increase in the 10-year Treasury rate. Rates on mortgages, corporate, and municipal bonds generally follow the 10-year Treasury rate up and down.\n\nDuring Ben Bernanke's tenure when the federal funds rate was raised in 2004-2006, those rates remained relatively stable due to the Chinese government's rapid purchase of U.S. bonds to keep the yuan cheap against the dollar. Currently, both the Chinese and European economies are experiencing troubles, and their monetary authorities are printing money to lower borrowing costs. This increased purchasing of U.S. securities by private investors seeking safer and better returns could limit any increase in U.S. long rates.\n\nHousehold balance sheets are in their best shape since the recovery began, and lower gasoline prices provide consumers with more disposable income. These factors should offset the effects of marginally higher short-term interest rates on consumer spending, and economic growth is expected to accelerate to 2.5 to 3 percent in the New Year.\n\nBank fees and car loans will become more expensive due to tighter banking regulations and higher short-term borrowing rates for banks. Banks may attempt to increase fees on checking accounts and other services, and charge higher rates for short-term credit, such as credit cards, car loans, and home improvements. However, banks may also start competing more for deposits and pay higher rates on 1 to 5-year CDs.\n\nThe stronger dollar and lower oil prices are impacting corporate profits, and hiring has slowed this year to about 210,000 new jobs a month\u2014less than the 260,000 monthly average in 2014. Small businesses, a significant source of new jobs in an economic recovery, have already faced tighter federal regulations that have led large banks to curtail lending to these entities. Slightly higher short rates are not likely to have a significant additional impact on their access to credit.\n\nFinding a job remains challenging for the long-term unemployed, whose skills may have atrophied during the Great Recession and slow recovery. Government benefits, such as expanded Medicaid and food stamps for healthy men, have often overshadowed incentives to reskill.\n\nOverall, if Beijing can implement an adequate stimulus program to stabilize its economy, the global economy will not sink America's boat, and job gains will continue. Once gasoline prices have bottomed, overall inflation will rise to about 2 percent.\n\nProblems in China and shifts in the broader global economy have caused equity prices to fluctuate recently. However, the Fed rate increase is widely anticipated and is likely already built into equity prices. The market is more likely to react positively to a rate increase simply because uncertainty about timing has been removed.\n\nThe economy has emerged from a tough recession and slow recovery in which the Fed deemed ultra-low interest rates necessary. However, conditions have improved, and in past decades, stock prices have often moved up even as the Fed raised interest rates. This remains a good time to be in stocks, and if you are an investor on the sidelines, gradually start buying in.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Blocks Enforcement of Strict New Asylum Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court has blocked the Trump administration from immediately enforcing a strict new asylum policy in a 5-4 decision. This marks the second legal setback this week for efforts to tighten immigration rules.\n\nThe court, in a brief written order, denied a bid to begin enforcing an asylum ban for any immigrants who illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border. The decision leaves in place lower-court rulings that blocked the administration from automatically denying asylum to people who do not go through official border crossings.\n\nAn open-ended nationwide injunction on enforcement issued by a San Francisco-based federal judge this week prompted the Justice Department to seek immediate relief from the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts provided the critical vote against the administration, siding with the four liberal justices. Newly confirmed Justice Brett Kavanaugh and three other conservatives on the bench sided with the administration, the order said.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, despite having surgery in New York on Friday to remove cancerous nodules in her lung, apparently voted with the majority, avoiding a 4-4 tie.\n\nThe current legal challenge originated in California, where the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also recently ruled against the administration and said the policy was likely \u201cinconsistent\u201d with existing law.\n\nTrump has said he was acting in response to caravans of migrants making their way to the border. The Supreme Court order comes after a federal judge in a separate case took the extraordinary step this week of ordering that asylum seekers who sued after their deportation be returned to the U.S. to have their claims heard anew.\n\nU.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, in doing so, blocked policies that could prevent immigrants who claim to have suffered gang violence or domestic abuse in their home countries from seeking asylum. The White House said in response that Wednesday's ruling \"will further overwhelm our immigration courts with meritless cases, making the existing massive backlog even worse.\"\n\nDespite setbacks in the courts, the administration is moving forward with other changes. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced Thursday that the U.S. has secured an agreement with Mexico so that immigrants claiming asylum will be returned to Mexico as their cases are processed\u2014a bid to end the practice known as \u201ccatch-and-release.\u201d Nielsen made the announcement at a House Judiciary Committee hearing, telling the committee that the goal is to crack down on migrants falsely claiming asylum, only to be released into the U.S. and escape the radar of immigration officials.\n\n\"But by the time the courts have issued their orders, most of these illegal aliens have vanished within our country for good,\" she said. \"They have escaped the law, undermined the system, and made it harder for us to actually help real asylum-seekers by flooding the system with false claims.\"",
    " Title: Senator Chris Van Hollen Proposes Motion for Supreme Court Chief Justice to Decide on Witnesses in Impeachment Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) has announced plans to make a motion on Friday that would require Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to decide whether the Senate will hear from witnesses in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. In a statement, Van Hollen stated, \"A fair trial includes documents and witnesses. In a fair trial, the judge determines what evidence is admitted. My motion ensures the Chief Justice will serve the same role as a judge in any trial across our country \u2013 to allow the Senate access to the facts they need to get to the truth.\"\n\nThe motion, according to Van Hollen, would require the Chief Justice to subpoena witnesses and documents if he determines they are likely to provide evidence relevant to the articles of impeachment. It would also require the Chief Justice to rule on any executive privilege, to prevent efforts by the Administration to stonewall and delay access to the facts.\n\nVan Hollen stated that the motion is consistent with Senate rules and could pass with a majority vote, and would preserve the right of the Senate to overrule the Chief Justice if the majority disagrees. He added, \"No Republican can question the fairness of this approach \u2013 the Chief Justice oversees the highest court in our land and was nominated by a Republican President.\"\n\nThe senator further stated, \"Given his authority to rule on questions of privilege, they should not fear a drawn-out process. I urge my colleagues to seek out truth and the facts and to vote in support of my motion. Anything else constitutes an effort to hide the truth.\"\n\nDemocrats have repeatedly argued that hearing from witnesses will clear up the air on the president's so-called wrongdoing. Two of the main people they want to hear from are former National Security Adviser John Bolton and Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nRepublicans have argued that any witnesses should have been called in the House. When these officials were slapped with Congressional subpoenas, the White House invoked executive privilege. Instead of waiting for the courts to rule whether or not these officials' testimony was a matter of national security, Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed full steam ahead. She admitted that the courts could \"take a very long time\" to make a determination.",
    " Title: Obama Proposes College Ranking Plan Based on Work-Ready Skills, Sparks Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama recently embarked on a two-day bus tour of schools, advocating for a new plan to rank colleges that rely on federal funding. The proposal, which has received mixed reactions, aims to evaluate institutions based on metrics such as the percentage of students who complete their education and the earnings of graduates. The objective is to facilitate the flow of federal aid to colleges with higher rankings, particularly those with lower tuition rates.\n\nOne of the criticisms leveled against the Obama plan is that it may not address the primary concern of the modern job market: employers' skepticism towards college credentials. The issue is not merely grade inflation, although it is a significant concern, with the percentage of A's given by teachers nearly tripling in recent decades. Instead, today's employers are seeking graduates with a set of cognitive skills suitable for a rapidly changing global economy.\n\nThese skills, often referred to as competency-based learning, encompass critical thinking, problem-solving, quantitative reasoning, and the ability to critique arguments. In essence, graduates should possess the ability to ask the right questions for creative solutions in competitive businesses.\n\nA graduate's grade-point average, primarily based on discipline-specific information, may not necessarily indicate a good thinker. Nor does graduating from a highly ranked school. A 2011 study titled \"Academically Adrift\" by Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa found that at least 45 percent of college students showed little or no improvement in critical-thinking skills after their first two years in college.\n\nThis could explain why 57 percent of Americans told Pew pollsters last year that colleges fail to provide students with good value for the money. Additionally, a 2010 survey by the Association of American Colleges and Universities found that only 1 in 4 employers believes colleges prepare students for the global economy.\n\nIf lawmakers aim to assist colleges, students, and employers in the education sector, they should consider objective scorecards that measure a graduate's work-ready skills. These tests offer an alternative credential for graduates to present to potential employers. They also help hold colleges and universities accountable for the quality of their teaching.\n\nOne of the most promising tests is the Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA+), produced by the New York-based nonprofit research organization Council for Aid to Education. The CLA+ offers a credible benchmark on an individual's ability to \"access, structure, and use information.\" The test costs $35 and takes approximately 90 minutes to complete.\n\nSeveral states have already tied government aid for colleges to such tests and other measures of \"learning outcomes.\" Additionally, a few hundred colleges plan to administer the CLA+ tests this year. The tests also provide a means for students who take free or for-profit online courses to earn a credible credential for employment.\n\nAdvanced economies that rely on innovation require advanced thinkers, or those adept at higher-order skills such as perception and creativity. Mr. Obama and Congress should consider changing the meaning and purpose of the college degree by focusing on the development of these skills.",
    " Title: McConnell's Decision to Alter Supreme Court Nomination Rules Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is pursuing a controversial move to change the rules for Supreme Court nominations, potentially ending the use of the filibuster for such appointments. This decision comes in response to Democratic opposition to the confirmation of President Trump's nominee, Neil Gorsuch.\n\nDuring an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" McConnell stated that if Democrats had been in power, they would not have filled a Republican president's vacancy. He did not confirm whether Republicans would unilaterally change the Senate rules via the \"nuclear option\" to confirm Gorsuch.\n\nAdam Jentleson, a former deputy chief of staff to Senator Harry Reid, wrote in a New York Times op-ed that McConnell's relentless opposition to President Obama's policies led to Reid's decision to end the filibuster on lower court nominees. McConnell's actions, according to Jentleson, included arm-twisting his fellow Republicans to obstruct Obama's policies, regardless of their substance.\n\nThis approach extended to the Affordable Care Act, where McConnell reportedly pressured his Republican colleagues to refuse cooperation with Democrats, arguing that a bipartisan bill would be perceived as acceptable by the public.\n\nCritics argue that McConnell's actions embody a \"party before country\" philosophy that contributed to the election of President Trump. If McConnell invokes the \"nuclear option,\" it would be a significant shift in Senate procedure and could further polarize an already divided Senate.",
    " Title: Clinton Invokes Sanders' Rhetoric on Income Inequality, Declines to Release Wall Street Speech Transcripts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of her victory in the New York primary, securing her near-assured nomination as the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton adopted a tone reminiscent of her rival, Bernie Sanders, during a \"Good Morning America\" Town Hall. Clinton and Sanders, she stated, share a common goal of addressing income inequality, raising the minimum wage, and regulating financial institutions.\n\n\"Senator Sanders and I both want to tackle inequality,\" Clinton said. \"We want to raise the minimum wage. We want to make sure that people who are putting our economy at risk are reined in, regulated.\"\n\nHowever, Clinton's stance on income inequality has been a subject of criticism, particularly from the left, due to her past highly-paid speeches to financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, during her tenure as Secretary of State. The content of these speeches remains private, and Sanders has called on Clinton to release them. Clinton has declined to do so.\n\nWhen asked about the new demand to disclose transcripts of her speeches, Clinton responded, \"When everybody agrees to do that, I will as well. Because I think it's important we all abide by the same standard.\"\n\nClinton defended her decision to give speeches after leaving the Secretary of State office, citing her unique perspective and the interest in her insights on global affairs. She compared herself to other former secretaries of state, such as Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, who have also given speeches post-office.\n\n\"When you leave the secretary of state office, people from all perspectives want to know, 'What do you think's going on in the world?' I think that's actually a useful conversation,\" Clinton said. \"Like all my predecessors, I gave speeches to a wide variety of groups, and it was predominantly about what's going on in the world.\"",
    " Title: House Republicans Delay August Recess as Border Security Bill Faces Uncertain Future\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House of Representatives is facing a delay in their August recess as they scramble to pass a border security bill. The chaotic situation unfolded on Thursday, with House leadership suddenly pulling their legislation from the House floor due to flagging support. A meeting is scheduled for Friday morning at 9 a.m. to discuss a potential path forward, but plans are subject to change at any moment.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Majority Whip Steve Scalise heard from numerous Republicans during a Thursday afternoon meeting who did not want to leave Washington without a bill passing. Representative Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.) expressed his willingness to stay \"till the cows come home.\"\n\nHowever, the votes in support of the original $ 659 million border bill have been dwindling, and it remains unclear if Scalise, who is the new GOP whip, will be able to regain support for the package. The political impact of this decision is not yet clear, but if the House does not vote, Democrats will be able to say that the GOP left Washington for an entire month without passing legislation to address the influx of migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe challenges facing the House bill were evident earlier Thursday, as hard-right conservatives indicated that they were still not appeased by the last-minute offer of a vote on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in exchange for moving forward on the border funding bill. This bloc demanded tougher border-security and immigration provisions in the supplemental package, as well as the inclusion of language rolling back DACA in the funding bill.\n\nMore than 57,000 unaccompanied children, mostly from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, have been apprehended at the southern border since October, exhausting government resources and leading federal agencies to warn that they will begin running out of money in August to deal with the crisis. The House bill would have provided funds for the border, revised a 2008 anti-trafficking law, and called for bolstering National Guard presence on the border.\n\nThe White House criticized the House's plan after leaders tacked on the DACA vote. The deferral program, announced by President Barack Obama in June 2012 during his reelection bid, has protected more than 550,000 young undocumented immigrants who grew up in the United States from deportation and provided work permits. However, Republicans have blamed DACA for contributing to the current crisis on the border, arguing that it sends a message to children from abroad that they, too, could be allowed to stay here lawfully.\n\nCORRECTION: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this piece misstated the cost of the border bill.\nCORRECTION: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this piece misstated the cost of the border bill.",
    " Title: Sanders Narrows Gap with Clinton in California Ahead of Primary Election\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Tuesday's primary election in California approaches, the campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining momentum, with the candidate inching closer to an upset victory over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. According to Real Clear Politics, Clinton currently holds an overall average lead of 10.8 points over Sanders, but in California, that lead narrows significantly, with Sanders trailing Clinton by 4.7 points overall and by just two points in two recent polls. In one recent poll reported on Friday, Sanders led Clinton by one point.\n\nThe Sanders campaign is citing a potential win in the most populous state as a reason to continue their bid, as they believe a victory will encourage superdelegates who currently support Clinton to switch their allegiances. Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, told MSNBC on Friday, \"The truth of the matter is, there are hundreds and hundreds of Clinton's so-called superdelegates who announced their support for her before there was a race, before we have seen all these recent and consistent polls.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump's campaign is keeping a close eye on the ongoing battle. Sam Clovis, Trump's national co-chairman and chief policy adviser, commented to Fox News on Friday that Sanders is \"right over her shoulder,\" and Clinton is making a drastic pivot to the left as a result.\n\nEven with a decisive win in California, it's unlikely that Sanders will be able to catch Clinton, as California is not a winner-take-all delegates race, and its 475 delegates are awarded proportionally. Clinton only needs 256 pledged delegates to clinch the nomination, meaning the superdelegates would not play a significant role. There are 763 pledged delegates still available between now and the Tuesday primaries in California and five other states, meaning Clinton needs to secure just one out of every three delegates. This means she can secure the nomination even before California's polls close on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, if Sanders defeats Clinton, Republicans could use her loss to depict her as a flawed general election candidate, and Sanders could use the victory to stay in the race through the July convention, forcing Clinton to fight a two-front battle for a longer period than she had anticipated. Sanders has been campaigning hard in California since May 17, and Clinton has also opted to spend the last few days in the state, including with a headline-making speech in San Diego where she criticized Trump's foreign policy.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Allows Indiana to Enforce Fetal Remains Disposal, Rejects Abortion Restrictions Based on Race, Sex, or Disability\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States decided on Tuesday to allow a provision of an Indiana law that requires the burial or cremation of fetal remains to take effect, while blocking a more controversial provision that would prohibit abortions motivated solely by race, sex, or disability. The court's decision not to take up the more contentious provision suggests a reluctance to challenge the core abortion precedents of Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe law, signed in March 2016 by then-Indiana Governor Mike Pence, was blocked last year from going into effect by the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals. Pence's office did not respond to CNN's request for comment on Tuesday. In a pair of tweets, the vice president defended his signing of the law three years ago, saying in one tweet that he was \"proud\" to support the measure and calling the high court's decision \"a victory for life!\"\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, in a concurring opinion, argued that the court should revisit the issue of abortion rights, stating that the Constitution is silent on abortion and that the court is \"duty bound to address its scope.\" Thomas also wrote extensively about the history of eugenics, suggesting that laws like Indiana's are necessary to prevent abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics.\n\nNo other justice, including Thomas's four fellow conservatives who are seen as backing more restrictive access to abortions, joined him in his opinion. Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said Thomas's opinion does not necessarily indicate the court will immediately take up the issue.\n\n\"Although Justice Thomas argues that the court will soon have to take up the issue it ducked today, I think it's telling that none of the other conservative justices -- John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh -- joined his separate opinion,\" Vladeck said. \"It's quite possible that Thomas's opinion is therefore less a prediction of where the court is likely to go than an aspiration.\"\n\nThe court also declined to take up the more controversial provision of the Indiana law, which would prohibit abortions based on the race, sex, or disability of the fetus. In his decision last year, Judge William Bauer wrote that provisions in the law that bar women from seeking abortions in certain cases \"clearly violate\" well-established Supreme Court precedent and are therefore unconstitutional.\n\nThe law requires that fetal remains be disposed of in the same manner as other human remains (i.e., burial and cremation), and the state can prohibit abortion that is solely motivated by the race, sex, or disability of the fetus. The law has been blocked from going into effect by lower courts. Indiana's attorney general, Curtis Hill Jr., said the language \"expands on long-established legal and cultural traditions of recognizing the dignity and humanity of the fetus.\"",
    " Title: Congressional Disapproval of Iran Nuclear Deal Does Not Hinder President Obama's Implementation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming vote in Congress regarding the Iranian nuclear deal is shaping up as a warning to Europe against resuming business with Tehran before the next U.S. president is elected. Despite strong bipartisan disapproval, President Obama is expected to implement the agreement, as he has broad executive authority to ease many sanctions on Iran by himself.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid, the highest-profile Democrat to endorse the deal, has stated that he will attempt to sway other members of his party. However, clear bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate are lining up against the deal.\n\nPresident Obama, acting on his own, can delist Iranian banks, commercial entities, and individuals targeted for sanctions. He can also order the Treasury Department to give out licenses allowing financial and commercial transactions with Iranian businesses. The president could provide sanctions relief for Iranian oil exports by treating legislation passed by Congress in 2012 as unconstitutional.\n\nSection 1245 of the National Defense Authorization Act required the president to freeze assets of Iranian banks, including the Central Bank of Iran, and aimed to reduce Iranian oil revenue by imposing sanctions on foreign banks that carry out \"significant financial transactions\" with the central bank. However, President Obama issued a \"signing statement\" on Section 1245 when he approved the overall legislation, stating that he could treat that section as nonbinding because it \"would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations.\"\n\n\"He would challenge Republicans to fight him in the courts,\" said Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a critic of the agreement. \"He would essentially just circumvent that statutory designation and provide significant sanctions relief.\"\n\nPresident Obama will continue to make his case for the Iranian deal on Friday when he addresses Jewish organizations and takes questions in a webcast. In addition to Senator Reid, the White House has picked up the support of Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, after President Obama wrote a letter to the lawmaker offering specific assurances that the U.S. would \"take whatever means are necessary\" to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, including possible military action.\n\nWhile the president was on vacation, more lawmakers announced which way they will vote when Congress takes up the Iran agreement in mid-September. So far, 29 senators, including two Democrats, are voting against the agreement. Twenty-six senators are supporting it, with 45 uncommitted, but it's almost a certainty that all 54 Republican senators will vote against the deal.\n\nIn the House, 225 lawmakers\u2014including 16 Democrats\u2014have announced that they would vote against the deal, according to a tally compiled by the Bipartisan Policy Center. There are 69 House lawmakers in favor of the deal so far, and 140 are uncommitted.\n\nDespite the opposition, lawmakers would need to muster a two-thirds majority vote in the House and the Senate to override President Obama's expected veto of the Iran resolution. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, has said a veto override is unlikely.\n\nHowever, the ultimate size of the vote against the agreement will influence European governments and industries about the prospects of U.S. policymakers seeking a tougher deal after President Obama leaves office. European leaders and business chiefs \"would be reticent to rush back in if there was a resounding vote of disapproval,\" said Mr. Dubowitz. \"They would want to know what the next president is going to do before they found themselves on the wrong end of an enforcement action.\"",
    " Title: Liberal Journalists' Definition of 'Fake News' Sparks Controversy and Concerns of Censorship\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Donald Trump's election victory last month, a debate on the concept of 'fake news' has intensified among liberal journalists. The term has been used to explain the disconnect between political journalists and the general public, with some blaming it for the perceived disconnect. However, there seems to be a lack of consensus on a consistent definition of 'fake news.'\n\nSome liberal journalists have included legitimate news organizations, such as Independent Journal Review (IJR) and The Blaze, under the 'fake news' umbrella alongside objectively false sites that generate viral hoaxes. This practice has been criticized for misleading the public and serving a particular narrative.\n\nFor instance, BuzzFeed News, a left-leaning news organization, has been accused of misleading the public with its coverage of 'fake news,' including stories about hoax websites run by teenagers in Macedonia pushing lies like \"Pope Francis endorses Donald Trump.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other left-leaning news organizations have lumped legitimate news organizations alongside objectively false sources. A list of 'fake news' sites compiled by a liberal college professor, which was uncritically accepted and distributed by some liberal journalists, included top right-of-center sites like IJR and The Blaze.\n\nThe Washington Post labeled one website as 'fake news' without providing any evidence, a move that has led to a potential defamation lawsuit. The website, which was included on a similar list, argues that it is a legitimate news source.\n\nSome liberal journalists have argued that 'conservative news' and 'fake news' are the same thing. This argument has been criticized for conflating legitimate news organizations with objectively false sites.\n\nThe debate has raised concerns that the crackdown on 'fake news' sites, the actual influence of which remains unknown, could be used by liberals to censor their conservative competitors. Some argue that this could lead to government control over First Amendment-protected speech or increased censorship by social media platforms.\n\nIn an interview with a conservative site, Media Research Center director of media analysis Tim Graham warned, \"The danger here is that when liberals try to define 'fake news,' it can be defined as 'fake angles,' as in 'things that should not be explored,' like paying for protesters.\"\n\nConservative website The Daily Wire was listed as 'fake news' without justification, leading to concerns that the 'fake news' label is being used to censor conservative viewpoints.\n\nThe debate over 'fake news' and its definition continues, with some arguing for a more nuanced approach to distinguish between legitimate news organizations and objectively false sites, while others see it as a tool for censorship.",
    " Title: Over 250 Foreign Students Arrested in Sting Operation at Fake Detroit University\n\n Article:\n\n About 90 additional foreign students at a university in metro Detroit, revealed to be a creation of the Department of Homeland Security, have been arrested in recent months. This brings the total number of students arrested on immigration violations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to approximately 250 since January.\n\n The university, known as the University of Farmington, marketed itself as offering graduate programs in technology and computer studies. The students, mostly from India, had arrived legally in the U.S. on student visas but lost their immigration status when the University of Farmington was shut down in January. The school was staffed with undercover agents posing as university officials.\n\n Out of the approximately 250 students arrested on administrative charges, \"nearly 80% were granted voluntary departure and departed the United States,\" the Detroit office of ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) told the Free Press in a statement Tuesday.\n\n Of the remaining 20%, about half have received a final order of removal; some were ordered removed by an immigration judge, and others \"were given an expedited removal by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\" HSI Detroit said the remaining 10% \"have either filed for some sort of relief or are contesting their removals with Executive Office for Immigration Review.\"\n\n ICE said in March that 161 students had been arrested, a number that has now grown to about 250. Meanwhile, seven of the eight recruiters who were criminally charged with trying to recruit students have pleaded guilty and been sentenced in Detroit. The remaining defendant will be sentenced in January.\n\n Attorneys for the students arrested said they were unfairly trapped by the U.S. government since the Department of Homeland Security had said on its website that the university was legitimate. An accreditation agency that was working with the U.S. on its sting operation also listed the university as legitimate.\n\n More than 600 students were enrolled at the university, which was created a few years ago by federal law enforcement officials with ICE. Records filed with the state Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs show that the University of Farmington was incorporated in January 2016.\n\n Many of the students had enrolled with the university through a program known as Curricular Practical Training, which allows students to work in the U.S through a F-1 visa program for foreign students. Some had transferred to the University of Farmington from other schools that had lost accreditation, which means they would no longer be allowed to remain in the U.S.\n\n Emails obtained by the Free Press this year showed how the fake university attracted students to the school, which cost about $12,000 on average in tuition and fees per year.\n\n \"They preyed upon on them,\" said Rahul Reddy, a Texas attorney who represented or advised some of the students arrested. \"They trapped the vulnerable people who just wanted to maintain (legal immigration) status.\"\n\n The fake university is believed to have collected millions of dollars from the unsuspecting students. No one has filed a lawsuit or claim against the U.S. government for collecting the money or for allegedly entrapping the students.\n\n Attorneys for ICE and the Department of Justice maintain that the students should have known it was not a legitimate university because it did not have classes in a physical location. Some CPT programs have classes combined with work programs at companies.\n\n \"Their true intent could not be clearer,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Brandon Helms wrote in a sentencing memo this month for one of the eight recruiters. \"While 'enrolled' at the University, one hundred percent of the foreign citizen students never spent a single second in a classroom. If it were truly about obtaining an education, the University would not have been able to attract anyone, because it had no teachers, classes, or educational services.\"\n\n In the memo, federal prosecutor Baker said the case raises questions about the U.S. \"foreign-student visa program.\"\n\n Baker wrote that \"immigration and visa programs have been hot-button topics in the United States for years and national scrutiny has only been increasing.\"\n\n Reddy said, though, that in some cases, students who transferred from the University of Farmington after realizing they didn't have classes on-site, were still arrested.\n\n Detroit ICE spokesman Khaalid Walls said the recruiters sentenced so far include Barath Kakireddy, 29, of Lake Mary, Florida, 18 months; Suresh Kandala, 31, of Culpeper, Virginia, 18 months; Santosh Sama, 28, of Fremont, California, 24 months; Avinash Thakkallapally, 28, of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 15 months; Aswanth Nune, 26, of Atlanta, 12 months; Naveen Prathipati, 26, of Dallas, 12 months. Phanideep Karnati, 35, of Louisville, Kentucky, is to be sentenced in January.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Email Use as Secretary of State Posed National Security Threat, Report Suggests\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report by the State Department's Inspector General has revealed that Hillary Clinton's decision to use a personal email system while serving as Secretary of State in 2009 posed a significant threat to national security. The report, released last week, details multiple warnings issued to Clinton and her staff regarding cybersecurity threats, yet Clinton continued to use her personal email for sensitive State Department business.\n\nThe first warning came in January 2011, when hackers attempted to breach Clinton's private server. The staffer responsible for maintaining the server notified State Department officials, and Clinton's top aides advised against discussing sensitive matters via email.\n\nIn March 2011, the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security sent a memorandum on cybersecurity threats directly to Clinton, warning of an increase in efforts to compromise the private home email accounts of senior department officials. The memo also stated that some personal email accounts had already been compromised and were being used to forward emails to hackers.\n\nIn May 2011, Clinton herself suspected a hacking incident after receiving a suspicious email link. Hours later, she received another email with a suspect link from the personal account of the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs.\n\nA month later, the State Department sent a cable to all diplomatic and consular posts, advising against conducting official business from personal email accounts. The cable was signed by Hillary Clinton.\n\nThese warnings, issued over a six-month period, should have alerted any responsible public official to the national security risks associated with insecure email communications. However, Clinton and several of her top aides continued to use personal email for thousands of instances of sensitive State Department business.\n\nWhile Clinton is under potential criminal investigation by the FBI for mishandling classified material sent through her email, she has remained silent during the investigation. This silence may be in her best interests and is within her rights. However, to become President, she will need to convince voters that she can prioritize the national security of the United States over her personal self-interest.\n\nIt is clear that Clinton broke the rules regarding email usage while serving as Secretary of State. The question now remains whether she also broke the law.\n\nThis editorial represents the opinions of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Editorial Board, separate from the news staff. Most editorials include an opposing view, a unique feature of \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nAfter this editorial was published, CNN's Jake Tapper asked Clinton to respond to the Editorial Board's criticism. Clinton stated that it was \"obvious\" that she has always put national security above personal self-interest.",
    " Title: Homeland Security Reveals High Rate of Visa Overstays, Critics Call It a National Security Concern\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a hearing held by the Senate's immigration subcommittee on Wednesday, Homeland Security officials disclosed that approximately 527,127 individuals overstayed their visas in 2015, representing 1.17% of the 45 million temporary visas issued for business and tourist travelers during the same period. This revelation has sparked criticism from lawmakers who view it as a significant loophole in immigration enforcement and national security.\n\nThe report, which is more than a decade overdue and incomplete, does not cover major visa categories for students or guest workers, both of which are likely to have higher overstay rates. The government deported only about 2,500 visa overstays last year, and has only about 3,000 active cases, accounting for a small fraction of the problem.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions (Alabama Republican and chairman of the immigration subcommittee) stated, \"This is the way the system gets eroded. This is where public confidence is being destroyed. This is how we\u2019re sending a message to the world that you can get away with it.\"\n\nAmong those who overstayed are thousands from countries with connections to terrorism: 219 from Afghanistan, 681 from Iraq, 564 from Iran, 56 from Libya, 1,435 from Pakistan, 440 from Syria, and 219 from Yemen in fiscal year 2015 alone.\n\nCraig C. Healy, assistant director of National Security Investigations at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, noted that individuals who overstay are unlikely to be prioritized for investigation unless they are deemed national security threats, serious criminals, or meet the secretary's priorities.\n\nThe high rate of overstays, coupled with the surge of Central Americans coming across the southwest border, likely means the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. is rising. The government is struggling with how to measure who has left the country, as there is still no biometric exit system, and the government relies on passenger information from airlines to complete its checks.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called for a solution, particularly after Congress recently dedicated $1 billion from visa fees to be spent on the problem. John Wagner, deputy assistant commissioner at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, stated that the hiccup is in trying to find a way to do the checks without disrupting international travel at airports.\n\nJessica Vaughan, policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies, expressed concern about the high rate of overstays in visitors from visa-waiver countries, with nearly 3% of visitors from Greece overstaying, and the worst offenders being regular visa countries such as Djibouti and Bhutan, where about a quarter of all visitors overstayed in 2015.\n\nTourist and business visas are supposed to be issued only to those who appear to have ties to their home countries and are likely to return. Japan had one of the best compliance rates, with only a fifth of a percent of the more than 3 million visitors in 2015 breaking the terms of their visas. Vatican City was among the best, with all 22 of its citizens who came on tourist or business visas leaving by the time their passes expired.",
    " Title: 3D-Printed Gun Blueprints Released Early Amid Legal Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nThe blueprints for 3D-printed guns, initially scheduled for public release on Wednesday following a U.S. Justice Department ruling, were made available four days early on the Defense Distributed website. The designs for nine types of guns were downloaded thousands of times before multi-state legal action was filed to block the release.\n\nThe controversy surrounding 3D-printed guns began in 2013 when Cody Wilson, a self-styled crypto-anarchist, showcased the world's first 3D-printed gun. Files detailing the process were immediately uploaded to the Defense Distributed website and downloaded hundreds of thousands of times. This led to the U.S. State Department ordering the files to be removed from the internet.\n\nA four-year legal battle ensued, with Defense Distributed joining forces with the Second Amendment Foundation, an organization that defends the right to own guns, to sue the State Department. In a surprise move last month, Defense Distributed won its case, with the U.S. Justice Department ruling that Americans may \"access, discuss, use, and reproduce\" the technical data.\n\nThis decision led to a backlash from lawmakers, and on Monday, Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced that it would be suing the State Department \"to stop the illegal distribution of 3D printed guns\" on behalf of eight U.S. states. In a statement, Mr. Ferguson said, \"These downloadable guns are unregistered and very difficult to detect, even with metal detectors, and will be available to anyone regardless of age, mental health, or criminal history.\"\n\nThe State Department had already received a letter asking it to reinstate its ban, signed by 21 attorneys general from states including California, Massachusetts, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The letter stated, \"As the chief law enforcement officers of our states, we believe the settlement terms and proposed rules are deeply dangerous and could have an unprecedented impact on public safety.\"\n\n\"In addition to helping arm terrorists and transnational criminals, the settlement and proposed rules would provide another path to gun ownership for people who are prohibited by federal and state law from possessing firearms,\" the letter continued.\n\nMr. Wilson has celebrated his victory as the beginning of \"the age of the downloadable gun.\" However, critics are concerned it will result in a significant increase in so-called ghost guns, unregistered weapons that the government is unaware of and unable to trace. Since the legal action began, Defense Distributed has been working on new gun designs and has also created a milling device, known as Ghost Gunner, that can turn parts purchased online into a fully functioning weapon.",
    " Title: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Announces Impeachment Proceedings Against President Trump, but No Violations of Law Identified\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D, California) announced on Thursday that Democrats will draft articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. Pelosi's statement was ominous, suggesting that Trump is acting like an \"oppressive monarch\" or a \"king president.\" She warned, \"If we allow a president to be above the law, we do so surely at the peril of our republic.\"\n\nHowever, it is important to note that President Trump is not above the law, but Democrats have struggled to identify any laws that the president has broken throughout the Ukraine-related impeachment inquiry. In a largely overlooked portion of his testimony, one of the Democrats' star witnesses, Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, stated that the National Security Council found that the 55-day pause in U.S. military aid to Ukraine was lawful.\n\nPresident Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, Ukrainian hacking of DNC computers, and corruption accusations against the Bidens conformed to America's Treaty with Ukraine on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, which was signed by President Clinton in July 1998 and ratified by the Senate in October 2000. The U.S. and Ukraine agreed to \"provide mutual assistance... in connection with the investigation, prosecution, and prevention of offenses, and in proceedings related to criminal matters.\"\n\nThe aid pause was within Trump's responsibility to assure that $391 million did not vanish down a black hole of graft. OMB official Mark Sandy testified that he \"attributed the hold to the President's concern about other countries not contributing money to Ukraine.\" This policy echoed Trump's statements on this matter.\n\nDelays in foreign aid are not uncommon. Ambassador Kurt Volker, who testified before the Intelligence Committee, stated that he had seen holdups of assistance before and assumed it was part of the decision-making process. President Trump withheld $300 million in aid to Pakistan last year for neglecting its anti-terrorism commitments, and Obama chopped aid to Uganda in 2014 after it adopted cruel anti-gay statutes. Human-rights concerns prompted President Carter to slice aid to Argentina, Ethiopia, and Uruguay.\n\nUkraine received its lethal military aid on September 11, 2019. If those funds were unallocated on October 1, that would have been illegal. However, these funds beat the September 30 Fiscal Year-end deadline by 19 days, which some experts argue would not violate the 1974 Budget and Impoundment Control Act.\n\nDespite all the controversy, Ukraine received its lethal military aid before September 30, 2019. Therefore, President Trump obeyed the Impoundment Control Act, too. It is important to note that impeachment is a political, not a legal, process. However, rather than punishing a crime spree, Democrats want to impeach President Trump\u2014for honoring one law, legal opinion, or precedent after another.",

The special, which includes a secret epilogue titled \"The Punchline,\" features Chappelle's controversial views on various topics, including his stance on the allegations against Michael Jackson, his continued use of transphobic jokes, and his defense of fellow comedians Kevin Hart and Louis C.K.\n\nIn the special, Chappelle expresses his belief that Michael Jackson did not molest children, stating, \"Do you know how good it must've felt to go to school the next day after that shit?\" He also makes jokes about being a Chinese person trapped in a Black man's body and uses a racist impression of a Chinese person.\n\nChappelle's comments about the trans community have also drawn criticism. He says, \"I can't stop writing jokes about these niggas,\" referring to trans people. In the Q&A section at the end of the special, Chappelle recounts an incident where a white woman left one of his practice sets, telling him she was raped. Chappelle reportedly responded, \"It's not your fault you were raped. But it's not my fault either. Ta-ta, bitch,\" to which the audience laughed.\n\nThe special has been met with backlash for Chappelle's alleged racist and transphobic remarks, as well as his apparent disregard for the criticism of his comedy style. The special seems to highlight the common accusation that Chappelle is only interested in repairing his relationship with marginalized groups if he doesn't have to change anything about himself.\n\nThroughout his career, Chappelle has been known for his controversial and daring comedy style, including his early-2000s skits about R. Kelly's court trials on \"Chappelle's Show.\" However, with his latest special, Chappelle has chosen to ignore the historic criticism against his style of comedy and new criticism from the trans community, coming off as a defiant rejection of change at any cost. As he continues down this path, the potential cost could be tarnishing his own legacy.",
    " Title: Foxconn Shifts Focus of Wisconsin Campus from Manufacturing to Research Hub\n\nArticle:\n\nElectronics giant Foxconn Technology Group announced on Wednesday that its planned $10 billion Wisconsin campus will primarily serve as a research hub, rather than a blue-collar manufacturing facility as originally intended. The shift in focus has been met with criticism, as the project was initially touted by President Donald Trump as a sign of a resurgence in American manufacturing.\n\nIn a statement, Foxconn said it remains committed to Wisconsin and the creation of 13,000 jobs as promised. However, due to changes in the global market environment, \"this has necessitated the adjustment of plans for all projects.\"\n\nThe move was criticized as a bait-and-switch by some, including Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, a Democrat, who said, \"We were promised manufacturing jobs...And now, it appears Foxconn is living up to their failed track record in the U.S.\u2014leaving another state and community high and dry.\"\n\nEconomic development officials and other supporters of the project urged patience, stating that Foxconn still plans to invest what it promised. The White House had no immediate comment.\n\nFoxconn, a major supplier to Apple, is the world's largest contract maker of electronics. Louis Woo, special assistant to Foxconn's CEO, was quoted as telling Reuters that it is scaling back and possibly shelving plans to build display screens in Wisconsin because \"we can't compete.\"\n\nInstead of a factory, Foxconn wants to create a \"technology hub,\" with about three-quarters of the jobs in research and development and design. Those jobs typically go to college graduates. The plant is under construction and scheduled to open in 2020.\n\nMarc Levine, senior fellow and founding director of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Center of Economic Development, called it \"one enormous bait-and-switch.\" He scoffed at the idea that Foxconn, known for manufacturing, could transform into a research and development giant.\n\n\"That's simply not what Foxconn is,\" Levine said in an email. \"So the notion that there will be 13,000 research jobs at Foxconn is highly, highly unlikely.\"\n\nThe company initially billed the massive 20 million-square-foot (1.86 million-square-meter) Wisconsin complex as its first North American manufacturing site for the next generation of display panels to be used in a wide variety of products, including large-screen TVs, self-driving cars, notebooks, and other monitors.\n\nWisconsin state and local governments promised roughly $4 billion to Foxconn, the richest incentive package in state history and the biggest pledged by a state to a foreign corporation in U.S. history. Foxconn was required to invest $10 billion and create 13,000 jobs to get the full incentives.\n\nIt had already fallen short last year, hiring 178 full-time employees rather than the 260 targeted, and failed to earn a state tax credit worth up to $9.5 million. Former Gov. Scott Walker, the Republican who brokered the deal, emphasized in a tweet Wednesday that Foxconn earns tax credits only for actual investment and job creation. \"No jobs/investment? No credits. Period,\" Walker tweeted.\n\nRepublican legislative leaders who pushed the project blamed new Democratic Gov. Tony Evers for Foxconn's change in plans. They said he had created an air of economic uncertainty by supporting the elimination of a manufacturing tax credit program.\n\nEvers was critical of Foxconn in the campaign against Walker but did not pledge to undo the deal. His top aide Joel Brennan said that the administration was surprised by the news from Foxconn. He did not address the accusations that Evers was to blame.\n\nDemocratic critics said the incentives promised to Foxconn were too rich, and they questioned whether the company would ever fulfill its promises. The president of Wisconsin's Technology Council, Tom Still, said he is not surprised Foxconn wants to change course since televisions are becoming less expensive and iPhone sales are declining.\n\nStill, whose group nurtures technology in Wisconsin, said Foxconn can succeed if the plant becomes more research-oriented because its areas of interest match up with Wisconsin's strengths, such as robotics, medical imaging, and industrial imaging.\n\nLast summer, Trump highlighted his economic policies at a groundbreaking event for the Foxconn complex. \"Made in the USA: It's all happening and it's happening very, very quickly,\" the president said in June after visiting the Foxconn site. \"Today we're seeing the results of the pro-America agenda.\"",
    " Title: Minimum Wage Debate: A Look at the Economic Implications and Constitutional Questions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate surrounding the minimum wage, particularly the push for a nationwide increase to $15 per hour, has sparked discussions about government intervention in the employer-employee relationship. Critics argue that such a move could represent an intrusion by the government into the market, with the government potentially overestimating the value of employees' services compared to employers and employees.\n\nSome contend that the minimum wage hike, if implemented, could be seen as a means for the government to transfer wealth through threats and force. The $15-per-hour figure, they suggest, may be the result of political compromise rather than free market forces or economic realities.\n\nCritics also warn of potential negative economic consequences, including increased unemployment and higher prices for goods and services. They argue that these wealth transfers could negatively affect everyone, with employees whose salaries rise showing gratitude not to their employers but to the politicians who forced the employers to pay them more.\n\nThe debate also touches on constitutional questions. Some argue that the right of an employee to sell labor and an employer to purchase that labor are part of the natural right to exchange goods and services, protected by the Constitution. They claim that the Constitution prohibits the government from interfering with freely entered-into contracts and from taking property without due process.\n\nHowever, critics argue that modern courts have ignored these clauses and allowed the government to interfere in the employer-employee relationship and to take property without due process. They question whether the government's understanding of business, wealth creation, and salary determination is flawed, with the government's mindset being more aligned with control and central planning rather than market-driven competition.\n\nCritics also warn of potential unintended consequences, such as employers reducing their workforce due to increased labor costs, leading to higher unemployment. They argue that the poor may be better off with employment and lower wages, with an opportunity for advancement, than being unemployed and relying on welfare.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate surrounding the minimum wage increase to $15 per hour raises questions about government intervention in the market, constitutional protections, and the potential economic consequences. Critics argue that the government's actions could lead to unintended negative effects, including higher unemployment and increased prices for goods and services. They also question the government's understanding of business and the economy, and the potential for political motivations in minimum wage increases.",
    " Title: Senate Delays Vote on Military Airstrikes in Syria as Opposition Grows\n\nArticle:\n\nThe push by President Barack Obama for congressional approval of military airstrikes in Syria has faced a setback as opposition from senators in both parties has grown, leading to a delay in a procedural vote. Six senators, including five Republicans and one Democrat, announced on Monday they would vote against a resolution authorizing the use of force, indicating the administration's efforts to build bipartisan support have been ineffective.\n\nThe Senate was initially scheduled to vote on Wednesday on a procedural motion to begin formal debate on the resolution, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., announced late Monday the vote would be delayed to give the president more time to make his case to senators and the public.\n\nThe delay comes amid reports that Russia is seeking a deal with Syria to dismantle its chemical weapons program. President Obama, in television interviews on Monday, suggested such a deal could obviate the need for U.S. military intervention, but senators had not been briefed on the development and expressed skepticism.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said, \"I have no idea what's going on. It'd be great if the Russians could convince Assad to turn over his chemical weapons to the international community. That'd be a terrific outcome. I just am very dubious and skeptical.\"\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry's comments made in London on Monday, describing the military effort as \"unbelievably small,\" also raised concerns among lawmakers. Graham stated that Kerry \"undercut everything the president has been doing for the last couple of days\" to build support.\n\nThe rapid succession of senators announcing their opposition on Monday has cast serious doubts on the president's ability to garner the necessary support in either the House or Senate. The GOP-led House is unlikely to take up a resolution unless the Senate can pass it first. A final Senate vote was expected this weekend, but Reid's decision to delay the formal debate has put the schedule in flux.\n\nFive GOP senators, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and Mike Enzi of Wyoming, all announced opposition on Monday, as did Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota.\n\nSen. Heitkamp is the latest in a string of Democratic senators from conservative states to come out in opposition, including Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark. Heitkamp and Manchin are working on an alternative resolution that would give the Assad government 45 days to sign an international chemical weapons ban and begin turning over its chemical weapons before authorizing U.S. military action.\n\nTwo Democratic senators, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, have declared their support. However, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., who voted for the resolution in the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, cautioned on Monday that he preferred pursuing diplomatic solutions.\n\nThe opposition underscores the uphill battle Obama faces on Capitol Hill to rally around his foreign policy agenda. The president will visit separately with Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans on Tuesday before his prime-time television address.\n\nGraham, who supports the resolution, said he believed it could still pass the Senate: \"If the president does a good job tomorrow night, yes.\"",
    " Title: North Korean Delegation Concludes Visit to South Korea, Invitation for Summit Unclear\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea's high-level delegation, led by Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, concluded a three-day visit to South Korea on Sunday. The visit, the highest-ranking to the South, was marked by \"frank and candid\" talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, but no mention of a North Korean invitation for Moon to visit Pyongyang for a summit was made in the North Korean news agency's report.\n\nDuring the visit, South Korean President Moon Jae-in met Kim Yo Jong four times, and the North Korean delegation attended a performance by a North Korean orchestra, the last item on their itinerary before returning home. In a toast during Sunday's dinner, Kim Yo Jong expressed hope to meet \"friendly faces\" in Pyongyang later.\n\nEarlier, South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon had hosted a lunch for the Pyongyang delegation at a five-star hotel. On Saturday, Kim Yo Jong \"courteously\" handed over a personal letter from the North Korean leader to Moon and told him of her brother's \"intention,\" without elaborating on the details.\n\nSouth Korean officials stated that Moon had been invited to Pyongyang to speak with Kim Jong Un during the talks and lunch that Moon hosted at the presidential Blue House in Seoul on Saturday. Such a meeting, if it occurred, would mark the first inter-Korea summit since 2007.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who returned to Washington after attending the opening of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, stated that the United States, South Korea, and Japan were in complete agreement on isolating North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.\n\nLoud applause greeted the appearance of Moon, Kim Yo Jong, and her delegation at the concert, attended by more than a thousand people. The North Korean orchestra will return home on Monday after their second and last performance on Sunday.\n\nNorth Korea's nominal head of state, Kim Yong Nam, a member of the delegation, was seen wiping away tears with his handkerchief and at times clapping enthusiastically during the show.\n\nThe main opposition party in South Korea warned that any talks between the two Koreas where the scrapping of North Korea's nuclear program was not a precondition would only \"benefit the enemy.\" Japanese editorials sounded a similar warning, stating that dialogue would be meaningless unless it led to denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.",
    " Title: USCIS Approved DACA Request for Alleged Murderer Jesus Rangel-Hernandez\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has admitted Jesus Rangel-Hernandez, a North Carolina resident charged with four counts of first-degree murder, despite his previous removal proceedings and alleged gang membership. According to a letter from USCIS to Senator Grassley, Rangel-Hernandez requested deferred action under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in January 2013, while he was in removal proceedings.\n\nAt the time of his DACA request, Rangel-Hernandez was in the United States without being admitted or paroled. He came to the attention of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) due to a 2012 arrest for possession of marijuana, for which charges were subsequently dismissed. ICE records indicate that they were not aware of Rangel-Hernandez's gang membership at the time of the arrest. His DACA request was approved on August 26, 2013, despite a TECS record indicating that he was a known gang member.\n\nAfter the deferred action request was approved, immigration proceedings were administratively closed on December 18, 2013. Rangel-Hernandez was scheduled for deportation but was able to stay in the country due to the DACA approval.\n\nIn February 2015, Rangel-Hernandez allegedly murdered four people in North Carolina. Police in Charlotte-Mecklenburg, N.C., stated in a Wednesday statement that 19-year-old Emmanuel Jesus Rangel-Hernandez has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the death of 19-year-old Mirjana Puhar and two other victims. The victims' bodies were found Tuesday in a Charlotte home, and police did not reveal how they were killed. Rangel-Hernandez is also charged in connection with a murder at a motel Sunday.\n\nNorth Carolina Senators Richard Burr and Thom Tillis have expressed concern over the approval of Rangel-Hernandez's DACA request. Burr stated, \"The flawed implementation of the President's blanket deferred action program has created a loophole that allows dangerous criminals who came here illegally \u2013 even known gang members \u2013 to stay in the country.\" Tillis added, \"The USCIS needs to immediately start performing detailed criminal background checks to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.\"\n\nToday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing examining the Obama administration's Central American Minors Refugee and Parole Program. During the unaccompanied minor crisis last summer, MS-13 gang members were using Border Patrol processing centers as recruitment areas and as a way to easily access the United States.",
    " Title: Senate Tax Overhaul: CBO Report Highlights Redistribution of Resources Toward Upper-Income Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released a report detailing the potential impact of the Senate tax overhaul bill, providing insights into the legislation's effects on various income groups. The report goes beyond analyzing personal income taxes, also considering spending cuts and their impact on the rich and poor.\n\nThe CBO report reveals that the Senate Republicans' bill would disproportionately benefit upper and upper-middle-class Americans, while lower-income groups would face overall losses. The following chart illustrates the net change in taxes per person or family for each income group:\n\n[Insert chart showing net change in taxes per person or family for each income group]\n\nIt is important to note that the wealthy, due to their larger incomes, may receive a larger nominal benefit. However, when the overall effect on each group is divided by the midpoint income for that group, the wealthy gain more relative to their income.\n\nFor instance, Americans earning between $10,000 and $20,000 would see a negligible change, with a loss worth just 0.14% of their income next year. In contrast, Americans earning between $500,000 and $1 million would see a net benefit worth nearly 3% of their income.\n\nFurthermore, the report also considers the population size of each income group. The data shows that lower-income groups have a larger number of taxpayers but would benefit far less from this tax overhaul. Higher-income groups have fewer taxpayers but would gain significantly more from the GOP bill.\n\n[Insert chart showing the percentage of federal tax returns from each income group compared to the relative size of the benefit or loss for each group]\n\nThe Republicans argue that the wealthy, while fewer in number, contribute a larger portion of U.S. taxes. This is part of their rationale for a sweeping tax change that extends beyond tax cuts or reform. However, these numbers suggest that the GOP tax plan represents a shift towards a less progressive tax system, moving resources from the poor to the rich.",
    " Title: Women Candidates in Key Senate Races Could Determine Control of the Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming Senate elections, several women are running in key races that could potentially flip Democratic-held seats and determine the control of the Senate. The balance of power in the Senate could hinge on the performance of these women candidates from both parties.\n\nOne of the most prominent races is in Kentucky, where Democratic nominee Alison Lundergan Grimes, in her challenge to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, is using her gender to appeal to female voters, who make up more than half of the Kentucky electorate. Grimes, in a speech on Tuesday, declared, \"I am a strong Kentucky woman who is an independent thinker.\"\n\nIn her primary victory in Kentucky, Grimes emphatically told supporters, \"I am not an empty dress.\" Meanwhile, in Oregon, Republican hopeful and pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby touted her own qualifications for Senate, stating, \"I am a doctor, a mom.\"\n\nAnother notable candidate is Michelle Nunn, the daughter of veteran Sen. Sam Nunn, who is running in Georgia. Nunn said in a speech on Tuesday, \"I believe that change is possible.\"\n\nIn addition to these candidates, there are vulnerable female senators in Louisiana, North Carolina, and New Hampshire. If these women candidates perform well, the Senate's balance of power could be significantly impacted.\n\nIn no place is gender more at play than in Kentucky, where Grimes is running a fierce challenge to McConnell. McConnell, when asked about a potential gender gap problem, responded, \"We'll find out in November, won't we?\"\n\nIn his victory speech, McConnell spoke glowingly of his late mother and his wife Elaine Chao, a former cabinet secretary under George W. Bush. McConnell also highlighted three Kentucky women he said were hurt by President Barack Obama's health care law.\n\nDemocrats' other big hope for picking up a GOP Senate seat is Michelle Nunn in Georgia. As for Republicans, Monica Wehby is a pediatric neurosurgeon hoping to unseat Democrat Jeff Merkley in Oregon, running as a political outsider.\n\nIn West Virginia, Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, is favored to pick up a Democratic seat, but even if she loses to Democrat Natalie Tennant, either way, the state would elect its first female senator.\n\nCurrently, there are 20 women senators, a record but still far from representative of the country, which is more than 50% female. 2014 could mark another historic number.",
    " Title: President Trump Revives Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines, Announces Supreme Court Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed executive orders on Tuesday, reviving the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. The orders were widely expected, as Trump had previously criticized his predecessor for blocking the projects.\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline, which would run from Canada to Nebraska and connect to existing lines running to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast, was stopped by former President Obama in late 2015. The U.S. government needs to approve the pipeline because it would cross the nation's northern border.\n\nBuilder TransCanada said Tuesday afternoon it was \"preparing the application\" for the Keystone XL pipeline. TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha stated, \"We appreciate the President of the United States inviting us to re-apply for KXL.\" Cunha added that the pipeline would create thousands of well-paying construction jobs, generate tens of millions of dollars in annual property taxes to counties along the route, and more than $3 billion to the U.S. GDP.\n\nThe Dakota Access pipeline, which would carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois, was the subject of fierce protests until the Army Corps of Engineers stepped in. The Army Corps of Engineers had declined to allow construction of the Dakota Access pipeline under Lake Oahe, stating that alternative routes needed to be considered. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters say the project threatens drinking water and Native American sites, though Energy Transfer Partners, the company that wants to build the pipeline, disputes that and says the pipeline will be safe.\n\nIn addition to the pipeline orders, Trump also signed three other orders related to pipeline construction, including one expediting the environmental permitting process for infrastructure projects and one directing the Commerce Department to maximize the use of U.S. steel.\n\nTrump also announced he planned to nominate a justice for the Supreme Court next week, moving swiftly to try to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The president was summoning top senators to the White House later Tuesday to discuss his upcoming nomination.\n\nThe moves on the pipelines and the Supreme Court nomination come as Trump makes the economy and jobs the centerpiece of his administration's first week in office. Trump met Tuesday morning with representatives from the auto industry, including GM and Ford, after meeting a day earlier, separately, with business and union leaders.\n\nThe pipeline orders follow earlier executive actions covering everything from trade to ObamaCare. Trump on Monday signed measures withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and instituting a hiring freeze for most of the federal government. He also ordered federal agencies on his first day in office to ease the regulatory burden of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe moves are likely to spark a new fight with environmentalists. Even before Trump's orders were official, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune put out a statement blasting what he called the \"dangerous\" decision. \"The Keystone pipeline was rejected because it was not in the country's interest, and the environmental review of the Dakota Access Pipeline was ordered because of the threats it poses to the Standing Rock Sioux. Nothing has changed. These pipelines were a bad idea then and they're a bad idea now,\" he said.",
    " Title: Boehner Offers Tax Revenue Increase in Bid to Avert Fiscal Cliff\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner has extended an olive branch to President Barack Obama in an effort to avoid the impending \"fiscal cliff,\" stating that the GOP will allow for increased tax revenue if the president abandons his plan to raise tax rates on the wealthy. The move sets the stage for negotiations during the lame-duck session of Congress, which begins next week, and the 113th Congress, which opens in January.\n\nIn the aftermath of Tuesday's election, which saw Mr. Obama's re-election and an expanded Democratic majority in the Senate, while Republicans retained control of the House (albeit with fewer numbers), leaders from all sides have emphasized the need for cooperation to address the looming tax increases and automatic spending cuts.\n\nBoehner's proposal involves closing tax loopholes to generate more revenue, which can then be used to lower income tax rates for everyone. This approach, he argues, would foster economic growth, resulting in more revenue for the federal government in the long run.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, has interpreted Tuesday's election as a mandate for raising taxes on the wealthy. However, Boehner and his fellow House Republicans have stated that they will not accept increases in tax rates.\n\nThe absence of President Obama from the public conversation on Wednesday was noteworthy, as he placed private calls to Mr. Reid, Mr. Boehner, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Vice President Joseph R. Biden spoke to reporters instead, expressing optimism about the potential for cooperation.\n\nThe \"fiscal cliff\" refers to the combination of expiring Bush-era tax cuts and automatic spending cuts set to take effect on January 1 and 2, respectively. If Congress does not act, these measures could plunge the U.S. into a short but deep double-dip recession, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nBoth sides in Congress have expressed reservations about the magnitude of the tax increases and spending cuts, but have not yet reached a consensus on a solution. The Senate has not passed a budget in three years, and House Republicans have faced difficulties passing large pieces of legislation, such as the farm bill, this year.\n\nThe election resulted in a slight shift in the balance of power, with Democrats expanding their majority in the Senate to at least 54-45, and the Republican majority in the House decreasing, though 10 seats remained undecided as of Wednesday evening. In the presidential race, Mr. Obama's popular vote and Electoral College margins decreased, and Florida was still undecided as of Wednesday. Despite this, Mr. Obama has secured another four years in office to pursue his election promises.\n\nBoehner has emphasized the need for spending cuts on entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid as part of any deal with the White House. Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, has expressed support for the revenue deal Boehner is offering, stating that it aligns with his no-new-taxes pledge.",
    " Title: Economists Praise Strong Job Growth, Yet Warn of Ongoing Economic Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a flurry of positive appraisals, economists have hailed the latest job growth figures as \"extraordinary,\" \"blowout,\" and \"wow.\" The robust employment data, according to David Berson, chief economist of Nationwide, dismisses concerns of an impending recession. Berson stated, \"The fears of the economy tipping into a recession now have clearly been overstated.\"\n\nPresident Trump welcomed the strong job growth in a White House Rose Garden address, calling the 312,000 new jobs a \"tremendous number\" that has significantly impacted the stock market. He also praised the increase in wage growth as \"beautiful to watch.\"\n\nHowever, the positive employment report comes amidst a backdrop of economic challenges. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged these issues on Friday. The ongoing trade war with China, a nation currently experiencing an economic downturn, could potentially dampen global demand. Domestically, there is a slump in the housing sector, with indications that the auto industry may also be affected.\n\nThis week, Apple reduced its revenue forecast for the first time in 16 years, attributing the move to weak iPhone sales in China. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, stated on CNN that Apple is not the only American company to face the brunt of tensions with Beijing. Hassett said, \"There are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have a lot of sales in China that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year until we get a deal with China.\"\n\nFurthermore, on Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management released a survey showing the steepest decline in manufacturing activity since 2008. Many manufacturers blamed the drop on rising costs related to tariffs. Despite this, the index reading of 54.1 still indicates an expanding economy. Measures of consumer confidence have also weakened recently.\n\nThe stock market has been experiencing its worst decline since the financial crisis. In response, Powell stated, \"We\u2019re listening sensitively to the messages markets are sending,\" but added that investors \"are way ahead of the data.\"",

The Post cites Trump's plan to release a financial document summarizing his net worth as a key indicator of his intention to run.\n\nTrump's potential entry into the race has been met with skepticism, as he has previously teased a presidential run in 2012. In the past, Trump has been criticized for using publicity stunts to garner attention, such as his comments about a possible presidential run during the reality television show Celebrity Apprentice.\n\nThe Republican Party's presidential field is seen as increasingly focused on appealing to the Tea Party base and boosting their popularity within the conservative entertainment complex, rather than on governing or winning the election. Trump is expected to compete for celebrity heft within this field.\n\nAccording to RealClearPolitics, Trump is currently polling around 3.6 percent, placing him in the middle of the field. This is significant as Trump is ahead of several other candidates, including Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, Carly Fiorina, Lindsey Graham, Bobby Jindal, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\n\nTrump's campaign platform includes a \"secret plan\" to defeat ISIS, which he has pledged to reveal upon his inauguration in 2017. Critics argue that this lack of transparency and specifics demonstrates a lack of seriousness in Trump's candidacy.\n\nThe potential impact of Trump's candidacy on American politics has been a topic of debate, with some viewing him as a circus sideshow attraction and others seeing him as a somewhat serious contender. If the first debate were to be held tomorrow, Trump would likely be among the top-tier candidates invited to participate. However, the concern is that the Republican Party is not fielding candidates commensurate with the seriousness of the nation's challenges.",
    " Title: Saudi Arabia Arrests 11 Princes, Including Prominent Investor Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, and Former Ministers\n\nArticle: Saudi Arabia announced on Saturday the arrest of 11 princes, several current and former government ministers, in a move that appears to consolidate power around Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The arrests were first reported by Al Arabiya, the Saudi state satellite TV network, according to the New York Times. Among those arrested was Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, a prominent member of the royal family and a major investor in Apple and Twitter.\n\nJust hours before the arrests, King Salman established a new anti-corruption committee, headed by the 32-year-old crown prince. The committee is authorized to investigate, arrest, and freeze the assets of anyone it suspects of corruption.\n\nThe unexpected arrests occurred on the same day that King Salman fired Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, Saudi Arabia's minister of the National Guard. Miteb was once considered a contender for the Saudi throne before the rise of Prince Mohammed two years ago. His removal gives the crown prince, who is already the Saudi defense minister, tighter control over the kingdom's security services.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Saturday's arrests were connected to the new anti-corruption committee. The royal order said the committee was needed \"due to the propensity of some people for abuse, putting their personal interest above public interest, and stealing public funds,\" according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nKing Salman has moved to stamp out dissent in the kingdom before his expected abdication in favor of Crown Prince Mohammed. Prince Miteb, who was one of the few powerful princes from outside King Salman's branch of the royal family, had been critical of the king's decision to appoint Prince Mohammed as his successor.",
    " Title: President Trump Pledges Support for Law Enforcement, Criticizes FBI Amidst Ongoing Investigations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech to a graduating class of law enforcement officers at the FBI Academy on Friday, President Donald Trump pledged his administration's unwavering support for the police.\n\n\"The president of the United States has your back 100 percent,\" Trump said during a 17-minute speech to state and local law enforcement officers who had completed a special training course at the bureau.\n\nThe president's support for law enforcement has been a consistent theme, but the comments at the FBI Academy came amidst a period of heightened tension between the White House and the bureau. Trump has publicly criticized the bureau's senior leadership and its reputation, labeling it as \"in tatters\" and \"the worst in history.\"\n\n\"It's a shame what's happened with the FBI,\" Trump said Friday, moments before he left for Quantico. \"But we're going to rebuild the FBI. It'll be bigger and better than ever.\"\n\nThe president praised agents who keep the country safe and distanced himself from any blame for the investigations that have dogged his administration. However, he did take aim at the growing violence in Baltimore and Chicago.\n\n\"What the hell is going on in Chicago? What the hell is happening there?\" he asked, which was followed by an awkward silence and then mild applause.\n\nThe White House, on Friday, revealed newly disclosed FBI records showing an \"extreme bias\" against Trump among senior leadership at the FBI. Deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley made these remarks to Fox News, stating that edits to former FBI Director James Comey's statement on Hillary Clinton's private email server and text messages from a top agent critical of Trump were \"deeply troubling.\"\n\nGidley alleged that there was \"extreme bias against this president with high-up members of the team there at the FBI who were investigating Hillary Clinton at the time.\" This statement comes as special counsel Robert Mueller continues his probe of possible Trump campaign ties to Russia.\n\nEdits to the Comey draft appeared to soften the gravity of the bureau's finding in its 2016 investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state. Gidley described the disclosure of politically charged text messages sent by one of the agents on the Clinton case, Peter Strzok, as \"eye-opening.\" Strzok, who was in the room as Clinton was interviewed, was later assigned to special counsel Robert Mueller's team to investigate potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. He was re-assigned after the messages were uncovered this summer.\n\nApproximately 200 leaders in law enforcement from around the country attended the weeks-long FBI National Academy program aimed at raising law enforcement standards and cooperation. Coursework included intelligence theory, terrorism and terrorist mindsets, law, behavioral science, law enforcement communication, and forensic science.",
    " Title: Texas Hospital Apologizes for Ebola Handling as Two Nurses Infected, Schools Close Over Fear of Virus Spread\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Ebola outbreak in the United States, a Texas hospital where an Ebola patient died and two nurses became infected has issued an apology for mistakes made in the initial treatment of the patient. The hospital's chief clinical officer, Dr. Daniel Varga, admitted that they \"did not correctly diagnose [Ebola] symptoms as those of Ebola.\"\n\nNina Pham, the first nurse infected, is set to be transferred to the National Institutes of Health facility in Maryland. She is currently being cared for at the same hospital where she worked and where she contracted the virus from a patient she treated, Thomas Eric Duncan.\n\nCDC Director Tom Frieden stated that a second nurse, Amber Vinson, who tested positive for Ebola and flew a day before it was known that she might be suffering from the virus, should not have been cleared to fly. Vinson reported a fever to the agency but was told she could continue her travel. As a result, 132 passengers on her flight are now questioning their potential exposure.\n\nVinson is currently being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, which has successfully treated two other Ebola patients without any of its employees becoming infected. The decision to transfer Vinson to Emory was reportedly due to staffing issues at the Texas hospital, leading to concerns and potential walkouts among nurses.\n\nIn response to the Ebola outbreak, the federal government is considering placing those who treated Duncan on a list that would prohibit them from flying. The CDC is also considering lowering the fever threshold that would be considered a possible sign of Ebola, currently set at 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nSchool closures in two states have occurred due to the fear of Ebola spread. In Texas, a few schools in the Belton Independent School District are closed Thursday because two students were on the same flight as Vinson from Cleveland to Dallas. In Ohio, two schools in the Solon School District in suburban Cleveland are closed Thursday due to a staffer who traveled home from Dallas on Frontier Airlines Tuesday on a different flight but potentially the same aircraft as Vinson.\n\nFrontier Airlines has placed six crew members on paid leave for 21 days \"out of an abundance of caution.\" The airline also removed the plane's seat covers and carpet near where the infected passenger sat, even though it had not been asked to do so by the CDC.\n\nFollowing scathing allegations by a nurses' union, a Texas Health Presbyterian spokeswoman stated that several of the claims were not true. The union had alleged that Duncan was \"left for several hours, not in isolation, in an area where other patients were present\" during his second visit to the hospital. However, the hospital spokeswoman claimed that Duncan \"was moved directly to a private room and placed in isolation\" during his second visit. The union also claimed that \"there was no one to pick up hazardous waste as it piled to the ceiling,\" but the hospital spokeswoman stated that the waste was \"well-contained in accordance with standards, and it was located in safe and containable locations.\"",
    " Title: Black Friday: A Critical Examination of the Annual Consumer Event\n\nArticle:\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, is a contentious annual occasion in the United States, often associated with American excess and indignity. This day illustrates the nation's unique penchant for conspicuous consumption, even in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Despite economic challenges, the cultural obsession with acquiring big-ticket items as a measure of social worth persists.\n\nIn some states, the Black Friday shopping frenzy has become so uncivilized that there are analytics predicting which states are most likely to have fights over discounted merchandise. These states often have lower median incomes, suggesting that the pressure to keep up with the bling associated with higher incomes contributes to Black Friday brawls.\n\nThe dynamics of Black Friday extend beyond the in-store chaos. Politicians and corporations have collaborated to send American jobs overseas in pursuit of cheap labor. This results in relatively inexpensive products being sold back to American stores, forcing consumers to earn less while being sold cheaper, more disposable goods.\n\nMoreover, it has been discovered that Black Friday deals are not always the best bargains, with similar prices available throughout the year. The quality of these items is often compromised to maintain profit margins, leading to a vicious cycle of cutting costs and decreasing quality.\n\nWhile there are valid reasons for saving money in stores, the practice of stampeding over each other and making national news for all the wrong reasons has become a tradition for many Americans. Given the reality of Black Friday, it is worth questioning whether the indignity is worth the savings, especially in the age of online retailers.",
    " Title: Christie's Past Statements Called into Question During Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Chris Christie launched his campaign under the motto, \"telling it like it is.\" However, a review of some of the New Jersey governor's statements during the Fox Business debate on Thursday suggests that he may have misrepresented some facts.\n\nThe testy exchange between Christie and fellow candidate Marco Rubio erupted on the debate stage when Rubio accused Christie of holding liberal views, citing Common Core, gun control, the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor, and a donation made to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn response, Christie stated, \"Let's get the facts straight... I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.\" However, fact-checking website Politifact reports that in 2009, while running for New Jersey governor, Christie initially stated that Sotomayor would not have been his choice. Later that year, he issued a statement voicing support for her appointment to the Supreme Court.\n\nChristie argued on Friday that his 2009 statements did not constitute support, claiming he was only calling for a straight up-or-down vote. In a 1994 Newark Star-Ledger story, Christie is quoted as saying, \"I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution.\" However, his campaign has since stated that he did not make the donation. Planned Parenthood, a non-profit, does not disclose its private donors' information.\n\nRubio's allegations, whether true or not, provided Christie with an opportunity to deliver a memorable zinger during the debate, as he accused Rubio of attacking a rival to boost his own poll numbers, a tactic he once accused Jeb Bush of using.",
    " Title: Trump Holds Rally in Michigan During Impeachment Vote in U.S. House of Representatives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unprecedented event in American history, President Donald Trump held a rally in Battle Creek, Michigan, as the U.S. House of Representatives voted on his impeachment articles on Wednesday night. The impeachment was initiated due to a whistleblower complaint regarding Trump's attempt to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as well as a Republican theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nVice President Mike Pence warmed up the crowd, with the rally taking place in a district represented by Rep. Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party earlier in the year to become an independent and voted in favor of the two articles of impeachment.\n\nTrump's speech began in a subdued manner, with the president discussing the restoration of the practice of Americans wishing each other \"Merry Christmas.\" He also praised the USMCA trade deal, but his speech was interrupted by a heckler. Trump responded by saying, \"Get her out of here!\" and added, \"There's one disgusting person who made a horrible gesture with the wrong finger.\"\n\nThroughout the rally, Trump boasted about the strong economy, the size of his rally crowds, and a new poll showing him ahead of the Democratic nomination candidates. He also made light of the impeachment process, referring to it as a \"political suicide march\" for the Democrats.\n\nTrump was impeached by the House, becoming the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats were criticized by Trump, who claimed they were seeking to overturn \"the results of an election.\"\n\nLate in his speech, Trump returned to the topic of impeachment, stating, \"They've been trying to impeach me from day one.\" He also made light of the impeachment process, saying, \"It's a political suicide march for the Democrats.\"\n\nTrump also made references to his former reality TV show, \"The Apprentice,\" and his potential political opponent, Hillary Clinton, who is rumored to be considering another presidential run. He also mocked Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, who voted for impeachment, and made a joke about her late husband, Rep. John Dingell, who would have been proud of her vote, according to Dingell.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's speech during the impeachment vote was a somewhat muted performance, with the president focusing on various topics, including the economy, his rallies, and the impeachment process itself. He also made light of the impeachment process and made several political jabs throughout his speech.",
    " Title: The Ongoing Issue of Voter Fraud in U.S. Elections and the Role of Voter-ID Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nThe issue of voter fraud in American elections has been a topic of debate for decades. Instances of voter fraud have been reported in various elections, such as Lyndon Johnson's election to the U.S. Senate in 1948, where he allegedly won by manufacturing fake votes, or the 1960 presidential election in Illinois and Texas, where voter fraud is believed to have influenced the results.\n\nIn recent times, cases of voter fraud have been reported in several states during the 2016 election cycle. For instance, in San Pedro, California, 83 absentee ballots were sent to different registered voters who supposedly lived in the same small, two-bedroom apartment. In Pennsylvania, a Democratic organization, FieldWorks LLC, was raided for fraudulently filling out registration forms for thousands of voters. In Indiana, state police believe there could be hundreds of fraudulent voter registration records. In Chicago, an investigation found people who had been registered to vote after their death. In Virginia, illegal aliens were discovered to have illegally registered to vote in an examination of just eight out of the Commonwealth's 133 counties and independent cities. In New York, Democrats were recently caught complaining about voter fraud created by New York City mayor Bill de Blasio's decision to give out ID cards without checking recipients' identities.\n\nMany argue that these problems could have been avoided if voters had to register in-person using a valid photo ID. This simple, commonsense requirement is standard in about a hundred countries around the world. Many countries' voter requirements are more stringent than anything being discussed in the United States. For example, Mexican voters must present voter IDs that include not only a photo but also a thumbprint to help ensure people don't register more than once. The IDs carry holographic images, embedded security codes, and a magnetic strip with still more security information. As an extra precaution, multiple-voting is further prevented by dipping voters' fingers in indelible ink.\n\nIn Mexico, voters cannot register by mail; instead, they must go to their registration office and fill out forms for their voter ID. When the voter card is ready three months later, the voter must make a second trip to pick it up from the registration office. Absentee ballots must be requested at least six months before the election. Despite these restrictive rules, people in Mexico are still able to vote, and the voter-participation rate actually went up after the 1991 reforms.\n\nThe debate over voter-ID laws in the United States is ongoing. There is evidence that voter-ID laws are associated with increased voting rates, and there hasn't been any evidence that voting regulations disproportionately harm minorities, the poor, or the elderly. However, the fate of America's recent, limited experiment with voter-ID laws will be determined by this election. After Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia's death earlier this year, Democratic-appointee-dominated district and appeals courts around the country have had free reign in striking down voter-ID laws. If Hillary Clinton wins and gets to appoint Scalia's replacement, which will result in a 5-to-4 liberal majority on the Supreme Court, these rulings will be upheld.\n\nThe rigging of elections undermines the government's legitimacy and discourages lawful voting. Today's election will determine whether states have any chance of solving this problem.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Seeks Expansive War Powers to Combat Islamic State\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry told Congress on Tuesday that President Obama is seeking expansive war powers to pursue the Islamic State terrorists in various locations, a move that has left lawmakers stunned by the proposed war authorization, which could potentially allow the Pentagon to commit American combat troops to the fight.\n\nDuring his testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Mr. Kerry stated that while Mr. Obama does not want combat troops, he does not want to restrict the president's ability to respond to unforeseen developments in the war should the Islamic State evolve, expand its fight to other countries, or prove more difficult to defeat.\n\n\"I don't think anybody wants to get into a long-term ground operation here. But we also don't want to hamstring the generals and the commanders in the field and the president, who is commander in chief, from their ability to be able to make some decision they need to make,\" Mr. Kerry said.\n\nThe administration's approach has sparked a growing furor, with lawmakers from both parties criticizing the White House for not taking action and for failing to lead on the issue. Sen. Bob Corker, the ranking Republican on the committee, stated, \"The reason we're here is a total failure of the president to lead on this issue.\"\n\nPresident Obama has repeatedly refused to propose his own war resolution. For now, Sen. Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat and chairman of the committee, has written a draft authorization for the use of military force (AUMF) that would impose a three-year limit on the authority and forbid ground combat troops in most situations, with exceptions for intelligence gathering, acting as spotters, or for rescue missions. The draft resolution does not specify a geographic limitation.\n\nLawmakers had hoped Mr. Obama, who won the presidency in 2008 in part due to his opposition to the Iraq War, would support strict limits. However, Mr. Kerry stated that the administration does not want such limits written into law.\n\n\"It sounds to me like you're making the case for a rather open-ended authorization,\" Mr. Menendez told Mr. Kerry, adding that he's been disappointed with the lack of cooperation from the president's team.\n\nMr. Menendez plans to have his committee vote on Thursday on a war resolution, and if the Senate stays in session next week, he said he'd like to see a vote on the chamber floor. He stated he'll push ahead even if they haven't been able to iron out differences with Mr. Obama over limits to his war powers.\n\nNo matter what the Senate does, the debate won't be finished this year. House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, has stated his chamber will take up the war debate next year, and he said it's Mr. Obama's job to propose a resolution to Congress and make the case for it to the American people.\n\nThe rise of the Islamic State, which goes by the acronyms ISIS or ISIL, has been embarrassing for the president, who a year ago declared al Qaeda on the run and said it was time to begin ramping down the war on terror. On Tuesday, Mr. Kerry made clear the administration considers the Islamic State, which has captured large swaths of Syria and Iraq, to be a branch of al Qaeda operating under a different name. He stated that means Mr. Obama already has powers to go after them under the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, so even if Congress doesn't act, the president will continue to pursue the war.\n\nMr. Obama has already committed thousands of troops to Iraq in what he says is a supporting role, backing that country's troops. The U.S. has also conducted airstrikes in both Iraq and Syria to try to halt Islamic State advances. Meanwhile, a defense policy bill about to clear Congress authorizes the president to arm and train Syrian rebel groups for the next two years, with the hope that those rebels will take the fight to the Islamic State inside that country.\n\nSenators did credit Mr. Kerry and Mr. Obama with pushing Iraq's politicians to push for political unity, which has helped solidify much of the country in opposition to the Islamic State. However, Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who has a long history of working with and against Mr. Kerry during their days together in the Senate, blasted his former colleague for being too timid in pursuing the Islamic State. He called Tuesday's hearing a \"charade.\"",
    " Title: The Origins and Controversy Surrounding the Sequestration: A Look at the Budget Control Act of 2011\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing political debate surrounding deficit reduction and the impending automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration, on March 1, 2013, can be traced back to the Budget Control Act of 2011. This act was designed to reduce the deficit and prevent default, creating a supercommittee on deficit control. The act stipulated that if the supercommittee failed to reach an agreement, automatic spending cuts would be imposed on all discretionary spending, including the military, and the expiration of various tax cuts would result in tax increases for millions of Americans.\n\nOn August 1, 2011, an overwhelming majority of Republicans (174-66) in the House voted for the bill. House Democrats split evenly, with 95 voting in favor and 95 against. Key Republican leaders, including John Boehner, Eric Cantor, and Kevin McCarthy, voted yes, while Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and Jim Clyburn also voted yes. The bill passed the Senate the following day, with 45 Senate Democrats supporting it, joined by 28 Republicans and one Independent.\n\nPresident Obama signed the bill, a bicameral, bipartisan effort in cooperation with the White House, into law. However, during the October 22, 2012, presidential debate with Mitt Romney, President Obama denied any involvement in the sequester, stating, \"The sequester is not something that I proposed... It will not happen... The budget we are talking about is not reducing our military spending. It is maintaining it.\"\n\nThis statement was a key moment in the final debate, which was generally scored in favor of the president. It could have gone the other way if Romney had been aware of the potential impact of sequestration, including a potential increase in unemployment up to 9.1 percent by the end of 2013, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nIn his book \"The Price of Politics,\" Bob Woodward traced the sequester idea as a negotiating strategy that originated in the White House. The idea of draconian cuts to the Defense budget was a White House proposal, which moved to the Democratic leader of the Senate, and eventually reached Republican leaders, culminating in mutually flawed assumptions that a bipartisan agreement on the supercommittee would be reached. The supercommittee could not agree, and the automatic spending cuts of sequestration are now on the way.\n\nAs a member of the 112th Congress, some representatives voted against the Budget Control Act of 2011. These representatives argue that there is waste in government, and that spending should be cut, particularly in areas such as wars, interventions, and foreign aid that may lead to interventions. They also argue that the U.S. needs to address its $600 billion trade deficit and focus on domestic issues.\n\nWith automatic spending cuts looming, the president will continue to distance himself from the sequestration process, while Republicans will try to bring him back to where he started: as the initiator. The White House will likely adopt a \"share the pain\" approach to deficit reduction, but it may not be enough to avoid sequestration. The Democrats will attack Republicans for sequestration, while the Republicans will argue that the cuts are necessary to reduce the deficit. The outcome of the political battle over deficit reduction and automatic spending cuts remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Trump Leads Republican Presidential Field by 11 Points in Latest National Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nBusinessman Donald Trump has taken an 11-point lead over his closest rival in the latest national poll on the 2016 Republican presidential field. According to the Washington Post-ABC poll released on Monday, Trump was the first choice of 24 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker follows closely at 13 percent, while former Florida Governor Jeb Bush is at 12 percent.\n\nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is next at 8 percent, followed by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida at 7 percent, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky at 6 percent each. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Texas Governor Rick Perry are at 4 percent each. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie rounds out the top 10 at 3 percent.\n\nTrump's lead in the poll is a significant increase from his 4 percent showing in a Post-ABC poll released in late May. In that survey, Trump, Walker, and Paul were tied for first at 11 percent, followed by Bush and Rubio at 10 percent each, Huckabee at 9 percent, and Carson and Cruz at 8 percent each.\n\nIn response to the survey, Trump's campaign released a statement from him, stating, \"People are tired of incompetent leaders and being pushed around at will by other nations, our enemies, and even our friends. Politicians have completely failed the American people. We owe $18 trillion dollars, have porous and dangerous borders, and can't even take proper care of our magnificent Veterans. If I become president, I will do what I do best\u2014fix these problems and Make America Great Again!\"\n\nTrump has faced criticism for recent comments he has made about Mexico and illegal immigrants, as well as the military service of Senator John McCain of Arizona. However, Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, downplayed any potential impact on Trump's poll numbers, stating that 8 percent of the poll was conducted on Sunday and calling it a \"statistical error.\"\n\nThe overall survey of 1,002 adults was taken from July 16-19 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.",
    " Title: House Transmits Articles of Impeachment to Senate, Setting Stage for Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States House of Representatives is set to vote on Wednesday to send the two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump to the Senate, marking the start of a trial that is expected to result in an acquittal for the President. The House's decision to transmit the impeachment articles follows a nearly four-week delay during which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attempted to dictate rules for the trial.\n\nThe Senate is expected to begin the trial on Tuesday with a standard set of rules preferred by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Democrats hope to put pressure on Senate Republicans, particularly those from swing states facing reelection in November, to back demands for additional witness testimony at the trial.\n\nHowever, the prevailing wisdom on Capitol Hill is that impeachment as an election issue will backfire on Pelosi, whose Democrats won the majority in 2018 by picking up seats in traditionally Republican strongholds. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer has been criticized for demanding a decision on witnesses in pretrial negotiations, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell accusing Schumer of using the trial process to hurt Republican election chances.\n\nSenate Democrats need at least four Republicans to vote with them to get the 51 votes needed to call a witness. They are eyeing four witnesses close to the President, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Adviser John Bolton. Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado, who are both moderate Republicans up for re-election, have expressed a willingness to consider calling witnesses. Senators Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who are not up for reelection this year, have also not closed the door to hearing from more witnesses.\n\nHouse Democratic leaders insist their side is winning the impeachment debate. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries of New York said, \"We'll see what happens in the Senate, but I think there's been substantial movement. That's a good thing.\" He also named several Republican senators, including Martha McSally, Joni Ernst, Cory Gardner, and Lamar Alexander, whom he hopes will support their case.\n\nRecent polling suggests an overwhelming number of Americans would like to hear from John Bolton during the trial. A Quinnipiac poll released this week showed 66 percent of respondents were eager to hear from the former national security adviser. The House Democrats' impeachment managers are expected to be named on Wednesday, with House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York at the top of the list of likely managers.\n\nThe House impeached Trump in a party-line vote on December 18, charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The two articles of impeachment stem from a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president in which Trump requested a probe of a political rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden. Pelosi held on to the articles for about a month, demanding the Republican-controlled Senate hold a fair trial and echoing Schumer's calls for more witnesses. The nearly four-week impasse did not yield any assurances on whether or not McConnell's chamber will hear more testimony.",
    " Title: Senate Adopts University's Doctrine of Self-Censorship, No-Go Zones, and Safe Spaces in Supreme Court Confirmation Hearings\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the Senate adopted a set of norms reminiscent of modern universities, characterized by self-censorship, no-go zones, and safe spaces. The polarizing atmosphere of the university has extended to Congress, as seen in the hearings for Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford.\n\nThe hearings demonstrated how college values have become the norms of the Senate. In the university setting, constitutional due process often vanishes when accusations of sexual harassment arise. This was evident in the false charges lodged against the Duke University lacrosse players and the concocted smear of a University of Virginia fraternity.\n\nThe credibility of either Kavanaugh or Ford was a contentious issue, but the asymmetry of the campus governance was evident in the hearings. Ford's veracity hinged on empathy and perceived believability, with little requirement for corroborating testimonies, witnesses, or physical evidence. In contrast, Kavanaugh was considered guilty from the start, and he had to prove his innocence.\n\nOne belief of the university is the postmodern idea of relativist truth. On campus, all narratives can present equally valid stories, with no clear distinction between them based on reality, as established by evidence and facts. Powerful individuals supposedly \"construct\" truths based on their self-interests, leading to self-described victims of historical biases being under no obligation to play by what they consider to be rigged rules of facts, evidence, or testimony.\n\nThis dynamic is exemplified by Senator Cory Booker (D, N.J) insisting that Dr. Ford told \"her truth.\" In other words, evidence was not so relevant. Ford's story of events from 36 years ago inherently would have as much claim on reality as Kavanaugh's rebuttal\u2014and perhaps more so, given their different genders and asymmetrical access to power.\n\nTruth-finding would have required difficult, time-honored examinations of physical evidence, the testimony of witnesses, and even unpleasant cross-examinations about the time and place of the allegations. However, such an approach would have potentially hurt feelings and questioned motives, as they are under constitutional norms of due process.\n\nIn the Senate, the race and gender of individuals increasingly determine who we are. Republican senators were often written off as \"old white men,\" not unique individuals who might be disinterested or biased, fair or prejudicial. Kavanaugh was largely assumed guilty, in part for once being a privileged white kid of 17 who had gone to a prep school.\n\nMeanwhile, Booker, by virtue of not being old and white, was considered a credible senatorial examiner. No one cared that Booker had once invented stories about an imaginary friend named \"T-Bone.\"\n\nSuch blanket race- and age-based stereotyping was not even consistent. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D, Conn.) is 72 and white. Yet given his progressive politics, no one dismissed him on the basis of gender and age, much less for being a serial fabricator who concocted false stories of being a Vietnam veteran.\n\nThe Senate also adopted the modern university's doctrine of self-censorship, no-go zones, and safe spaces. Given issues of gender and the university concept that accusations of sexual assault inherently are exempt from constitutional protections of due process, Ford was more or less excused from normally tough cross-examination.\n\nIn her testimony, Ford never explained why, despite her self-professed fear of flying, she has been a frequent flyer on business and leisure trips. Ford's privacy and medical status were understandably to be respected and off-limits. Yet Ford suggested that her friend, Leland Ingham Keyser, was suffering from \"significant health challenges\" after Keyser did not corroborate Ford's allegations.\n\nFord was never really asked why her narratives concerning the number of witnesses to the alleged assault and their genders were not compatible. Her accounts of the location and time of the alleged assault were either inconsistent or nonexistent. In contrast, Kavanagh was grilled on everything from his high-school yearbook to a made-up accusation that he once committed sexual assault on a docked boat in Newport, R.I.\n\nSwarming and shouting down those who hold different views in order to shame and intimidate them is part and parcel of the modern university. Now, we are seeing such campus street theater in Congress. During a break in the hearings, female protesters cornered Senator Jeff Flake (R, Ariz.) in an elevator and screamed in his face.\n\nThe psychodrama worked\u2014just as it usually does on campus. A shaken and flushed Flake soon backed down from his stated intention of voting to confirm Kavanaugh.\n\nCampuses are no longer out-of-touch ivory towers. Their creed is now beginning to run the country, which is frightening.",
    " Title: House Speaker Paul Ryan Announces Retirement, Sparking Succession Race and Political Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan announced on Wednesday that he will retire from the House of Representatives at the end of this year, closing out a two-decade career in Congress and igniting a succession race within the Republican Party. The announcement comes as the party braces for a challenging election season.\n\nRyan rejected claims that he was fleeing a sinking ship, predicting that Republicans will maintain their House majority despite headwinds in November's elections. He vowed to be an active lame-duck speaker as he serves out his term, pushing for spending controls and the rest of the Republican agenda.\n\nRyan's decision was reportedly driven by family considerations. He noted that he came to Congress from Wisconsin before his first child was born and now all three children are teenagers. \"If I am here for one more term, my kids will only have ever known me as a weekend dad,\" he said. \"I just can't let that happen. So I will be setting new priorities in my life.\"\n\nThe announcement set off jockeying among Republicans to fill Ryan's post. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana are seen as his most likely successors. Some lawmakers and conservative groups urged a go-slow approach on choosing the next leader, particularly since Republicans' position will not be clear until after November's elections.\n\nRyan has been speaker for about 2\u00bd turbulent years. He faced down conservative rebellions and secured a large tax cut, but he failed to repeal Obamacare or lock down a deal on immigration. He considered his biggest accomplishments to be tax cuts and last month's omnibus spending bill that included a massive spike in Pentagon funding along with a big boost in domestic funding.\n\nHis biggest regret, he said, was failing to win changes to big social spending programs, though he said the House, under his leadership as a committee chairman and then as speaker, had done its part by passing \"the biggest entitlement reform bill ever considered in the House of Representatives.\"\n\nRyan, the Republican Party's 2012 vice presidential nominee, said he thinks he is finished with elected politics for the immediate future\u2014and potentially for good. After serving as a prominent critic of Donald Trump at times during the 2016 campaign, he became the president's most effective ally on Capitol Hill by helping push the White House agenda.\n\nDemocrats said they hoped that Ryan, free from having to face voters, will now turn against Trump and sideline conservatives who have resisted efforts to strike more liberal-leaning deals. However, Ryan's relationship with conservatives as speaker has been uneasy at times, with spending concerns and a perceived lack of input from the rank and file being among the issues.\n\nConservative members generally praised Ryan for his approach to the job and for helping win tax cuts last year. They said they would leave a more broad-based examination of his record for another time. The succession race and the political landscape in the House of Representatives will continue to evolve in the coming months.",
    " Title: Romney's Business Ties and Bain Capital Investments Under Scrutiny in Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing scrutiny of Mitt Romney's business ties and investments made by his private equity firm, Bain Capital, has intensified as the Obama campaign has accused Romney of either misrepresenting his role at Bain to federal regulators or to the American public regarding the duration of his tenure at the firm.\n\nThe allegation, based on a report in the Boston Globe, suggests that documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicate that Romney may have led Bain until 2002, three years longer than he claims. This is significant because the Obama campaign asserts that Romney shares responsibility for the investments Bain made between 1999 and 2002, which allegedly led to jobs being shipped off to China and India.\n\nStephanie Cutter, deputy campaign manager for the Obama campaign, stated in a conference call that if Romney was lying to the American people about his role at Bain, it raises serious character and trust issues. The Romney campaign, in response, labeled the accusation as \"reckless and unsubstantiated\" and called for an apology from the Obama team.\n\nThe Romney campaign maintains that internal Bain documents show Romney had stopped managing the firm's clients when he went to oversee the Salt Lake City Olympics. Bain Capital also released a statement supporting Romney's claim that he left in 1999 and had no involvement with the management or investment activities of the firm or its portfolio companies since his departure.\n\nDemocrats have demanded Romney release more tax returns to provide voters with a better understanding of his finances, and they argue that his role at Bain is crucial for voters to have a complete picture of his approach to job creation.\n\nDavid Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois, stated that Romney's complex finances make it difficult for him to control the narrative surrounding his business history. He also criticized the Romney campaign for not having better answers ready, given their years of running for the presidency.\n\nBefore the Boston Globe story, the Romney campaign had already released an ad accusing President Obama of lying about Romney's role in offshoring jobs. The ad, titled \"No Evidence,\" questions Obama's credibility and cites the analysis of Factcheck.org and The Washington Post, which found no evidence that Romney shipped jobs overseas and labeled the Obama campaign's charge as \"misleading.\"\n\nThe Globe report, according to the Obama campaign, proves that Romney was in \"full control of Bain Capital through 2002\" and directly responsible for the related outsourcing, bankrupting, and layoffs. \"Whatever the consequences of Bain investments were, he was responsible,\" the campaign stated.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney and President Obama Tied in Virginia Poll, Electoral Map Could Differ from 2008\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll by Quinnipiac University shows a tight race between Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama in the swing state of Virginia. The poll, conducted from July 10-16, shows both candidates tied at 44 percent, with 8 percent undecided, 2 percent preferring another candidate, and 2 percent stating they would not vote. This is a significant shift from March, when Obama held an 8-point lead over Romney in the same state.\n\nIn the poll, independent voters slightly favor Obama, with 40 percent supporting the president and 38 percent supporting Romney. However, Obama's advantage with women has decreased from 16 points in March to 5 points in July. Additionally, Obama's favorability ratings are underwater for the first time since December, with 46 percent holding a favorable opinion of him and 48 percent an unfavorable one.\n\nRomney's favorability ratings are also not particularly strong, with a 39-42 favorable-unfavorable split. Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, commented, \"One of them is going to win the White House, but neither would get elected Prom King.\"\n\nThe poll surveyed 1,673 registered voters and has a margin of error of 2.4 percentage points. The poll results suggest that the electoral map this year could look different from four years ago, when Obama expanded Democratic territory and flipped historically red states such as Virginia and North Carolina. Instead, it could resemble the 2004 election, where an under-fire incumbent, President George W. Bush, fended off a challenger, Sen. John F. Kerry, who was not particularly popular.\n\nIf Obama holds onto the states he won in 2008, which now have 246 electoral votes, Virginia's 13 votes could clinch re-election for Obama even if he loses the other key swing states - Ohio, Florida, and North Carolina. Because New Mexico is trending toward Obama, the president could reach the required 270 electoral votes by winning just one of the three other Bush states he flipped in 2008 - Nevada, Colorado, or Iowa.\n\nPaul Goldman, a longtime Democratic strategist who advised former governors L. Douglas Wilder and Mark R. Warner, stated, \"The president doesn't have to win Virginia to get elected, but there's a good chance Romney does.\"\n\nNPR also released a poll that gives Obama a 47 percent to 45 percent lead, within the margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. However, voters in 12 battleground states, which included Virginia, were split, with 46 percent favoring Obama, 46 percent favoring Romney, and 3 percent undecided. The poll of 1,000 likely voters was conducted from July 9-12 and had a margin of error of 4.56 percentage points.\n\nOther recent polls also indicate a close race nationally. Romney leads 47 percent to 46 percent in a CBS/New York Times poll, while Obama leads 45 percent to 41 percent in a Fox poll. The new numbers were released as first lady Michelle Obama is scheduled to visit Virginia on Friday to launch a voter outreach program the campaign plans to take to other battleground states next week.\n\nOn July 13, at a campaign stop in Roanoke, Va., Obama made the now-infamous \"If you've got a business, you didn't build that\" remark, which argued that other people or government services inevitably help along the way. Since then, Romney's campaign has used the remark as a rallying cry to argue that Obama does not understand or care for the free enterprise system.\n\nOn Thursday, Romney's campaign unveiled a Web ad titled \"These Hands,\" which features Jack Gilchrist, the owner of Gilchrist Metal Fabricating Company in Hudson, N.H., where Romney stopped in January. The ad questions the idea that Obama's hands didn't build his company. The Obama campaign countered with its own online ad, titled \"Mitt Romney: Saying Anything to Get Elected,\" which splices recent remarks from Romney with Obama's comments to argue that the challenger was essentially agreeing with the president's larger point.",
    " Title: Republican Rep. Mark Sanford Loses GOP Primary in South Carolina\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the latest primary election held on Tuesday, Republican Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina lost his seat to state Rep. Katie Arrington. This outcome was the most significant in a series of elections held in Virginia, Maine, Nevada, and North Dakota.\n\nThe primary elections saw a consistent trend in Democratic primaries, particularly in three key House races in Virginia, where female candidates are winning at unprecedented rates and often by large margins. Notable retirements and runoffs in the Republican party include Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, and Alabama Rep. Martha Roby.\n\nSanford's loss was attributed to his criticism of President Donald Trump, a factor that also led to Alabama Rep. Martha Roby's runoff. Trump endorsed Arrington, stating that Sanford had been \"unhelpful\" to him and was \"better off in Argentina.\"\n\nIn an ad, Arrington urged voters to tell Sanford to \"take a hike,\" referencing Sanford's 2009 scandal involving an extramarital affair.\n\nCorey Stewart, a controversial Republican candidate known for his support of the Confederate flag and monuments, won the Republican Senate nomination in Virginia. National and state Republicans expressed concern that Stewart's presence on the ballot could lead Republican voters to stay at home, hurting the party in several competitive House races.\n\nIn Virginia's competitive House races, women will represent the Democratic party in November, marking another example of the party turning to women to unseat vulnerable Republicans in the Trump era. Three women\u2014Elaine Luria, Abigail Spanberger, and Jennifer Wexton\u2014won Democratic primaries in Virginia on Tuesday.\n\nA record number of Democratic women have filed to run for Congress since Trump took office, with many citing his presidency as their motivation. To date, 476 women have filed to run for the House in 2018, surpassing the 272 who filed in 2016.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Caleb Frostman, the Democrat running in Wisconsin State Senate District 1, claimed victory in Tuesday's special election. Meanwhile, Ann Groves Lloyd, the Democrat running in the special election in Wisconsin State Assembly District 42, conceded to her Republican opponent.\n\nNorth Dakota Republicans chose Rep. Kevin Cramer to challenge Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, while Nevada Democrats picked Rep. Jacky Rosen as their nominee against Sen. Dean Heller. The two primaries were relatively quiet, but will be among the nation's most important battlegrounds in November.\n\nCNN was unable to project a winner in the Maine House District or either the Democrat or Republican primary for Maine governor due to the complexity of asking voters multiple questions on each race.",
    " Title: Romney Addresses NAACP, Criticizes \"Obamacare\" and Economic Conditions for Blacks\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney faced a cool reception at the NAACP annual convention in Houston on Wednesday, as he criticized the Affordable Care Act, also known as \"Obamacare,\" and addressed economic and educational issues affecting the African-American community.\n\nRomney questioned the historical loyalty of the black community to the Democratic Party, suggesting that decades of Democratic policies have failed to address persistent problems in the community. He proposed a new approach, stating, \"When decades of the same promises keep producing the same failures, then it's reasonable to rethink our approach\u2014and consider a new plan.\"\n\nThe former Massachusetts governor emphasized his support for charter schools and vouchers, a stance similar to that of the Obama administration. He also attempted to counter the perception that his campaign is focused on helping the wealthy, stating, \"The president wants to make this a campaign about blaming the rich. I want to make this a campaign about helping the middle class.\"\n\nRomney did not address the issue of voter ID laws, a topic that has been a point of contention between Republicans and civil rights groups. He acknowledged President Obama's historic election but presented economic data, including the 14.4 percent unemployment rate in the black community, to suggest that the current administration has failed to address these issues effectively.\n\nRomney referenced his father, Michigan Governor George Romney, and closed with a religious note, quoting Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. \"Every good cause on this Earth relies in the end on a plan better than ours,\" Romney said, before quoting King: \"Without dependence on God, our efforts turn to ashes and our sunrises into darkest night.\"\n\nRomney's use of the term \"Obamacare\" and his criticism of the healthcare law, which remains controversial, was met with boos from the audience. His strong case for school choice, including a proposal to link federal funding to students, rather than schools, appeals to some segments of the African-American electorate but is aimed at his conservative base.\n\nRomney also touched on his opposition to same-sex marriage, a divisive issue within the black community, and reiterated his jobs message, including his aim to reduce government spending by eliminating \"expensive nonessential programs like Obamacare.\"\n\nPeeling off African-American voters, who overwhelmingly voted for Obama in 2008, has always been a challenging task for Republicans, even without an African-American incumbent in the White House. In a statement after the speech, NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous criticized Romney's stance on the Affordable Care Act, stating, \"His criticism of the Affordable Care Act\u2014legislation that will improve access to quality health care for millions\u2014signals his fundamental misunderstanding of the needs of many African Americans.\"\n\nNAACP Chairman Roslyn M. Brock, however, praised Romney for his courage in addressing the convention directly.",
    " Title: Monster Blizzard Affects Over 70 Million People, Causes Massive Disruptions\n\nArticle:\n\nA massive blizzard, expected to impact more than 70 million people, began dumping snow across the nation's capital on Friday. The storm, which has prompted an army of plows to maintain open major arteries and transportation systems, is predicted to be one of the top three snowfalls of all-time for Washington, D.C., according to National Weather Service forecaster Daniel Peterson.\n\nThe Washington Metro subway system is set to shut down entirely late Friday night and remain closed through Sunday for the safety of workers and riders. Underground stations usually stay open during major snowstorms. Mayor Muriel Bowser urged government workers to head home by the early afternoon, warning the storm has \"life and death implications.\"\n\nTens of thousands of people crowded into the airports as more than 3,300 flights were canceled for Friday, most in Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina. Thousands more were delayed. For Saturday, over 3,300 flights were canceled, including all flights into and out of Philadelphia International Airport. All major airlines have issued waivers for travel over the weekend, allowing passengers to rebook onto earlier or later flights to avoid the storms.\n\nThe storm is expected to hit areas around the nation's capital the hardest, dropping more than 2 feet of snow. Philadelphia could get 12 to 18 inches, and New York 8 to 10 inches, although some forecasts suggest even more. Train service could be disrupted by frozen switches, the loss of third-rail electric power, or trees falling on wires.\n\nAcross the region, track workers, power company employees, road crew members, firefighters, and other first-responders were mobilized for the long weekend. In New York City, 79 subway trains will have \"scraper shoes\" to reduce icing on rails, the Metropolitan Transit Authority said.\n\nConditions quickly became treacherous as the storm moved northeast. Arkansas and Tennessee got eight inches; Kentucky got more than a foot, and states across the Deep South grappled with icy, snow-covered roads and power outages. At least eight people died in traffic fatalities in the dangerous weather.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings stretching from northern Virginia to parts of New York's Long Island, where the U.S. Coast Guard warned seas could swell up to 18 feet. The blizzard warnings are scheduled to last until early Sunday.\n\nGov. Chris Christie declared a state of emergency in New Jersey late Friday and said roadways had been pre-brined but suggested people stay home on Saturday. Forecasters also warned of \"thundersnow,\" a dangerous type of thunderstorm that drops snow instead of rain.\n\n\"The most intense part of the storm will come Saturday morning from around 4 a.m. through 12 p.m,\" said Fox 5 DC meteorologist Gary McGrady. \"We can expect heavy snow, possibly 2 inches per hour, and blizzard conditions with 30 to 35 mph winds creating legitimate whiteout conditions.\" McGrady added that his forecast called for between 1 and 2 feet of snow to fall in the national capital region before all was said and done.\n\nThe same storm system dropped 6 inches of snow in the Little Rock area overnight, breaking a snowfall record set more than 20 years ago. Schools and state government offices in central Arkansas shut down on Friday. The state's largest utility, Entergy Arkansas, said about 12,500 homes and businesses lost power.\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic region is notorious for struggling to cope with winter weather, and a light dusting on Wednesday night served as an ominous prelude to the massive blizzard. Less than an inch of snow was enough to immediately turn roadways treacherous in the District, Maryland, and northern Virginia, causing hundreds of accidents and leaving drivers gridlocked for hours. President Obama was not spared, as his motorcade slowly weaved and skidded along icy streets to the White House.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol Police said sledding on Capitol Hill\u2014which only recently became legal after an act of Congress\u2014would be welcome for the first time in decades, as long as conditions are safe. Even the start of the snowstorm could not keep some tourists from visiting the White House. On Friday afternoon, several groups and couples were walking in the park in front of the mansion, and the fountain in the home's yard was still spraying water.\n\nNewlyweds Stefan Tomic and Cherokee Tomic, both 22, were visiting from New York and had just arrived in the city Friday by bus. They said they did not want to change their plans because of the weather, and their first stop was the White House. As far south as Atlanta, people were urged to go home and stay there to avoid a repeat of the city's \"icepocalypse,\" when a fairly light winter storm in 2014 caused commuter chaos for days.\n\nNWS Director Louis Uccellini warned at a news conference that the snowfall could easily cause more than $1 billion in damage and paralyze the Eastern third of the nation. \"It does have the potential to be an extremely dangerous storm that can affect more than 50 million people,\" Uccellini said at the service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.",
    " Title: Trump's Syria Strike Sparks Controversy Among Far-Right Supporters\n\nArticle:\n\nThe sudden shift in U.S. policy towards Syria, marked by President Donald Trump's decision to launch a missile strike against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has sparked controversy among Trump's far-right supporters. This change in policy, which was met with praise from hawkish critics, has left many of Trump's supporters, who had previously supported his anti-interventionist stance, perplexed.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the strike, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley had stated that the U.S.'s focus was no longer on removing Assad from power. However, Trump's condemnation of the chemical weapons attack in Syria, which resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians, led some of his supporters to accuse him of being manipulated by a \"false flag\" operation orchestrated by deep state agents.\n\nProminent alt-right figures, such as Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones, spread conspiracy theories about the attack, with Cernovich suggesting that the attack was a staged operation and Jones blaming the attack on Democrat billionaire George Soros. Ann Coulter, a prominent Trump supporter, criticized Trump for abandoning his campaign principles, implying that he was swayed by emotional images of the attack.\n\nThe missile strike occurred hours after the removal of Steve Bannon, a key figure in the alt-right, from the National Security Council Principals Committee, which limited his access to military decision-making. Bannon's supporters quickly attributed the Syria situation to the same individuals they believed were responsible for his diminishing influence in the White House, namely Jared Kushner and the \"West Wing Democrats.\"\n\nBreitbart, a far-right news outlet, expressed disapproval of the strike by noting the praise from \"Republican Hawks,\" a term used to describe pro-war neoconservatives. Raheem Kassam, Breitbart London's editor-in-chief, spent his radio show criticizing the Trump administration and calling for an investigation into the Syria situation.\n\nThe controversy highlights the divide between Trump's far-right supporters and the more hawkish elements within the administration, as well as the potential influence of different advisors on the President's policy decisions.",
    " Title: HUD Proposes Rent Increase for Millions of Public Housing Residents\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson has unveiled a proposal that would raise the rent paid by millions of families living in federally subsidized public housing to 35 percent from 30 percent of household income. The proposal, named the Make Affordable Housing Work Act, would also eliminate all deductions that could lower the rent and evaluate rents every three years instead of annually.\n\nThe proposal, which would need to be approved by Congress, could spark a debate over supporting the country's poorest and most vulnerable families. Democrats are expected to offer strong opposition, and some members of the Republican majority may be reluctant to endorse the plan ahead of the midterm elections in the fall.\n\nUnder the proposal, rents would no longer be subject to deductions for utilities, medical expenses, or other factors that could lower the rent-to-income ratio. Elderly and disabled tenants, who make up more than half of the 4.7 million public housing families, would be exempted.\n\nCarson stated that the changes are necessary to bring more money into the system and modernize an outdated model. He argued that the current system discourages public housing residents from earning more income due to the rent-to-income ratio.\n\nTenants' rights advocates have already expressed concern over the proposal. Jack Cooper, executive director of the Massachusetts Union of Public Housing Tenants, described it as a \"war on low-income people.\" Cooper, who understands Carson's perspective as a self-made individual, expressed concern that the proposal would force families into homelessness due to the increased rent burden.\n\nCarson, a retired neurosurgeon, has long advocated for the idea that too much government support can create a culture of dependency among recipients. During a 2016 speech at his alma mater, Yale University, Carson stated, \"Government should not keep people in a dependent state. It should be used as a springboard, and not as a hammock.\"\n\nCooper, however, argued that the proposal would not encourage greater self-sufficiency but would instead force families into homelessness due to the increased rent burden. He noted that the nationwide average annual income for public housing residents is $12,000, and many families may not be able to afford the additional expenses.\n\n\"We're talking about keeping a roof over people who can't afford the market,\" Cooper said. \"They're devastating folks that are already in dire straits.\"",
    " Title: Georgia Senator Saxby Chambliss Breaks with Anti-Tax Pledge, Cites National Debt Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from the long-standing anti-tax pledge advocated by conservative activist Grover Norquist, U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) has expressed his dissent, stating that he values the wellbeing of his country over a 20-year-old pledge. In an interview with Georgia television station WMAZ, a CNN affiliate, on Wednesday, Chambliss expressed his disagreement with Norquist's stance on the U.S. budget deficit and the potential consequences of the fiscal cliff.\n\nThe U.S. Congress is facing a year-end deadline to reach an agreement on addressing the U.S. budget deficit or implement other measures to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, which experts warn could lead the country back into recession. The budget standoff centers on disagreements over how to generate new revenue to reduce the deficit.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and Senate Democrats advocate for increasing tax rates for the wealthiest Americans, while House Republicans, who control the majority in that chamber, favor alternative methods for generating revenue, such as closing certain tax loopholes and eliminating deductions.\n\nNorquist, who heads the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform, has been successful in persuading a strong majority of congressional Republicans to sign his pledge not to raise taxes. Many GOP candidates who ran for office also signed the promise, but a small number of freshman lawmakers have rejected the idea that they are bound to the document this year.\n\nAccording to the Americans for Tax Reform website, Chambliss, along with 38 other senators and 219 House members entering the next Congress, have signed the pledge. However, Chambliss, who has previously criticized Norquist's influence on anti-tax sentiments, stated this week that Norquist's ideas are obstructing the search for a solution to the mounting debt.\n\n\"Norquist has no plan to pay this debt down,\" said Chambliss, who is up for re-election in 2014. The anti-tax crusader has stated that he predicts congressional Republicans will hold firm and negotiate a deal that excludes tax hikes.\n\nWhen asked if Chambliss is concerned Norquist may use his resources to challenge his re-election bid, the senator replied, \"In all likelihood, yes.\"\n\n\"But I do not worry about that because I care too much about my country,\" he said. \"I care a lot more about it than I do Grover Norquist.\" The two-term senator from Georgia added he is \"willing to do the right thing and let the political consequences take care of themselves.\"",
    " Title: Republican Candidates in Ohio and Kansas Face Tight Races, Raising Concerns for Party Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Republican candidates backed by President Donald Trump narrowly led in closely watched races in Ohio and Kansas on Wednesday, concerns grew in Republican circles about their ability to continue extending millions of dollars in aid to candidates in November's Congressional elections.\n\nIn Ohio's 12th congressional district, Republican Troy Balderson may have eked out a victory in a special election for a U.S. House of Representatives seat, but was leading Democrat Danny O'Connor by only about 1,700 votes or less than 1.0 percent. The final result could be days away as state officials count more than 8,000 provisional and absentee ballots.\n\nIn the Kansas primary to select a Republican candidate for November's mid-term U.S. elections, Kris Kobach was unable to convert an endorsement by Trump into a resounding victory. He clung to a 191-vote lead over his Republican primary opponent, current Governor Jeff Colyer, with potentially thousands more provisional and absentee ballots outstanding.\n\nThe narrow margin in Ohio is attributed to the $4 million-plus the party and outside groups pumped into the district in the final weeks to boost voter turnout. The infusion of cash into a district that has been represented by Republicans for 30 years further triggered alarm bells for the party.\n\nIn November, all 435 U.S. House members and one-third of the Senate stand for reelection. Democrats need to pick up 23 seats to take control of the House, and there are dozens of seats currently held by Republicans with larger Democratic populations than the Ohio district.\n\n\"Moving forward, we cannot expect to win tough races when our candidate is being outraised,\" said Corry Bliss, executive director of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican Super PAC that supported Balderson in Ohio. \"Any Republican running for Congress getting vastly outraised by an opponent needs to start raising more money.\"\n\nBliss's group, as of mid-July, had raised $96.6 million and had $73.3 million in remaining cash.\n\nRepublicans hope Balderson's narrow win on election night will jolt the field out of complacency. The biggest unknown may be just how much cash remains for Republicans to tap.\n\nCasino executive Sheldon Adelson, historically a large donor, has already kicked in $30 million to help Republicans. However, the network of donors managed by Charles and David Koch have gone in the opposite direction, warning Republicans they may not support their candidates in large part because of Trump's protectionist trade policies.\n\nThere may still be a well of cash for Republicans thanks to the deep-pocketed donors delighted last year when Republicans passed sweeping tax cuts.\n\n\"There is going to be an awful lot of thank-you checks written for the tax bill,\" Brettell said.\n\nIn Democratic circles, the Ohio results were cast as a win, even if their candidate was not victorious. Other Republicans, including Vice President Mike Pence and Ohio Governor John Kasich, had rushed to Balderson's aid in a district Kasich once represented.\n\n\"He should be running scared this fall,\" said David Pepper, chair of the Ohio Democratic Party, regarding Balderson, who faces O'Connor in a rematch on Nov. 6. \"He's not going to have Donald Trump, Mike Pence, and all that money bailing him out.\"\n\nBoth races left unanswered questions about whether Trump will be able to lift endangered members to victory, regardless of how much cash they have. Trump took credit for Balderson's lead, writing on Twitter that the campaign took \"a big turn for the better\" after he appeared in the district on Saturday.\n\nHowever, Pepper noted that Trump's presence energizes Democrats as well, adding that \"if he thinks that finish in this district is a good result, all power to him.\"\n\nThe Ohio race mirrored other special federal elections over the past 12 months, including upsets by Democrat Conor Lamb in a Pennsylvania congressional race in March and by Democrat Doug Jones over Roy Moore for an Alabama Senate seat in December of last year. Trump stumped for both candidates in losing efforts.\n\nIn those races, rural voters favored Trump-supported candidates, but turnout in those regions lagged heavy suburban turnout, where Democrats expanded on margins won by Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nKobach had hoped to ride his ties to Trump to victory after the president endorsed him in a tweet, but even as Kobach sought to declare himself the virtual winner on Wednesday, he acknowledged he could still lose, and a protracted recount could aid Democrats. Kansas state law allows for a recount if the vote margin is within half a percentage point, but the candidate has to request the recount. The candidate who requests the recount must pay for it if the results are unchanged by that process, Kobach said.",
    " Title: White House Condemns Extremist Groups, Including White Supremacists and Neo-Nazis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, a White House spokesman confirmed that President Donald Trump explicitly condemns all extremist groups, including white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and other extremist organizations. The spokesman stated, \"The President said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi, and all extremist groups.\" The spokesman further added that Trump called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.\n\nThe President's statement on Saturday was met with criticism for not specifically calling out and condemning white supremacist groups. Among the critics was former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who told ABC News that Trump should have been much harsher. Scaramucci stated, \"I wouldn't have recommended that statement. I think he would have needed to have been much harsher.\"\n\nWhile in New Jersey, Trump described the Charlottesville rally as an \"egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides.\" Many political observers deemed the President's response as not aggressive enough, given that a member of the alt-right allegedly drove a car through a group of antifa protesters, resulting in one death and at least 19 injuries.\n\nScaramucci added, \"With the moral authority of the presidency, you have to call that stuff out.\" Other Republicans also expressed their opinions on Trump's statement publicly. GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch stated on Twitter, \"We should call evil by its name. My brother didn't give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home.\" GOP Sen. Cory Gardner urged Trump to declare the incident an act of terror. Gardner said, \"Mr. President \u2013 we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists, and this was domestic terrorism.\"",
    " Title: Media Concerns Arise Over Mueller's Statement on Trump-Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected move, Special Counsel Robert Mueller publicly disputed reported allegations related to the Trump-Russia investigation, sparking concerns within the media about potential backlash from Mueller's announcement. However, these worries were not centered on media accuracy but rather on the perception that Mueller had confirmed President Donald Trump's \"fake news\" label.\n\nJeffery Toobin, a senior CNN analyst and writer for The New Yorker, expressed his concerns on-air following Mueller's announcement. \"I have a different view of the implications of all this,\" Toobin told CNN's Anderson Cooper. \"My view is the larger message that a lot of people are going to take from this story is that the news media are a bunch of leftist liars who are dying to get the president, and they're willing to lie to do it.\" Toobin added, \"I just think this is a bad day for us.\"\n\nCNN anchor Chris Cuomo also observed that \"Mueller did not do the media any favors.\" \"And he did do the president one, because as you saw with Rudy Giuliani and as I'm sure you'll see with the president himself, this allows them to say, 'You can't believe it. You can't believe what you read, you can't believe what you hear, you can only believe us,'\" Cuomo said.\n\nIn response to the development, Trump characterized the situation as \"a very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our country!\" He later denounced \"fake news\" as the \"enemy of the people.\" The president's statement referred to Buzzfeed, which released the \"discredited 'Dossier,'\" a document paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats as opposition research, on which the entire Russian probe is based.",
    " Title: U.S. Admits 12,587 Syrian Refugees in FY 2016, 98.2% Are Sunni Muslims\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States admitted a total of 12,587 Syrian refugees during the 2016 fiscal year, surpassing the target President Obama declared last fall by 2,587 (20.5%). The majority of the refugees are Sunni Muslims, with 12,363 (98.2%) identifying as such, while another 103 are identified as Muslims and 20 as Shi'a Muslims.\n\nSixty-eight of the 12,587 Syrian refugees (0.5%) are Christians. This group includes 16 Catholics, eight Orthodox, five Protestants, four Jehovah's Witnesses, one Greek Orthodox, and 34 refugees who self-identified as simply Christians.\n\nThe remaining Syrian refugees resettled in the U.S. in FY 2016 are 24 Yazidis, eight refugees with religion given as \"other,\" and one with \"no religion.\"\n\nIn the final month of the fiscal year, 1,847 Syrian refugees were admitted, with 1,812 being Sunnis, 13 being other Muslims, 12 being Christians, seven being Yazidis, and three being \"other\" religion.\n\nThroughout the year, the numbers of Christians and other religious minorities among the Syrians granted refugee status in the U.S. were dwarfed by those of Sunni Muslims. Although the majority of Syrians are Sunnis, the number of Sunnis among the refugees was still disproportionately high, and the number of Christians disproportionately low, when compared to the overall population makeup.\n\nWhen the conflict began in 2011, an estimated 10% of the Syrian population (1.5-1.7 million) was Christian, and 74% was Sunni Muslim. In contrast, Christians accounted for just half of one percent of the refugees resettled in the United States in FY 2016, while Sunnis accounted for 98.2%.\n\nThe United Nations reports that 4,806,702 million Syrians are registered as \"persons of concern\" in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and North Africa. It does not provide a denominational breakdown.\n\nEstimates of the number of Christians who have fled their homeland vary, but the European Parliament this year said at least 700,000 had done so, while a Chaldean Catholic bishop from Aleppo last March put the figure at at least one million.\n\nThe U.S. government administration has determined that atrocities carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS/ISIL) against religious minorities in areas under its control amount to genocide. Administration officials say, however, that its refugee program does not and will not prioritize any particular religious group when considering Syrians' applications.\n\nPresident Obama has not declared a target figure for Syrian refugee admissions for FY 2017, although a recent report to Congress stated that the administration \"aims to admit a significantly higher number\" of Syrian refugees in the new fiscal year than the 10,000 target initially set for FY 2016.\n\nAssistant Secretary of State Anne Richard said last week that even though the department is working with a stipulated target for FY 2017, \"this administration has been very clear that we want to bring more Syrians, so my own guidance to our staff is that we want to bring even more than we brought this year.\"\n\nOver the course of the conflict that began when small anti-government protests in early 2011 were met with a harsh crackdown by the Assad regime and later widened into a convoluted civil war, the U.S. has resettled a total of 14,460 Syrian refugees \u2013 87% of them during FY 2016. Of those 14,460, 14,082 (97.3%) are Sunnis, 196 (1.3%) are Shi'a and other Muslims, and 124 (0.8%) are Christians. The rest are 25 Yazidis, six Zoroastrians, three atheists, two Baha'i, 14 refugees with \"other\" religion, and eight with \"no religion.\"",
    " Title: Autopsy Report Suggests Michael Brown Was Shot Multiple Times, Family Calls for Arrest of Officer Darren Wilson\n\nArticle:\n\nA preliminary autopsy report, conducted at the family's request, suggests that Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black man who was fatally shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on August 9, was shot at least six times, including twice in the head. The autopsy was performed by pathologist Michael Baden, who shared his opinion that Brown did not suffer before his death.\n\nAt a news conference in Ferguson, Missouri, attorney Benjamin Crump, representing the Brown family, stated that Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, asked, \"What else do we need to get them to arrest the killer of my child?\" Crump also revealed that Baden shared his opinion that Brown could have survived all of his wounds except for the shot to the top of his head.\n\nBaden explained that the shot to the top of Brown's head was probably sustained last, hitting him as he was bending over, and exited through his right eye. The pathologist also stated that six bullets entered Brown's body, and at least two bullets ricocheted and traveled back through his body. Bullet wounds to Brown's arms could have been sustained by putting his hands up or crossing his arms, according to Baden.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a separate federal autopsy of Brown, which was being performed by a U.S. military medical examiner on Monday. Holder stated that the additional autopsy would be thorough and aid in the investigation. The Justice Department is conducting a separate inquiry into possible civil rights violations related to the shooting.\n\nBaden also mentioned that a final autopsy report would require study of the clothes Brown was wearing to see if they contained gunshot residue, which would indicate whether at least one shot was fired at close range. No residue was found on Brown's body, according to Baden.\n\nThe St. Louis County Medical Examiner's autopsy concluded that Brown died of gunshot wounds, but other details have not been released. The Washington Post, citing a person familiar with that autopsy, said the county autopsy indicates Brown was shot six to eight times and that he had marijuana in his system. Suzanne McCune, administrator of the medical examiner's office, stated that the office is only providing information that Brown died of gunshot wounds to the head and chest and could not confirm the marijuana report.\n\nShawn Parcells, a forensic pathologist assistant who helped conduct the autopsy requested by Brown's family, told CNN on Monday afternoon that he was surprised that the preliminary results of the autopsy were not released sooner. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a separate, third autopsy, citing the \"extraordinary\" nature of the case at the request of Brown's family.",
    " Title: The Evolution of Journalism: A Look at the Past and Present\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent layoffs at digital news outlets BuzzFeed, Huffington Post, and Vice have sparked concerns about the state of journalism and its impact on democracy. Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, a former Facebook employee and author, suggests that the Founding Fathers, such as Ben Franklin and Samuel Adams, would find today's journalistic landscape unrecognizable, but would recognize social media, blogs, and partisan outlets like Daily Kos or National Review.\n\nGarc\u00eda Mart\u00edzen argues that the concept of journalistic objectivity, which is often considered a cornerstone of modern journalism, is a relatively recent development in American history. In the past, newspapers were overtly political, and a name like The Press Democrat would have signified a Democratic party affiliation. Advertising was a minor concern, as party leaders encouraged members to subscribe to their local party organ.\n\nThe shift towards a more neutral, advertising-driven model occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in response to the growth of the national market for consumer goods after the Civil War. Newspapers increased the number of ads relative to content and moved away from political partisanship to expand circulation. This change was driven by both ideals and greed, as newspapers sought to reach larger audiences and generate more revenue.\n\nJill Abramson, former executive editor of The New York Times, offers insights into this collision between the legacy grandeur and profitability of journalism and the current zeitgeist in her memoir, Merchants of Truth. In one scene, the Times' CEO asks Abramson to come up with new revenue ideas, to which she indignantly responds, \"If that's what you expect, you have the wrong executive editor.\" This disconnect between editorial and business would have been inconceivable to a reborn Founding Father journalist, who would have embraced new monetization ideas.",
    " Title: DHS Confirms Use of DACA Recipients' Information for Deportation Proceedings\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has confirmed that personal information provided by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients can be used for immigration enforcement proceedings. This information, which includes sensitive details about their residences, workplaces, and schools, was provided by the recipients during the application process.\n\nIn a memo, the DHS stated that US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the agency responsible for handling DACA, would not proactively provide a list of DACA recipients' personal information to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for immigration enforcement purposes. However, if ICE officers request such information, USCIS will provide it.\n\nThe Trump administration has signaled that they will not defend the constitutionality of DACA, as they question its legality, particularly in regards to the separation of powers. The GOP has long criticized DACA as executive overreach, and a dozen Republican state attorneys general have threatened to sue the administration if they settle the DACA issue. As a result, the program was ended with a six-month enforcement delay to allow Congress time to pass DACA-like legislation.\n\nRecently, there has been a debate in Congress and the media regarding the enforcement of DACA. While this discussion continues, two DACA recipients were apprehended by the Border Patrol for smuggling illegal immigrants across the border. This incident highlights the ongoing tension between border security and immigration policy.\n\nSenate Republicans, such as Tom Cotton from Arkansas, see this as an opportunity to push for the passage of the RAISE Act, which aims to overhaul the green card process to prioritize immigrants with high skills and includes a language provision. This proposal is met with opposition from Democrats, who view any aspect of border security as anathema.",
    " Title: Neutral Analysis on George Zimmerman Case: A Journalist's Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nThe George Zimmerman case, a highly debated topic in recent times, has seen various opinions expressed by public figures such as former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. However, a practicing attorney and columnist, with experience in a murder trial, offers a neutral perspective on the matter.\n\nThe attorney, who once served as lead counsel for a 17-year-old boy facing the death penalty, has chosen to remain silent on the Zimmerman verdict. The complexity of the laws governing such serious cases and the impact of testimony and evidence make it difficult to second-guess the strategy of the prosecution or defense, or to judge the jury's decision.\n\nThe attorney notes that legal analysts, while their opinions may vary, are grounded in law and experience. However, when politicians and political pundits pass judgment on a jury's decision, their comments are often uninformed.\n\nThe attorney also addresses the ongoing discussions about \"stand your ground\" laws in Florida and other states. They point out that the defense in the Zimmerman case did not rely on this particular law, and that the arguments over its effectiveness and potential problems are not central to the courtroom proceedings.\n\nFurthermore, the attorney questions the practicality of stricter laws against racial profiling, as it may be challenging for Congress to determine if an individual is racially profiling another. They also question the applicability of such laws to all races and the treatment of individuals by others.\n\nThe attorney concludes by acknowledging that Trayvon Martin's death is a fact that cannot be undone, and that Zimmerman, despite being declared \"not guilty,\" faces a sense of a \"sentence\" due to the hatred and threats he faces. The attorney, with a passing interest in the case, expresses a lack of qualification to opine on the merits of this case, given their limited experience in murder trials.",
    " Title: Barr and Mueller: A Clash of Perspectives in the Release of Mueller Report\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General William Barr testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 1, 2019, following a letter from Special Counsel Robert Mueller expressing concerns about Barr's summary of the Mueller report's findings.\n\nThe release of Barr's summary of the Mueller report's top-line conclusions sparked controversy, with Democrats and the press focusing on the process of the report's release rather than its content. The full 400-page report was later made public with redactions.\n\nBarr's decision to release a summary of the report's findings was aimed at providing a swift assessment of whether President Donald Trump had conspired with Russian officials. He opposed the subsequent release of summaries of the report, preferring to release the entire report at once.\n\nMueller, in a letter to Barr, expressed concerns about the summary and the public's perception of it. However, Mueller did not dispute the accuracy of Barr's summary, as Barr noted that Mueller did not \"exonerate\" Trump on obstruction.\n\nBarr is facing accusations of perjury in prior congressional testimony regarding his handling of the report. During a conversation with Representative Charlie Crist (Fla.), Barr stated that he was unaware of specific complaints from unnamed Mueller staff regarding the summary's release to the press. He also offered his own perspective on why he chose not to release summaries of the report.\n\nWhat is notable about this episode is that Mueller, or people close to him, were reportedly concerned about the media coverage and political discussion surrounding the report, particularly its perceived lack of damning evidence against the president. This is not a prosecutorial concern, but a political one that is unbecoming of individuals entrusted with immense investigative power in the name of objectivity.\n\nThe ongoing debate between Barr and Mueller, as well as the media's coverage of the issue, continues to generate controversy and speculation. The focus on process rather than content has led to accusations and counter-accusations, highlighting the political polarization that surrounds the Trump administration.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking the Dakota Access Pipeline Controversy: A Neutral Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) has been a subject of intense controversy, with anti-fracking activists and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe voicing concerns over the project's potential impact on tribal lands and the environment. However, a closer look at the facts surrounding the DAPL reveals a more nuanced picture.\n\nThe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe did not participate in the initial consulting process regarding the DAPL route, according to court documents. The Army Corps of Engineers attempted more than a dozen times between 2014 and 2016 to discuss the DAPL route with the tribe, but the tribe either failed to respond or delayed the process.\n\nThe DAPL runs parallel to an already existing pipeline, the Northern Border Pipeline, built in 1982, which has never received protests or complaints from demonstrators associated with Standing Rock. The government rerouted the DAPL several times to avoid tribal lands, and the modifications were made to avoid 91 of the 149 eligible sites containing stone features considered sacred by American Indian tribes.\n\nThe DAPL route does not cut through Standing Rock's reservation, and the tribe has argued that the land is theirs under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851. However, the treaty was forged between the U.S. government and the Great Sioux Nation, not Standing Rock. The tribe has challenged the treaty and others like it in court for not being honored.\n\nEminent domain was not used on the North Dakota route, and Energy Transfer Partners relied on voluntary easements to construct the pipeline's southern route near Standing Rock Sioux's reservation. Federal officials are refusing to evict protesters occupying private property along the DAPL route, citing free speech rights. Eminent domain was used in other portions of the route in Iowa, prompting farmers to sue the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) in an effort to prevent the company from gaining the right to use the property-seizing tool.\n\nInvestments in pipelines like DAPL have increased by 60% since 2010, according to an American Petroleum Institute study, and have nearly doubled from $56.3 billion in 2010 to $89.6 billion in 2013. The increase has likely raised concerns among environmentalists about the use of eminent domain.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers evaluated the Bismarck route, eventually concluding it was not a viable option due to the project's close proximity to the capital's municipal water supply wells. The department also determined the northern route would have made it difficult to stay 500 or more feet away from homes, a policy required in North Dakota. The southern route near Standing Rock's reservation is mostly rural, making it easier for the pipeline to be constructed with as little environmental impact as possible. The Army Corps of Engineers deemed the new pipeline route crossing Lake Ohae safe in an environmental assessment.",
    " Title: Trump Disputes Puerto Rico Hurricane Death Toll, Sparking Controversy Amidst Approaching Hurricane Florence\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has disputed the official findings that nearly 3,000 people died in Puerto Rico as a result of last year's hurricanes. In a series of tweets, Mr. Trump claimed, \"3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico,\" without providing evidence for the claim.\n\nThe official death toll of 2,975 was released last month after an independent study by George Washington University. The study concluded that the initial death toll of 64 only included those killed directly by hurricanes Maria and Irma, either by drowning, flying debris, or building collapse. George Washington University also counted those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor healthcare provision, a lack of electricity, and clean water.\n\nThe politics surrounding the death toll have become a contentious issue, with Democrats accusing Mr. Trump of downplaying the disaster's impact on Puerto Rico. The president's tweets came as Hurricane Florence, a category two storm projected to bring catastrophic flooding, bore down on the U.S. East Coast.\n\nThe governor of Puerto Rico, who commissioned the research, said he accepted the estimate as official. Puerto Rico's Mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, responded to Mr. Trump's tweets, stating, \"Mr. Trump, you can try and bully us with your tweets BUT WE KNOW OUR LIVES MATTER.\"\n\nIn response to the criticism, Mr. Trump hailed the U.S. response in Puerto Rico as \"an incredible, unsung success.\" This statement was met with backlash from Puerto Rican officials, with San Juan's Mayor Cruz describing Mr. Trump's handling of Maria as a \"stain on his presidency.\"\n\nThe U.S. federal government's response to Hurricane Maria has come under fresh scrutiny this week, with photos emerging showing 20,000 pallets of bottled water meant for victims still sitting on a runway in Ceiba, Puerto Rico, a year after the storm. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is currently investigating whether or not it placed the water bottles on the runway and, if so, will \"fess up.\"\n\nThe ongoing controversy surrounding the death toll and the federal government's response to Hurricane Maria has sparked criticism from both political parties. Even some of Mr. Trump's fellow Republicans have spoken out against him, with Florida Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen calling the president's tweets \"mind-boggling.\" Florida Governor Rick Scott, who is currently running for the U.S. Senate, tweeted, \"I've been to Puerto Rico 7 times & saw devastation firsthand. The loss of any life is tragic.\"\n\nThe ongoing debate over the death toll and the federal government's response to Hurricane Maria has raised questions about the U.S. government's ability to effectively respond to natural disasters in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories.",

The decline in risk assets continued on Thursday, with U.S. stock indexes set to close in bear-market territory.\n\nThe World Health Organization declared COVID-19, the infectious disease first identified in Wuhan, China, in December, a pandemic on Wednesday. This declaration, along with President Donald Trump's Oval Office address about the pandemic, failed to alleviate market anxieties going into trading on Thursday.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has infected over 127,000 people and claimed nearly 4,700 lives worldwide. Market experts fear that the pandemic could disrupt global supply chains and drive the global economy into recession.\n\nThe Dow DJIA, +9.36%, composed of 30 blue-chip companies, has been pulled lower by a significant decline in shares of component Boeing Co.

The Nasdaq tumbled 4.7%, to end at 7,952.05.\n\nStocks dropped into correction mode, defined as a pullback of 10%, late last month as fears over the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak began to rise.\n\nThere is some hope that a stint in bear-market territory will be short-lived if the viral outbreak is effectively mitigated by governments and central banks across the globe. Historically, the period in a bear market can be lengthy.\n\nOn average, a bear market for the Dow lasts 206 trading days, while the average bear period for the S&P 500 is about 146 days, according to data from Dow Jones Market Data. The Dow is currently off 29% from its Feb. 12 record, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are 27% from their Feb. 19 peaks, as of late Thursday.\n\nThe move for the Dow also represents the blue-chip index's fastest move from a record high to a bear market since 1931\u201419 days. In November 1931, as the Great Depression was enveloping the U.S., the Dow took a brisk 15 days from a record to a drop of at least 20%.",
    " Title: African-American Trump Supporter Faces Criticism and Discrimination\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - Devinn Smart, a 24-year-old African-American supporter of President Donald Trump, has faced criticism and discrimination for his political views. In an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 News, Smart expressed his belief that Trump will win the 2020 presidential election by a landslide.\n\nSmart, who grew up in a family of die-hard Democrats and attended a historically black university in Hampton, Virginia, initially held a different political view. However, after researching Trump's policies, he became a supporter.\n\nIn 2016, Smart did not vote, but after Trump's election, he publicly declared his support on Twitter, complete with a \"Make America Great Again\" hat. This decision led to a barrage of insults, including being called a \"coon,\" a \"bootlicker,\" and an \"Uncle Tom\" due to his support for the president.\n\nSmart has also faced discrimination in his role as a preacher. Twice, he was disinvited from spiritual revival conferences in Virginia after the organizers learned of his political views. In one instance, a pastor asked Smart to denounce his support for Trump on Twitter or be disinvited. Smart refused, questioning the pastor's adherence to biblical principles.\n\nDespite the backlash, Smart remains steadfast in his support for Trump. He cites the historically low unemployment rate for African-Americans, the groundbreaking prison reform law, and the record amount of federal money allocated to historically black colleges as achievements that may be paying political dividends.\n\nIn 2016, Trump won eight percent of the black vote. A new poll shows him with almost double that now at 15 percent. Smart attended the White House in October as part of the Black Leadership Summit. During the event, he and a friend had a unique experience. They asked President Trump if they could pray, and he granted their request. The friend's subsequent prayer has since gone viral.\n\nSmart believes there are many other African-Americans who support Trump but are too afraid to express their views publicly. He shared that he received over 100 messages on Twitter from people who support Trump but are not as vocal as he is.\n\nThe Trump Campaign is hopeful that Smart's prediction of a strong African-American voter turnout in 2020 will come to fruition.",

The show portrays witchcraft as a tool to combat evil, sparking debate among some who argue that it is merely make-believe and poses no concern for children.\n\nHowever, a former witch and lesbian, Jenny Weaver, expressed caution to parents regarding the content their children consume. In an interview with \"The Prayer Link,\" Weaver shared her personal experiences and the impact that similar media had on her life.\n\nWeaver, who grew up in a dysfunctional home and battled depression, recounted her connection to the 1996 movie \"The Craft,\" which follows four high school witches with immense power. Weaver saw the power portrayed in the movie as an escape from her struggles, leading her to self-harm and eventually becoming a practicing witch.\n\n\"I remember hearing these voices, 'Just kill yourself. Just go away. It would be better off if you would just die.' And so, I started to cut my wrists severely,\" Weaver explained, detailing the 56 cuts she inflicted on her arms.\n\nWeaver's self-harm opened a door to the demonic realm, leading her to practice witchcraft, study Wiccan religion, and engage in spells and incantations. She emphasized the importance of parents being mindful of the media their children consume, stating, \"It's not a joke when we say be careful what your children are watching.\"\n\nWeaver also shared her experiences with lesbianism and drug addiction, which she overcame after years of struggle.

The investigation reveals that sophisticated hackers now have the capability to strike at any moment they choose.\n\nThe power grid, which supplies power to the military, mass transit, business, and millions of Americans, is protected 24/7 against physical and cyber attacks. However, the AP investigation reports that, in the past decade, nearly a dozen times foreign hackers have gained remote access to networks that run the grid.\n\nEireann Leverett, with the Cambridge Center for Risk Studies, stated, \"We're still in this era where everyone believes it's secure by default... and it's not.\" Stephen Swick, with American Electric Power, added, \"We're seeing people looking for vulnerabilities, people scanning to see what types of openings they can find.\"\n\nSome of the attacks against the U.S. power grid are believed to have been carried out by hacking teams from Russia, China, and Iran, with ISIS also attempting to hack American power companies. Alejandro Mayorkas, with the Department of Homeland Security, stated, \"We are not where we need to be and we are very, very focused on getting to where we need to be.\"\n\nAs of now, intrusions into the networks that control the power grid have not caused the catastrophic blackout that experts fear. However, it is believed that many cyber attackers already have the information they need to do just that, giving them the capability to strike at will.\n\nSwick warned, \"It's all real. There's lots of variables and lots of potentials that could happen.\" The Department of Homeland Security emphasizes public and private cooperation as the key to fighting cyber attacks.

Carter's stance on critical issues such as Guantanamo Bay, Ukraine, and troop deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan differed from the White House's, prompting a response from the White House.\n\nWhite House spokesman Joshua Ernest cautioned that President Obama, not Mr. Carter, sets policy. In response to questions about Carter's testimony on arming Ukraine against Russian aggression, Ernest stated, \"A decision like this will be made by the commander in chief.\"\n\nTwo of Obama's previous defense chiefs, Robert Gates and outgoing Secretary Chuck Hagel, have publicly expressed frustration over what they perceived as White House micromanagement of the Pentagon.\n\nCarter, who is popular in the Senate and whose nomination is all but assured, faced questions from Republican senators on the Senate Armed Services Committee about his plans to remain independent. Carter immediately took the challenge, expressing support for sending arms to Ukraine in the fight against Russian separatists, a stance that differs from Obama's.\n\nCarter did not specify the weapons to be considered but said, \"I incline in the direction of providing them with arms, including to get to what I'm sure your question is, lethal arms.\"\n\nAt the White House, Ernest was peppered with questions and tried to put a positive face on a new defense secretary who is unafraid to express his opinions publicly. Carter was described as a \"strong believer in the chain of command.\"\n\nCarter also assured lawmakers he would not allow the White House to pressure him into rapidly closing the U.S. military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In a statement made just the day before, Carter expressed doubt about Obama's goal of closing Gitmo, despite supporting it.\n\nSenator John McCain, the chairman of the committee and an Arizona Republican, expressed concerns about White House micromanagement of the Defense Department and over-centralization of foreign and defense policy.

The job growth and unemployment rate fell short of expectations, as economists were anticipating approximately 180,000 new jobs and a slight decrease in the unemployment rate to 4.8%.\n\nThe U.S. economy has experienced 78 consecutive months of job growth. The job growth for the past few months was revised, with June numbers decreasing to 271,000 from the initially reported 292,000, and July numbers increasing to 275,000 from the previously reported 255,000. The net change was a slight drop, with about 1,000 fewer jobs added in the past two months than the BLS had originally believed.\n\nAverage hourly earnings rose by 3 cents, to $25.73. The percentage of involuntary part-time workers, as well as the labor force participation rate and the number of long-term unemployed, all saw little change.\n\nService-providing sectors performed well last month, with food services, social assistance, professional and technical services, and financial activities all experiencing growth. Health care jobs continue to increase, but at a slower pace than recent months. Mining employment, on the other hand, continues its long decline.\n\nThe jobs report has been closely monitored in recent months, as the Federal Reserve considers raising interest rates for only the second time since the global financial crisis.

    " Title: \"Lenny McAllister Advocates for a More Consistent and Resourceful Approach to Post-COVID-19 Economic Recovery\"\n\nArticle:\n\nLenny McAllister, Director of Western Pennsylvania for the Commonwealth Foundation, an award-winning think tank based in Pennsylvania, has called for a more consistent and resourceful approach to economic recovery in the post-COVID-19 world. McAllister, who has appeared on Fox News, The Blaze, Sirius XM Radio, and other outlets, argues that the discussion around re-opening local economies should be more in line with the spirit and successes of America.\n\nMcAllister contends that, during times of crisis, people tend to act out of either fear or resourcefulness. He suggests that, for weeks, too many Americans have acted out of fear, leading to over-arching, non-transparent, and single-tracked subjective decision-making that has caused harm to both those who contracted COVID-19 and those who have not.\n\nIn his opinion piece, McAllister argues that it is time for Americans to change course and think bigger. He believes that the old question of \"fight or flight\" still applies, but that we must fight smartly, confidently, yet differently. McAllister suggests that we must fight back against all impacts of the virus, not just the health crisis.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, McAllister makes the case for re-opening America for a variety of reasons, including the fact that the curve has flattened, and hospitals are not currently overrun. He also points out that experts have shown that the worst-case scenarios given for fatalities linked to COVID-19 were over-estimated, with some calling for \"...time to end the COVID-19 Hysteria...\" Even many epidemiologists are critiquing how often the models for projections are inconsistent at best.\n\nMcAllister argues that it is time to re-open our society and bolster our consumer-driven economy, leaning on the time-tested ingenuity of the American people. He believes that personal responsibility, consumer-driven decision-making, and business innovation can keep us safe while getting people back to work.\n\nMcAllister points out that \"big box\" stores such as Target, Publix, and Wal-Mart have remained open during some of the strictest shelter-in-place orders and kept their customers safe. He questions why we cannot also trust small business owners, who are often family-owned and locally-invested, to do the same. After all, they are the type of business operators that can least afford to flub social distancing and safety guidelines at the risk of losing their hard-earned consumer base due to small margins of operating expenses, leaving very little room for error.\n\nMcAllister also highlights the example of distillers stepping up and pivoting their businesses when Americans were in short supply of hand sanitizers. He expects them and other manufacturers to step up once again, revving up their economic engines while adjusting their business practices to keep their employees and customers safe.\n\nAccording to McAllister, businesses exist to make profit and provide value, not just for their stakeholders, but for their consumers as well. That value includes providing proven quality in their products but also safe environments for commerce. He believes that, through innovation, businesses can survive and society can thrive.\n\nMcAllister cites examples from American history, such as the weight-related epidemic in America, the Tylenol tampering cases of the early 1980s, and the evolution of car safety, to illustrate how businesses have adapted to changing circumstances. He argues that our post-curve-flattening world is very much the same, and that our successful re-opening must be driven mostly by the power of free markets, not free-wheeling governors.\n\nMcAllister concludes that, with more people making good, self-directed decisions to keep us all safe while getting our economy and society back on track, we can have more assurances that more people can overcome the medical, social, economic, and emotional impacts of COVID-19. He believes that, with more people in the fight, there will become more ways for us to overcome the aftermath of the virus safely.",
    " Title: Trump Super PACs Struggle to Raise Funds Amidst Campaign's Bombastic Rhetoric\n\nArticle:\n\nSuper PACs supporting Donald Trump's presidential campaign are facing difficulties in fundraising due to the candidate's controversial rhetoric and unclear financial support expectations. According to the Federal Election Commission, Trump's campaign war chest is significantly smaller than Hillary Clinton's, with Clinton having $42.5 million in the bank at the start of June compared to Trump's $1.3 million.\n\nTrump has repeatedly taunted big donors and boasted for months that his campaign would not rely on them or Super PACs. However, recent statements suggest a change in his stance.\n\nBillionaire broadcaster Stan Hubbard, who has donated $100,000 to the pro-Trump Great America Pac, criticized Trump's recent trip to Scotland and his comments about the plunge in the pound post-Brexit. Hubbard stated, \"He should have let his kids do it.\"\n\nSimilarly, potential Super PAC donors have expressed concerns about Trump's rhetoric and the need for a clearer, less bombastic message. Michael Epstein, who has raised significant funds for Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, said he might back a Super PAC if Trump demonstrates more presidential behavior and shows a strong performance at the Republican National Convention. However, Epstein expressed doubts, stating, \"I\u2019m less and less hopeful. He can\u2019t get out of his own way.\"\n\nFour key pro-Trump Super PACs have been launched, but they have run only about $5 million in ads combined, compared to the leading pro-Clinton Super PAC, Priorities USA Action, which reportedly began a massive ad blitz in mid-May worth almost $130 million.\n\nSigns of turmoil and slow growth among the Trump Super PACs, which can accept unlimited donations, are evident. Texas mega-donor Doug Deason, who has met with Trump, stated that the candidate's top fundraiser had signaled that a new Super PAC, Make America Number One, backed by hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, was the \"official\" one. However, Make America Number One is reportedly seeking big checks from GOP donors who are not yet ready to back Trump but want to stop Clinton.\n\nBillionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who has pledged some $100 million to help Trump, has been cautious and slow in opening his checkbook after at least two meetings with Trump since late May. Adelson is said to be considering setting up his own Super PAC and discussing cobbling one together to help Trump, according to fundraising sources.\n\nOther wealthy donors, including Bernie Marcus and Toby Neugebauer, are reportedly being considered by Adelson for teaming up on a Super PAC. Adelson may also release his funds in installments, with about half coming after Trump picks his running mate, according to a GOP operative with ties to Adelson.\n\nExisting Super PACs are making efforts to attract big donors. The Great America Pac, which boasts veteran GOP operative Ed Rollins as a strategist, has raised $5 million and has commitments for another $4 million. The Pac plans to raise $150 million by the election, with a focus on key states such as Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.\n\nOther pro-Trump Super PACs are also ramping up their fundraising and ad drives. Laurance Gay, the managing director of the Super Pac Rebuilding America Now, stated that it had raised $2 million, most of which has paid for two TV ads. Rebuilding America Now expects to raise and spend close to $20 million through the Republican National Convention and then hopes to raise another $80 million for the rest of the campaign season.\n\nHowever, fundraising remains a challenge for the pro-Trump Super PACs. Fred Malek, a veteran money man and top fundraiser for GOP governors, cautions that Trump's policies and temperament pose obstacles for Super PAC fundraising. Malek emphasizes that GOP donors and voters \"want to see a nominee who is more inclusive rather than divisive and recognizes that politics is a game of addition and not a game of subtraction.\"",
    " Title: Debt Ceiling and Congressional Scandals Dominate Washington Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Congress is currently grappling with a multitude of pressing issues, including the debt ceiling, budget, immigration, jobs, and the Keystone pipeline, among others. These matters have accumulated in the inbox, with the debt ceiling being reached over the weekend. While President Obama has vowed to maintain his focus on the middle class, the bipartisan response to at least three ongoing scandals has become an integral part of the 2013 congressional agenda.\n\nTreasury Secretary Jack Lew notified Congress on Friday that he was implementing \"extraordinary measures\" to enable the government to continue paying its bills. This action was taken as the U.S. government technically hit the debt ceiling, following the expiration of a prior suspension on that limit.\n\nIn 2011, the debate over the debt ceiling was a significant news event, with the full faith and credit of the U.S. government at stake. This time around, the situation is almost routine, with Lew referring to the \"standard set of extraordinary measures\" in his letter to House Speaker John Boehner on May 17. However, Lew cautioned that Washington may only last until sometime after Labor Day, and urged Congress to act promptly to protect the country's good credit and avoid potential catastrophic consequences.\n\nCongressional Republicans are expected to seek cost-cutting concessions to partially offset the increase in the debt ceiling, but have not specified what these will be. Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, stated that Congress is in the process of discussing with members and the American public on how to address the debt ceiling and \"Washington's out-of-control spending.\"\n\nIn the House, lawmakers are primarily focused on investigating the administration's handling of the Benghazi terror attack, the IRS's targeting of conservative groups, and the Justice Department's seizure of phone records from Associated Press journalists. The latter scandal was exacerbated by revelations that the department obtained a search warrant for a Fox News reporter's private emails as part of a separate leak investigation.\n\nPresident Obama and his administration are also dealing with the fallout from these scandals, with a portion of his administration's staff dedicating time to answering investigators' questions. Andrew Card, former chief of staff to President George W. Bush, suggested that the White House counsel's office will be closely focused on White House cooperation with the investigations, while the current chief of staff, Denis McDonough, is likely keeping the president and his senior staff focused on other matters.\n\nThe issue of gun control, which was a priority for Obama in his second term, appears to have been set aside for the time being. However, the matter of the budget, including the possibility of major entitlement and tax reform, still looms. The Senate and House have each passed their own budget, but an agreement has not been reached on reconciling the differences between the two versions.\n\nSome work on Capitol Hill will likely continue unaffected by the scandals. A Senate committee is moving toward finalizing its work on an immigration bill this week, while bipartisan House negotiators are crafting a bill of their own.",
    " Title: Consumer Expectations and Online Data Collection: A Study by Digital Content Next\n\nArticle:\n\nWith the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) now in effect, digital media companies are reassessing their online data collection policies and procedures to ensure compliance. The CCPA is considered the most comprehensive consumer privacy law and a benchmark for other states to follow.\n\nDigital Content Next, the trade association of major digital publishers, conducted a survey of a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults to understand their expectations around online privacy and their engagement with online tracking. The findings show that consumers generally expect websites and apps to collect data about them to personalize, protect, and improve their experience. However, they do not expect outside vendors to collect data about them for reuse or sale.\n\nWhen asked about their expectations regarding data collection by websites and apps, 59% of respondents expect data collection to protect them from fraud and malicious activity. Similarly, 55% expect data collection to help improve the website or app overall. Around half (54%) expect data collection to identify if they are a paid subscriber or member when they log into the website or app. Nearly half (49%) expect data collection to offer a personalized experience, while only 32% expect data to be shared with outside vendors to deliver targeted ads while they are on the website or app to help fund its content.\n\nWhen asked about the data practices of outside vendors, fewer respondents (38%) expect the future reuse of their personal data, and even fewer (24%) expect it to be sold. Interestingly, when given a clear explanation of how their data will be used and the benefits, more respondents (47%) align with the practice.\n\nConsumers' awareness of their ability to opt out of data collection is relatively low. Only half (52%) of all U.S. adults said they were aware of ways they could choose not to participate in online data collection. Furthermore, fewer consumers have opted out of online data collection or plan to do so in the next 30 days (40%) than those who either don't know how to opt out or don't understand what it means (44%).\n\nFor those opting out of online data collection, the top consumer actions remain cookie-related, such as deleting browser cookies on a regular basis or turning them off, followed by turning on \"Do Not Track\" and installing an ad blocker. However, deleting cookies or turning on \"Do Not Track\" doesn't completely remove the consumer from online data collection.\n\nIn the former case, deleting cookies has the frustrating consequence of logging the user out of news and other subscription sites and depersonalizing experiences consumers are comfortable with, like a weather site knowing their location to provide an accurate forecast. In the latter, privacy policies show that most of the industry, especially third-party ad tech vendors, ignore \"Do Not Track,\" as there's no incentive to move independently. The new CCPA regulation may change this, raising the bar for everyone.\n\nAs a result of opting out of online data collection, consumers expect greater privacy, an improved online experience, and enhanced security. These findings highlight the need to align data collection practices with consumer expectations. While consumers understand the need for websites and apps to collect some amount of user data, there's a significant disconnect with third parties selling or reusing this data in the future. Offering seamless and simplified controls is an important part of the compliance process and, arguably more importantly, of preserving and growing the trust of publishers' audiences.",
    " Title: New Hampshire Primary Poll: Buttigieg Leads Democratic Contenders, Warren and Biden Slip\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, a new poll indicates South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg with a significant lead over his top-tier rivals in New Hampshire, which hosts the first primary in the race for the White House. According to a Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll released Tuesday, Buttigieg garnered the support of 25 percent of likely Democratic presidential primary voters in New Hampshire. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts were tied for second, each at 15 percent.\n\nThe poll showed Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 9 percent, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at 6 percent, billionaire environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer at 5 percent, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each at 3 percent, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 2 percent, and everyone else tested in the survey at 1 percent or less.\n\nButtigieg, the youngest candidate in the large field of White House hopefuls, has surged in the polls since the spring, reaching top-tier status. He has gained 15 percentage points since the previous Saint Anselm College poll, which was conducted in September. Warren's support has dropped 10 points since the previous poll, while Biden's support has decreased by 9 points.\n\n\"With less than three months before the primary, the race for New Hampshire's Democratic delegates is still in a great deal of flux,\" New Hampshire Institute of Politics Executive Director Neil Levesque noted.\n\nThe reputation of New Hampshire voters as late deciders was reflected in the survey. Thirteen percent of respondents said they remained undecided, and of those who were backing a candidate, only 36 percent said they were firm in their choices. If voters change their minds, Warren may benefit, as she topped the list for second choice, at 23 percent.\n\nThe poll's release came two and a half months before the Iowa caucuses, which kick off the presidential nominating calendar, followed eight days later by the New Hampshire primary. A Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom poll released this past Saturday indicated Buttigieg at 25 percent among likely Iowa Democratic presidential caucus-goers, with Warren at 16 percent, and Biden and Sanders at 15 percent. A Monmouth University survey also conducted earlier this month showed Buttigieg with a single-digit advantage over his top rivals in the Hawkeye State.\n\nThe Saint Anselm College Survey Center poll was conducted November 13-18, with 255 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators. The survey's sampling of error was plus or minus 6.1 percentage points. The poll's release came days after former Gov. Deval Patrick, D-Mass., entered the presidential nomination race, with less than 1 percent support in the New Hampshire primary. The poll also indicated over three-quarters of those questioned said they would discourage former New York City mayor and billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg from launching a bid. Ninety-one percent said they would discourage 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton from running again. However, more than four in ten said they would encourage former first lady Michelle Obama to run.",
    " Title: Federal Reserve Leaves Door Open for Possible Additional Stimulus Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK ( CNNMoney ) -- The Federal Reserve has left the possibility of additional stimulus measures on the table, with Chairman Ben Bernanke indicating that the central bank stands ready to take further action if the U.S. economy worsens.\n\nDuring a press conference on Wednesday, Bernanke stated, \"In case things get worse, we are prepared to protect the U.S. economy and financial system.\" This statement was interpreted by many as a sign that the Fed may consider a third round of asset purchases, known as quantitative easing (QE).\n\nIan Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics, commented in a note to clients, \"Mr. Bernanke's press conference surely left few doubts that the Fed will take more aggressive action and renew QE if the economy fails to perform as they expect.\"\n\nMeanwhile, University of Pennsylvania Economist Justin Wolfers tweeted, \"I read the Fed as saying: One more bad jobs report, and we'll do more.\"\n\nThe job market remains a top concern for Bernanke, with the unemployment rate still high at 8.2%. The latest jobs report showed employers added only 69,000 jobs in May, marking the weakest hiring in a year.\n\nBernanke also addressed Europe's financial crisis and the uncertainty surrounding the \"fiscal cliff,\" which is dampening U.S. growth. (Read: Fiscal cliff: What you need to know)\n\nIn response to these concerns, the Fed extended its existing policy known as Operation Twist and lowered its expectations for the job market and the broader U.S. economy this year. The central bank predicts the unemployment rate will end the year between 8% and 8.2%. Just two months ago, it was more optimistic, predicting the jobless rate could fall as low as 7.8%.\n\nThe Fed also sees broader weakness ahead, predicting the economy will grow between 1.9% and 2.4% this year. In April, it had forecasted that the economy would grow as much as 2.9%. This weaker outlook prompted the Fed to extend Operation Twist by $267 billion.\n\nThe program swaps short-term bonds for ones with longer durations, thereby pushing interest rates lower on mortgages and business loans. The hope is that cheaper credit will reach consumers and businesses, who will then boost the economy by spending more. However, the effect on Main Street has been questionable, with mortgage rates at record lows but new home sales remaining choppy and banks still reluctant to lend to those with less-than-perfect credit. Small business owners are also struggling to secure loans.",
    " Title: Chris Matthews Ties Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Second Amendment to Murders in Texas and Colorado\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a controversial statement on MSNBC's Hardball, host Chris Matthews linked Texas Senator Ted Cruz and the Second Amendment to the murders of prosecutors in Kaufman, Texas, and a prison guard in Colorado. The Media Research Center criticized Matthews for ignoring the criminal element of the prosecutor slayings and instead attributing the murders to individuals exercising their Second Amendment rights.\n\nAccording to the Media Research Center, on March 30, the bodies of 23-year Army veteran and Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were found in their home, victims of an apparent assassination. A national security expert suggested the murders were intended to send a message that no one is safe and that the killers are in control.\n\nThe Aryan Brotherhood, a violent prison gang, is suspected of being behind the murders in Kaufman County, Texas, and the killing of a top prison official in Colorado. The FBI has declassified 156 pages of internal documents that reveal the Aryan Brotherhood's history of engaging in brutal, high-profile killings to intimidate foreign narcotics cartels and other organized crime groups.\n\nIn response to the Kaufman County murders, county courthouses across Texas are implementing increased security measures, including more armed guards. Prosecutors in the Dallas area have also been urged to carry their own guns for self-protection against armed violent criminals.\n\nThe Media Research Center criticized Matthews for failing to discuss the criminal elements of the cases involving firearms and for smearing millions of law-abiding citizens in the process. The organization also noted that the Aryan Brotherhood does not care about gun control or votes on gun safety.",
    " Title: New Jersey Middle School Teacher Reassigned After Kneeling During Pledge of Allegiance\n\nArticle: A teacher at Sgt. Dominick Pilla Middle School in New Jersey has been reassigned following incidents where the educator reportedly knelt during the school's recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. The school is named after a U.S. Army Ranger who died during a 1993 mission in Somalia.\n\nThe teacher's actions sparked a heated debate among parents, who viewed the silent protest as inappropriate and agenda-driven for a middle school setting, according to the Philly Voice. Partisan political behavior is prohibited on school premises and during school hours, as noted by the Voice.\n\nDuring a school board meeting of Vineland Public Schools in early October, parents expressed their concerns about the teacher's behavior. Resident Ron Maccri stated, \"Teachers are paid to educate our students, they're not paid to indoctrinate our students. What this woman is doing would be bad in any school, but because it's in the (Sgt. Dominick Pilla) School \u2014 who gave his life for our military \u2014 it's reprehensible.\"\n\nAnother resident, Randy London, a U.S. Coast Guard veteran, also voiced his displeasure during the meeting. \"That type of behavior offends me,\" London said. \"I'm not saying anyone needs to agree with everything, but if that is the district's policy, there should be no teacher\u2026taking a knee during the Pledge of Allegiance.\"\n\nLou Russo, president of the Vineland Education Association, suggested that students could learn from the teacher's missteps. \"It would be one thing if [the teacher] was proselytizing to kids that you can't stand, or you should not stand for this reason, but she's not doing that,\" Russo insisted, pointing out that teachers themselves can not force students to stand for the pledge anyway.\n\nOn Tuesday, the district determined the teacher's fate, with Pilla school Principal Ismael Bermudez reassigning the teacher away from conducting homeroom. Joseph Rossi, the district's executive director of personnel, added, \"Like all principals, Mr. Bermudez has the authority to utilize his building staff as appropriate.\"\n\nRusso stated that the school deployed what they believe was a reasonable accommodation for the teacher. \"It is a reasonable compromise that balances a school employee's free exercise of their religion versus a parent's concern of how that free exercise may influence their child,\" Russo said, noting that they have requested a legal opinion from their state affiliate and await its findings.\n\nThe teacher defended her First Amendment rights and insisted that her actions were not politically motivated, according to the Voice's reporting.",

On February 20, Iran confirmed 13 new cases, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 18. Seven cases were diagnosed in Qom, four in Tehran, and two in Gilan.\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) officials have expressed concern over the outbreak, with Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stating that the cases outside of China, although small in number, not linked to Wuhan or China, are \"very worrisome.\" He added that the \"dots are actually very concerning.\"\n\nTedros stated that the window of opportunity to contain the virus is still open but is narrowing, and action must be taken quickly before it closes completely. He also cautioned that the outbreak could still go in any direction.\n\nIran's health-care system has the \"basic capacity\" to detect and contain the coronavirus, according to Dr. Jaouad Mahjour, assistant director of emergency preparedness at WHO. However, world health officials remain concerned about the potential spread of the virus to countries with weaker health systems.\n\nOutside of China, there are 1,152 cases across 26 countries, including eight deaths, according to Tedros.

    " Title: Federal Judge Halts Execution of Dementia-Suffering Inmate in Second Federal Execution This Week\n\nArticle:\n\nTERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday halted the execution of a man, who is reportedly suffering from dementia, set to die by lethal injection in the federal government's second execution this week after a 17-year hiatus. Wesley Ira Purkey, convicted of a gruesome 1998 kidnapping and killing, was scheduled to die at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, where Daniel Lewis Lee was put to death Tuesday after his eleventh-hour legal bids failed.\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, D.C. imposed two injunctions prohibiting the federal Bureau of Prisons from moving forward with Purkey's execution, but the Justice Department immediately appealed. An appeals court panel kept in place both injunctions in orders Wednesday evening. Appeals to the Supreme Court were still pending.\n\nThe issue of Purkey's mental health arose in the runup to his 2003 trial and when jurors had to decide whether he should be put to death in the killing of 16-year-old Jennifer Long in Kansas City, Missouri. Prosecutors said he raped and stabbed her, dismembered her with a chainsaw, burned the body, and dumped her ashes in a pond in Kansas. Purkey was separately convicted and sentenced to life in the beating death of 80-year-old Mary Ruth Bales, of Kansas City, Kansas.\n\nHowever, the legal questions of whether he was mentally fit then are different from whether he's fit now to be put to death. Purkey's lawyers argue he clearly isn't, saying in recent filings he suffers from advancing Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe legal questions surrounding Purkey's case have been hashed, rehashed, and settled by courts over nearly two decades. \"Competency is something that is always in flux,\" according to Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, who teaches law school courses on capital punishment.\n\nIn a landmark 1986 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the Constitution prohibits executing someone who lacks a reasonable understanding of why he's being executed. It involved the case of Alvin Ford, who was convicted of murder but whose mental health deteriorated behind bars to the point, according to his lawyer, he believed he was pope.\n\nPurkey's mental issues go beyond Alzheimer's, his lawyers have said. They say he was subject to sexual and mental abuse as a child and, at 14, was diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and psychosis.\n\nLast week, three mental health organizations urged U.S. Attorney General William Barr to commute Purkey's sentence to life in prison without possibility of parole. The National Alliance on Mental Illness, Mental Health America, and the Treatment Advocacy Center said executing mentally ailing people like Purkey \"constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and does not comport with 'evolving standards of decency.'\"\n\nThe execution of Wesley Ira Purkey is now on hold, with the legal battle likely to continue into the evening. The fate of other scheduled executions, including Dustin Lee Honken, an Iowa drug kingpin, remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Warren's Senate Campaign Ends in Debt Despite Record Fundraising\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts' newly elected Senator Elizabeth Warren ended her campaign in debt, despite raising a record-breaking $42 million for her Senate race this year, making her the most financially successful congressional candidate in the country. In an email to her supporters, Warren, a Harvard Law professor and prominent scholar of American debt, requested donations to help pay off the remaining campaign bills.\n\nWarren did not disclose the exact amount of debt her campaign has accumulated, but attributed part of the shortfall to the thousands of volunteers who joined her campaign, stating that it led to increased last-minute expenses for coffee and pizza.\n\n\"One of the results of our embarrassment of riches was, well, I'll come out and say it - we ended up with a little bit of debt,\" Warren wrote. \"Everyone, we need a little more money to pay off our final bills. Can you help one more time?\"\n\nWhile it is common for campaigns, even successful and well-funded ones, to end in debt, the disclosure is notable for Warren due to her extensive research on the roots of debt in American families and businesses.\n\n\"I know this was the most expensive Senate race in the country,\" Warren wrote. \"And I know that we've sent you a bazillion emails asking for money over the past year. I'm sure you expected them to all end once the votes were counted - and yes, that's what I thought too. Right now, I'd rather be writing about filibuster reform and banking regulation. But we still have a little more to do to wrap things up. Can you help one more time to finish 2012 strong?\"",
    " Title: Ohio Polls Tighten as Romney Narrows Obama's Lead, Early Voting Factors into Discussion\n\nArticle:\n\nThe race for Ohio's electoral votes is tightening, but Mitt Romney does not hold a lead in any of the current Real Clear Politics average polls, with two polls showing a five-point lead for President Barack Obama. The Democratic advantage in party identification has increased across these polls, with an average increase from 5.5 to 6.5 points.\n\nOne reason for the increase in Democrats' share in the polls is early voting. If a pollster calls someone who says they have voted, they are automatically passed through the likely-voter screen since they have, after all, voted. However, as Gregory House famously stated, \"Everybody lies.\" Pollsters can only work with the information their respondents provide, and this is the reason that likely-voter screens can be so tricky, though important, in polling.\n\nIn Ohio, where early in-person and absentee voting estimates show early turnout to be about 15 percent of voters, responses in the current polls claim that 23 percent of registered voters have already voted. This means that polls are overstating early voting by eight percentage points on average. This could be due to some voters having requested an absentee ballot and reporting that as voting, some having mailed in ballots that haven't been counted yet, or some voters simply lying about having voted when they haven't.\n\nIn the polls' early-voting results, Obama leads on average by 20 points. However, it is unclear how much the Democratic advantage in this category has shrunk from 2008. Obama's early-voting advantage gives him a lead that Romney is only slowly chipping away at with his Election Day voter lead. But if pollsters are finding more respondents who are claiming to have already voted than what the records show, some of this early-voter advantage is illusory.\n\nRomney's strength with independents and crossover voters, as well as historical trends in Ohio, suggest that he is in a strong position to win the state on Election Day. Romney leads among independents by an average of 12.3 points, up from 8.7 points last week. In the last nine elections, the GOP has outperformed in Ohio, and with Romney currently running just ahead of Obama nationally, it seems more likely that Obama's lead in Ohio has more to do with the higher party-ID advantage than a dramatic shift in Ohio from the past nine elections.\n\nIn addition to Romney's strength with independents, in the past two elections, the GOP candidate has won over more Democrat votes than they've lost Republican ones. Obama's Ohio win in 2008 was based entirely on his strength with independents and the wave turnout, both of which are highly unlikely to be repeated in 2012. If Romney wins with independents by anywhere near the current average and takes more crossover voters than Obama does, Obama would need to exceed 2008 turnout greatly to win.\n\nWith less than two weeks until Election Day, it is important to remember that the picture for Romney in Ohio is better than many pundits would have us believe. Romney's rallies are a reminder that it's not 2008 anymore, as Republicans have reclaimed the enthusiasm advantage that led to such sweeping 2008 victories for Democrats. That GOP enthusiasm has become contagious since the debates, and it is exactly what has Team Obama so afraid these days. All they have left to hang their hopes on is a slim lead in the polls, and even that might not be enough on Election Day.\n\nJosh Jordan, a small-business market-research consultant, wrote this article.

    " Title: House Republicans Predicted to Pass Funding Bill Before Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final hours before a vote, House Republicans are optimistic about passing their $1.1 trillion, nine-month government funding bill before a potential government shutdown on Thursday. According to top aides and lawmakers on the GOP whip team, between 150 and 175 Republicans are expected to support the bill. Senior House Democrats predict some of their members will help make up for Republican defections to get the bill across the finish line.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and his staff have been in contact with Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) throughout the process, despite Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) public proclamation that Democrats were worried about provisions tucked into the bill that would loosen Wall Street regulations and campaign finance laws.\n\nThe deal to jack up donation limits to national party committees was negotiated by top aides to a leading Democrat and Republican: Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. If the larger funding package falls apart, Speaker Boehner will put a three-month stop-gap spending bill on the floor to set up a fiscal fight next year when Republicans have control of both chambers.\n\nAs of late Wednesday evening, Republicans were not formally making fallback plans if the bill failed, and House Democrats weren't formally whipping against the measure. House Democratic leadership plans to meet Thursday morning ahead of the vote. The government will begin to shut down by Friday morning if nothing passes. Almost no one expects a shutdown.\n\nLawmakers are angry that they only had one full day to read a 1,600-page spending bill that extends all government funding through September 2015, and Homeland Security funding through February. When lawmakers started digging into the bill, they found a provision that helps big banks trade derivatives in units backstopped by a government guarantee. Another last-minute addition would allow all national party committees to collect $777,000 each year from individuals, up from $32,400 annually under current law.\n\nHigh-profile lawmakers like Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) vowed to vote against the bill, backed by progressive groups on the outside who were seizing on Pelosi's (D-Calif.) skepticism. Republicans were already worried that the legislation doesn't pick a strong enough fight with Obama over his unilateral changes to immigration law \u2013 a few conservative members like Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas and Rep. Tom McClintock of California privately questioned the strategy.\n\nSpeaker Boehner also faced criticism for breaking one of his central 2010 campaign promises: that he would advance legislative issues one at a time. \"All these provisions in this bill got worked out in a bipartisan bicameral fashion or they wouldn't be in the bill,\" the speaker said. Boehner added, \"When you get to the end of a two-year session of Congress, a lot of work gets built up and never gets to cross one floor or the other floor. And as a result, when we get to the end of session, members try to find a way to get their legislation across the finish line because of not really issues on the House side, more issues on the Senate side, to facilitate their ability to move legislation, some of the stuff ends up in one bill.\"\n\nThe mood was tense in the Capitol Wednesday when GOP leaders started whipping the bill, and Senate Democrats were unsure how many of their House counterparts would vote for the bill. But Pelosi and Boehner have been in close contact. On Wednesday morning when they spoke, Boehner demurred when Pelosi asked how many Democratic votes he needed. That responsibility falls to House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Boehner answered. Boehner warned Pelosi that if the large bill failed, he would have a short-term funding bill ready for immediate consideration.\n\nIf Republican defections swell, Scalise could catch blame, but if the GOP posts better-than-expected numbers, he'll start off the 114th Congress with a stronger hand. Pelosi is trying to regain her own strong hand, which has been weakened dramatically by her party's disastrous showing on Election Day. She was involved in the negotiations, but objected to many of the last-minute additions to the package - and is using the situation to boost her sway with disaffected Democrats. Pelosi believes she can get Republicans to change the bill, but GOP leadership staff has repeatedly made clear that they will not change the omnibus.\n\nRepublicans have one victory in this lame duck: they cleared a renewal of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act by a huge margin. The GOP leadership had hoped to include this legislation in the omnibus, but House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) insisted the TRIA extension include unrelated changes to the Dodd-Frank financial services law. Democrats protested, but the bill passed with 417 votes.",

The debate, moderated by Elaine Quijano, exposed the depths of the Hillary campaign's \"demagogic cheapness\" as Kaine repeatedly interrupted Pence and rattled off opposition research.\n\nPence, speaking slowly and authoritatively, reiterated basic points about Hillary Clinton's tax-and-spend policies and her feckless foreign policy. He deftly answered the litany of accusations against Donald Trump by noting that Kaine was indulging in the very \"insult-driven campaign\" he pretended to find so shocking in Trump.\n\nKaine devoted most of his energy to rattling off his opposition research, much of it too insiderish and transparently canned to impress anyone. Pence, on the other hand, looked directly at the camera and reiterated basic points about Clinton's policies.\n\nOne of the most notable moments of the debate came when Pence noted that Clinton had called much of the country a \"basket of deplorables.\" Kaine's response, claiming Trump cared more about his tax returns than the troops, was met with a shake of Pence's head in disbelief.\n\nPence's calm demeanor and ability to re-direct the debate back to serious issues was a stark contrast to Kaine's irritated and short-circuiting performance. Pence's thoughtful discussion of adoption and the sanctity of life also made Kaine's partisan gibbering look ignoble.\n\nDuring several exchanges, Pence turned what Kaine and Clinton consider strengths into weaknesses. For example, when Kaine launched into a windy attack on Putin and a tendentious description of Trump's admiration for him, Pence simply drew attention to Clinton's disastrously ineffective \"reset\" with Putin.\n\nIn debates, less is more, as Pence showed. Against a flailing, gabbing, and demagogic opponent, it is better to step back and let the audience see that the person who talks the most often says the least. Come Sunday, Trump would do well to imitate his running mate.",

This core group, which includes a registered Republican who has served four presidents, including one Democrat, and who partnered with Michelle Obama's office on the Let's Move anti-obesity campaign, emphasizes the importance of finding common ground and focusing on areas of agreement.\n\nThe individual, who has created a 60/40 rule for collaboration, agrees with someone on 60% of the issues and focuses on the areas of agreement, setting aside the 40% of differences. This approach is not unique among those who align with one political party but find ways to work with the other.\n\nIn 2009, 16 CEOs from consumer goods companies joined the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation, implementing the largest voluntary food and beverage industry marketplace initiative, which ultimately removed 6.4 trillion calories from the American diet by reducing the sugar and fat content of hundreds of products. In 2005, as U.S. Commissioner General, the individual worked alongside governors from both parties and the private sector to launch the US Pavilion at the Aichi World EXPO.\n\nSimilar bipartisan efforts are ongoing in various bipartisan commissions and blue-ribbon panels addressing issues such as Social Security, biodefenses, tax reform, and the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. These collaborative efforts, which focus on personal consideration, listening, and respect, succeed because the end goal is what matters, not party ideology.\n\nThe principles of bipartisanship, which are common in many areas beyond politics, emphasize personal consideration, listening, and respect. These collaborative efforts, which focus on fixing problems and finding new paths, are alive and in need of further nurturing.

The event, which was hosted by Jack Nicholson, was marked by Obama's introduction of the nominees and the eventual announcement of the winner, Argo.\n\n\"These nine movies took us back in time and all around the world,\" Obama said. \"They made us laugh, they made us weep, and they made us grip our armrests just a little tighter.\" She continued, \"They taught us that love can endure against all odds and transform our lives in the most surprising ways, and they reminded us that we can overcome any obstacle if we can dig deep enough and fight hard enough and find the courage to believe in ourselves.\"\n\nAfter handing Nicholson an envelope to announce the winner, Obama said, \"Hang on a second,\" before making the announcement. The tweet, \"@pfro, \"I love how Michelle Obama was all like: oh, sorry, I was just hangin' with some US servicemen, hold on a sec - lem me present at the #oscars,\" captured the moment.\n\nThe appearance of Michelle Obama at the Oscars received mixed reactions on social media. Some tweets praised her for her performance, such as \"@juliweiner's \"Daniel Day Lewis\u2019s Michelle Obama is GOOD.\" However, others criticized her for what they perceived as too many celebrity-laden appearances, with tweets like \"@daveweigel's \"Having Nicholson introduce Michelle Obama probably spared us from the ultimate McFarlane sexist joke #Oscars.\"\n\nSome tweets expressed disapproval of Obama's appearance at the Oscars, with comments like \"@davidplotz's \"Michelle Obama is doing WAY too many cameos. Bad memories of Nancy Reagan on Mr. T's lap.\" Others criticized the decision to have Obama present at the Oscars, with tweets like \"@abenedikt's \"MIchelle Obama jumps the shark.\"\n\nDespite the backlash, Obama seemed to enjoy her appearance at the Oscars, tweeting, \"@FLOTUS's \"It was a thrill to announce the #Oscars2013 best picture winner from the @whitehouse! Congratulations Argo!\" This article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.",
    " Title: Reflections on Easter Amidst Political and Social Divisions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of a politically and socially divisive year, some individuals find solace in the celebration of Easter, a Christian holiday symbolizing renewal and resurrection. The world, it seems, is more divided than ever, with societal fault lines along race, gender, class, immigration status, religion, sexual orientation, and more, causing a series of tremors that permeate daily life.\n\nThe actions and rhetoric of the current administration have become a rhythm for many, whether they support or oppose the leader. Each outburst generates a response, either a cheer or an outcry, creating a shifting tide of energy that ebbs and flows.\n\nAs the nation moves towards a self-centered, self-interested future, questions arise about the ability to care for the less fortunate, protect refugees, and value all lives equally. Boundaries are being drawn, and fortified walls are being erected to safeguard the \"we\" that is being narrowly defined.\n\nThis period is marked by a turning-in and turning-on, a shift back to a time when the nation was divided and fractured. In the midst of this tumult, some find Easter - a moment of respite amidst raw, natural times.\n\nThe story of Easter revolves around a faultless man who absorbs the faults of others, a hated man who refuses to retaliate against scorn, and a man who sacrifices himself for the good of the world, bringing others life through his embrace and defeat of death. The scriptures that tell this story are jarring when juxtaposed against the values of the current era:\n\n\"For God so loved the world that he gave his only son...\"\n\"...while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us...\"\n\nThe question remains: can we ever become an Easter people? What event or circumstance will bring about a return to grace and make us whole again or perhaps whole for the first time?\n\nIt is unclear what it will take to provoke such a transformation - an election, a disaster, new leadership, or cataclysmic loss. The resistance may need to reach its pinnacle, or the current leader may need to hit his penitential floor. Alternatively, the change may not be about them or him, but rather a collective internal transformation that feels like national atonement.\n\nImagining such a future is challenging, especially when warships are moving and MOABs are exploding, and the next breaking news report or fiery tweet is always imminent. Yet, there is no hope as hopeful as the sunshine on a Sunday morning, and no day as dream-worthy as Resurrection Day.\n\nOn such a day, perhaps we will catch a glimmer of a different future, bright enough to light a path that helps us get there. And maybe once we see it, we will take a step - towards Easter.",
    " Title: Donald Trump's Refusal to Commit to Accepting Election Results Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the latest presidential debate, the focus has been on Donald Trump's refusal to commit to accepting the election results, a stance that has been met with criticism and concern. The Republican nominee's statement, while controversial, is consistent with his efforts this month to question the integrity of the democratic process.\n\nTrump's reluctance to accept the election results, despite the potential consequences, is attributed to his personality traits, particularly his narcissism and inability to accept defeat. The debate performance, which has been widely criticized, underscores Trump's unstable and disordered personality, a weakness that has been a recurring theme throughout the campaign.\n\nTrump's obsession with polls and his fear of being labeled a loser has led him to manufacture excuses for his potential defeat, with the claim of a rigged election being the most recent example. This claim, which undermines a nearly sacred democratic rule, not only risks his chances of winning but could also widen the margin of his potential defeat.\n\nThe American public's reaction to Trump has been largely negative, with many viewing him as a radical and destabilizing force rather than an agent of change. His narcissism, particularly his inability to accept that he may lose to a woman in the presidential race, has been a significant factor in his debate performance and other controversial moments during the campaign.\n\nPeter Wehner, a contributing opinion writer who served in the last three Republican administrations, noted that Trump's egotism and self-obsession are unlike anything seen in American political life. This character flaw has led to several detrimental moments during the election, including his inability to cite a favorite Bible passage earlier in the campaign and his response about not being prepared to say he would abide by the election results in the debate.\n\nWehner cited a Bible passage, \"Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall,\" as a foreshadowing of Trump's fate. The passage underscores the potential consequences of unchecked pride and self-obsession in political leadership.",
    " Title: Fauci Disputes Concept of Second Wave of Covid-19 Cases in the US\n\nArticle:\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, a leading US public health expert and member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, has stated that the US may not experience a \"second wave\" of Covid-19 cases. The US has reported over 2 million cases of Covid-19 and nearly 115,000 deaths, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland.\n\nFauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Friday that increases in cases in several states are not necessarily indicative of a \"second spike\" of infections. He emphasized that an increase in hospitalizations is a cause for concern and requires close attention.\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that close to 80% of Americans self-isolated in the last month and 74% wore face coverings in public either always or often. Residents of New York and Los Angeles self-isolated and wore face coverings about 90% of the time.\n\nIn the past week, 19 states, including Texas, South Carolina, Utah, Arizona, North Carolina, Arkansas, Alabama, Oregon, California, Nevada, and Florida, have reported seven-day rolling average highs for new Covid-19 infections. In Arkansas, Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, announced a record number of cases in the previous 24 hours. In Oregon, Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat, placed a seven-day hold on lifting or loosening social restrictions. In Maryland, Baltimore announced it would not be moving into phase two of planned reopening.\n\nSome experts have become more optimistic that a vaccine for Covid-19 can be developed swiftly. However, they caution that this does not guarantee the speed, safety, and durability of the vaccine. In New York City, mass protests have sparked fears of a resurgence of the virus, but new infections are now at the lowest level in the entire US. New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, stated that the state was the \"No 1 state in terms of infection\" but is now the \"last state in terms of rate of transmission.\"\n\nThe CDC could not confirm reports of striking increases in coronavirus hospitalizations but would monitor the numbers \"very closely.\" Such developments sent stock markets into a tailspin on Thursday, before a slight recovery on Friday.",
    " Title: Ted Cruz Raises $20 Million in Three Months Ahead of Iowa Caucus\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Ted Cruz has reportedly raised nearly $20 million in the past three months, according to an internal memo obtained by NBC News. This significant fundraising haul comes as the Iowa caucus approaches in the final month.\n\nA campaign aide told NBC News, \"We're showing we have the strength going into the Iowa caucus. If people want to get behind a candidate who can go the distance, we're showing we've got that.\"\n\nThe $20 million raised in the third quarter surpasses the $12.2 million Cruz brought in during the previous quarter, bringing his total yearly fundraising to $45 million. In the same timeframe, rival candidate Ben Carson, who was then a rising contender in polling, also raised a similar $20 million, while Marco Rubio brought in $6 million.\n\nCruz is the first candidate to report their fundraising totals for this quarter, which technically ends on Thursday. At the beginning of October, Cruz's campaign had the most cash on hand\u2014$13.8 million\u2014but it has yet to publicly release its current cash holdings.\n\nThe substantial fundraising by Cruz, who often emphasizes on the campaign trail that his campaign is built to last, is mirrored by hefty fundraising by several super PACs supporting his candidacy. Through September, the super PACs had raised $38 million, with the organizations spending little of that money to date.\n\nThe additional funds provide Cruz with expanded resources to potentially buy advertising in the upcoming early states. However, through the summer and fall, the campaign resisted spending on traditional television and radio advertising, putting in less than $1 million so far. The campaign has yet to reveal its advertising plan, stating it will buy television airtime on a week-to-week basis.",
    " Title: New York Coronavirus Cases Surge Past 11,600 as Statewide Lockdown Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York state reported over 4,500 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, pushing the statewide total to 11,600. New York City, the epicenter of the nation's COVID-19 crisis, accounted for the majority of the increase, with more than 2,400 new cases reported, raising the total number of infected in the city to 8,115. The virus claimed at least 15 more lives in the city on Saturday, bringing the death toll to 60.\n\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo announced plans to purchase 6,000 new ventilators and two million N95 masks in response to the mounting crisis. One million masks will be sent to health care responders in the city, and 500,000 will go to Long Island. Hospitals statewide have been directed to end elective surgeries and alter their space and staffing to accommodate the influx of infected patients.\n\nNew York is also considering four possible locations for temporary \"field hospitals\" to be set up by the Army Corps of Engineers and operated with FEMA assistance. The four sites being considered are the city's Javits Center, SUNY Stony Brook, SUNY Westbury, and the Westchester Convention Center. The Javits Center could be converted into a 1,000-patient hospital in the next few days.\n\nThe number of cases in Westchester, where the state's first major outbreak was located, is slowing, according to Governor Cuomo. However, there were at least 294 cases there as of Saturday. In New Jersey, the sick tally rose to 1,327 on Saturday, with 16 deaths. Both Governor Phil Murphy and Governor Cuomo attributed their states' increases in reported infections to increased testing.\n\nA statewide lockdown is set to take effect 8 p.m. Sunday night, setting tight limits on shopping, work, and recreation to minimize close contact and prevent a healthcare-system-crippling spike in cases. The lockdown will force the shutdown of most of the state's businesses, with the exception of grocery stores and bodegas, liquor stores, gas stations, laundromats, and restaurant delivery services. The city has appointed a \"Food Czar,\" Kathryn Garcia, to ensure no one goes hungry. Those lucky enough to still be working in \"non-essential\" businesses must do so from home, and exercising outdoors is limited to solitary, non-team endeavors such as walking, biking, and running.",
    " Title: Bloomberg Poll Shows Obama Leading Romney by 13 Points Among Likely Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nAccording to a recent Bloomberg poll, President Barack Obama is leading his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, by 13 points among likely voters. The poll, conducted from June 15-18, shows Obama with 53 percent of the vote, while Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, has 40 percent.\n\nThe poll indicates that Romney has yet to repair the damage to his image during the Republican primary. Thirty-nine percent of Americans view him favorably, which is about the same as when he announced his presidential candidacy last June. In contrast, 48 percent see him unfavorably, a 17-percentage point increase during the nomination fight marked by attack ads.\n\nThe survey also reveals that a majority of likely voters, 55 percent, view Romney as more out of touch with average Americans compared with 36 percent who say the same about President Obama.\n\nThe poll sample is skewed, but the survey results can be viewed from another perspective. Questions to consider include:\n\n1. Do you believe Obama's popularity is twice as high as it was in 2008 (when Obama won by roughly 6.5 points)? This poll suggests it is.\n2. How has Obama gained 13 points since Bloomberg's March poll, which had the race tied at 47?\n3. Does Bloomberg have a better grasp on this race than Rasmussen and Gallup, both of which show Romney ahead today by identical 47-45 margins?\n4. Does Barack Obama have a commanding lead nationally, despite being tied or down in new polls from Michigan and Iowa - both states he won by double digits last time?\n5. If Barack Obama is cruising to a decisive victory, why is an expanding pool of elected Democrats choosing to jump ship from the Democratic National Convention, where Obama will be re-nominated?\n6. How large would Obama's lead be if he had not just experienced a solid month of failed attacks, exploded narratives, party defections, botched events, inadvertent tells, and dreadful economic news?\n\nIt is worth noting that the economic numbers are being revised downward today, and there is a possibility that the U.S. could cross back into negative job growth this month.",
    " Title: Sen. John McCain Criticizes President Obama's Foreign Policy on CNN's \"State of the Union\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) criticized President Barack Obama's foreign policy, stating that it has contributed to the \"unraveling of the world order that was established after World War II.\"\n\nRegarding President Obama's response to Russian hacking, McCain expressed concern over the perceived lack of a clear strategy or policy. He called for a select committee to investigate the cyber attacks, particularly their potential impact on the American election.\n\nMcCain asserted, \"We need to get to the bottom of this. We need to find out exactly what was done and what the implications of the attacks were, especially if they had an effect on our election.\" He also questioned the effectiveness of President Obama's response to Russian hacking, stating, \"I'm sure that when Vladimir Putin was told 'cut it out,' unquote, I'm sure that Vladimir Putin immediately stopped all cyber activity.\"\n\nMcCain further expressed concern over the increasing cyber attacks on various aspects of American life, stating, \"We have no strategy, nor do we have any policy towards that, and it's very disturbing.\"\n\nIn addition, McCain linked the current geopolitical situation to a lack of American leadership, stating, \"What's happening here when we see the seizure of these ships, when we see the cyber attacks, when we see the dismemberment of Syria, when we see the tragedies that are taking place there which are heartbreaking, actually heartbreaking while we sat by and watched all this happen, this is a sign of a possible unraveling of the world order that was established after World War II.\"\n\nMcCain concluded by emphasizing the importance of American leadership in maintaining global peace, stating, \"We're starting to see that, the strains and unraveling of it, and that's because of an absolute failure of American leadership. When America doesn't lead, a lot of other bad people do, and that's why we're seeing this slaughter in Aleppo that breaks your heart.\"",
    " Title: Doug Jones Expresses Concerns Over Witnesses and Evidence in Impeachment Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocrat Doug Jones, the current senator of Alabama, has expressed concerns over the lack of witnesses and evidence in the ongoing impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. In an interview with ABC's The Week, Jones criticized the \"gaps in testimony\" and called for a \"full, fair, and complete trial.\"\n\nJones argued that the Senate needs to interview witnesses and receive documents to provide a comprehensive understanding of the impeachment case. He stated, \"It means witnesses, it means documents, it means getting the information out now, in this very serious matter, and not over the course of the next few months.\"\n\nThe Democrats have charged President Trump with \"obstruction of Congress\" for directing \"the unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas\" in the buildup to impeachment. The White House is currently embroiled in a legal battle over Congressional subpoenas.\n\nSen. Doug Jones attributed the lack of evidence to President Trump's refusal to allow his associates to testify and deliver documents. He said, \"I would like to see a full and complete picture. And we don't have that because the president has refused to have his people come and testify and deliver documents.\"\n\nHowever, Jones also indicated that he could oppose impeachment if the evidence does not support Trump's removal. He stated, \"If those dots aren't connected and there are other explanations that I think are consistent with innocence, I will go that way too.\"\n\nIn a recent poll regarding the Alabama Senate race, Jones trails former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former Auburn head football coach Tommy Tuberville, and Representative Bradley Byrne. Only 23 percent of those surveyed favored Jones's reelection. Among voters 65 and older, the largest age cohort in the poll, 31 percent favored Jones's reelection, while 54 did not.\n\nWhen asked whether his reelection concerns were affecting his vote, Jones denied making a political calculation. He said, \"This has to do with the future of the presidency, and how we want our presidents to conduct themselves.\" Jones concluded, \"If I did everything based on a pure and political argument, all you'd need is a computer to mash a button.\"",
    " Title: Rubio Questions Significant Impact of Tax Overhaul on American Workers\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has cast doubt on the recent tax overhaul's impact on American workers, potentially undermining his party's message ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. In an interview with The Economist magazine, Rubio stated there is \"no evidence whatsoever\" the law has significantly benefited American workers.\n\nThe tax overhaul, which passed through the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress in December without Democratic support, permanently reduced the top corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. However, tax cuts for individuals are temporary and expire after 2025.\n\nRepublicans, including President Donald Trump, have maintained their tax overhaul will result in increased take-home pay for workers and have pointed to bonuses some workers received from their employers as evidence the law is effective. Rubio, who voted for the proposal despite advocating for a larger child tax credit, had lobbied party leaders for this provision.\n\nIn response to Rubio's comments, Olivia Perez-Cubas, Rubio's spokeswoman, stated, \"Senator Rubio pushed for a better balance in the tax law between tax cuts for big businesses and families, as he\u2019s done for years. As he said when the tax law passed, cutting the corporate tax rate will make America a more competitive place to do business, but he tried to balance that with an even larger child tax credit for working Americans.\"\n\nThe tax law serves as the only significant legislative achievement for Republicans since President Trump took office, as they approach the midterms, during which all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and about a third of the 100-member Senate's seats are being contested.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected earlier this month that the tax bill, as written, would add $1.9 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.",
    " Title: Obama's Middle East Policy Shift and the Egyptian Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn May 2011, President Barack Obama announced a significant reorientation of American policy in the Middle East during a speech at the State Department. The traditional American interests, which included regional stability, countering terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and ensuring the free flow of oil and commerce, often led to alliances with authoritarian regimes.\n\nThe president emphasized that the events of the Arab Spring, particularly in Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya, demonstrated the need for a shift in strategy. He stated, \"Strategies of repression and strategies of diversion will not work anymore.\" The president's new \"core principles\" included supporting universal rights, encouraging political and economic reforms, and opposing violence and oppression.\n\nThe president emphasized that these principles were not secondary but a top priority, stating, \"Our support for these principles is not a secondary interest. Today I want to make it clear that it is a top priority that must be translated into concrete actions and supported by all of the diplomatic, economic, and strategic tools at our disposal.\"\n\nHowever, in the ensuing two years, particularly in the eight weeks since the Egyptian military's coup, the Obama administration has faced criticism for its response to the Egyptian crisis. Critics argue that the U.S. has appeared cautious, timid, indecisive, reactive, and shortsighted, struggling to balance its professed commitment to change with the fear of chaos.\n\nVali Nasr, a critic of the administration from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, suggests that U.S. policy may, intentionally or not, be returning to a pre-Arab Spring, Islamophobic, order-at-all-costs policy, aligning the U.S. with countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia.\n\nThis shift in policy and the U.S.'s perceived response to the Egyptian crisis has raised questions about the U.S.'s influence and commitment to the principles outlined by President Obama in 2011. Critics argue that the Egyptian military's actions, including the murder of civilians, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's continued use of chemical weapons against his own people, demonstrate a lack of credibility in the U.S.'s stance against violence and oppression.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Designates ISIS Atrocities Against Christians and Minorities as Genocide\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration's decision to label ISIS's atrocities against Christians and other minorities as genocide is a significant step, but many warn that it is only the beginning of a lengthy process. In a statement, Secretary of State John Kerry declared, \"In my judgment, Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in territory under its control.\"\n\nThe genocide designation is a critical first step towards safeguarding Christians from ISIS and other Islamic extremists in Iraq and Syria. Johnnie Moore, author of the book Defying ISIS, stated, \"Every jihadist in the Middle East believes they can kill, kidnap, enslave, and otherwise torture Christians and other religious minorities, and they believe they can do it without repercussions.\"\n\nIn northern Iraq, Assyrian Christians, an ancient people descended from the first followers of Christ, are facing extinction. Juliana Taimoorazy, founder and president of the Iraqi Christian Relief Council, warned, \"As Assyrians of the Middle East, we are on the verge of extinction.\" Taimoorazy recently visited Telskuf in the Nineveh Plains of Iraq, where 200,000 Christians have fled from ISIS. She described the devastation, stating, \"The homes are destroyed when you walk inside. Their closets are all broken, the beds are all overturned - the kitchens are destroyed.\"\n\nSecretary Kerry's genocide designation aims to keep the plight of these Christians at the forefront of U.S. foreign policy. Advocates are already working with the State Department to ensure Christians are represented in Syrian peace talks and that property rights for those forced to flee their homes in Iraq are enforced.\n\nNina Shea, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, stated, \"There are going to be borders redrawn, constitutions redrafted.\" She emphasized, \"It's absolutely essential that the Christians have a voice in this process or they will have no place in the new Syria or in the new Iraq.\"\n\nAn effort is already underway to create a safe haven in the Nineveh Plains so that Christians, Yazidis, and other minorities can return home, govern themselves, and rebuild their lives without fear of extermination. Robert Nicholson, executive director of the Philos Project, stated, \"If you care about the presence of Christianity, the Christian witness, in this very Gospel-poor part of the world, you will support the idea of a safe haven.\"\n\nDespite the horrors they have experienced at the hands of ISIS, Christians in this region are experiencing a revival of their faith. Taimoorazy shared, \"They have told me repeatedly it's because of persecution that has been inflicted on them that they have grown closer to Christ, that they find themselves praying more, that they're thirsty for the Gospel more.\"\n\nNow, the same advocates who pushed for the genocide designation are moving to maintain the pressure, hoping to ensure the Obama administration not only talks but acts to protect those persecuted Christians and other religious minorities. They aim to make real progress before the next administration takes office.",
    " Title: Romney Defends Campaign Strategy Amidst Conservative Criticism, Denies Writing Off Half of Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with CBS News, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney defended his campaign strategy, stating that it is \"doing a very good job\" despite criticism from some conservative thought leaders. The interview followed the release of a video from a secretly recorded fundraiser held by Romney last spring, in which he described 47% of the electorate as viewing themselves as victims, dependent upon government services, and likely to vote for President Barack Obama.\n\nRomney's campaign responded aggressively to the comments, with the candidate holding a press conference hours after the comments emerged. However, the comments, Romney's response, and his criticism of Obama over violence in the Arab world in the previous week have fueled a narrative advanced by some conservative thought leaders.\n\nPeggy Noonan, a conservative columnist whose work appears in The Wall Street Journal, described Romney's campaign as \"incompetent\" this week. In a Thursday column, Noonan stood by her comments, stating, \"I really meant 'rolling calamity.'\" Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative publication The Weekly Standard, likened Barack Obama and Mitt Romney as \"two presidential candidates who - when they thought they were speaking privately to their fellow 1 percenters - have shown contempt for fellow Americans.\"\n\nIn the CBS interview, Romney pushed back against charges that his 47% comment meant he was writing off nearly half of the country. \"I want to make it very clear, I want to help 100 percent of the American people,\" he said, echoing a new line he debuted on the campaign trail this week after the fundraiser video emerged.\n\nWhen asked if his skills in turning around businesses, a reputation which he and his supporters tout, were needed for his campaign, Romney said, \"My campaign doesn't need a turnaround.\"\n\nRomney also pushed back on recent national and battleground state polling which appears to give Obama a slight edge over Romney, either within or just outside of the sampling error for each survey. \"We've got a campaign which is tied with an incumbent president to the United States,\" Romney said.\n\nIn addition, Romney announced plans to ramp up his campaign schedule with a bus tour, starting in Ohio on Friday. The tour will cover several battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Iowa. The tour is intended to help Romney connect with voters and address concerns about the economy and jobs.",
    " Title: Shift in Strategy: Republicans and Allies Broadening Focus Beyond Obamacare Repeal\n\nArticle:\n\nRecent polling and political strategies suggest that the Republican Party and like-minded groups may be moving away from a singular focus on repealing the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. The shift in strategy is becoming increasingly evident as the 2014 midterm elections approach.\n\nIn March, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who is in a reelection bid against Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, stated that while he wants to repeal the law, Kentucky's version, Kynect, is \"unconnected\" to the fate of Obamacare. Kynect, which provides insurance coverage to over 413,000 people, was created under the Affordable Care Act and is primarily funded through federal funds.\n\nMcConnell's stance is a shift from his primary campaign, where he took a hard-line stance on getting rid of Obamacare. Similarly, Americans for Prosperity (AFP), an organization expected to spend over $100 million this election cycle backing issues that Republicans favor, has also broadened its scope.\n\nIn the lead-up to the launch of Obamacare last fall, AFP had a laser-like focus on the issue, spending millions of dollars in states and districts where Democrats are vulnerable. However, the organization's website now features a campaign against the Export-Import Bank, which is not related to Obamacare. Additionally, an ad airing in Louisiana, where Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is locked in a tight reelection race, attacks her for \"wasteful government spending,\" with no mention of Obamacare.\n\nAFP's partner group, AFP Foundation, launched an $850,000 ad buy in Wisconsin earlier this week that focuses on taxes and does not mention Obamacare. AFP spokesman Levi Russell stated, \"We're responding to the changing environment. That initial shock (of Obamacare) has changed a little bit, but it has not gone away.\"\n\nRepublicans are now retooling their message, having emerged from primary battles of who's farther to the right. They must now try to appeal to a more diverse audience that has become more accepting of the federal health care program approved in 2010 without Republican support.\n\nAccording to a recent CNN poll, 38% of people want to either replace the law or get rid of it. This is a significant decrease from a November poll that found 43% of respondents wanted the law repealed. Elizabeth Wilner with the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan polling group, wrote that Republicans are starting to use the word \"fix\" in their campaigning instead of \"repeal.\"\n\nSince Republicans gained control of the House in 2011, they have voted more than 50 times on a full or partial repeal of the health care law. However, the pace has fallen off dramatically in recent months. This shift in strategy may indicate a recognition that a singular focus on Obamacare repeal may not be as effective in the current political climate.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Reaches Deal with ZTE, Over Congressional Objections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has finalized a deal with Chinese tech giant ZTE, as announced by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday. The agreement, according to Ross, concludes the phase of negotiations with the company, which had been subject to crippling penalties for its previous evasion of sanctions against North Korea and Iran.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, ZTE will pay a $1 billion fine, replace its management, and submit to oversight from the U.S. Commerce Department. Ross stated, \"We are literally embedding a compliance department of our choosing into the company to monitor it going forward. They will pay for those people, but the people will report to the new chairman because we are also having them replace the entire management and the entire board.\"\n\nPresident Trump had instructed Ross to look into easing restrictions on ZTE following a personal request from Chinese President Xi Jinping. Ross described the deal as a victory, stating that the previous strict actions had \"brought... a $17 billion company to its knees, more or less put them out of business,\" and that the new agreement is \"something I think even more effective.\"\n\nRoss warned that if the company fails to comply with the new agreement, strict punishment will be enforced. \"Now, if they do violate it again, in addition to the billion dollars they're paying us right up front, we have them put $400 million in escrow so the total deal is a billion 400 million,\" Ross said.\n\nMany in Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, have strongly opposed the president's handling of the ZTE matter, with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer tweeting, \"The deal with ZTE proves the president just shoots blanks.\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a leading GOP critic, tweeted, \"This deal will do nothing to keep us safe from corporate and national security espionage.\"",
    " Title: Media Errors Plague 2017 Reporting on Trump-Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2017, several high-profile media outlets were embroiled in controversies surrounding inaccurate reporting on the Trump-Russia investigation. One such instance involved CNN, which in December reported that Donald Trump Jr. was colluding with Wikileaks over stolen documents. The network claimed that a man named Mike Erickson emailed Trump Jr. on Sept. 4, 2016, with a link to Wikileaks documents and the decryption key needed to access them. However, a copy of the email given to \u2588\u2588\u2588 showed that it was actually sent on Sept. 14, 2016, after the stolen documents had already been leaked to the general public. Furthermore, Erickson has no apparent ties to Wikileaks or Russia.\n\nThe Washington Post identified him as the president of an aviation management company. To this day, CNN has yet to explain how two different anonymous sources fed the network the wrong date.\n\nAnother instance of media error occurred with The New York Times, which had to \"look into\" its own fake news when former FBI director James Comey questioned its reporting. The NYT claimed that U.S. intelligence officials intercepted communications between the Trump campaign and senior Russian intelligence officials in the year leading up to the election. Comey called the reporting \"almost entirely wrong\" and warned media outlets about relying on sources who don't have a full understanding of \"what's going on.\"\n\nIn the week leading up to the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany in July, CNN anchors reported that President Trump would not be confronting Russian President Vladimir Putin about his country's meddling in American elections. The CNN report\u2014which relied on a single, anonymous source\u2014turned out to be dead wrong.\n\nAn ABC News reporting error resulted in a stock market panic and the suspension of reporter Brian Ross earlier this month. Ross reported that former national security adviser Mike Flynn was prepared to testify that candidate Trump ordered him to make contact with the Russians. Hours later, ABC clarified that Flynn wasn't asked to contact Russia until after the election, during the Trump team's transition period. The story quickly fizzled from Trump-Russia collusion to standard preparation for an incoming presidential administration.\n\nThree CNN employees resigned over a poorly-sourced story on the Trump transition team in June. Relying on a single, unnamed congressional source, CNN claimed that Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci was under investigation over a meeting with a Russian banker that took place shortly before Trump's inauguration. CNN retracted the story and apologized to Scaramucci after multiple parts of the report were proven to be inaccurate.\n\nBloomberg News was forced to correct a bombshell report in December that claimed Special Counsel Robert Mueller had subpoenaed Deutsche Bank records related to President Trump and his family. The story claimed that Mueller had \"zeroed in\" on Trump. Bloomberg later corrected the report, noting that the bank records \"pertain to people affiliated\" with Trump, not the president himself.\n\nCNN broke another flawed bombshell in May. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, while applying for his security clearance, had failed to disclose two meetings with then-Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak. CNN described the story as \"the latest example of Sessions failing to disclose contacts he had with Russian officials.\" CNN quietly walked back the scoop seven months later, noting that the FBI specifically told Sessions he wasn't required to disclose the meetings. In other words: CNN's report excoriated Sessions for simply following protocol.\n\nJournalists at multiple outlets, specifically CNN, consistently pushed the false claim that Republican donors had originally funded the infamous Trump-Russia dossier. Republican donor Paul Singer funded the firm behind the dossier, Fusion GPS, to conduct opposition research on candidates including Trump during the GOP primary. However, Singer had no involvement in the dossier, which has played a central role in the Trump-Russia narrative.\n\nAs former FBI Director James Comey geared up for a congressional testimony in June, CNN found the perfect opportunity to make some bold\u2014but incorrect\u2014predictions. CNN reported that Comey would testify that he did not tell Trump he was the subject of an investigation, as it would be improper for him to do so. CNN was proven drastically wrong when Comey released his prepared testimony, complete with the confirmation that he assured the president that he was not under FBI investigation.\n\nA number of media outlets, including The New York Times, CNN, ABC News, and the Associated Press spent the year perpetuating a false claim Hillary Clinton made during the 2016 presidential debates. Each outlet incorrectly reported that \"all 17 intelligence agencies\" agreed that Russia meddled in the election. The truth is only four intelligence agencies evaluated and made judgments about Russian interference because the rest, like the Department of Energy and the Drug Enforcement Agency, have little authority on the matter.\n\nNBC News published what the network hyped as a \"potential bombshell\" in September. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort's notes from the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer contained the word \"donations\" near a reference to the Republican National Committee, the network reported. NBC began walking back the anonymously sourced story almost immediately, before a report in Politico debunked the \"bombshell\" altogether. Despite what NBC's sources told the network, the word \"donations\" did not appear in Manafort's notes, which weren't considered to be damaging to the Trump team at all.\n\nIn August, The New York Times \"obtained\" and published a draft of the National Climate Assessment (NCA), quoting anonymous scientists who feared \"the Trump administration could change or suppress the report.\" There's just one problem: despite the paper's fear mongering, the draft report had already been publicly available for months.\n\nReports about \"fake news\" on Twitter turned out to be fake news themselves. CNN reported that \"fake news\" was higher in swing states, citing a study from the Oxford Internet Institute. However, the researchers in the study never talked about \"fake news,\" but rather \"junk news\" that apparently comes from mainstream conservative outlets like the Washington Examiner.",
    " Title: GOP Primary Kicks Off as Jeb Bush Announces Exploration of 2016 Presidential Run\n\nArticle:\n\nThe announcement by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush on Tuesday that he is \"actively\" exploring a 2016 presidential run has set the stage for the Republican primary, with other potential GOP candidates following suit. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson have made moves indicating their interest in the race.\n\nBush's Facebook announcement was followed by two Google ads bought by Paul's leadership political action committee (PAC). The first ad appeared in search results for those who searched Bush's name, while the second ad, which included the line \"We need leaders who will stand against Common Core,\" was perceived as an attack ad due to the national school-curriculum standards supported by Bush but opposed by conservative-minded supporters of state autonomy and less government.\n\nPaul, who stated he is \"still a few more months\" away from making a 2016 decision, discussed his stance on Fox News' \"The Kelly File\" later that night. He expressed his belief in less federal government and more decentralized government, particularly in education, and expressed skepticism about Bush's chances in the primary.\n\nRepublican strategist David Payne, a senior vice president at Washington, D.C.-based VOX Global, offered a mixed review of the \"digital shadow boxing\" between the potential candidates, suggesting they will need to be more innovative to capture the interest of Republican primary voters.\n\nThe effort to elect Carson also entered the mix before the end of the day. The National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee announced it will open an office in Iowa, historically the site of the first caucus of the presidential election cycle, followed by the New Hampshire primary.\n\nPolitical strategists argue that if Bush's announcement triggered a starting gun, it was the one that prompted big donors to become more active, particularly those waiting to see if Bush, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, or 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney would try to become the party's establishment candidate.\n\nOther top 2016 GOP hopefuls, such as Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, also used Bush's announcement to draw attention to their own efforts. Cruz expressed his respect for Bush but stated he would wait until Bush officially decides before assessing his potential impact on the GOP primary. Rubio's spokesman indicated that Rubio's decision on whether to run for president or re-election would be based on where he can best achieve his agenda, not on who else might be running.",
    " Title: Obamacare Sign-ups Reach 100,000 in November, Still Short of Initial Goal\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services reported that approximately 100,000 people signed up for health insurance on the federal Obamacare website in November, according to a Bloomberg report citing a source familiar with the program's progress. The agency, however, declined to confirm the specific number, stating that they are still in the process of finalizing the data and expect to report the November numbers in mid-December.\n\nThe reported sign-up number is a significant increase from the 26,794 enrollments in October, marking a fourfold increase. Several states running their own exchanges have also reported steady climbs in enrollment, although some, like Oregon, are still facing technical issues that hinder sign-ups.\n\nHealth and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters stated, \"We expect that enrollment will increase with the technical improvements we've made, enrollment taking place across our customer service channels and the surge in enrollment that many states who are running their own marketplaces have reported.\"\n\nThe administration had initially hoped for about 800,000 people in the state and federal exchanges by now, and about 7 million by the end of March. Officials announced over the weekend that they had met their targets for making key fixes to the website, which is now reportedly working faster and with fewer crashes and errors. However, they acknowledged that the website is far from perfect despite the repair effort, and will need more work.\n\nThis article first appeared on \u2588\u2588\u2588 Pro at 7:41 a.m. Dec. 2, 2013.",
    " Title: Congress to Pass Government Funding and Terrorism Insurance Bills Before Year-End\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final days of the 113th Congress, the House and Senate are expected to pass a government-funding bill and renew the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) this week. The deadline for government funding is Thursday, and both bills are anticipated to pass, albeit with some last-minute drama.\n\nThe government-funding bill, unofficially dubbed the \"cromnibus,\" is set to keep most of the government open through September 2015, but it will extend Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding only until February. The shorter DHS funding deadline is intended to pressure President Barack Obama over his recent executive action on immigration.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), and Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) are expected to lead the effort to secure GOP support for the bill. However, several dozen House Republicans have expressed unease with the legislation due to its lack of specific provisions to block Obama's immigration executive action. Democrats, led by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), are expected to support the bill, but a potential wild card exists. If the bill is pushed further to the right with controversial riders on environmental or labor policy, Democrats may vote against it, and the White House may issue a veto threat.\n\nIf the legislation is unveiled on Monday, it could hit the House floor by Wednesday, allowing the Senate one day to pass it to avoid a government shutdown. The House has canceled its votes Monday evening for the White House Christmas party, giving the GOP leadership just two days to get its members in line.\n\nThe controversy over Obama's immigration policy will continue into 2015. Boehner has stated that the new Republican-controlled Congress, which comes into session on January 6, will work to change Obama's executive order when DHS funding comes up for renewal next year. However, it is unclear how Congress will be able to revise or alter the president's unilateral action.\n\nRenewing TRIA has proven more challenging in Congress' rush to leave town. The federal government provides a backstop for insuring against terrorist attacks, and passage is a priority for potential targets like cities, municipalities, and professional sports teams. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) is negotiating with Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to hash out a deal. The two sides were on the brink of an agreement last week, but Hensarling wants to insert reforms to Dodd-Frank regulations into the package. House GOP leadership aides have vowed that they will not let the negotiations fall apart and will pass the measure.\n\nOn the foreign policy front, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to debate and vote on a resolution authorizing the use of military force against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The measure, being pushed by Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.), won't have time to reach the Senate floor or be taken up by the House. The debate, however, will set a benchmark for lawmakers when they return to debate this issue more fully in the next Congress. An Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) vote would also boost Paul's GOP presidential ambitions by placing him in the spotlight on a critical foreign policy issue.\n\nTwo other matters will also receive attention during the next 96 hours. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who are switching their respective roles in January, will try to hammer out a last-minute agreement on executive-branch nominations, the final time Obama will have that opportunity during his presidency under a Democratic-run Senate. Additionally, the House Ethics Committee is being closely watched over whether it will make any late announcements on high-profile cases. The secretive panel is scheduled to meet privately several times this week. If the Ethics Committee does not act on these pending cases before the end of this Congress, it will have to vote to take them up again once the next Congress begins. Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) will take over as Ethics Committee chairman next year from Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas).",
    " Title: Democrats Gain Edge Over Republicans in Midterm Elections, According to New Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nA new CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday indicates that Democrats have a slight edge over Republicans in the upcoming November midterm elections, with 47% of likely voters supporting the Democratic party compared to 45% for the Republican party. This 6-point swing from a CNN poll three weeks ago, where likely voters favored the Republicans by a 4-point margin, falls within the poll's 3.5% margin of error.\n\nThe poll, conducted after the U.S. launched airstrikes against ISIS in Syria, suggests a shift toward the Democrats nationally, although the gains are primarily in the Northeast and not in the competitive races that could determine control of the Senate. The \"generic ballot\" question, which asks Americans to choose between an unnamed Democrat and an unnamed Republican in their vote for U.S. House, indicates a shift toward the Democrats if not in key races in key states.\n\nThe poll also reveals that the economy is a more important issue for voters than military action against ISIS, with roughly two out of three Americans stating that the economy is more important in determining their vote for the midterms. This contrasts with the lead-up to the Iraq War in 2002, when 49% of Americans considered the possibility of war with Iraq a more important factor than the economy.\n\nIn addition, most Americans, 59%, do not consider the conflict with ISIS to be a war, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Monday. The poll also indicates that Americans are largely unsatisfied with Congress's handling of the situation with ISIS, with 60% disapproving. This is just weeks after members of Congress absconded from Capitol Hill without a vote on military action against ISIS to campaign for reelection in their districts.\n\nThe poll also shows that Democrats gained the most ground among men and independent voters, two key groups that could help Democrats in competitive races this November. Men took a 7-point swing toward Democrats from the previous poll, bringing the party within 6 points of Republicans' 49% support. Republicans also lost support among independents as Democrats saw a 7-point bump, giving them a 44-42% advantage over their rivals.\n\nThe traction for Democrats comes in the wake of an expanded military campaign ordered by President Barack Obama. The polling director for CNN, Keating Holland, stated that the Democrats' gains among men and independent voters \"may be a sign that some men wanted to see aggressive action taken against ISIS and are rewarding the President's party\u2014or simply that the President's actions have convinced men that they do not need to send more Republicans to Washington in order to get action that they are looking for.\"",
    " Title: Obama Nominates Tom Perez for Labor Secretary, Sparking Political Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has nominated Tom Perez, the Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, to be his next Labor Secretary. If confirmed by the Senate, Perez would replace Hilda Solis, who resigned in January.\n\nPerez, 51, is the son of Dominican immigrants and worked his way through college and law school before joining the Justice Department and becoming Maryland's state labor secretary. In his nomination announcement, Obama praised Perez as a man who embodies the American promise, stating, \"His story reminds us of this country's promise, that if you're willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from, what your last name is, you can make it if you try.\"\n\nPerez emphasized the importance of open-mindedness, listening to all sides, and focusing on results during his nomination speech. However, the issue of immigration reform and its impact on undocumented workers has already become a contentious point in the nomination process.\n\nRepublican opposition to Perez's nomination was swift, with Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, criticizing the appointment as \"an unfortunate and needlessly divisive nomination.\" Sessions argued that Perez's past work for the advocacy group Casa de Maryland has involved seeking ways to hire more illegal workers.\n\nSen. David Vitter (R-La.) has also announced his intention to block the Perez nomination, citing the Justice Department's alleged failure to respond to a 2011 letter he wrote with questions about federal enforcement of the 1993 Motor Voter Act.\n\nMeanwhile, AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka praised Perez as a champion for ordinary working people and a strong advocate for workers' rights. The White House has portrayed Perez as an individual aligned with Obama's sense of social justice, highlighting his work in settling the nation's three largest fair-lending housing cases, boosting enforcement of human trafficking laws, and protecting the rights of veterans and students.\n\nPerez's confirmation hearings are expected to feature questions about a scathing inspector general's report released last week that revealed internal racial hostilities in the Civil Rights Division and found Perez gave misleading public testimony in 2010 regarding the decision to drop prosecution of New Black Panther Party members. The report has added fuel to the political debate surrounding Perez's nomination.",
    " Title: Romney Outraises Obama by $21 Million in May Fundraising\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, raised approximately $86 million in May, outpacing President Barack Obama's fundraising efforts by about $21 million, according to campaign finance reports filed on Wednesday. Romney's campaign, along with his super PAC allies and the Republican Party, raised an estimated $65 million by Obama and his allies.\n\nRomney's fundraising advantage is expected to persist through November, as his team is planning a weekend of donor schmoozing at a Utah ski resort. The event invites 100 supporters who have raised $100,000 or more, featuring Romney, his top campaign staff, and notable GOP figures such as Karl Rove, Tim Pawlenty, Rob Portman, Paul Ryan, and Bobby Jindal.\n\nPresident Obama's campaign is attempting to keep pace. While the president's campaign often portrays itself as small-donor-powered, Wednesday's reports show that his allies are mounting a big-money push, attracting three new million-dollar donors to a supportive super PAC and raising larger checks into a campaign committee restructured to accept larger donations.\n\nThe reports, filed with the Federal Election Commission, depict a well-positioned Romney fundraising network for the new big-money age, capable of challenging an Obama operation that, in some ways, is still adapting to the era of mega-donors.\n\n\"It's easier to raise money in big chunks if there are people who are willing to give it that way, then it is to mobilize thousands of people to give $20 each,\" said Bob Biersack, a leading campaign finance tracker who recently joined the Center for Responsive Politics after decades at the FEC.\n\nBig donors have fueled record fundraising for GOP super PACs, including Restore Our Future, which raised $5 million, and American Crossroads, which raised $4.6 million, according to Wednesday's filings. Repeat donors to the super PACs included Pennsylvania medical executive Rocco Ortenzio, Idaho vitamin executive Frank VanderSloot, and a company controlled by Dallas developer Harlan Crow, who collectively donated $1.6 million last month.\n\nHowever, Wednesday's reports do not fully reflect the efforts to attract new donors who previously wrote big checks to Romney's GOP opponents, such as casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who pledged $10 million this month, and also intends to give generously to American Crossroads' nonprofit sister group.\n\nDemocrats have expressed concern for months about their inability to counteract Restore Our Future and a constellation of GOP-allied outside groups already spending heavily on ads attacking Obama. They received some positive news on Wednesday, as the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action, which had been struggling to attract big donors, reported raising $4 million in May\u2014its best month yet. This came largely from three new donors who gave $1 million each in May\u2014developer Franklin Haney, Houston lawyer Steve Mostyn, and philanthropist Barbara Stiefel\u2014all of which had the group feeling optimistic and touting the impact of its ads attacking Romney over his tenure at the private equity firm Bain Capital.\n\nHowever, Priorities' $18.6-million total haul for the cycle pales in comparison with the $61.5 million raised by Restore Our Future.",
    " Title: The Impact of European Arrival on Native American Populations: A Historical Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nThe arrival of European explorers, such as Samuel de Champlain and Capt. John Smith, in the early 1600s marked a significant turning point in the history of the New World. According to historian Mancall, a disease, believed to be leptospirosis, spread among Native American communities, potentially introduced by Old World bacteria carried by rats on European ships. This illness weakened the native population, creating an opportunity for European settlers, such as the Pilgrims.\n\nKing James's patent referred to this spread of disease as a \"wonderful Plague\" that could help devastate and depopulate the region. However, many Native Americans not killed by disease were victims of direct violence.\n\nThe celebration in 1621, often associated with the first Thanksgiving, did not mark a friendly turning point and was not an annual event. Relations between the Wampanoag and the settlers deteriorated, leading to the Pequot War. In 1637, in retaliation for the murder of a settler believed to have been killed by the Wampanoag, settlers burned a nearby village, killing as many as 500 men, women, and children. Following the massacre, William Bradford, the Governor of Plymouth, wrote that every Thanksgiving Day ordained by a Governor was in honor of the bloody victory, thanking God that the battle had been won.\n\nJust 16 years after the Wampanoag shared that meal, they were massacred. This was one of the earliest episodes in a series of violent encounters between settlers and Native Americans. There were numerous massacres and wars, with the U.S. government authorizing over 1,500 wars, attacks, and raids on Native American communities, more than any other country in the world against its indigenous people.\n\nThis account says nothing of all the treaties brokered and then broken or all the land grabs that removed populations, including the most famous removal of natives: the Trail of Tears. Beginning in 1831, tens of thousands of Native Americans were forced to relocate from their ancestral lands in the Southeast to lands west of the Mississippi River. Many died along the way.",
    " Title: Former President Obama Criticizes Trump Administration's Response to Covid-19 Pandemic, Addresses Racial Inequality\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare break from tradition, former President Barack Obama has criticized the Trump administration's response to the Covid-19 pandemic during speeches to graduating students of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and high school students. The comments, made on Saturday, come amidst the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over 88,000 lives in the United States, a death toll far higher than any other country.\n\nDuring his address to HBCU graduates, Obama stated, \"More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they're doing. A lot of them aren't even pretending to be in charge.\" He further criticized the administration's response in a second speech for graduating US high school students, saying, \"Doing what feels good, what's convenient, what's easy\u2014that's how little kids think. Unfortunately, a lot of so-called grown-ups, including some with fancy titles and important jobs, still think that way\u2014which is why things are so screwed up.\"\n\nObama's comments come amidst dual crises\u2014one being the pandemic disproportionately affecting people of color in the US, and the other being the economic impacts of attempts to contain the virus through lockdowns. As of now, there have been 1.4 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US.\n\nThe former president also addressed the high-profile killings of black people by police, including the case of Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black jogger who was shot and killed after being pursued in broad daylight by a white former police officer and his son through a neighborhood in Georgia. Obama stated, \"We see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him, if he doesn't submit to their questioning.\"\n\nThe remarks prompted a response from Peter Navarro, a top economic adviser to President Trump, who said he was \"glad Mr. Obama has a new job as Joe Biden's press secretary.\" Biden, Obama's former vice president, is running against Trump for president.\n\nObama's comments come after a leaked call last week in which he described the US government's coronavirus response as, \"an absolute chaotic disaster,\" and questioned whether the justice department's decision to drop charges against former national security advisor Michael Flynn could endanger the \"rule of law\" in the United States. The remarks prompted Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to tell the former president to \"keep his mouth shut.\"\n\nThe remarks also come amidst the emergence of the #Obamagate conspiracy theory, a theory pushed by President Trump that accuses Obama of attempting to frame Trump for colluding with Russia to win the 2016 election. One former CIA analyst described the hashtag as \"a hashtag in search of a scandal.\"\n\nThe speeches were preceded by performances by musicians, actors, and entertainers such as Steve Harvey, Anthony Hamilton, Doug E Fresh, Wyclef Jean, Common, Kevin Hart, Wendy Raquel Robinson, and Vivica A Fox. The messages to graduates tuning in online because they could not hold traditional celebrations on campus were shot through with acknowledgements of America's history of racial segregation.\n\nSpeakers noted the perseverance required to spend a final semester largely online, and the bittersweetness of the moment itself. \"This is obviously not the way you wanted to graduate,\" said Doc Rivers, coach of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers. \"But you know what else we know? You're going to make us all proud.\"\n\nGraduates were sent out into an \"uncertain world,\" but one they had a chance to improve upon. \"As graduates, you now join the ranks of national and world leaders, influencers,\" said Senator Kamala Harris of California. \"I know this is a trying time, but please do not let the moment of this crisis dampen your ambitions, your hopes, or your dreams, because your country needs you.\" Harris attended the HBCU Howard, recently ran for the Democratic nomination, and is a contender to become Joe Biden's running mate in the 2020 election.",
    " Title: Terrorist Attack in New York: Eight Dead, Suspect in Critical Condition\n\nArticle:\n\nInvestigators at the scene of a terrorist attack in New York have found a note referencing Islamic State, according to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. The attack occurred on Tuesday afternoon when a man drove a rented truck down a popular cycle path in Manhattan.\n\nThe man, who is in critical condition in a New York City hospital after being shot by a police officer, is expected to survive. The truck collided with a school bus at the corner of Chambers Street, bringing the rampage to a halt. The school bus was later removed.\n\nThe attack resulted in eight deaths and 11 injuries. The stretch of the cycle lane in lower Manhattan, near the site of the 9/11 attack, remained sealed off on Wednesday morning. Mangled bicycles were still strewn along the approximately one-mile length of the path where people were struck.\n\nThe truck was still at the scene, with its smashed front visible. The site is just a few blocks from the One World Trade Center skyscraper, which was only recently completed on the site of the original Twin Towers, destroyed in the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, killing nearly 3,000 people. Tuesday's attack represented the highest death toll from a terrorist incident in the city since 9/11.\n\nThe victims of the attack were from various nationalities, including Belgium and Argentina. The suspect in the attack is 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, a national of Uzbekistan who immigrated to the US in 2010 and was a driver for the car service Uber, living in New Jersey.\n\nInvestigators converged on an apartment building in Patterson, New Jersey, where the suspect is understood to have lived. The president of Uzbekistan, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, has sent his condolences to President Donald Trump and offered his country's assistance in investigating the attack.\n\nNew York City officials have expressed defiance and resilience in the face of the attack, with Mayor Bill de Blasio describing it as an act of terror. The suspect's motives and the exact details of the attack are still under investigation.",
    " Title: Lawmakers Propose Economic Stimulus Packages and Universal Basic Income Amid Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nMultiple lawmakers, including Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), have proposed economic stimulus packages and universal basic income programs in response to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. On Friday, Gabbard introduced a resolution that would provide a monthly income of $1,000 to every American until COVID-19 no longer poses a public health emergency.\n\nIn an effort to contain the spread of the virus, the U.S. has imposed travel bans on several countries heavily affected by the pandemic, and numerous large events and conferences have been canceled or postponed. The stock market experienced its worst losses since 1987 on Thursday, but the exact number of workers affected is unavailable.\n\nLast week, Republicans and Democrats united to enact $8.3 billion in emergency funding, primarily dedicated to healthcare concerns arising from the crisis. A second round of relief, set to receive a House vote on Friday, focuses on the economic fallout, providing financial assistance to those most directly affected by the outbreak. The bill expands unemployment insurance, extends paid sick leave for workers forced to stay home, and provides food aid to low-income children due to school closures. The bill also aims to offer free coronavirus testing for everyone showing symptoms, including the uninsured.\n\nHowever, some members argue that a universal basic income is necessary to prevent lasting economic damage. \"The coronavirus pandemic has created a threat to the health and well-being of the American people, as well as to our country's economic stability,\" Gabbard said in a statement. \"While some in Washington are focused on taking care of Wall Street, everyday Americans get left behind. That's wrong...Taking care of all Americans will stimulate our economy during this downturn.\"\n\nEconomist Nouriel Roubini supported the idea in a tweet on Friday, suggesting it be financed with bonds and monetized by the Federal Reserve.\n\nOn Friday, Democratic Reps. Ro Khanna (Calif.) and Tim Ryan (Ohio) also introduced legislation to establish an emergency Earned Income Tax Credit. The bill would provide a payment of $1,000 and $6,000 to over a third of Americans who earned less than $65,000 last year.\n\n\"In order to alleviate the economic fallout of the Coronavirus, we must ensure hard-working Americans have money in their pockets and are able to pay their bills,\" Khanna said in a statement. \"We must soften the blow for workers as large gatherings and events are canceled and hours are cut. A payroll tax cut is not sufficient.\"",
    " Title: Biden's 2020 Campaign: A Comparison to Hillary Clinton and George W. Bush\n\nArticle:\n\nJoe Biden, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, kicked off his campaign in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on May 18, 2019.\n\nMatt Continetti, editor of the Washington Free Beacon, recently posed the question, \"Is Biden the new Hillary Clinton?\" The question arises as Trump's team is reportedly planning to employ similar tactics against Biden as they did against Clinton in the 2016 election.\n\nIn 2016, Trump defined Clinton as a candidate of entrenched interests who used a long career in politics for familial gain. He highlighted Clinton's support for the 1994 crime bill and for NAFTA and TPP, creating divisions between the former secretary of state and important Democratic constituencies. Trump also attacked Clinton's foreign-policy credentials, portraying her as an interventionist who weakened America's standing in the world.\n\nAccording to the RealClearPolitics average, Biden is currently leading Trump by 8 points. In crucial states like Pennsylvania, Biden has a double-digit lead, with a 10.5 percentage-point advantage in Michigan, 8 points in Wisconsin (though polling there is sparse), and 4 points in Ohio. Biden is tied in Florida, according to the RealClearPolitics average.\n\nTrump won the Electoral College by taking a handful of states out of the traditional Democratic column with razor-thin margins. It's early, but the concerning part for Trump is that Biden is not only outperforming other Democrats in the field, but he's also outperforming Clinton at a comparable time in 2015.\n\nHowever, the comparison between Biden and Clinton may not be entirely accurate. Clinton ran as an experienced Washington hand, but after 16 months of Trump attacks, she lost to Trump by 77,000 votes in three states. The same could happen again to a nominee easily caricatured as the epitome of Beltway cluelessness, according to Continetti. What looks like Joe Biden's greatest strength\u2014electability born of experience\u2014may also be a debilitating weakness.\n\nWhile Trump's attacks on Clinton were effective at times, Trump was aided enormously by the fact that Americans, particularly Republican and Republican-friendly ones, were skeptical or outright hostile to her already, thanks to decades of experience with, and criticism of, her. Trump didn't define Clinton as much as she did.\n\nMoreover, implicit to her campaign was the promise of both a third Obama term and a restoration of the Clinton dynasty. Trump did not need to work hard to convince voters exhausted or frustrated by the Obama years or disdainful of Clinton Inc. to vote against her.\n\nBiden occupies a different space, psychologically and politically. There's a lot of conventional wisdom in Washington that the early front-runner always loses. However, this is true except when it isn't. In 2003, former Vermont governor Howard Dean dominated the polls but eventually lost. In 1999, George W. Bush dominated the polls and, except for a brief scare from Senator John McCain in the New Hampshire primary, essentially cruised to victory.\n\nA key part of Bush's early success, not just in polls but in fundraising, stemmed from the fact that he was promising a Bush restoration. Indeed, some of his early approval ratings were a direct result of nostalgia for his father, with whom he shared a name. Also, he was offering a referendum on the incumbent president and the scandals and partisanship that defined the end of his administration. He vowed to restore \"honor and dignity to the Oval Office\" and to be a \"uniter not a divider.\"\n\nThe very different context notwithstanding, this is pretty much Biden's campaign message. The ideological, activist, and Twitter-obsessed base of the Democratic party may not like Biden's pitch. But it sure looks like rank-and-file Democrats do, particularly African-American women who may see in Biden something of an Obama restoration.\n\nOf course, Biden can blow it, as he did the two previous times he ran for president. But counting on the past repeating itself is a good strategy only when you pick the right example from the past.",
    " Title: GOP Steps Up Digital Efforts to Enhance Online Presence Ahead of Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublicans, following their losses in the 2012 election, are taking aggressive steps to improve their digital strategy in preparation for the upcoming midterm elections. According to Eric Frenchman, a strategist at Connell Donatelli Inc., the Republican Party needs to prioritize digital media as their first line of defense, rather than relying on traditional offline media such as TV, talk radio, and direct mail.\n\nIn the 2012 election cycle, the Democratic Party outspent the Republicans on digital media and advertising, with President Obama's team investing $52 million compared to Mitt Romney's $26 million. Obama posted four times as much online content as Romney and was active on twice as many digital platforms, according to a Pew Internet & American Life study.\n\nThe digital strategies employed by both parties during the 2012 election mirrored the 2008 election, where Sen. John McCain's campaign launched an 11th-hour tech offensive that came too late. Similarly, Romney advisers took aggressive steps during the summer to close the digital gap but were outmaneuvered.\n\nAcross platforms, Obama published 614 posts during a two-week period compared with Romney's 168. The greatest contrast was on Twitter, where Romney averaged one tweet per day while Obama had 29. Republicans were also outperformed on YouTube, with Democrats publishing two videos for every GOP video.\n\nTo address these shortcomings, Republican strategists are taking proactive measures to become more competitive. Last week, members of the Republican Party, along with consultants from companies like Facebook and Twitter, met in Washington to strategize on building a better digital platform. The group was led by Romney's digital director Zac Moffatt, RNC digital director Tyler Brown, and RNC Chief of Staff Jeff Larson.\n\nFrenchman, who directed over $175 million in online advertising for the 2008 McCain-Palin presidential bid, emphasized the importance of allocating sufficient funds to compete with the already tech-savvy Democratic team. \"Spend money earlier in the process,\" Frenchman said. \"It's not something you can afford to wait to finance. It's going to take money, and it needs to happen now.\"\n\nThe Republican Party's digital shortcomings in the 2012 election highlighted cracks in their plan, as the Obama team had a four-year head start. Frenchman suggested that the GOP should pool their resources and assemble a super RNC digital team to address the situation early.\n\nSome have criticized the Romney campaign for wasting time trying to reinvent the digital wheel instead of building on foundations already in place. The Romney campaign was also called out for being too slow to respond to developments in the race.\n\nObama's digital team used their website, emails, and text messages to push the president's message, as well as developing tools that made it easier to donate online, assemble groups to canvas neighborhoods, and volunteer for field operations in swing states. They also started a campaign that helped supporters find their Facebook friends in battleground states through an Obama 2012 app that also reminded them to vote. They then put a link on Facebook that helped supporters find voting locations.\n\nFor its part, the Romney campaign has stated that they will hand over their digital files, which includes data on 1 million new voters, to the RNC.",
    " Title: GOP's Scant Legislative Agenda for 2018 Due to Loss of Senate Seats Due to Poor Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican Party's legislative agenda for the remainder of 2018 is minimal, according to a report by The Washington Post. The $1.3 trillion spending bill, which President Trump signed into law last month, is likely the last significant legislation to pass Congress before the November elections.\n\nThe House of Representatives is expected to take a largely symbolic vote on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget and attempt to reverse some spending while also finalizing a banking deregulation bill and drafting legislation to address the opioid crisis. The Senate, meanwhile, is likely to focus on confirming Trump nominees, including more judges and the president's picks to lead the State Department and the CIA following last month's Cabinet shuffle.\n\nThe article points out the irony of House Republicans calling for a vote on a balanced-budget amendment after passing a deficit-financed tax cut and a budget-busting omnibus bill. The Senate filibuster is not entirely to blame for the legislative stalemate, as the process creates a barrier against many types of legislation but not all. The process of budget reconciliation enables a narrow, 51-vote majority to change policies related to spending and taxes, which is how the GOP got tax reform passed in December. However, Republicans are declining to pursue this option in 2018.\n\nThe cause for the legislative stalemate is rooted in the various maladies and mistakes of state Republican parties across the country. The article argues that the GOP has lost eminently winnable Senate races, allowing Senate Democrats to pad their caucus. This has stymied the Republican legislative agenda.\n\nThe Senate's composition, when viewed from a partisan state perspective, makes sense, with strongly Democratic states electing two Democrats, and strongly Republican states electing two Republicans. Purple states have one Democrat and one Republican. However, the deviations do not always hold across purple states, with New Hampshire having two Democrats and Iowa having two Republicans.\n\nThe main exception to this is a group of six Senate Democrats who come from strongly Republican states. These are Doug Jones of Alabama, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Joe Tester of Montana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The only Republican from a strongly Democratic state is Susan Collins of Maine.\n\nCandidate effects explain many of these Democratic-held seats. Jones, Donnelly, and McCaskill won their races because their Republican opponents said or did outrageous things that alienated the broad middle of their states. Tester and Heitkamp are still in office because their opponents, while not ridiculously bad, ran thoroughly lackluster campaigns in 2012, failing to win despite the boost they received from Mitt Romney's winning their respective states with ease. Among the six, only Manchin, a former governor, had the sort of reputation that could inoculate him from a strong Republican campaign to oust him.\n\nThe article concludes that the GOP should not have lost all six of these seats. Three to four should be in Republican hands, and the failure rests not with the party's leadership but with Republican voters and leaders in these states: They failed to select good candidates, and now the party is paying the price.",
    " Title: Romney's Assertion on Medicare Pay Cuts for Doctors Challenged\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing 2020 presidential campaign, healthcare, particularly Medicare, has been a significant topic. Over the past couple of weeks, Republican candidate Mitt Romney has made a claim regarding $716 billion in Medicare reductions over ten years, which is a part of the federal health law, the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This claim has become a recurring theme in Romney's stump speeches.\n\nDuring his economic speech in Ames, Iowa, last week, Romney stated:\n\n\"It matters to the senior who needs to get an appointment with a medical specialist, but is told by one receptionist after another that the doctor is not taking any new Medicare patients; because Medicare has been slashed to pay for Obamacare.\"\n\nHarold Pollack, a professor of public health policy at the University of Chicago, disputes Romney's assertion, stating, \"I'm honestly rather baffled at the arguments that Governor Romney is making.\"\n\nWhile it is true that the ACA envisions reductions in Medicare, and some of that money is used to fund the rest of the law, these two factors are not directly connected. The issue of Medicare pay for doctors predates the ACA by more than a decade, according to Pollack. \"And every year, Congress has to go through the song and dance with something called the doctor fix to prevent Medicare fees from a fairly catastrophic reduction. That has nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act. Health reform does not cut physician fees,\" Pollack explains.\n\nThe Medicare pay for doctors problem has been a long-standing issue, with Congress needing to address it annually through the so-called \"doctor fix.\" This issue is unrelated to the ACA.\n\nThe ACA did take a few steps to boost payments for some doctors, including improving reimbursement for primary care providers in both Medicare and the Medicaid program, where the shortage of doctors has been more pronounced.\n\nA campaign email referenced a 2010 survey of doctors by the Physicians Foundation, in which 30% said the law would prompt them to close their practices to new Medicare patients. However, the survey had a response rate of only 2.4%, and more than two-thirds of those who responded started with a self-described negative view of the law.",
    " Title: Democratic National Committee Elects Tom Perez as New Chair in Contested Race\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) elected Tom Perez as their new party chair on Saturday, in a contentious race that marked a significant transition for the party. Perez, a favorite among the more centrist wing of the party, received 235 votes, while Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), a favorite among progressives, received 200 votes. Perez, the son of Dominican immigrants, will be the first Latino to hold the post.\n\nAs the chair, Perez will lead the party's organizing, messaging, and fundraising operations. This role carries substantial influence in defining the Democrats' identity and pitch to voters following their shock loss in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe DNC chair election comes at a time when the Democrats hold little political control, having lost 20% of their Senate seats, 25% of their House seats, 45% of their governors, and over half of state legislatures since 2009, according to the Associated Press. Several candidates, including Perez, campaigned on a promise to focus more on down-ballot races and ramp up small-donor fundraising.\n\nOne of the crucial questions for Perez is interpreting national demographic trends and translating them into Democratic strategy. Some Democrats argue that the next DNC chair needs to target more progressive white voters, often referred to as \"Bernie voters,\" who were skeptical of Hillary Clinton's candidacy. They believe demographic trends favor them and move away from the white working-class voters who unexpectedly supported President Trump.\n\nHowever, others argue that these numbers oversimplify the situation. Lanae Erickson Hatalsky and Jim Kessler of the centrist think tank Third Way suggest that changes are concentrated in urban Democratic strongholds, voters cast ballots across parties more often than believed, and the rising proportion of voters who identify as liberal is offset by other factors, including a corresponding rise in conservative-identifying voters.\n\nPerez's election to the post may come as a surprise to some who expected Ellison to prevail, partly as a concession to the progressive wing. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a backer of Ellison, had framed the choice as one between the \"failed status quo\" and a \"fundamental restructuring of the Democratic Party.\"\n\nJerry Shriner, a DNC member from Idaho, expressed concerns about Perez's election, stating, \"There are risks with every candidate, but [with Ellison and Perez] in particular...I think there will be people who pull back.\" However, Shriner added, \"But the way I look at it, we have four years to work on that. Whatever problems either candidate might create in terms of divisiveness, we have four years to pull that together.\"",
    " Title: Sen. Rand Paul Seeks Information on Surveillance Allegations by Obama Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, has formally requested information from the White House and the U.S. intelligence community regarding potential surveillance by the Obama administration. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Friday, Sen. Paul expressed concerns about the politicization of intelligence agencies.\n\nIn a tweet, Sen. Paul stated, \"I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community.\" He further questioned whether the Obama administration targeted other presidential candidates, members of Congress, journalists, clergy, lawyers, and federal judges.\n\nSen. Paul, a critic of intelligence programs that capture metadata on innocent Americans, told Breitbart that several individuals have approached him with allegations of surveillance. Former National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice acknowledged in April that associates of President Donald Trump were \"unmasked,\" but denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSen. Paul expressed concern about the potential misuse of information, stating, \"We've had several people come to us and say that it happened. I don't have access to that information, but I've been very concerned that too many Americans' information is being culled through without a warrant. I don't have any facts to say it happened. But numerous sources are coming to us saying it did happen, so I want to search through, find out why I wasn't notified. Was it on purpose?\"\n\nThe senator's request follows a report that NSA officials honored almost 2,000 \"unmasking\" requests in 2016. Sen. Paul told Breitbart, \"We have several sources telling us that members of the Obama administration were looking at politicians, particularly [those] who were running for office.\"\n\nFBI Director James B. Comey has previously denied that President Trump's campaign was ever targeted directly by the Obama administration. The details of Sen. Paul's request and the response from the White House and the intelligence community are yet to be disclosed.",
    " Title: Tlaib Rejects Israel's Offer to Visit Grandmother Due to Restrictive Conditions\n\nArticle:\n\nRashida Tlaib, a Democratic U.S. House member, has declined Israel's offer to visit her grandmother in the West Bank, citing the restrictive conditions as contradicting her beliefs in fighting against racism, oppression, and injustice. Tlaib made the announcement on Twitter on Friday.\n\nIsrael had initially barred Tlaib and fellow Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, also a Muslim, under pressure from President Donald Trump. However, Israel announced on Friday that it would allow Tlaib to visit her family, a day after the initial ban.\n\nIsrael's Interior Minister Aryeh Deri stated that Tlaib agreed not to re-state her support for a boycott of Israel during the visit as a condition for entry. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a firm ally of Trump, had laid out this condition.\n\nAfter Tlaib indicated she would reject the offer, Deri questioned on Twitter whether her interest in visiting relatives was genuine. \"I approved her request as a gesture of good will on a humanitarian basis, but it was just a provocative request, aimed at bashing the State of Israel,\" he wrote. \"Apparently her hate for Israel overcomes her love for her grandmother.\"\n\nThe decision to block the visit, initially planned to start this weekend, sparked furor among Democrats and at least one prominent Republican - Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. The staunchly pro-Israel group American Israel Public Affairs Committee also stated that the two lawmakers should be allowed to visit.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman called the trip \"nothing more than an effort to fuel the BDS engine,\" referring to the \"boycott, divestment and sanctions\" movement against Israel over the country's treatment of Palestinians, a cause Omar and Tlaib have voiced support for.\n\nThe decision to block the visit reversed a previous announcement in July from Israel's ambassador to the U.S., Ron Dermer, that Israel would permit the women to enter out of respect for Congress.\n\nTlaib stated that her family would not want her to agree to Israel's restrictions and that they were an effort \"to humiliate me and my family or take away our right to speak out.\"\n\n\"When I won the election to become a United States congresswoman, many Palestinians, especially my grandmother, felt a sense of hope, a hope that they would finally have a voice,\" Tlaib said in a statement from her congressional office. \"I can not allow the Israeli government to take that away from them or to use my deep desire to see my grandmother, potentially for the last time, as a political bargaining chip.\"",
    " Title: Trump, Putin Hold First Face-to-Face Meeting in Helsinki, Discuss \"Difficult Multi-national Issues\"\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a face-to-face meeting in Helsinki, Finland, marking the first time the two leaders have met in person. The meeting, which was described by Trump as a \"good start,\" included two hours of closed-door talks followed by a working lunch with their senior advisers.\n\nPrior to the summit, Putin stated that it was time to discuss \"difficult multi-national issues.\" Relations between Russia and the West have been strained due to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, a claim Russia strongly denies.\n\nBefore the much-anticipated summit, Trump expressed hope for an \"extraordinary relationship\" and blamed U.S.-Russia tensions on previous administrations. Some U.S. politicians called for the summit to be cancelled following the indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence agents on Friday for hacking the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nHowever, Trump put the blame for the deterioration in relations with Russia on \"years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt.\" The tweets are likely to alarm White House advisers who are already nervous about the risks of ceding too much ground to the Russian leader during the talks.\n\nThe two leaders were joined only by their interpreters during their two hours of face-to-face talks. The summit comes after a tumultuous European tour that saw Trump sharply criticize longstanding allies of the U.S. over trade and military spending.\n\nRussia has been criticized in the U.S. for its military support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria as well as its destabilizing actions in Ukraine. Relations have also been damaged by accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and Trump campaign collusion in the effort. The allegations are being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nTrump has consistently denounced the inquiry as a \"witch hunt.\" The 12 Russians indicted on Friday were targeted as part of Mueller's investigation. Top Democrats, including party chairman Tom Perez, urged Trump to cancel the talks, saying Putin was \"not a friend of the United States.\" On the Republican side, Senator John McCain said the summit \"should not move forward\" unless the president \"is prepared to hold Putin accountable.\"\n\nRussia denied the hacking allegations and said it looked forward to the talks as a vehicle for improving relations. U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton has said that both sides have agreed the meeting will have no set agenda. However, he said he found it \"hard to believe\" Putin would not expect the alleged election hacking to be brought up.\n\nTrump has also been urged to raise the poisoning of two people in the UK who came into contact with the nerve agent Novichok on 30 June. Investigators believe the incident is linked to the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in March.\n\nDuring a joint news conference with UK Prime Minister Theresa May last week, Trump elaborated on what would be discussed at the summit. \"We'll be talking about Syria,\" he said. \"We'll be talking about other parts of the Middle East. I will be talking about nuclear proliferation.\"\n\nThis is not the first time U.S. and Russian leaders have met in Helsinki. Finland remained politically and militarily neutral after World War Two, making it an attractive meeting spot for the two superpowers. The city was a backdrop to the signing of the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which are credited for improving relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries. Helsinki remained a destination in the post-Soviet era, and the Trump-Putin summit is the fourth such meeting in the city.\n\nWhat has Trump been doing so far in Europe? His tour has included a NATO summit in Belgium and a visit to the UK. Neither passed without controversy. Following the NATO summit, Trump said the allies had pledged to \"substantially\" raise their defense budgets, but other leaders cast doubt on this claim. The UK visit also had its ups and downs after Trump told a newspaper the U.S. would probably not give the UK a trade deal under the terms of May's Brexit plans - and then later appeared to backtrack on this position. He also said Europe was \"losing its character\" because of immigration from Africa and the Middle East. On Sunday, just before he departed for Helsinki, Trump described the European Union as a foe on trade. He told CBS News that European countries were taking advantage of the U.S. and not paying their NATO bills.",
    " Title: Trump Issues Executive Order Temporarily Blocking Some Foreigners from Permanent U.S. Residency\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order on Wednesday that temporarily blocks some foreigners outside the United States from obtaining U.S. permanent residency, a move he said would protect American workers amid the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. The executive order includes a number of exemptions and is not a full suspension of legal immigration, as suggested by a Trump tweet late on Monday night.\n\nThe order blocks some foreigners outside the United States from settling permanently in the United States by obtaining what is informally known as a \"green card.\" The measure applies to both requests for permanent residence based on employment in the United States and requests based on familial ties but contains a number of exceptions.\n\nThe order does not affect people coming to the United States on non-immigrant visas, including tourists and business travelers. It also does not affect workers such as farm laborers entering the United States on temporary visas or skilled workers on H-1B visas. Foreigners already in the United States and seeking to adjust their status will not be blocked by the latest measure.\n\nThe immediate impact of the order was not clear since most U.S. consulates around the world have already shuttered most immigration processing services. Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals will be exempt, as will other prospective immigrants coming to the country to perform \"essential\" work to combat the new coronavirus, as determined by federal agencies.\n\nThe measure also excludes immigrants applying for the EB-5 visa program, which allows foreigners willing to invest large sums of money in U.S. projects that create or preserve jobs to obtain permanent residence. The order makes an exception for spouses of U.S. citizens and their unmarried children under the age of 21. The measure contains several other exemptions, including a general exemption for \"any alien whose entry would be in the national interest.\"\n\nThe suspension will begin just before midnight on Thursday and last 60 days. After that, Trump will review U.S. economic conditions and decide whether it should be extended. Future extensions could potentially be longer than 60 days, Trump said this week. The executive order states that the administration will review all temporary visa programs - including guest worker programs - to determine if additional steps should be taken to protect U.S. workers.\n\nTrump's latest immigration order draws on the same legal authority his administration cited in its 2017 travel ban that suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations. While that policy cited security concerns, critics dubbed it a \"Muslim ban.\" Federal judges blocked several iterations of the ban from taking effect, but the Supreme Court eventually upheld a reworked version of the measure in 2018 and it continues to be in force and was expanded in January.\n\nSome legal experts argue the high court's ruling does not permit a broad, worldwide ban on immigration into the United States and expect Trump's latest order to be challenged in court. The United States suspended routine visa services in most countries worldwide in mid-March due to the coronavirus outbreak, which was expected to dramatically slow legal immigration. In addition, countries around the world have closed their borders and enacted quarantines to limit the spread of the virus, greatly reducing travel worldwide.\n\nAmid the global slowdown, the number of permanent residency visas issued by the State Department fell to around 24,000 in March, a 35% decrease from the previous month, according to department statistics published on Thursday. The number of temporary visas issued also decreased by roughly a third. Trump said on Tuesday that an immigration suspension would protect U.S. workers, an extension of the message he employed during his 2016 presidential campaign. However, researchers generally agree that immigration into the United States has actually stimulated economic growth, increased the size of the economy, and created jobs, according to Giovanni Peri, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis.\n\n\"The idea that immigration threatens American jobs is just not there in any data,\" he said.",
    " Title: U.S. Special Forces Mission to Rescue American Hostage Luke Somers Fails; Al Qaeda in Yemen Issues Threatening Video\n\nArticle:\n\nHours before the Obama administration revealed a failed U.S. special forces mission to rescue American hostage Luke Somers in Yemen last month, al Qaeda's branch in the nation circulated a harrowing video giving Washington three days to meet unspecified demands or face \"consequences\" for Mr. Somers.\n\nThe video, which mimicked hostage videos released by AQAP's rivals from the Islamic State group, showed local al Qaeda commander Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi delivering a statement in Arabic and English. Al-Ansi criticized U.S.-led airstrikes against the Islamic State group and President Obama for his \"latest foolish action,\" referring to the \"failed operation\" in Hadramawt. He warned the U.S. against future attempts to rescue hostages.\n\nIn the 3-minute video, Mr. Somers appeared somber and gave a brief statement in English, asking for help. The video was first reported by SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors militant sites. Mr. Somers, a 33-year-old photojournalist born in Britain, had been working in Yemen since 2011 as a freelancer for the Yemen Times when operatives from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) kidnapped him in September 2013.\n\nOfficials at the White House and Pentagon said Thursday that President Obama had personally authorized last month's mission to rescue Mr. Somers, the lone American among roughly a dozen hostages held by AQAP in Yemen. The mission was coordinated with the Yemeni government and was undertaken by U.S. and Yemeni forces. Regrettably, Mr. Somers was not present, though hostages of other nationalities were rescued.\n\nIn light of Thursday's developments, Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, warned the administration to proceed carefully and assertively in the Somers case. \"This administration has already broken this policy once with the release of the Taliban Five, and in doing so allowed dangerous terrorists to resume the fight,\" he said.\n\n\"AQAP's latest threat against an American hostage reflects the unrelenting and pervasive brutality of Islamist extremist groups who are at war with the West,\" the Texas Republican added. \"We must send a clear message to extremists: 'We will not negotiate with you. We will do everything in our power to stop you and bring you to justice.'\"",
    " Title: Sanders Aims to Gain Momentum with Wins in Kansas, Nebraska, and Maine\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is seeking to revitalize his struggling presidential campaign this weekend, with the objective of winning three of the four state Democratic contests. The aim is to create momentum heading into Tuesday's crucial Michigan primary.\n\nOn Saturday, preliminary results indicated that Sanders was on track to achieve his goals. The Kansas Democratic Party declared Sanders the winner in their caucuses, and multiple news reports suggested he was leading in Nebraska. With 79% of the vote in from Nebraska, Sanders was at 55% compared to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 45%.\n\nSanders' team is also targeting a win in Maine on Sunday. As anticipated, Clinton won Louisiana on Saturday, where approximately half of the electorate is black. Clinton has been performing strongly in polls with black voters, with over 80% of them voting for her.\n\nSanders, on the other hand, has performed well in states with predominantly white populations, who identify with his populist economic message. In the seven states he has won, they all rank among the 18 whitest in the country.\n\nSanders renewed his commitment to taking his campaign all the way to the convention on Saturday. \"We have now won double-digit victories from New England to the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains to the Midwest,\" he said in a statement. \"Democrats in Kansas today added to a column of double-digit victories in Minnesota, Colorado, Oklahoma, New Hampshire, and Vermont.\"\n\n\"We have the momentum,\" he said. \"We have a path toward victory. Our campaign is just getting started, and we are going all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.\"\n\nDemocrats had 109 delegates at stake on Saturday night, and Sanders needed to capture a majority of them to have a viable path to the White House. After Saturday's contests, Clinton led Sanders 1,104 to 446 in the delegate race. Either candidate needs 4,763 to win the party nomination.\n\nAfter the Super Tuesday contests, where Sanders lost seven of the 11 caucuses and primaries to Clinton\u2014six of which were held in the south\u2014his campaign made winning Nebraska, Kansas, and Maine a priority. Sanders' first campaign stop after the March 1 contests was in Maine, and over one-fifth of his advertising spending since Super Tuesday has been dedicated to Kansas and Nebraska. Both states have embraced his authenticity, the fact that he's not beholden to corporate interests, and his proposals for debt-free university.\n\nIn Nebraska, where Democrats but not Republicans held county caucuses, large crowds and long lines were reported outside caucus locations on Saturday in the greater Omaha and Lincoln areas.\n\nKaitlin Heavin of Omaha was one of many young Sanders supporters who dominated the Sarpy County Caucus at Platteview High School in rural Springfield. \"I don't hate Hillary, but I don't love her either,\" said Ms. Heavin, who wore a Sanders T-shirt. \"I love Bernie.\"\n\nHer friend Kim Anthony of Millard, who has two children with graduate degrees and hefty loans to show for it, cited Mr. Sanders' stance on reducing student debt. \"I know he can't do everything, but if he can just do some of what he's talking about, he can get us on the right path,\" Ms. Anthony said.\n\nIn Kansas, Sanders held a pre-caucus rally in the liberal stronghold of Lawrence with the aim of attracting voters. Although Clinton had establishment support in the state with the backing of former Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, Sanders' supporters were able to overcome it.\n\nWith weekend wins, Sanders is looking to head into March 8 with momentum, as delegate-rich Michigan is up for grabs. Sanders' advisers have said his path to the nomination involves winning in industrial Midwestern states and targeting states like New York and California where many delegates are up for grabs.\n\nBoth candidates have been campaigning heavily in Michigan, and spent the weekend there. On Sunday, Sanders and Clinton will debate in Flint, Michigan. Clinton requested to debate in the city to highlight the poisoned water crisis. Both Clinton and Sanders have said if the city wasn't predominantly black and poor, the crisis may never have happened.\n\nSanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver told reporters the team feels good about their chances in Michigan. \"I think his message on trade in particular will be very powerful out there,\" Mr. Weaver said after his team's March 1 losses on the path ahead. \"He has been a consistent opponent of the kind of job-gutting trade deals that Secretary Clinton has consistently supported for decades. And I think there will be some serious questions that will have to be answered by the Clinton campaign about why people should vote for a candidate who has voted for the type of trade deals that have gutted the economy in Michigan, Ohio, and other places.\"",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Affirms Retirement from Politics, but Speculation Persists\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with Marie Claire magazine, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has stated that she has no plans to return to politics, including a potential 2016 presidential bid. Despite her assertions, speculation remains as to whether Clinton will indeed step away from politics or if her supporters hope for a change of heart.\n\nClinton, who has been out of politics for 20 years, expressed a desire to reclaim personal time and independence. \"I have been on this high wire of national and international politics and leadership for 20 years,\" Clinton said. \"It has been an absolutely extraordinary personal honor and experience. But I really want to just have my own time back. I want to just be my own person. I'm looking forward to that.\"\n\nClinton also expressed hope for a female president, stating, \"That would be a great experience for me, to be up there cheering.\" A search for \"Hillary Clinton for President\" and \"2016\" on Google yields over 4 million hits, including several \"Hillary for 2016\" Facebook pages, indicating that her supporters may be holding out hope for a political comeback.\n\nDespite her popularity, Clinton has faced criticism, particularly regarding the 2012 attack on the US diplomatic post in Benghazi, which resulted in the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. In a CNN interview this week, Clinton attempted to quell the political firestorm surrounding the attack.\n\n\"I take responsibility,\" Clinton said. \"I'm in charge of the State Department, 60,000-plus people all over the world, 275 posts. The president and the vice president certainly would not be knowledgeable about specific decisions that are made by security professionals. They're the ones who weigh all of the threats and the risks and the needs and make a considered decision.\"\n\nRepublican attacks have primarily been directed at President Obama, but Clinton was asked whether there was an attempt to undermine her potential 2016 chances. \"That is just so far from anything that anybody should be thinking about,\" Clinton responded.\n\nClinton has been supported by a loyal staff known as \"Hillaryland,\" many of whom have worked with her for years. Last summer, former director of policy planning Anne-Marie Slaughter caused a stir within the State Department when she wrote a controversial article in The Atlantic about the challenges of balancing high-level government work with family responsibilities. Slaughter, who is now a professor at Princeton University, was criticized by Clinton in the Marie Claire interview.\n\n\"Some women are not comfortable working at the pace and intensity you have to work at in these jobs\u2026 Other women do not break a sweat. They have four or five, six kids. They're highly organized, they have very supportive networks,\" Clinton said, emphasizing her own approach as a hands-on mother who prioritized her child while remaining committed to her work.\n\nClinton expressed little patience for those who fail to take advantage of their opportunities, stating, \"I can't stand whining. I can't stand the kind of paralysis that some people fall into because they're not happy with the choices they've made. You live in a time when there are endless choices\u2026 But you have to work on yourself\u2026 Do something!\"",
    " Title: An Analysis of the Relationship Between America and Russia: A Historical and Contemporary Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nThe relationship between America and Russia has been a complex and evolving one, marked by a series of events that have shaped the political landscape of both nations. The following is a neutral analysis of the relationship, based on the provided text, focusing on historical events and contemporary issues.\n\nRecent events suggest a contentious relationship, with allegations of Russian involvement in the assassination of an ex-spy using a chemical weapon on British soil, interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, annexation of Crimea, and the downing of a passenger airliner in Ukraine. However, it is also noted that Russia has been a significant player in the Middle East, intervening in Syria, and providing safe haven for Edward Snowden.\n\nHistorically, the relationship between the two nations has been marked by significant shifts. The end of the Cold War saw Russia withdrawing from 700,000 square miles of Europe and Eurasia, and the implementation of economic reforms under Boris Yeltsin's government, which was met with resistance from the Russian population. American intervention, in the form of financial aid and political consultancy, was a contentious issue during this period.\n\nThe relationship between the two nations has been used as a symbol of Western self-doubt, reflecting various concerns and fears within Western societies. These range from doubts about the leadership class's commitment to the interests of their own people, to concerns about the impact of the post-Cold War program of freer movement of goods, capital, and people on their economies and political stability.\n\nThe text suggests that the relationship between America and Russia is often viewed through a lens of projection, with Russia being blamed for political developments in other countries, such as the rise of populist nationalist parties in Hungary and Poland. However, it is also noted that Russia is a nation with its own history, impelling national interests, and problems, and not merely a ghost written into the Western storyline.\n\nIn conclusion, the relationship between America and Russia is a complex one, shaped by historical events and contemporary issues. The text suggests that the relationship is often used as a symbol of Western self-doubt, reflecting various concerns and fears within Western societies. It is also noted that the relationship is often viewed through a lens of projection, with Russia being blamed for political developments in other countries. However, it is crucial to recognize that Russia is a nation with its own enduring interests, and its relationship with America should be understood in this context.",
    " Title: The Limits of Presidential Influence on Economic Growth: A Neutral Analysis of Donald Trump's Job Creation Claims\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, a significant portion of Donald Trump's appeal lies in the perceived unsatisfactory performance of the U.S. economy and his promise to improve it. Supporters argue that Trump's business acumen would enable him to restore manufacturing jobs, get tough with China and Mexico, and make America great again.\n\nHowever, these ideas are largely unfounded, according to economists. In an economic speech in Detroit last month, Trump claimed he would \"jump-start America,\" but economist John Cochrane of the free market Hoover Institution at Stanford University states that even the wildest campaign promises make little difference to the economy as a whole.\n\nThe economy is subject to numerous unpredictable factors, such as growth in China, oil production in Saudi Arabia, Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, and unforeseen events like terrorism, natural disasters, war, and financial crises. Demographic changes at home also play a role.\n\nPresidents have limited control over the economy, with the Federal Reserve having more direct influence. The Fed, for years, has been using low interest rates and expansionary monetary policy to stimulate growth. However, growth has lagged, and the Fed has struggled to achieve its optimal annual growth rate of 2 percent.\n\nPresidents face numerous constraints, including the need for legislation to implement major policy changes, which requires compromise with Congress. They do not control either spending or revenues, which are subject to the approval of lawmakers. Flows of cash are also susceptible to the ups and downs of the economy, which can raise or lower incoming amounts and outgoing obligations with no action by the people in power.\n\nTrump's promise to create a net total of 25 million jobs over the next decade qualifies as utterly preposterous. The longest peacetime expansion in American history, which occurred under President Bill Clinton, fell short of that feat. The next president will face headwinds, such as sluggish growth abroad, an aging population, and an immigration slowdown, that Clinton did not.\n\nThe most important economics book of 2016, according to Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon, is The Rise and Fall of American Growth. The book makes an exhaustive case that the huge improvements in living standards during the 20th century were a unique phenomenon that cannot be repeated. Gordon contends, \"America is riding on a slow-moving turtle. There is little that politicians can do about it.\"\n\nWhile this view may be too pessimistic, it underscores the limited influence a president has on economic growth. Regardless of whether Trump is atop a turtle or a thoroughbred, he cannot make it gallop.",
    " Title: Mitch McConnell Secures Victory Over Tea Party Challenger, GOP Incumbents Fare Well in Primary Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2014 primary elections, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell secured a decisive victory over his tea party challenger Matt Bevin, overshadowing the night. The results indicate a resurgence of the once-iron law of politics: it is difficult to unseat a sitting member of Congress who is determined to hold onto their seat.\n\nIn three states on Tuesday, long-serving lawmakers defeated tea party opponents. Eight-term Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson fended off a challenger supported by the Club for Growth, while Rep. Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania easily dispatched an opponent once considered a tea party warrior.\n\nMcConnell's triumph over Bevin was the most significant event of the night. Bevin, a Louisville investor, was supported by outside groups such as the Senate Conservatives Fund and FreedomWorks. However, Bevin's campaign was unable to match McConnell's efforts, and his public image was severely damaged as McConnell's campaign scrutinized his record on issues such as bank bailouts and cockfighting.\n\nThe cost of winning renomination as a sitting Republican senator has more than doubled since 2002, according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission filings. Chris Chocola, the former Indiana congressman who now heads Club for Growth, stated, \"We were able to sneak up on people in the past. There's no sneaking up on people anymore.\"\n\nSince the start of the tea party wave in 2010, only a handful of Republican incumbents have lost primaries. However, conservative insurgents have scored major successes in open-seat races, such as Marco Rubio's primary win in 2010 and Ted Cruz's in 2012. The record of conservative insurgents against incumbents features fewer big victories, and in almost every case, the loser was a lawmaker who either underestimated the challenge or lacked the will to fight.\n\nRepublican campaign committees have taken notice and have been preparing their members for tough primaries. The National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee have held briefings and one-on-one meetings with sitting senators to emphasize the importance of working actively to secure the party nomination.\n\nIn Kentucky, McConnell thoroughly discredited Bevin as a conservative messenger. McConnell's campaign ran advertisements attacking Bevin for praising the Troubled Asset Relief Program bailouts while he was a financial executive, and McConnell's campaign manager, Jesse Benton, humiliated Bevin at a conservative rally with a pop quiz about the Constitution that Bevin failed.\n\nElsewhere, in primary fights that are still ongoing, incumbents have blunted or broken the momentum of hard-right challengers. In Kansas, Sen. Pat Roberts has watched a primary challenge from physician Milton Wolf falter and fade after revelations that Wolf posted images of X-rayed gunshot victims on his Facebook page. Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran still faces a potentially competitive primary from state Sen. Chris McDaniel, but early fears that Cochran might collapse have subsided as McDaniel's record of incendiary statements and inconsistent support for Mississippi's federal priorities has been aired before the voters.",
    " Title: Young Adult Enrollment in ObamaCare Lags Behind Expected Goals, Concerns Raised by Insurers\n\nArticle:\n\nInsurers have expressed concerns over the low number of young adults signing up for health insurance through the ObamaCare exchanges, as newly released statistics showed that less than a quarter of people who have enrolled are between the ages of 18 and 34. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, only 24 percent \u2013 or 489,460 \u2013 of the 2.2 million people who signed up for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were in the coveted 18-to-34 age range. This means the government has hit only 18 percent of its stated goal of registering 2.7 million adults in the 18-to-34 age range.\n\nExperts have predicted that the program will need roughly 40 percent of enrollees to be in that prime demographic to be fiscally solvent. Adults ages 55 to 64 made up 33 percent of the total number of Americans who signed up, the largest group represented in the data.\n\nObamaCare needs so-called 'invincibles' \u2013 healthy young adults \u2013 to sign up in coming months to help offset the costs of older and less healthy enrollees. If that doesn't happen, insurers could be forced to raise the rates, making the costs and future of ObamaCare uncertain.\n\nMarty Anderson, marketing director for Wisconsin-based Security Health Plan, told the Wall Street Journal, \"This is concerning that we're seeing this portion come in so old.\" Allan Einboden, chief executive of Scott & White Health Plan, told the Journal that the data was \"more negative than we thought it was going to be,\" and added that several requests to pre-authorize surgeries for enrollees in the first days of their coverage had executives worried about costs.\n\nRobert Laszewski, a consultant who works with insurers, told The New York Times, \"You need healthy people of all ages... the program is not ramping up fast enough to guarantee a good balance of healthy and sick people, which you need to sustain the program.\"\n\nAdministration officials, however, were upbeat in describing the numbers Monday. They said they're in a \"solid place,\" and noted that this age group makes up just 26 percent of the general population. Monday's report was the first time the government has released demographic data on the performance of President Obama's signature health care overhaul. In all, about 1.8 million people enrolled in new individual health plans through the law in December, bringing the total number of new enrollments between Oct. 1 and Dec. 28 to about 2.2 million.\n\n\"There's no way to spin it: youth enrollment has been a bust so far,\" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, in a statement following the release. \"When they see that ObamaCare offers high costs for limited access to doctors \u2013 if the enrollment goes through at all \u2013 it's no surprise that young people are not rushing to sign up.\"\n\nAs analysts have told \u2588\u2588\u2588, insurance companies have said they may want to take advantage of the \"risk pool\" provisions \u2013 which involve the federal government covering 80 percent of any losses associated with an older and unhealthier base of customers.\n\nAccording to HHS, 79 percent of ObamaCare customers selected a plan with financial assistance. While only 2.2 million people have actually signed up, 44.5 million called or visited state and federal websites.\n\nOf the 2.2 million who have signed up, 54 percent are female and 46 percent are male, HHS said. Individuals and families are able to choose from four plans offered through the federal marketplace \u2013 bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. Sixty percent selected a silver plan, while 20 percent selected a bronze plan, according to HHS.",
    " Title: Johnson & Johnson Settles Ohio Opioid Lawsuit for $20 Million Ahead of Federal Trials\n\nArticle:\n\nPharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has reached a settlement of $20 million with two Ohio counties, Cuyahoga and Summit, to avoid a federal trial over the opioid epidemic's corporate responsibility. The settlement, which includes Cleveland and Akron, is a significant step in the ongoing litigation over the opioid crisis, which has claimed over 400,000 lives in the past two decades.\n\nThe Ohio settlement, set to commence on October 21, is the first in a series of federal trials aimed at determining the extent of opioid painkiller manufacturers', distributors', and pharmacy chains' liability for the worst drug epidemic in American history. A second trial is scheduled for West Virginia in January. The outcomes of these and other test cases will shape a broad settlement covering numerous federal lawsuits across the United States.\n\nUntil now, Johnson & Johnson has maintained its innocence in the opioid crisis, refusing to settle similar lawsuits and denying any responsibility. However, in August, the company lost a landmark case in Oklahoma, where a judge found Johnson & Johnson instrumental in causing addiction and death due to a \"false and dangerous\" sales campaign that contributed to the crisis. The state of Oklahoma sued the company, alleging it ran a \"cunning, cynical, and deceitful scheme\" to mass-market opioid painkillers with false claims of minimal addiction risk. The judge ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $572 million in the first year of a longer-term settlement.\n\nJohnson & Johnson made no admission of liability in the Ohio settlement and stated that the agreement was reached to direct resources toward addressing the opioid crisis. However, law professor Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond suggested that the Oklahoma loss may have influenced the company's decision, as it may have reconsidered litigating every case due to potential liability exposure.\n\nIt remains uncertain whether Johnson & Johnson will settle with hundreds of other litigants, potentially totaling hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. However, most drug-makers have reportedly folded as the trial approaches, apparently wary of larger payouts. Johnson & Johnson's retreat came days after one of the largest opioid manufacturers, Mallinckrodt, reached a $30 million deal with the two Ohio counties. Two other companies, Endo and Allergan, agreed to settlements earlier. This leaves only one manufacturer, Teva, still fighting the case alongside pharmacy chain Walgreens and drug distributors, which are some of the largest corporations in the US, despite their names not being widely known.\n\nThe remaining trial may provide an unwelcome focus on the role of distributors such as Cardinal Health and McKesson, which shipped millions of opioid pills into small communities. Law professor Tobias suggested that this will add to the pressure on them to settle before the trial. \"They should be feeling the pressure because they're the deepest pockets left. They may settle to avoid a substantial settlement. They may want to avoid a huge verdict at the beginning,\" he said.\n\nSeparately, Purdue Pharma, the drug-maker that initiated the epidemic with its powerful opioid OxyContin, has reached a tentative deal potentially worth several billion dollars with some states, using bankruptcy to remake the company as a trust and surrender future profits toward addiction treatment and prevention.",
    " Title: Boehner's Re-election as House Speaker Seems Imminent Despite Fiscal-Cliff Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the fiscal-cliff debate, House Speaker John Boehner appears to be on track for re-election as the top Republican in the House of Representatives on Thursday. Two GOP congressmen, Rep. Mike Grimm of New York and Chris Smith of New Jersey, who earlier criticized Boehner, have now endorsed him for a second term.\n\nWith these endorsements and a lack of viable alternatives, many observers believe Boehner is on track for another year as Speaker. A potential challenge centered around an aid package for victims of Superstorm Sandy, but even that issue seems to have passed.\n\n\"Whatever's done is done, and that's it,\" declared Rep. Pete King of New York on Wednesday afternoon after a meeting with Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor in which GOP leaders pledged to allow a vote on $9 billion in aid for victims of the record-breaking storm. A second vote on the remaining $51 billion will come on Jan. 15.\n\n\"The bottom line is we need the $60 billion,\" King said. \"We have gotten that solid commitment.\"\n\nEarlier Wednesday, King and several other members of the New York-New Jersey congressional delegation had criticized Boehner for not allowing a vote on the aid to come to the House floor. However, King later stated that his anger at Boehner was in the past.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned, that was a lifetime ago,\" he said after the meeting with Boehner and Cantor, according to the Hill. \"The bottom line is we are getting the result that we need.\"\n\nRon Meyer, a spokesman for the conservative group American Majority Action, which was among several calling for Boehner's ouster, acknowledged that House Republicans do not have a viable alternative to Boehner.\n\n\"It turns out no one else seems willing to pick up the mantle,\" he said on Wednesday. \"I hesitate to say it, but this goes to some degree to cowardice.\"\n\n\"You can't beat somebody with nobody,\" added a senior House Republican to the National Journal on Wednesday.\n\nBoehner's speakership seems all but certain to survive several challenges in recent months. Two weeks ago, dozens of GOP legislators refused to support Boehner's \"Plan B\" fiscal-cliff proposal that would have staved off rising tax rates for most Americans. The party split capped an extensive day of lobbying and arm-twisting of the GOP rank and file, which included a late-night meeting Boehner called to determine whether he had enough votes for approval.\n\nThat not being the case, Majority Leader Cantor announced that no vote would be held\u2014and Boehner himself was spotted leaving the Capitol shortly thereafter.\n\nMuch of the criticism centered around conservative GOP legislators and outside groups seeing Boehner as too willing to compromise with the White House and Democrats on taxes and other fiscal issues. And last month, Boehner stripped four Republicans\u2014including three heavily supported by the Tea Party Patriots\u2014from their coveted committee seats. The move created tension within the GOP ranks.\n\nHowever, other conservative groups were joining with American Majority Action to attack Boehner for his support of the fiscal-cliff bill that was negotiated by Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, according to the National Journal. Boehner was among just 85 House Republicans ultimately supporting the measure. But Cantor and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy of California voted against it. They were among 151 House GOP members to do so.",
    " Title: White House Maintains Neutral Stance on FBI's Clinton Email Investigation Developments\n\nArticle:\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest has stated that he would neither defend nor criticize Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey's decision to announce new developments in the Hillary Clinton email investigation, a stance that contrasts with the criticism from the Clinton campaign and other Democrats.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Comey revealed that the FBI was looking into new evidence related to an investigation of the Democratic presidential nominee's email. This news has once again put Mrs. Clinton's email troubles, which were thought to be largely behind her, back in the spotlight.\n\nIn remarks in Ohio on Monday, Mrs. Clinton said there was \"no case here\" and questioned the agency's motives in announcing the developments just 11 days before the presidential election. A day earlier, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid accused Mr. Comey of violating a law barring federal officials from using their position to influence an election. In a letter to Mr. Comey, Mr. Reid wrote: \"I led the fight to get you confirmed [by the Senate] because I believed you to be a principled public servant. With the deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong.\"\n\nHowever, Mr. Earnest said President Barack Obama thought Mr. Comey a man of integrity. \"The president believes that Director Comey is a man of integrity, he's a man of principle and he's a man of good character,\" Mr. Earnest said.\n\nMr. Comey announced in a letter to congressional committee chairmen on Friday that the FBI would look into new emails related to the investigation of Mrs. Clinton. The newly-found emails surfaced as a result of a probe into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Mrs. Clinton's long-time aide, Huma Abedin.\n\nIn a separate development, it has been reported that interim Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile shared a primary debate question with the Clinton campaign, according to hacked emails released by WikiLeaks. The authenticity of the emails has not been independently verified.",
    " Title: CNN's Don Lemon Sparks Controversy with Claim that Jesus Christ Was Not Perfect\n\nArticle:\n\nCNN anchor Don Lemon, who identifies as Baptist and was educated in a Catholic school, has sparked controversy with his recent comments suggesting that Jesus Christ was not perfect during His time on earth. In a conversation with fellow CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, Lemon stated, \"Jesus Christ \u2014 if that\u2019s who you believe in, Jesus Christ \u2014 admittedly was not perfect when He was here on this earth.\"\n\nThe statement, made on the Monday morning edition of Newswatch on the \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Channel, has been met with criticism from several Christian leaders. Dr. Derwin L. Gray, a pastor based in North Carolina, responded to Lemon's comments on Twitter, stating, \"Good sir, Jesus was perfect. He had no sin. He is the unblemished Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.\"\n\nThe belief in Jesus' perfection is central to the substitutionary atonement, a doctrinal belief that Jesus died for humanity, granting salvation to those who put their faith in the Son of God. The Bible states that Jesus lived a sinless life while on earth, with passages such as 1 Peter 2:22, 2 Corinthians 5:21, 1 Peter 1:19, and Hebrews 7:26 attesting to His sinlessness.\n\nThomas Aquinas, an Italian priest, defined sin as \"an utterance, a deed, or a desire contrary to the eternal law.\" Given that God's character is the basis for this eternal law, going against it would be a direct contradiction to His nature, making sin an impossibility for Jesus. Catholic teaching, like evangelical Christian theology, affirms that Jesus was \"like us in all things, except sin.\"\n\nLemon's comments have been met with criticism for their inaccuracy, with some suggesting that, given his background, he should have been more aware of the Christian doctrine he was discussing. It remains unclear if Lemon's comments were intended to be taken literally or were made in a more figurative sense.",
    " Title: Media Bias and the Clinton Email Scandal: A Neutral Analysis of Washington Post Columnists' Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent column for The Washington Post, Dana Milbank and Ruth Marcus, both Yale-educated journalists, have expressed their views on the ongoing controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. Both columnists have criticized Clinton for her decision, with Milbank's column titled \"Hunkered Hillary made things worse\" and Marcus's column stating, \"The greatest irony may be that the Clintonian urge for privacy produces the opposite of what she needs.\"\n\nBoth columnists argue that Clinton's use of a private email server was a self-inflicted wound on her campaign, rather than evidence of wrongdoing. Milbank's column primarily rebuts Donald Trump's nickname for Clinton, \"Crooked Hillary,\" stating that investigations into her activities have not yielded substantial evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nThe columnists' criticism of Clinton's email scandal is met with a critique of their perceived bias towards Clinton. They are accused of downplaying the significance of the email scandal and the potential conflicts of interest associated with the Clinton Foundation. The column argues that the media, particularly liberal media, have not held Clinton accountable for her actions, instead focusing on investigating and \"getting the goods\" on Republican politicians.\n\nThe article also highlights the discrepancy in media coverage of the Clinton Foundation, comparing the minimal coverage of the foundation's potential conflicts of interest to the extensive coverage of the \"Bridgegate\" scandal involving Chris Christie. The article suggests that the media have allowed the Clinton Foundation to operate with minimal scrutiny, even after reporters exposed potential rule-breaking.\n\nIn conclusion, the article presents a neutral analysis of the perspectives of Dana Milbank and Ruth Marcus on the Clinton email scandal and the Clinton Foundation, highlighting the perceived bias of the columnists and the discrepancy in media coverage of the two scandals. The article does not take a political stance, but instead presents the facts and allows readers to draw their own conclusions.",
    " Title: CNN and MSNBC Devote Significant Airtime to Debunked Hydroxychloroquine Study\n\nArticle:\n\nOn May 22, CNN and MSNBC dedicated substantial airtime to a now-retracted study that claimed taking hydroxychloroquine while battling COVID-19 could be fatal. CNN devoted 90 minutes and 54 seconds, while MSNBC's total was 19 minutes and 19 seconds.\n\nThe Media Research Center (MRC) analyzed every hour of live programming from CNN and MSNBC on May 22, and, in the case of CNN shows and MSNBC primetime, backed up by Nexis transcripts. Since the study went live just before 9:00 a.m. Eastern, each of the 10 subsequent CNN shows covered the study. On MSNBC, nine shows featured it.\n\nAs of this study's publication, MSNBC has ignored the retraction, while CNN has only given it one minute and 45 seconds during The Lead with Jake Tapper.\n\nThe study, published in The Lancet, was retracted on Thursday due to a myriad of problems, ranging from skepticism of its accuracy to bizarre ethical issues about one of the companies involved. The study was not fully peer-reviewed, a hallmark for ensuring that studies hold weight and actually found what they stated.\n\nThe Hill reported that the study's authors retracted it because independent peer reviewers could not access the data used for the analysis. The source of the data was Surgisphere Corporation, which told peer reviewers it would not transfer the full dataset used for the study because it would violate client agreements and confidentiality requirements.\n\nThe Lancet wrote in a statement that it \"takes issues of scientific integrity extremely seriously\" and that there are \"many outstanding questions about Surgisphere and the data that were allegedly included in this study.\"\n\nOver the following days, more information emerged about Surgisphere, including an investigation from The Guardian that Surgisphere had some questionable hires for a healthcare company, including a \"science fiction writer and an adult-content model.\"\n\nDespite the study's flaws and subsequent retraction, CNN and, to a lesser extent, MSNBC continued to discuss the study without questioning its accuracy. For example, during the May 22 airing of CNN Newsroom, co-hosts Poppy Harlow and Jim Sciutto were enthralled, trumpeting the \"expansive study\" as \"big news\" and a \"major development\" that spelled \"real danger\" for patients taking hydroxychloroquine.\n\nOn MSNBC, Rachel Maddow fretted that the study signaled Trump's promotion of hydroxychloroquine had \"moved on from absurd and sort of insane to a potentially deadly threat.\" Similarly, during the May 22 airing of Morning Joe, hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski shared the breaking news and expressed concern about the study's findings.\n\nHowever, as more information has come to light, it has become clear that the study was flawed and inaccurate, and its retraction should have prompted a reevaluation of the initial coverage. It is essential for news organizations to fact-check and verify the information they present to the public, especially in times of crisis.",
    " Title: Tea Party Patriots Launch SuperPAC for 2014 Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund SuperPAC was launched on Monday, with the aim of focusing on key Senate races during the 2014 midterm elections. The organization, led by Jenny Beth Martin, president and co-founder of the parent group, aims to empower grassroots activists to have a significant impact in targeted districts and states.\n\nAccording to Martin, the organization is currently collaborating with activists in South Carolina and Kentucky, where they are seeking alternatives to Senators Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell, respectively. The organization plans to expand its mission into Mississippi, Nebraska, Louisiana, Arkansas, and North Carolina races.\n\nMartin described the Citizens Fund as \"community organizing for conservatives,\" differentiating it from other Super PACs due to its grassroots activist network across the country. The organization has also initiated an early-bird presidential straw poll, reflecting the interests of its membership. The candidates in contention are Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Marco Rubio of Florida, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, and Sarah Palin.\n\nIn Kentucky, there are interesting dynamics afoot. According to pollster Scott Rasmussen, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell runs even with Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes in the 2014 U.S. Senate race. However, McConnell's GOP primary rival Matt Bevin leads Grimes by six points, with 48% support compared to Grimes' 42%.\n\nMatt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks for America, a liberty-minded, low-tax group, stated, \"The results of this poll are clear. Matt Bevin has a stronger chance at defeating the Democrat in the general election. Anybody interested in protecting this Republican Senate seat needs to revisit the premise that a do-nothing incumbent is a safe bet. To beat Grimes in November, we have to ditch Mitch.\"",
    " Title: Bill on Amnesty for Illegal Immigrants Does Not Include Requirement for Back Taxes\n\nArticle:\n\nJon Feere, legal policy analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies, has stated that claims from amnesty advocates suggesting the bill contains a requirement for illegal immigrants to pay back taxes for their years working off the books are inaccurate. The bill only requires illegal immigrants to resolve any existing issues with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) if they have been audited and requested payment of unpaid taxes.\n\nAccording to Feere, approximately 45 percent of illegal immigrants, who are estimated to be working off the books, are not on the IRS's radar and are highly unlikely to have ever been audited due to the lack of tax forms to audit. The number of illegal immigrants who have been audited by the IRS is also likely small, as the IRS historically audits only about 1 percent of tax filers.\n\nThe current tax provision in the bill will not affect the overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants applying for amnesty. At least one amendment has been offered to require payment of back taxes for the period that amnesty applicants have worked illegally in the United States.\n\nAdditionally, the bill does not require employers of illegal immigrants to pay FICA taxes for the years they paid illegal immigrants under the table.\n\nThe lack of a back-taxes provision in the bill is not surprising, as Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) snuck a provision into a tax law following the 1986 amnesty becoming law, barring amnesty adjudicators from sharing the tax information of amnesty applicants with the IRS. Schumer reasoned that a successful legalization program could not be achieved if an alien became vulnerable to an enforcement action by the IRS upon submitting an application. Similarly, the Bush administration requested Congress strip a back-taxes provision from the failed 2007 amnesty bill.",

The controversy revolves around a clip that appears to show nine seconds of silence after Couric asked the activists, \"If there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun?\"\n\nAudio released to the Washington Free Beacon reveals that the activists immediately answered a similar question posed by Couric. Director Stephanie Soechtig told The Washington Post that the pause was intended to allow viewers to consider the question. Couric has expressed support for the film and is \"very proud of the film.\"\n\nHowever, some critics, including the Independent Women's Forum, have expressed outrage over the film's portrayal of the activists. Culture of Alarmism Director Julie Gunlock issued a statement on Wednesday, calling for Couric to be fired. Gunlock stated, \"Katie Couric should be ashamed of herself for her dishonest and distorted reporting on this issue... Like serial fabricator Brian Williams, Couric should be fired. Her tactics have been exposed, and Americans should never again trust her to report on these important issues.\"\n\nSocial media users, including Mark Hemingway, Jen M, and Ursula Hennessey, have also criticized Couric for the alleged deceptive editing. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has also weighed in, calling the edits \"outrageous\" and \"unbelievable,\" and urging Couric to explain the editing.\n\n\"Under the Gun\" premiered on May 15 on Epix and first screened at the Sundance Film Festival in January.",

The Liberal party, led by Trudeau, took the most seats, providing them with the best opportunity to form a government. However, falling short of a majority means the Liberals will have to rely on an opposition party to pass legislation.\n\nRobert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto, commented, \"Trudeau is prime minister because the rest of the party was able to pull itself together and prevail. While Trudeau certainly deserves credit for what has happened, he\u2019s really going to have to demonstrate qualities that he hasn\u2019t yet shown.\"\n\nThe results were a surprise given the series of scandals that tarnished Trudeau's image, particularly the resurfacing of old photos showing him in blackface and brownface. Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, noted, \"I\u2019m surprised at how well Trudeau has done. I don\u2019t think anybody expected Trudeau to get a majority, but they are not that far off.\"\n\nWith results still trickling in early Tuesday, the Liberals had 156 seats, 14 short of the 170 needed for a majority in the 338-seat House of Commons. In his early Tuesday address, Trudeau stated, \"Tonight Canadians rejected division and negativity. They rejected cuts and austerity. They elected a progressive agenda and strong action on climate change.\"\n\nThe Canadian vote was essentially a choice between Trudeau and Andrew Scheer, the unassuming leader of the Conservative Party, who was seen as the antidote to Trudeau's flashy and celebrity-laden image. Barack Obama, the former American president, made an unprecedented endorsement by a former U.S. president, urging Canadians to re-elect Trudeau and stating the world needs his progressive leadership.\n\nAndrew Scheer, 40, is a career politician who was seen as a potential antidote to Trudeau's flashiness. However, Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto, stated late Monday that he expected Scheer to resign, saying, \"He\u2019s gone. He ran a really dirty campaign. There is nothing to be proud of on his side. He had the opportunity and blew it.\"\n\nIn his concession speech, Scheer said the results showed Trudeau was much weakened since his 2015 election, when pundits had predicted the beginning of another Trudeau dynasty. Scheer stated, \"Tonight Conservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice. And Mr. Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready, and we will win.\"\n\nTrudeau was also hurt by a scandal that erupted this year when his former attorney general said he pressured her to halt the prosecution of a Quebec company. Trudeau has said he was standing up for jobs, but the damage gave a boost to the Conservative Party.\n\nThe Liberal party will likely rely on the New Democrats to form a new government and pass legislation. Opposition New Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh stated early Tuesday that he had congratulated Trudeau and vowed to play a constructive role in Parliament.\n\nThe results left the Conservatives deeply disappointed. Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, commented, \"The Conservatives are deeply disappointed. Scheer had promised to end a national carbon tax and cut government spending, including foreign aid, by 25 percent.\"\n\nTrudeau's efforts to strike a balance on the environment and the economy have been criticized by both the right and left. He brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change but rescued a stalled pipeline expansion project to get Alberta's oil to international markets. His legalization of cannabis nationwide and his efforts to strike a new free trade deal for Canada with the U.S. and Mexico have also been points of contention.\n\nTrump, who has clashed with Trudeau over trade, tweeted his congratulations early Tuesday, saying, \"Canada is well served.\"",
    " Title: Christmas Reflection: Jesus' Birth and the Refugee Experience\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Christmas approaches, the over two billion Christians worldwide reflect on the significance of the holiday, focusing on the story of Jesus' birth. While the celebration is observed with varying levels of intensity, those who prioritize the religious aspect of Christmas emphasize the central role of Jesus in the festivities.\n\nJay Parini, a poet, novelist, and professor at Middlebury College in Vermont, highlights this focus in his book \"Jesus: The Human Face of God.\" Parini's opinions, as expressed in this commentary, are solely his own.\n\nThe story of Jesus' birth, as recounted in the Bible, is a poignant narrative that combines elements of joy and terror. A young family from Galilee arrives in a small town as strangers, with the pregnant mother unable to find a place to stay. Upon the child's birth, magi, or wise men, travel from the East to worship him, unintentionally alerting a malevolent king to the newborn's existence. The king, fearing the child as a potential rival, orders a massacre of infants in an attempt to eliminate him. An angel then appears to Joseph, instructing him to flee with his family to Egypt, making Jesus a refugee in search of a safe haven.\n\nParini emphasizes the importance of Jesus' message during this season, urging love as a means to combat hate, whether from King Herod or contemporary figures like al-Baghdadi. The story of Jesus' birth serves as a reminder of the plight of refugees, a situation that continues to affect millions worldwide.",
    " Title: President Obama Discusses Daughters' Upbringing and Perception of Wealth\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview for the Amazon Kindle store, President Barack Obama discussed the unique living situation of his daughters, Sasha and Malia, and the steps he takes to ensure they understand the abnormal nature of their White House lifestyle.\n\n\"We are constantly reminding Malia and Sasha of the slightly unreal environment that they're in, and that that's not the norm and they should not expect to be the norm,\" Obama said.\n\nThe President explained that having relatives who do not live like the commander-in-chief, and even struggle to get by, has kept his children grounded. \"One of the advantages we have is that we still have family members who are not only middle class, but we've got some family members who are poor,\" he told Amazon editor David Blum.\n\nObama further elaborated that Malia and Sasha have cousins who understand the struggle of making ends meet, and that they recognize the worth of these family members despite their circumstances. \"They know that those kids are just as worthy as they are, they just haven't had as much luck,\" he said.\n\nThe President, who spoke at an Amazon.com distribution plant in Tennessee on Tuesday, also addressed the distorted sense of wealth that children, even those not living in the White House, may have. \"If you look back on your childhood, or if I talk to my friends, all of us have that same impression when we go back home and we realize that the place where we were living was pretty small,\" he said.\n\nObama noted that a cultural shift has occurred, with a constant barrage of made-for-television wealth changing what kids consider a normal life. Traditional benchmarks of success, such as a home, job, education, health care, and retirement, are no longer deemed sufficient, he said.\n\n\"There was not that window into the lifestyles of the rich and famous,\" he said. \"Kids were not monitoring every day what Kim Kardashian was wearing, or where Kanye West was going on vacation, and thinking that somehow that was the mark of success.\"",
    " Title: North Korea Conducts Submarine Ballistic Missile Test, Claims Weapon Capable of Striking \"Hostile Forces\"\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea has reportedly conducted an underwater test-firing of a submarine ballistic missile (SLBM), according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Saturday. The test, which took place near Sinpo South Shipyard on the east coast, is said to have proven the missile's ability to meet the latest military science and technology requirements.\n\nThe North's state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper published photos of a projectile rising from the surface and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un smiling from a distance at what looked like a floating submarine. Kim described the missile as a \"world-level strategic weapon\" and an \"eye-opening success.\"\n\nKim declared that his military now has a weapon capable of \"striking and wiping out in any waters the hostile forces infringing upon the sovereignty and dignity of (North Korea),\" according to KCNA. The news agency report said the missiles \"soared into the sky from underwater.\"\n\nExperts in Seoul suggest that the North's military demonstrations and hostile rhetoric are attempts at wresting concessions from the United States and South Korea, whose officials have recently discussed the possibility of holding preliminary talks to test North Korea's commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nIn recent years, North Korea has expressed a desire to resume talks aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. The last public U.S. attempt to restart the six-party process, involving China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, North Korea, and the U.S., collapsed in 2012 after the North launched a long-range rocket. Pyongyang conducted its third nuclear test in February 2013, and has test-fired numerous shorter-range missiles since then.\n\nIn January, the U.S. again proposed a meeting with North Korea, but the bid failed to gain traction. This week, South Korean envoy Hwang Joon Kook said, after meeting with his U.S. and Chinese counterparts, that all five parties are ready once again to test North Korea's intentions on talks.\n\nNorth Korea also threatened to fire at South Korean naval vessels it claims have been violating its territorial waters off the western coast of the Korean Peninsula. South Korea's presidential Blue House held an emergency national security council meeting to review the threat and discuss possible countermeasures.\n\nIntelligence sources from Seoul and Washington claim that Pyongyang has been developing a SLBM, which could represent a new threat to South Korea. The sources tell South Korea's Yonghap news agency that the North has succeeded in installing a missile launcher onto the submarine after conducting a series of experiments on shore as well as underwater.\n\nMinistry officials have previously said that North Korea has about 70 submarines and appears to be mainly imitating Russian designs in its efforts to develop a system for submarine-launched missiles. North Korea is believed to have obtained several of the Soviet Navy's retired Golf-class ballistic missile submarines in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe move is seen as part of efforts by North Korea to equip its missiles with miniaturized nuclear bombs. If so, that would mean the Pyongyang has developed a naval strike capability that is at least a decade ahead of the South, according to Yonghap news agency, quoting unidentified \"North Korea watchers.\"\n\nThe South Korean navy has just laid out a plan to build six 3,000-ton submarines equipped with vertical missile launchers between 2027 and 2030, the South Korean agency says.",
    " Title: Biden Addresses Allegations of Inappropriate Touching, Vows to Change Campaign Style\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, a potential 2020 presidential candidate, joked about past allegations of making women uncomfortable through physical contact during a speech on Friday. In a speech before the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Biden joked about seeking permission before hugging a labor union president and putting his arm around a boy he invited onstage.\n\nBiden's conduct has been under scrutiny in the past week as several women have claimed they felt uncomfortable due to hugs, shoulder grasps, and other close physical contact initiated by Biden during his career. During a question-and-answer session after the speech, Biden stated he was \"sorry that I didn't understand more\" when asked if he would directly apologize to the women. He clarified, \"I'm not sorry for my intentions. I'm not sorry for anything I've ever done.\"\n\nBiden acknowledged that his intentions were not the issue and that he would need to change his campaign style to ensure consent before touching anyone, regardless of his intentions. He also conceded that his conduct might affect his campaigning methods moving forward.\n\nBiden stated he is \"very close\" to announcing his 2020 presidential bid, but is being cautious with his words to avoid starting the campaign clock. He also dismissed the label of being a moderate, stating he wished he had been labeled as such when he ran for the Senate seven times. Biden contended that the majority of Democratic Party members are still liberal-to-moderate Democrats in the traditional sense.\n\nPresident Trump, who has been accused by more than a dozen women of inappropriate sexual contact, defended a tweet he posted earlier this week showing a parody video of Biden being approached from behind by a second Biden who rubs his shoulders. When asked if he was the \"right messenger\" for that, Trump responded, \"I think I am a very good messenger.\" Trump also stated that he did not view Biden as a threat, adding, \"I think he's only a threat to himself.\"\n\nAfter Biden's speech, Trump tweeted that union workers would be voting for him instead.",
    " Title: Twelve Republican Senators Join Democrats to Terminate President Trump's National Emergency Declaration\n\nArticle:\n\nTwelve Republican senators joined forces with Democrats on Thursday to pass a resolution terminating the national emergency declared by President Trump last month. The 59-41 vote was a rare bipartisan rebuke of Trump, who will now issue the first veto of his presidency to preserve the emergency declaration.\n\nThe Senate GOP dissenters, including Lamar Alexander, Roy Blunt, Susan Collins, Mike Lee, Jerry Moran, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul, Rob Portman, Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio, Pat Toomey, and Roger Wicker, span the ideological spectrum from conservative to moderate. Most argued that the president was operating outside the rule of law, while some simply called the emergency declaration an executive overreach that Congress had a duty to stop.\n\nSenator Lamar Alexander, who plans to retire after three terms representing Tennessee rather than seek reelection next year, stated, \"Never before has a president asked for funding, Congress has not provided it, and the president then has used the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to spend the money anyway. The problem with this is that after a Revolutionary War against a king, our nation's founders gave to Congress the power to approve all spending so that the president would not have too much power. This check on the executive is a crucial source of our freedom.\"\n\nSenator Collins, the moderate from Maine who is the only senator facing a 2020 reelection campaign among the twelve Republicans to vote for the resolution, argued in a floor speech that Trump's declaration failed to pass the longstanding five-part test of a genuine emergency: \"necessary, sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and not permanent.\"\n\nSenator Mitt Romney, who took a hard-line stance against illegal immigration during his 2012 presidential campaign, stated, \"This is not a vote against border security. In fact, I agree that a physical barrier is urgently needed to help ease the humanitarian crisis at the southern border, and the administration already has $4.5 billion available within existing authority to fund a barrier\u2014even without an emergency declaration.\"\n\nSenator Mike Lee, who thought Trump's declaration was legal under the 1976 National Emergencies Act, was willing to uphold it if the law could be changed to curb the power it gives the executive. However, when a deal to pass Lee's Article One Act, which would have satisfied his concerns, fell through, he decided to vote \"no.\"\n\nTwo of the more surprising votes against terminating the national emergency were those cast by Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, both of whom face reelection in 2020. Tillis had been expressing disapproval of the emergency declaration for weeks, while Sasse has generally voiced more public criticism of President Trump than any other Republican in the Senate.\n\nSenator Ben Sasse said in a statement, \"The National Emergencies Act (NEA) is 'overly broad and I want to fix it, but at present Nancy Pelosi doesn't, so I am therefore voting against her politically motivated resolution.' As a constitutional conservative, I believe that the NEA currently on the books should be narrowed considerably. That's why I'm an original sponsor of Senator Lee's legislation, and it is why I have repeatedly gone to the White House to seek support for NEA reform.\"\n\nRepublican senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who voted to uphold the emergency, spoke for the vast majority of Senate Republicans when he took the floor to argue that there is a genuine emergency on the Southern border and that President Trump's declaration was both legal and proper. \"Since last October, Border Patrol agents have apprehended more than 260,000 illegal aliens at the border, a surge of 90 percent\u2014almost double\u2014from the previous year,\" he said. \"He [Trump] is only exercising the statutory authority delegated to him by us.\"\n\nWhile Cotton said he respects colleagues who worry about a slippery slope, he dismissed that objection because Congress has \"not delegated to the executive the power to confiscate guns, close power plants, or any of the other common entrants in the parade of horribles on the slippery slope. That's the difference between lawful and lawless government, and it's the case here.\"\n\n\"If you want to see lawless executive action, by the way, you can look instead to the last administration,\" Cotton added. \"President Obama purported to give millions of illegal aliens legal status and work permits in clear violation of statutes passed by Congress. Strange how I don't recall the self-styled 'Resistance' manning the ramparts and rushing to the Ninth Circuit back then. In fact, I only recall congressional fanboys of a president using the 'pen and phone' to encroach on our constitutional prerogatives.\"\n\nIn 2014, when the House voted to rescind President Obama's DACA program for illegal immigrants who arrived as minors, only four Democrats joined most Republicans to rebuke what many said was an unconstitutional action. Democrats controlled the Senate at the time, and Majority Leader Harry Reid never brought the legislation opposing DACA up for a vote.",
    " Title: Sen. Bernie Sanders Defends Record, Highlights Policy Stances Ahead of 2016 Democratic Presidential Nominating Contest\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a candidate for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, defended his political record on Wednesday, emphasizing his opposition to free trade agreements and his efforts to regulate Wall Street banks.\n\nIn an interview on CNN's \"New Day,\" Sanders stated that voters would need to compare his record with that of Hillary Clinton, the party's frontrunner for the presidential nomination. He expressed respect for Clinton but clarified that he was running to represent working families and the middle class, not to run against Clinton.\n\nSanders highlighted his opposition to trade agreements, citing his votes against various trade deals and his leadership in the fight against the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). He argued that the TPP would result in the outsourcing of well-paying jobs to low-wage countries.\n\nFurthermore, Sanders discussed his proposals for a breakup of the largest financial institutions on Wall Street, asserting that these institutions, if they are too big to fail, are too big to exist due to their excessive power.\n\nSanders also emphasized his support for free college tuition at public colleges and universities, his leadership on climate change, and his push for legislation that would require the wealthiest individuals and largest corporations to pay a \"fair share\" of taxes.\n\n\"Those are my views, and people are going to have to judge Secretary Clinton's views,\" Sanders said. He added, \"I think you have to look at my record.\"\n\nSanders concluded by stating that his record demonstrated a strong commitment to standing up for the voiceless and powerless, particularly those who have given up on the political process.",
    " Title: Three Suspects Sought in Brussels Terror Attacks; ISIS Claims Responsibility\n\nArticle:\n\nAuthorities in Belgium are searching for three suspects in connection with the coordinated attacks at the Brussels airport and a subway station in the Belgian capital on Tuesday, which left at least 30 people dead and 230 others injured. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but it is too soon to confirm whether the terror group was behind the blasts.\n\nSurveillance footage shows a man wearing light-colored clothes and a hat pushing a baggage cart through the airport, which is one key piece of evidence authorities are examining. Police have released photos of three men they believe are suspects tied to the airport attack, standing side-by-side. The man on the right is the focus of the investigation, as authorities believe he planted a bomb at the airport and then left.\n\nTwo of the men, wearing black in the surveillance images, are believed to be suicide bombers who died in the explosions in the airport's departure lounge. The man in light-colored clothing is a wanted man, and authorities are asking for the public's help in tracking him down.\n\nA photograph released by investigators shows the three suspects side-by-side. Federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said the two men wearing black in the photograph were likely the suicide attackers. Video shows the men exiting a taxi and moving through the airport, according to two U.S. officials. The man dressed in white left the airport after accompanying the other two, a move the officials said appeared to be planned.\n\nA break in the investigation may have come from a taxi driver who took the suspects to the airport. The driver contacted authorities after seeing surveillance footage and gave them the address where he picked the men up, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. That information prompted authorities to raid a residence after the attacks.\n\nInvestigators found a nail bomb, chemical products, and an ISIS flag during a house search in the northeast Brussels neighborhood of Schaerbeek, Belgium's federal prosecutor said in a statement. Hours later, they were still combing through the building for evidence. Security was high, with a helicopter hovering overhead carrying a sniper with a weapon trained on the building.\n\nAs masked, armed officers stood guard outside the building, the burst of camera flashes inside could be seen from the street below. Officers left the building carrying bags of evidence they loaded onto vehicles.\n\nA Belgian government representative told CNN that 10 people were killed and 100 wounded at Brussels' international airport. At least 20 people died and 130 were wounded at the Maelbeek metro station. The blasts sent wounded people fleeing into the streets, spurred evacuations of nuclear plants and transit hubs, and led to raids in some areas as authorities searched for suspects and evidence.\n\nAuthorities in Belgium have been trying to crack down on terror threats for months as they raided homes in the area in search of suspects. Tuesday's violence came just days after investigators closed in on Europe's most wanted man, Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam, who was hiding out in a Brussels suburb.\n\nThe \"working assumption\" is that the attackers came from the network behind November's massacres in Paris, which left 130 dead, Belgian security sources said, while cautioning it is very early in the latest investigation. ISIS also claimed responsibility for those attacks.\n\nAs doctors treat the wounded and authorities search for suspects, a key question remains unanswered: Could the attacks have anything to do with Abdeslam's arrest? On Tuesday, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel deflected a question about whether there is any link between the attacks and Belgium-born French citizen Abdeslam's capture, saying it is too early to tell.\n\nTwo senior U.S. officials told CNN they believe the Belgium attack is tied to the same network as Abdeslam. One of the two airport explosions happened outside security checkpoints for ticketed passengers and near the airline check-in counters, an airline official briefed on the situation said. The subway station blast happened about an hour later in the Brussels district of Maelbeek, near the European Quarter, where European Union institutions are based.\n\n\"We were fearing terrorist attacks,\" Michel told reporters Tuesday. \"And that has now happened.\" Belgium is no stranger to terror. \"The Belgians have been sitting on a ticking time bomb,\" a U.S. counterterrorism official said, given all those who have traveled from the small European nation to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS, then possibly come back home.\n\nBut for survivors of Tuesday's blasts, the repeated warnings from officials in recent months did not dull the shock of seeing the carnage. \"You can not believe it; you can not believe it,\" said Jef Versele, who was in the airport's departure hall when bombs exploded there. \"It was so insane. Not in my backyard.\" The second blast inside the airport blew out windows, created a lot of smoke, and caused parts of the ceiling to fall, he added.\n\n\"People were on the floor,\" Versele said, estimating he saw 50 to 60 who were thrown to the ground and did not seem to be able to walk. Anthony Barrett saw the wounded carried out on stretchers and luggage carts as he watched from his hotel across from the terminal building.\n\nAfter the attacks in Brussels, the home of NATO and the capital of the European Union, leaders inside Belgium and beyond vowed not to back down in their fight against terror. In Belgium, where officials declared three days of national mourning, Michel offered a resolute message to those who supported and cheered the attackers.\n\n\"To those who have chosen to be barbarous enemies of freedom, democracy, and fundamental values... we remain united as one,\" Michel said. \"We are determined to defend our freedoms and to protect our liberties.\" In its message claiming responsibility, ISIS noted that Belgium is one of the nations \"participating in the international coalition against the Islamic State.\"",
    " Title: ACLU's Commitment to the First Amendment Remains Controversial, According to ACLU's National Legal Director\n\nArticle:\n\nDavid Cole, the national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), has reassured readers in a New York Times op-ed that they should not \"lose faith in the First Amendment.\" The op-ed, directed at \"liberals or progressives,\" can also be interpreted as a response to critics who question the ACLU's commitment to the First Amendment, including libertarians and conservatives.\n\nThe debate about the ACLU's support for freedom of speech has been ongoing since 1990, as evidenced by a cover story published by \u2588\u2588\u2588. Charles Oliver argued that the ACLU's commitment to free speech had been compromised by its pursuit of progressive causes. Critics, including longtime ACLU members such as Nat Hentoff and Alan Dershowitz, expressed concern that \"greed and left-wing ideology have corrupted the union,\" which had \"diluted its message, compromised its mission, and, in some instances, abandoned its commitment to the First Amendment.\"\n\nNearly three decades later, the argument about the ACLU's support for freedom of speech continues, indicating that the organization remains divided on the issue, and that the stalwarts are influential enough that the ACLU is still willing to defend the First Amendment rights of people who offend progressives.\n\nRecent evidence of internal qualms about free speech is a staff memo revealed by Wendy Kaminer, a former member of the ACLU's national board. The memo suggests that the organization's lawyers, in selecting First Amendment cases, should consider the impact of speech on \"other values advanced by the ACLU,\" such as equality and racial justice. While the memo affirms the ACLU's commitment to defending speakers whose views its members find repugnant, the very idea that the organization's goals conflict with each other is an invitation to prioritize some of those \"other values\" over freedom of speech.\n\nCole's response to Kaminer reaffirmed \"our commitment to defending speech with which we disagree,\" but it also repeated the memo's thesis that First Amendment cases can \"pose conflicts between our values.\" In his New York Times piece, Cole argues that the ACLU still takes a viewpoint-neutral approach to First Amendment cases, citing various cases the organization has defended, including high school students disciplined for political activism, students penalized for social media posts, and anti-Trump and pro-Trump demonstrators, among others.\n\nCole defends the First Amendment as a principle that is useful to both the left and the right, citing the Supreme Court's ruling that the First Amendment prohibits holding the Westboro Baptist Church liable for displaying anti-gay signs outside a military funeral. Cole rebuts the idea that neutrality is suspect because it favors the rich and powerful, stating that the First Amendment favors people without power and influence.\n\nWhile Cole's defense of the First Amendment is encouraging, it is purely instrumental, as he argues that progressives should support freedom of speech because it helps advance their goals, not because using force to silence offensive speakers is unjust or immoral. This omission may mean Cole knows his audience, as judging from the grumbling within his own organization about the freedom that white supremacists and other unsavory characters enjoy under the First Amendment.",
    " Title: Brexit Vote: Immigration Emerges as Key Factor in UK's Decision to Leave EU\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent Brexit referendum has sparked discussions centered on immigration, with many British citizens expressing dissatisfaction with the country's inability to govern itself independently from the European Union (EU). One individual, who voted to leave the EU, stated that his primary reason was to halt the flow of immigration, regardless of Europe or trade deals.\n\nStephen Booth, co-director of Open Europe, a nonpartisan think tank based in London and Brussels, reported that of the approximately 5 million net immigrants to the United Kingdom between 1990 and 2014, over three-quarters came from outside Europe. Currently, immigration from the EU accounts for nearly half of the United Kingdom's net inflow, Booth said. The expansion of the EU in 2004 and 2007, which brought in poorer countries like Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland, and the Eurozone economic crisis have contributed to substantial internal immigration to Britain and its relatively strong economy.\n\nProponents of immigration argue that it has grown the British economy, increased tax revenue, and attracted skilled workers. However, critics claim that immigration has overwhelmed Britain's public resources, changed the country's culture and values, and placed an enormous strain on the welfare state.\n\nIn a letter to the UK-based Guardian, Richard Mountford of Tonbridge, Kent, stated that the Brexit vote was a protest against the mass immigration flow. He suggested that the EU should offer an opt-out from the free movement of people to the UK and any other member state that desires it. This, he argued, would address the main reason for the vote to leave and make it legitimate for the UK government to offer a second referendum, rather than initiate the exit process immediately. An opt-out, Mountford added, would also help alleviate anti-EU sentiments in several other EU countries.\n\nAfter the votes were counted, Britain voted 52% to 48% to leave the EU. UK Prime Minister David Cameron, who backed the \"Remain\" camp, lost the referendum and announced his resignation the morning after the vote. A new prime minister is projected to be installed in October, with Cameron remaining in a caretaker role until then.",
    " Title: Sen. Mitt Romney Criticizes President Trump's Behavior in Mueller Report\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican and the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, expressed his disapproval of President Trump's behavior as detailed in the special counsel Robert Mueller's report released on Thursday. In a series of tweets, Romney shared his reaction after reviewing the report, which summarizes the special counsel's investigation into the 2016 presidential race and related matters.\n\n\"It is good news that there was insufficient evidence to charge the President of the United States with having conspired with a foreign adversary or with having obstructed justice. The alternative would have taken us through a wrenching process with the potential for constitutional crisis. The business of government can move on,\" wrote Romney.\n\nHowever, he continued, \"I am sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the President.\" Romney also expressed his dismay at various actions taken by individuals associated with the Trump campaign, such as welcoming help from Russia, failing to inform American law enforcement, and promoting Russian interests in Ukraine.\n\nIn response, President Trump tweeted on Saturday, sharing a video that mocked Romney's loss during the 2012 election to former President Barack Obama. Trump tweeted, \"If @MittRomney spent the same energy fighting Barack Obama as he does fighting Donald Trump, he could have won the race (maybe).\"\n\nThe 488-page report summarizes the special counsel's findings nearly two years since Mueller, a former FBI director, was appointed by the Department of Justice to lead an investigation into the 2016 race started by his successor, James Comey. Mueller's probe concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 race in a \"sweeping and systematic fashion\" and identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. However, investigators did not find evidence of Trump's associates illegally coordinating with Moscow, and Mueller concluded the probe without making a determination with respect to the obstruction question.\n\n\"The evidence we obtained about the President's actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\" Mueller wrote.\n\nTrump has celebrated the report in the wake of its release, declaring on Twitter that \"The Russia Hoax is dead!\"\n\nElected to the Senate in 2018, Romney has been a vocal critic of Trump since prior to his presidency. Speaking in early 2016, Romney called the future president \"a phony, a fraud\" and a \"failed candidate.\"",
    " Title: Former DNC Chair Donna Brazile Alleges Clinton Campaign's \"Cult-Like\" Atmosphere in New Book\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Donna Brazile, in her recently published book and subsequent media interviews, has portrayed the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign as an impenetrable and even \"cult-like\" environment, hindering any efforts by advisers who warned about the missteps that ultimately led to Donald Trump's victory.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" Brazile seemed to walk back suggestions in her book that some on the Clinton team were sexist, but described their attitude as \"dismissive\" and \"condescending.\"\n\nBrazile suggested that the campaign placed too much emphasis on data analysis and algorithms, neglecting traditional, grassroots campaigning. In her book, \"Hacks,\" she wrote, \"Everybody worshipped the data and the analytics.\"\n\nBrazile told Fox News that she and campaign manager Robby Mook came from \"different\" schools, with the Clinton team focusing on algorithms and data modeling. If she had concerns, why couldn't she break through? Brazile claimed she tried but \"could not crack them.\"\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Brazile stated, \"I felt like it was a cult. You could not penetrate them.\"\n\nThe book and Brazile's subsequent media interviews have sparked tensions between Brazile and the Clinton camp. Over the weekend, dozens of Clinton campaign team members released an open letter, stating, \"We do not recognize the campaign she portrays in the book.\" They added, \"But we do not recognize the campaign she portrays in the book.\"\n\nOne of the most explosive claims in the book, released in an excerpt ahead of publication, alleges that the DNC struck a special deal with the Clinton campaign, giving the campaign partial control over party decisions and resources in exchange for financial assistance. This claim has fueled concerns among Bernie Sanders supporters that the former Democratic primary candidate was at a disadvantage from the start in his race against Clinton for the nomination.\n\nBrazile maintains she worked hard during the general election to help Clinton win and stresses that her aim even now is to help the party heal. \"I'm focusing on making sure that grassroots Democrats know that our party is going to become stronger,\" she told Fox News. \"We had a very competitive primary. I don't know when the Republicans will sit down and heal their wounds, but we are healing our wounds, and we are going to learn how to become a stronger, more effective party.\"",
    " Title: East Coast Storm Causes Travel Disruptions and Casualties Across the Country\n\nArticle:\n\nA massive winter storm, which originated on the West Coast, has been causing disruptions and casualties across the United States. The storm, which started on Thursday, has led to more than 100 wrecks and has been blamed for at least seven deaths.\n\nThe storm has affected much of the East Coast, with snow and sleet falling in pockets of Pennsylvania and New York. The system is not expected to dissipate anytime soon, and it could cause even more problems and headaches on Wednesday, particularly for air travelers waiting to fly home for Thanksgiving.\n\nWinds are forecast to pick up and affect densely populated areas in the Northeast in the next day or so. For drivers, big gusts mixed with drenching rains can slow things down, while for air travelers, there is always a big trickle-down effect when airports like New York's LaGuardia and Kennedy airports or those in Philadelphia and Boston experience wind delays.\n\nThe expected issues should not overshadow what this storm has already done. The system started on the West Coast, proving its might from the get-go. A 52-year-old man in Yuba County, California, died on Thursday when a tree fell on top of a vehicle, according to the county sheriff's office. Road conditions were blamed for the deaths of two people in New Mexico, and three people were killed in an icy pileup along Interstate 40 late Friday in northwest Texas. The weather also was blamed for four deaths in Oklahoma since late last week.\n\nThe storm's impact was felt Tuesday, with one stretch of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, about 20 miles east of Pittsburgh, seeing a mix of snow, rain, and ice over the course of the day. Snow was the issue for cities and towns along the Appalachian Mountains, all the way down to West Virginia. Parts of upstate New York, including Buffalo and Syracuse, were seeing flakes on Tuesday night.\n\nHowever, the temperature was not expected to be especially chilly everywhere. The National Weather Service forecast temperatures to rise into the 50s during the night in Philadelphia and Boston. But there, the temperature wouldn't be the story so much as the wind speed. Sustained winds in New York, where the thermostat should hit 55 degrees by 5 a.m., will reach 19 to 24 mph, with gusts blowing as strong as 55 mph. It will not be much better on Thursday, when the forecast calls for breezes from the west at 21 to 24 mph, with more potent gusts.\n\nThe wind could hamper the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade through the streets of Manhattan. The giant balloons that are the parade's trademarks -- featuring characters from Hello Kitty to Snoopy to the Pillsbury Doughboy -- won't soar if sustained winds exceed 23 mph that day, because of fears that the balloon handlers won't be able to control them.\n\nAs of Tuesday night, the weather's effect on flights was fairly minimal. As of 10:30 p.m., 158 flights had been canceled nationwide, with another 84 scuttled Wednesday, according to the air travel tracking website Flightaware.com. The highest number of pre-Thanksgiving Day cancellations, with 28 so far, is northern New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport, the site says.\n\nThere is a possibility this situation could turn for the worst, quickly, leading to major delays if not more cancellations. CNN's meteorology unit estimates, if winds blow as forecast, New York metro area airports could see average delays of two to three hours, and Boston's Logan airport could be even worse. This would not just affect those flying in and out of those airports, or others like Washington's Dulles or Reagan that could be similarly affected. There's a ripple effect because of the logistics of carefully coordinated schedules and connecting flights that could affect many of the 3.14 million people that AAA projects will fly this weekend.\n\nIn expectation of such headaches, major airlines like Delta, US Airways, JetBlue, and United have already relaxed their policies by letting some customers change their reservations without a fee. Still, the vast majority of travelers -- 43.4 million, by AAA's count -- won't be in the air but on the road. For them, the combination of strong winds and slick surfaces, even if they are not coated with snow or ice, could lead to problems. In other words, make a plan if you will be among these millions over the next few days, packing snacks and patience in case you come to a crawl. And, as always, drive safely.",
    " Title: Paul Ryan's Political Evolution: From Fiscal Hawk to House Speaker\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 2008 interview with a media personality, former Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) discussed his political views and the evolution of his stance on government intervention in the economy. Prior to his tenure in Congress, Ryan had visited the interviewee at ABC and shared his concerns about the approaching debt crisis and the unfairness of entitlement programs.\n\nRyan's political career took a turn when the housing bubble burst, leading him to vote for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the auto bailout. The interviewee questioned Ryan's adherence to free-market principles, to which Ryan explained his votes as a response to the impending deflationary spiral and the potential collapse of the economy.\n\nThe interviewee inquired about the government's role in bailing out the auto industry, to which Ryan responded that his vote was aimed at preventing the auto companies from receiving TARP funds. He also expressed concern over TARP's transformation into a \"revolving government slush fund.\"\n\nThe interviewee posed the question of whether government should have bailed out the auto industry in an ideal world. Ryan admitted that he would have preferred to vote against the bills, but the political climate at the time, marked by near panic, influenced his decision.\n\nRyan explained his view that the increasing reliance on the federal government for benefits and livelihoods is moving the country towards a \"road to serfdom.\" He argued that this trend signifies a shift from a society where the goal of government is to promote equal opportunity, to one where the government aims to equalize the results of people's lives.\n\nThe interviewee expressed concern that most Americans may not understand economics and prefer a government that \"takes care\" of them. Ryan countered that Americans believe in the American idea, where rights do not come from government, and do not want a government that redistributes, regulates, and rations their rights.\n\nIn 2008, Ryan proposed a \"Roadmap for the Future,\" a budget plan aimed at slowing the growth of government. The plan, while timid, would not eliminate the Education Department or other unnecessary government agencies and would not balance the budget for decades. Despite its moderate nature, even fellow Republicans criticized the plan, with Newt Gingrich labeling it \"right-wing social engineering.\"\n\nThe interviewee invited Ryan back on his show in subsequent years to discuss the progress of his Roadmap. By then, Ryan felt that the political landscape had shifted, with his Roadmap helping to change the conversation and inspiring many Republicans to embrace smaller government and fiscal responsibility.\n\nRyan expressed satisfaction with the progress made in moving the country towards limited government and economic freedom. He acknowledged that, for 50 years, the needle did not move in terms of reducing the size of government, but now more Americans understand the importance of fiscal responsibility.\n\nRyan concluded the interview by stating that America has one more opportunity to revive and reapply the American idea, but there will come a point where that moment might pass. He emphasized that the people of southern Wisconsin are ready to engage in adult conversations about the debt crisis and that the country can get back toward limited government and economic freedom.",
    " Title: Whispers of Iran Nuclear Deal Emerge as Deadline Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Iran and world powers faced another self-imposed deadline on Monday, whispers of a potential nuclear deal began to emerge from the negotiating room. According to two unnamed diplomats, as reported by The Associated Press, the deal, which would limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of sanctions, is expected to be announced on Monday.\n\nNPR's Peter Kenyon, reporting from Vienna, reported that Iranian TV is adding to the expectation for a deal. He stated, \"The signals from Iran are positive, with state-run media predicting an agreement will happen, and Iranian officials describing the document as running to almost 100 pages, including several technical annexes.\"\n\nHowever, most reports of an imminent deal include the caveat that a few issues need to be resolved, and the various capitals must sign off on any agreement. If an accord is reached, exhausted negotiators will have little time to celebrate their achievement, as critics in Congress have warmed up their attacks, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has re-stated his argument that Iran poses a greater threat than the self-proclaimed Islamic State.\n\nThe BBC has rounded up what high-level officials said on the record about the negotiations on Sunday:\n\n* US Secretary of State John Kerry said, \"A few tough things need to be resolved, but added: 'We're getting to some real decisions.' \"\n* French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who cancelled a trip to Africa to stay at the talks, said, \"I hope we are finally entering the final phase of these marathon negotiations. I believe it.\"\n* In Iran, President Hassan Rouhani said, \"The sides had 'come a long way.' 'We need to reach a peak and we're very close,' the Isna news agency quoted him as saying.\"\n\nIf the deal is reached, it would mark the culmination of decades of diplomacy. However, the deal would have to be approved by several capitals, including the U.S. Congress.",
    " Title: Number of VA Facilities Under Investigation for Falsified Records and Treatment Delays More Than Doubles\n\nArticle:\n\nThe number of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities under investigation following complaints about falsified records and treatment delays has more than doubled, according to the Office of Inspector General (IG) at the Veterans Affairs Department. As of late Tuesday, 26 facilities are being investigated nationwide.\n\nActing Inspector General Richard Griffin revealed last week that at least 10 new allegations about manipulated waiting times and other problems have surfaced since reports of problems at the Phoenix VA hospital came to light last month. The expanded investigations come as President Barack Obama's choice to help carry out reforms at the Veterans Affairs Department, Rob Nabors, is set to travel to Phoenix to meet with staff at the local VA office.\n\nObama announced last week that Nabors would be assigned to the VA after allegations of delayed care that may have led to patient deaths and a cover-up by top administrators in Phoenix. Similar claims have been reported at VA facilities in Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Georgia, Missouri, Texas, Florida, and elsewhere.\n\nNabors met Tuesday in Washington with representatives of several veterans' organizations, including the American Legion and Disabled American Veterans, among others. He will meet Thursday with leadership at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Medical Center, including interim director Steve Young. White House spokesman Jay Carney confirmed the meeting.\n\nYoung took over in Phoenix after director Sharon Helman was placed on leave indefinitely while the VA's Office of Inspector General investigates claims raised by several former VA employees that Phoenix administrators kept a secret list of patients waiting for appointments to hide delays in care.\n\nCritics say Helman was motivated to conceal delays to collect a bonus of about $9,000 last year. A former clinic director for the VA in Phoenix first came out publicly with the allegations of secret lists in April. Dr. Samuel Foote, who retired in December after nearly 25 years with the VA, says that up to 40 veterans may have died while awaiting treatment at the Phoenix hospital. Investigators say they have so far not linked any patient deaths in Phoenix to delayed care.\n\nThe allegations have sparked a firestorm on Capitol Hill and some calls for VA Secretary Eric Shinseki's resignation. The VA's undersecretary for health care, Robert Petzel, has since stepped down.\n\nHowever, Republicans denounced the move as a hollow gesture, since Petzel had already been scheduled to retire soon. And several lawmakers are proposing legislation to take on VA problems.\n\nRepublican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, told The Associated Press on Tuesday he plans to introduce legislation this week to ensure that internal probes by the VA's Office of Medical Inspector are released to Congress and the public \"so the full scope of the VA's dysfunction can not be disguised.\"\n\nMoran noted that a VA nurse in Cheyenne, Wyoming, was put on leave this month for allegedly telling employees to falsify appointment records. The action came after an email about possible wait-list manipulation at the Cheyenne hospital was leaked to the media.\n\nBut Moran said the Cheyenne center was already the subject of a December 2013 report by Office of the Medical Inspector. That report apparently substantiated claims of improper scheduling practices, but it's unclear if action taken at the Cheyenne center was based on the medical inspector's findings, Moran said.\n\n\"Because OMI reports are not available to the public and have not been previously released to Congress, it is impossible to know whether the VA has taken action to implement the OMI's recommendations for improvement in each case,\" Moran said.\n\nMeanwhile, two Republican senators introduced legislation to prohibit payment of bonuses to employees at the Veterans Health Administration through next year. Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Deb Fischer of Nebraska said the VA should focus its spending on fixing problems at the agency, \"not rewarding employees entrenched in a failing bureaucracy.\" Burr is the senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and Fischer is a panel member.\n\nThe House passed a bill in February eliminating performance bonuses for the department's senior executive staff through 2018.\n\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, also called on Obama to back off plans to nominate Jeffrey Murawsky to replace Petzel at the VA. Murawsky, a career VA administrator, directly supervised Helman from 2010 to 2012.\n\nThe White House has said Obama remains confident in Shinseki's leadership and is standing behind Murawsky's nomination.\n\nShinseki and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel met with the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday to discuss how the two departments can improve interactions between their health records systems. The two Cabinet members said in a joint statement that the meeting was productive and that both men share the same goal \u2014 to improve health outcomes of active duty military, veterans, and beneficiaries.",
    " Title: Poll Workers Brace for Election Day Amid Concerns of Violence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a hearing last month, Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler expressed concerns not about potential hacking of voting machines, but rather the possibility of violence at polling stations on Election Day. The statement comes in the wake of incidents such as the firebombing of a Republican Party headquarters in North Carolina and reports of armed individuals loitering outside a Democratic campaign office in Virginia.\n\nAmber McReynolds, the director of elections for the city and county of Denver, stated that poll workers are being prepared for any scenario, with active shooter training added to their election judge training. McReynolds emphasized the importance of poll workers being able to handle any situation in a calm and responsive manner.\n\nPoll workers also have a central hotline to report any issues, allowing for real-time tracking of events throughout the city on Election Day. McReynolds noted that if emergency response is needed, it can be easily mobilized.\n\nMatt Masterson, a member of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, a federal agency that collaborates with state and local election offices, stated that almost every jurisdiction has a detailed plan for voting place emergencies. These plans were strengthened after the September 11 terrorist attacks, which occurred on a primary election day in New York City.\n\nMasterson believes that, given the current election climate, these plans are receiving extra attention. He stated that election officials have rechecked their plans and ensured that poll workers are well-versed in handling any escalation of conversations in polling places.\n\nTo avoid Election Day confrontations, Masterson suggested that everyone\u2014including poll workers, candidates, and outside monitors\u2014should be aware of the rules in advance. For example, the question of whether voters can carry guns into polling stations varies by location, with some places strictly prohibiting it, while others allow it in open-carry states.\n\nSchedler stated this week that it is a delicate balance for election officials, aiming to make voters feel safe while also welcoming them. He expressed concern about the sight of individuals with guns at polling stations, stating that it is not a typical experience for voters.\n\nMasterson and Schedler both agreed that most confrontations can be handled by polite but firm poll workers.",
    " Title: Congress Members Call for Enforcement of Federal Marijuana Laws, While Others Propose Bill to Protect State Marijuana Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, members of the U.S. Congress have expressed differing views regarding the enforcement of federal marijuana laws in states where marijuana use and sale are legal. Representatives Andrew Harris (R-MD), Frank Wolf (R-Va.), and Jo Bonner (R-Ala.) have called for the Obama administration to intervene in Colorado and Washington, states where marijuana use and sale are legal, citing federal law preemption.\n\nHowever, during an appropriations hearing with DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart, these calls for intervention were met with resistance. Leonhart stated that the DEA is still enforcing federal law and that the real problem lies in the heavy reliance on local law enforcement groups for cooperation.\n\nIn a countermove, Representative Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) is reportedly preparing to introduce a bill that would protect marijuana users and business owners from federal prosecution, as long as they are in compliance with state laws. The bill, known as the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act, would amend the Controlled Substances Act, which makes the sale and use of marijuana illegal under federal law.\n\nThe bill has five co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle, including Reps. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), Don Young (R-Alaska), Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), and Jared Polis (D-Col.). In a statement, Rohrabacher described the bill as \"common sense\" and stated that it \"keeps the federal government out of the business of criminalizing marijuana activities.\"\n\nTwo recent poll results suggest a shift in public opinion on the issue. According to a December poll by Gallup, 58% of Americans support legalizing marijuana, while 35% are opposed. Pew's results show no partisan split when it comes to enforcing federal drug laws against pro-pot states.\n\nThis emerging issue could potentially lead to an intraparty squabble within the Republican Party, as some members push for stricter enforcement of federal marijuana laws while others advocate for states' rights regarding marijuana legalization. The outcome in Congress remains uncertain, but the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act could potentially balance the older voters the party needs to hold and the younger voters the party needs to win.",
    " Title: Trump Leads Clinton in Nevada, North Carolina, and Ohio in Latest Statewide Polls\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the battleground states of Nevada, North Carolina, and Ohio, Donald Trump is currently leading Hillary Clinton in the latest statewide likely voter polls conducted between September 18-20, 2016. The polls, jointly directed by Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), were conducted by telephone with live interviewers among a sample of likely voters selected from statewide voter files.\n\nIn Nevada, Trump has a three-point advantage over Clinton among likely voters, with 43% supporting Trump and 40% backing Clinton. Gary Johnson receives 8% of the vote, while \"none of these\" takes 4%. Green Party candidate Jill Stein is not on the ballot in Nevada. Independents back Trump (42%) over Clinton (23%) and Johnson (21%).\n\nIn North Carolina, Trump is up by five points, with 45% of likely voters supporting Trump and 40% backing Clinton. Six percent favor Johnson, and Stein is not on the ballot. Whites back Trump by a 31-point margin (58-27%), while blacks support Clinton by 82 points (85-3%).\n\nIn Ohio, Trump is also leading Clinton by five points among likely voters, with 42% supporting Trump and 37% backing Clinton. Six percent favor Johnson, and Stein receives 2%. Trump's edge over Clinton comes mainly from independents (20 points) and working-class whites (26 points). Clinton is up by just three points among women, who supported Obama by 11 points in 2012.\n\nIn each state, the polls also ask about the senate races. In Nevada, Joe Heck leads his Democratic opponent Catherine Cortez Masto by seven points (43-36%). In North Carolina, incumbent Sen. Richard Burr bests Democratic challenger Deborah Ross by 43-37%, with Libertarian Sean Haugh at 6%. In Ohio, Rob Portman holds a 14-point lead over Democrat Ted Strickland (51-37%).\n\nThere's also a gubernatorial race in North Carolina. Republican incumbent Pat McCrory tops Democrat Roy Cooper by 46-43%. Libertarian Lon Cecil receives 3%. The polls were conducted with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for the total sample of likely voters in all three states.",
    " Title: Biden Secures Victory in Illinois Primary, Strengthening Democratic Nomination Lead\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has solidified his position in the Democratic presidential nomination race following the Illinois primary on Tuesday, securing 59.5% of the votes to Senator Bernie Sanders' 35.8% with 96% of precincts reporting. The election day in Illinois was marked by delayed results, missing election judges, dwindling supplies of hand sanitizer, and debates over whether the state should hold its primary during a global health pandemic.\n\nSpeaking from his Delaware home, Biden described the night as \"very good\" in Illinois and Florida, stating that he was \"a little closer to securing the Democratic Party's nomination for president.\" He also addressed Sanders' supporters, saying, \"I hear you. I know what's at stake. I know what we have to do.\"\n\nBiden performed particularly well with women voters, older voters, and African-American voters, according to CNN polls. He took 70% of the African-American vote, compared to Sanders' 27%. Among women, Biden had 65% to Sanders' 30%. Sanders, unsurprisingly, performed well with voters aged 17-44, with 63% compared to Biden's 17%, according to the CNN poll. Biden took 78% of the vote among voters 45 and older, the polls found.\n\nThe race was closer in Chicago, with Biden at 50.43% and Sanders at 45.52% with 77% of precincts reporting. In suburban Cook County, with 95% of precincts reporting, Biden led Sanders 62.76% to 32.81%.\n\nHistorically low Election Day turnout in Chicago prompted Biden to rely on a record number of early voters and those who voted by mail. Illinois, Florida, and Arizona, with their combined 441 delegates for the taking, held their primaries on Tuesday despite the coronavirus outbreak. Biden won all three states, with 155 pledged delegates at stake in Illinois.\n\nThe Democratic presidential race now consists of Biden, Sanders, and U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, but Illinois voters had 13 candidates on their mail-in, early voting, and Election Day ballots. Most candidates dropped out of the race in early March as Biden and Sanders continued to gain delegates across the nation.\n\nThe tide turned when Biden won nine states on March 3, the most important voting day in the Democratic party, and Democratic moderates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar quickly dropped out. With Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg also out, all eyes were on the former vice president and the democratic socialist and the competing factions of the Democratic party each represented.\n\nSanders lost Illinois in 2016 by a tiny margin of just 2 percentage points to Hillary Clinton. He was boosted by a Chicago rally on the eve of the election, which packed a downtown theater with many young, progressive voters.\n\nDue to the coronavirus outbreak, both the Biden and Sanders campaigns had to cancel events in the waning days of the election, meaning no last-minute in-person rallies and no campaigners knocking on doors. Most voter contact over the weekend for both campaigns was via apps, calls, texts, and emails.\n\nSanders took to a virtual event on Tuesday evening to discuss the need to ensure that any coronavirus medical care be affordable for low-income families. Biden hosted his own live-streamed event on Friday instead of planned fundraisers and a public rally. Sanders came out to Chicago on March 7 to host a rally, just before the coronavirus spread led to closures across the state.\n\nSanders was backed by two top leaders of the Chicago Teachers Union and Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, D-Ill., the most prominent Illinois elected official backing him. Biden had the crucial endorsements of Mayor Lori Lightfoot and three African American members of Congress from Illinois\u2014Representatives Bobby Rush, Danny Davis, and Robin Kelly, whose districts have the highest concentration of black voters in the state.\n\nIllinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, who was a major Hillary Clinton backer in 2016, also endorsed Biden for president on Monday. The billionaire entrepreneur and businessman turned governor had repeatedly vowed to stay out of the primary but eventually endorsed to ensure Illinois voters still went out to the polls.",
    " Title: Opioid Crisis Declared a National Health Emergency: Call for Elevation to National Emergency Status\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2017, the President declared the opioid crisis a national health emergency, citing 70,237 drug overdose deaths in the United States that year. The number remained high in 2018. With over 70,000 deaths annually, the opioid crisis is considered a national crisis of unprecedented proportion.\n\nRecently, border patrol agents in Arizona confiscated the largest seizure in U.S. history of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid blamed for the majority of overdose deaths. The overwhelming majority of this fentanyl comes from Mexico.\n\nThe call for elevating the opioid crisis to a National Emergency under the National Emergency Act is gaining momentum. Proponents argue that the ongoing influx of opioids from Mexico is a significant contributor to the high death toll and that an effective border barrier could prevent many of these deaths.\n\nCurrently, there are 32 National Emergencies declared, none of which are killing U.S. citizens. The annual carnage of opioid-related deaths exceeds the entire death toll for the 12-year Vietnam War.\n\nDeclaring a national emergency would have several benefits. First, it would acknowledge the severity of the crisis and mobilize resources to address it. Second, it would address the issue of drug trafficking and the associated crime that comes with it.\n\nCritics argue that the open border globalists crowd is indifferent to the families and communities affected by the opioid crisis. They claim that many are misguided and blame doctors or pharmacies when the carnage is from illegal heroin and fentanyl.\n\nComparatively, other ongoing national emergencies, such as the blocking of Sudanese Government Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Sudan (declared in 1997) and the Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (declared in 2006), have not resulted in any American deaths.\n\nThe question now is why the D.C. swamp is against a national emergency being declared to protect American citizens but cheers when a national emergency is used for international issues with no impact on U.S. citizens. The President is being urged to declare an emergency to address the opioid crisis, as it is a matter of national security and public health.\n\nCongressman Gosar, a representative from a border district in Arizona, has been an advocate for secure borders since taking office in 2011. He is a member of the House Freedom Caucus.",
    " Title: Election Results: Houston Rejects Transgender \"Bathroom Bill,\" Ohio Marijuana Legalization Fails, and Gubernatorial Races Decided\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the election races across the country on Tuesday, Houston voters rejected a transgender \"bathroom bill,\" Ohioans rejected legal marijuana, and Republicans captured both gubernatorial contest races at stake.\n\nWith 30 percent of precincts counted, The Associated Press declared that Houston's Proposition 1 had gone down to defeat. The measure was taking a beating with 62 percent of voters against the measure and 38 percent in favor. The vote capped a pitched 18-month battle between Houston pastors and Mayor Annise Parker, the first openly lesbian mayor of a major city, who had championed the ordinance allowing people to use restrooms, showers, and other public accommodations based on their gender identity, not their biological sex.\n\nIn Kentucky, Republican businessman Matt Bevin defeated Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway by 53 to 44 percent, with independent Drew Curtis taking 4 percent in the race to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear. Meanwhile, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant easily won a second term over Robert Gray, a Democrat who spent just $3,000 in a token campaign in the overwhelmingly Republican state.\n\nOhio voters overwhelmingly rejected Issue 3, which would have legalized recreational marijuana for adults 21 and over, handing the pro-pot movement its first defeat since Colorado and Washington approved legalization measures in 2012. In Ohio, however, there was a twist: The proposal would have also created a monopoly on cultivation for 10 investors, prompting opponents to denounce the measure as an example of \"weed greed.\"\n\n\"When it comes to the broader debate about legalizing marijuana, the defeat of Issue 3 won't be a case of 'as Ohio goes, so goes the nation,'\" said Tom Angell, chairman of Marijuana Majority, in a statement. Unlike Ohio, the four states\u2014Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska\u2014that have approved recreational pot for adults began with medical marijuana.\n\n\"This was about a flawed measure and a campaign that didn't represent what voters want,\" Mr. Angell said.\n\nMr. Bevin, a Kentucky business owner who had challenged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the 2014 GOP primary, ran as a political outsider with strong tea party support. He won the GOP gubernatorial primary in a crowded Republican field by just 83 votes. In his victory speech, Mr. Bevin issued a clarion call for unity, praising Mr. Conway and saying \"this is our opportunity to come together as one. We have much work ahead of us.\"\n\nHis running mate\u2014Lt. Gov.-elect Jenean Hampton, who introduced him Tuesday night\u2014became the first black person to win a statewide race in Kentucky. Mr. Conway made a concession and congratulations call before 9 p.m., telling supporters at the Frankfort Convention Center that he had told his rival that he \"remained positive about moving this state forward, and that if he ever needed any assistance, that this Democrat was at his disposal.\"\n\nThe result came as a bit of an upset because every poll had shown Mr. Conway ahead of Mr. Bevin, albeit only slightly in recent weeks. His election nearly completes Kentucky's shift from Democratic to Republican over the past few decades as GOP candidates gain ground in statewide races.\n\nRunning as a conservative Christian, Mr. Bevin was known for his unswerving support of Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, who drew national attention over her refusal to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. By contrast, Mr. Conway, when he was attorney general and a year before the Supreme Court's ruling, decided not to appeal a federal judge's order that the state marry same-sex couples, effectively imposing gay marriage on the state by default.\n\nThe Bevin campaign hammered Mr. Conway over his support for President Obama, with ads saying that the Democratic candidate was in favor of Obamacare, gun control, and abortion but against coal, \"just like Obama.\" The American Principles Project declared in a news release that social issues and candidates who support traditional values had won big.\n\n\"Bevin's upset victory in Kentucky is a victory for Kim Davis, a rebuke to those who say social issues hurt the GOP, and a call for Republicans nationally to support the First Amendment Defense Act,\" said the American Principles Project's Maggie Gallagher in a statement.\n\nMississippi Attorney General Jim Hood was also leading in his bid for a fourth term. The Democrat's race was especially significant in that he is believed to be the only Democrat still holding statewide elected office in the Deep South. Whatever happens in Mississippi, Louisiana could change that later this month. That state already had its so-called \"jungle primary\" for governor last month, narrowing the field to the top two vote-getters, Democratic candidate John Bel Edwards and Republican David Vitter. They now square off on Nov. 21.\n\nMore than 300 cities held mayoral elections, the biggest being Houston and Philadelphia, America's fourth- and fifth-largest cities. In Houston, seven candidates face off in a nonpartisan race to succeed Mayor Annise Parker, who pushed the transgender ordinance but is term-limited herself. In overwhelmingly Democratic Philadelphia, former city council member Jim Kenney easily defeated a Republican businessman to succeed term-limited Mayor Michael Nutter.",
    " Title: Clinton Emails Contained Sensitive Intelligence Information from Spy Satellites and Signal Intelligence\n\nArticle:\n\nThe revelation that Hillary Rodham Clinton's private emails contained sensitive information derived from spy satellites and signal intelligence has raised questions about her handling of classified information, according to security experts.\n\nLarry Johnson, a former CIA analyst trained in the rules of handling government secrets, told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Clinton's lack of recognition of the classified nature of the information in her emails calls into question her overall competence.\n\nAs details emerge about the extent of Clinton's use of personal email to exclusively conduct business as secretary of state, her defense has shifted. Initially, she stated flatly that her private emails did not hold or transmit classified information. She later amended that defense to claim that none of the information she sent by private email was classified at the time she sent it. Now, her defenders have evolved her story further, suggesting that she didn't know information she was handling was classified because it wasn't marked as such.\n\nPete Hoekstra, former chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, wrote an op-ed published Wednesday in The New York Post calling the latest explanation from the Clinton camp a \"sham.\"\n\n\"The statement ignores how the process works,\" Mr. Hoekstra and former federal prosecutor Victoria Toensing wrote in the joint op-ed. \"The reason government officials with security clearances are required to keep their correspondence on the appropriate government server is so the material can be vetted and classified prior to hitting'send' to an uncleared recipient.\"\n\nIn an interview with The Times, Mr. Hoekstra said that repeating in an email classified information from a report or a secure briefing still violates regulations. He recalled the extraordinary steps the intelligence community took when it gave him top-secret information. He received the data either in a secure room in a House office, at an off-site FBI facility, or on his secure phone.\n\nAsked whether it was possible that Clinton dealt with top-secret material but did not know it, Mr. Hoekstra answered, \"Sure, it's always possible that you will have received information from the intelligence community that they consider top secret and you may not be aware of that. Unlikely, but possible.\"\n\nLast month, the inspectors general for the State Department and the intelligence community flatly contradicted Clinton's claim that her emails did not contain national secrets. They wrote in a public joint statement that the information among thousands of emails on her private server was definitely classified at the time.\n\n\"These emails were not retroactively classified by the State Department,\" the inspectors general wrote. \"Rather, these emails contained classified information when they were generated and, according to IC classification officials, that information remains classified today. This classified information should never have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system.\"\n\nThis week, I. Charles McCullough III, the intelligence community's inspector general, revealed that not only did a small sampling of Clinton's 30,000 emails turned over to State contain classified information, but two held data that were top-secret\u2014the highest classification.\n\nMr. McCullough went further. The top-secret information was labeled \"SI,\" which is intelligence community parlance for \"special intelligence.\" Special intelligence is intercepted communications from foreign targets. In addition, the intercept came from code word \"talent keyhole,\" (TK), which stands for the nation's military satellites and their production of classified imagery and intercepted communications.\n\nAn intelligence spokeswoman said the TK compartmental function \"protects information and activities related to space-based collection of imagery, signals, measurement and signature intelligence, certain products, processing and exploitation techniques, and the design, acquisition, and operation of reconnaissance satellites.\"\n\n\"TOP SECRET/SI/TK\" means her server held some of the nation's most sensitive information. The information could have come from the National Security Agency and most certainly the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, experts said.\n\nMr. Johnson, the former CIA analyst, said revelations about the highly sensitive nature of information in certain emails call into question the entirety of Clinton's story about the private email server she operated out of her home in Chappaqua, New York.\n\n\"She's admitting she lacks the knowledge and intelligence to recognize classified information. That's her defense? That she's stupid?\" he said. \"I think she knew it was classified and used it. They were passing information back and forth.\"\n\nThe SI and TK designations mean that if Clinton's server was hacked, \"there is the possibility of compromising multiple intelligence sources,\" Mr. Johnson said.\n\nBecause Clinton conducted all State Department business on one server at her home, it is assumed that her aides also passed classified information on unsecure systems. This is because a commercial system such as Clinton's cannot communicate with a secure government network set up to handle and protect secrets. Clinton did not use a State.gov account, as is expected of all State Department employees.\n\nIntelligence experts said Clinton's server, which she turned over under pressure to the Justice Department this week after having vowed never to part with it, was susceptible to hacks from adversaries such as China and Russia.\n\nClinton handed over 30,000 printed emails in December after the special House committee investigating the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, pressed the State Department for her emails and discovered they were all on her own server.\n\nWatchdog groups, including Judicial Watch, have filed lawsuits to obtain the emails under the Freedom of Information Act. Prodded by a federal judge, State Department foreign service officers and, more recently, outside intelligence officials, have been sifting through the material to delete government secrets.\n\nThe inspectors general estimate that hundreds of emails will be shown to contain classified information before the tedious process is complete.",
    " Title: South Dakota's Concealed Carry Law May Change with New Governor\n\nArticle:\n\nSupporters of legislation that would allow people to carry concealed handguns without a permit in South Dakota anticipate revived prospects for the bill once GOP Gov.-elect Kristi Noem takes office in January. The legislation languished under retiring Republican Gov. Dennis Daugaard, but Noem, during her campaign, offered support for a so-called constitutional carry law.\n\nState Sen.-elect Lynne DiSanto, who sponsored a permitless concealed carry bill that Daugaard vetoed, said such legislation is likely in the upcoming session and she is optimistic about its prospects. \"There are a lot of Republicans that are very excited to have a conservative governor,\" said DiSanto. \"I think under a new governor it's very likely to pass.\"\n\nCurrently, it's a misdemeanor for someone to carry a concealed pistol or to have one concealed in a vehicle without a permit in South Dakota. As of the end of October, there were nearly 108,000 pistol permits in South Dakota, according to the secretary of state's office.\n\nDaugaard vetoed DiSanto's proposal in 2017 and also rejected a similar measure in 2012; constitutional carry legislation failed during the 2018 session after he issued a veto threat. Bill supporters have argued that getting a concealed pistol permit can be burdensome.\n\nBackers are likely to get a boost from Noem, who defeated Democratic state Sen. Billie Sutton in the Nov. 6 election. Noem, in January, urged passage of a permitless carry bill. At the time, Noem didn't endorse a specific plan, though her campaign said she supported the policy \"in principle.\" Transition team spokeswoman Kristin Wileman said in a statement this week that Noem won't commit to legislation until she can review its text, but said she's a strong 2nd Amendment supporter and thinks provisions like constitutional carry can \"protect and even strengthen this right for South Dakotans.\"\n\n\"The governor-elect will work to find a way that law enforcement and gun-right proponents can come together around a solution,\" Wileman said.\n\nStaci Ackerman, executive director of the South Dakota Sheriffs' Assn., said the group has not discussed 2019 legislation yet. However, she said the organization supported a bill in the 2018 session that allowed permitless carry for state residents with a South Dakota driver's license or identification card; the measure did not advance out of the Senate.\n\nThe 2019 session is scheduled to run from Jan. 8 to March 29. Republicans will control both houses of the Legislature as well as the governorship.",
    " Title: Pelosi Retains House Democratic Leadership Role After Defeating Ryan in Secret Ballot Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a secret ballot vote on Wednesday, Nancy Pelosi successfully defended her position as House Democratic Leader, securing 134 votes to Ohio Representative Tim Ryan's 63. Pelosi, a California Democrat, has held this top position in House Democratic leadership since 2003.\n\nPelosi became the first female Speaker of the House in history when Democrats won control of Congress in 2006. However, since their significant losses in 2010, Pelosi has faced questions about her leadership capabilities in the minority party. After Democrats lost 63 seats in 2010, she faced a challenge from then-North Carolina Representative Heath Shuler, who received 43 votes. Ryan's 63 votes represent the most significant opposition Pelosi has faced.\n\nThe debate over Pelosi's leadership was reflective of the larger debate within the Democratic Party regarding its direction following Hillary Clinton's surprising and disappointing loss to Donald Trump in the presidential race. House Democrats had hoped to gain as many as 15 or 20 seats, but they only flipped six seats in the 2020 elections, a result that was met with disappointment by many Democrats.\n\nTrump's victory came after he won narrow victories in several Rust Belt states, such as Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan, which delivered him the Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency. Many of the seats Democrats were unable to win back were located in more working-class, rural areas of those states. Ryan argued that the party needed someone who understands blue-collar voters and new, younger leadership. The 43-year-old Democrat argued he was better equipped to do that, coming from the manufacturing hub of Youngstown, Ohio.\n\nRyan's home county had flipped to Trump by six points after previously voting for President Obama by 22 points just four years ago. Pelosi responded to this loss in an interview with the Huffington Post, stating, \"He didn't even carry his district for Hillary Clinton.\" However, others saw Ryan's loss as a sign that he could win over working-class voters better than someone from ultra-liberal San Francisco.",
    " Title: Attorney General Barr's Tenure Sparks Controversy, Critics Accused of Double Standards\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General William Barr attended a Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony at the White House on October 8, 2019, in honor of former Attorney General Edwin Meese. The event has sparked controversy, with some criticizing Barr, who is a serious legal figure and one of the adults in the room late in President Trump's first term.\n\nThe criticism has been intense, with over 2,000 former Justice Department employees signing a letter calling on Barr to resign. An article in The Atlantic labeled Barr as \"un-American,\" and warned that his actions could lead to a banana republic where all are subject to the whims of a dictatorial president and his henchmen.\n\nThe criticism stems from Barr's decision to change the sentencing recommendation for Roger Stone, a longtime political associate of President Trump. The original sentencing recommendation called for a sentence of seven to nine years, but Barr recommended a lesser sentence.\n\nHowever, it is unclear why the country would collapse into dictatorship if Stone is sentenced to less than seven years in prison, especially given that the judge has complete discretion to impose whatever sentence she sees fit.\n\nSome critics suspect that Barr was doing Trump's bidding, but the attorney general maintains that he was surprised by the initial, maximalist sentencing recommendation, and he intended to amend it before Trump's comments about the matter.\n\nIf Barr were truly Trump's enforcer, he would have squashed the Stone case rather than merely recommending a little less jail time at the end. Indeed, Barr said in an ABC News interview last week that he considered the Stone case a \"righteous\" prosecution.\n\nBarr allowed the Mueller probe to reach its conclusion unmolested. The extent of his alleged interference was, prior to the release of the report, summarizing its findings in a way that wasn't harsh or detailed enough for Trump's critics.\n\nFurthermore, Barr declined to prosecute former Department of Justice official and frequent Trump target Andrew McCabe for lying to investigators. If Barr is really Trump's Roy Cohn, his personal enforcer masquerading as a top law-enforcement official, nailing McCabe would have been his Job One.\n\nNo, all the evidence suggests that Bill Barr is doing his best to render fair justice in the treacherous environment created by a president of the United States who routinely comments on pending criminal cases and investigations and by the Justice Department's own politically fraught, overly zealous intervention in the 2016 election and its aftermath.\n\nAnti-Barr polemics dwell on the parade of horribles that might come from his tenure at Justice, without pausing to consider that a norm-busting violation of the rules targeting a politically inconvenient individual already occurred - the abusive FISA surveillance of former Trump campaign official Carter Page.\n\nThe supposed institutionalists and civil libertarians who are piling on Barr are more outraged that the attorney general wants to get to the bottom of this abuse - and related 2016 investigatory overreach - than by the abuse itself.\n\nIt's no wonder that Barr has a poorly disguised contempt for his critics, many of whom are so inflamed by their opposition to Trump that they've lost any sense of standards. In a peppery speech to a Federalist Society conference last year that is now one of the counts against him, Barr rightly warned that \"it is the Left that is engaged in a systematic shredding of norms and the undermining of the rule of law.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, they really don't want Trump to have an attorney general, but that's not going to happen. If they force Barr out - or more likely, Trump's continued tweeting pushes him over the edge - they'll miss him when he's gone.",
    " Title: Obama Calls for Increase in Federal Minimum Wage to $9 per Hour by 2015\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Barack Obama called upon Congress to boost the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour by 2015, up from the current rate of $7.25. The wage would rise in steps, and after reaching the maximum in two years, would thereafter be indexed to inflation.\n\nThe president's focus on the minimum wage came as a surprise, even to longtime supporters of a pay increase. In an interview Wednesday morning, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said, \"I agree with the president, but I didn't know he would bring it up.\"\n\nGiven the unexpected nature of the wage push, she said she did not know how Democratic lawmakers might put together their strategy for getting the legislation passed. For many years, it had been Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy who led congressional battles for higher wages, but with his death in August 2009\u2014one month after the last minimum wage hike took effect\u2014supporters will need a new champion in Congress to marshal the troops.\n\nOpponents are already gearing up for the fight. House Speaker John Boehner (R) made it clear he would work against minimum-wage legislation. \"When you raise the price of employment, guess what happens? You get less of it,\" Boehner said. \"At a time when the American people are still asking the question, 'Where are the jobs?' why would we want to make it harder for small employers to hire people?\"\n\nCongress last passed a bill establishing a series of minimum wage increases in 2007\u2014before the Great Recession began. The last of those increases took the pay up to $7.25, where it has remained frozen. Nineteen states plus the District of Columbia have minimum wages above $7.25. For example, in Washington state, the pay is now up to $9.19 an hour\u2014the highest minimum in the country. If the federal level were to rise, many of those 19 states would most likely pass new legislation to exceed it.\n\nIf the past is any indicator, business groups\u2014particularly the National Restaurant Association\u2014will put up a fierce fight to block any federal minimum wage increase. Another group backed by the restaurant and hotel industries says an increase in the minimum wage can hurt the economy. \"The President's minimum wage hike ignores both simple economic logic as well as the overwhelming scholarly consensus on minimum wage hikes,\" Michael Saltsman, research director of the Employment Policies Institute, said in a statement. The institute says research \"points to a loss of job opportunities following a minimum wage hike.\"\n\nHowever, many economists point to studies that show a higher minimum wage does little to hurt job creation. Instead, these economists argue that a higher wage reduces income inequality and puts more money into the hands of consumers who can spend it. So, the argument goes, while a pizza-shop owner might have to spend more on his payroll under new wage legislation, he also would see a boost in revenues as customers find themselves enjoying bigger paydays.\n\nThe minimum wage has been a hot-button issue with business groups since its introduction in 1938. They argue that a federal minimum wage is inflationary and represents an unnecessary government intervention in the labor market. They say labor supply and demand alone should set wages, not lawmakers.\n\nSupporters disagree. They say inflation is very low, while income inequality is growing. Working people lack of spending power, and that's what is inhibiting economic growth, the argument goes.\n\n\"We applaud the president for expressing support for raising the minimum wage and tying it to the cost of living,\" Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, said in a statement on behalf of the labor organization. He said the economy is not suffering from high wages but rather from \"wage stagnation and growing inequality.\"\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, U.S. median income fell 7 percent after adjusting for inflation, according to census data. Over the past year, the unemployment rate has hovered at or just below 8 percent.",
    " Title: Relatives of Aunt Jemima Portrayers Express Concern Over Brand's Rebranding\n\nArticle:\n\nThe relatives of two women who portrayed Aunt Jemima in the 1920s and 1930s have expressed concern over Quaker Oats' decision to rebrand the iconic character, citing the potential erasure of their family history.\n\nLarnell Evans Sr., a great-grandson of Anna Short Harrington, who portrayed Aunt Jemima, told Patch, \"This is an injustice for me and my family. This is part of my history.\" Harrington, discovered at the New York State Fair in 1935, played Aunt Jemima for 25 years.\n\nCritics argue that Aunt Jemima is based on a racial stereotype. Quaker Oats announced the removal of the image on June 17, stating that it was part of an effort \"to make progress toward racial equality.\"\n\nEvans expressed disappointment over the rebranding, stating, \"She worked 25 years doing it. She improved their product... what they're trying to do is ludicrous.\"\n\nThe family of Lillian Richard, who became an ambassador for the brand after being discovered by the company in Dallas, also shares similar concerns. Vera Harris, Richard's great niece, said, \"We just don't want my aunt's legacy\u2014what she did making an honest living at the time\u2014to be wiped away.\"\n\nHarris and her family have spearheaded multiple efforts to honor Richard, including putting signs leading to Hawkins, Texas that read \"Home of Lillian Richard'Aunt Jemima,' \" according to NBC. Harris understands why Quaker Oats made the decision but is proud of her aunt's honest living and wants to honor her legacy.\n\nEvans also shares the sentiment, expressing hurt over the erasure of his great-grandmother's history. \"The racism they talk about, using images from slavery, that comes from the other side\u2014white people. This company profits off images of our slavery. And their answer is to erase my great-grandmother's history. A black female... It hurts,\" he told Patch.\n\nThe family members' concerns highlight the complexities surrounding the rebranding of Aunt Jemima, as they grapple with the potential erasure of their relatives' legacies while acknowledging the racial stereotypes associated with the character.",
    " Title: Senate Conservatives Fund Launches Radio Ad Urging Mitch McConnell to Oppose Funding for Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nA conservative political action committee, the Senate Conservatives Fund, has initiated a radio advertisement challenging Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell to oppose any funding for President Barack Obama's health care law, potentially leading to a government shutdown. The ad will air starting Tuesday in Kentucky, where McConnell is running for a sixth term amidst competition from primary rival, businessman Matt Bevin, and Democratic opponent, Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes.\n\nThe ad, costing nearly $50,000, states, \"Republicans in Congress can stop Obamacare by refusing to fund it, but Senator Mitch McConnell refuses to lead the fight.\" The commercial also references a recent campaign embarrassment for McConnell, referring to a leaked audio of a Jan. 9 telephone conversation in which his campaign manager, Jesse Benton, said he was \"holding my nose\" while working for the candidate. Benton later issued a statement expressing his continued support for McConnell and commitment to his re-election.\n\nThe Senate Conservatives Fund, founded by former South Carolina Republican Senator Jim DeMint, is also spending close to $200,000 on radio ads in six other states, targeting GOP senators to refuse funding for the health care law. The senators in their crosshairs are Richard Burr of North Carolina, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Mississippi's Thad Cochran, and Arizona's Jeff Flake.\n\nThe issue of funding the health care law has caused division within the Republican party, with House and Senate GOP leaders expressing concern over the political impact of a potential government shutdown, while tea party conservatives are determined to undermine the health care law. The federal 2013 fiscal year ends on September 30, and new appropriations must be passed by then to avoid a shutdown of numerous government offices and agencies.\n\nThe radio ad is not the only criticism McConnell is facing. Another conservative group, the Madison Project, launched a radio spot on Monday, labeling McConnell a \"career Washington politician\" who claims to be a conservative. The Madison Project is supporting Bevin's candidacy.\n\nThe Senate Conservatives Fund has not endorsed in the Kentucky GOP primary, but in a July statement, executive director Matt Hoskins expressed openness to backing Bevin. Hoskins stated that McConnell could lose the Senate race and cost the GOP its shot at the Senate majority. The group also mentioned they were \"waiting to see if the grassroots in Kentucky unite\" behind Bevin.",
    " Title: Tillerson Urges Russia to Cooperate on Syria, Suggests Joint Mechanisms for Stability\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday called on Russia to do more to bring peace to Syria and suggested that Moscow and Washington could cooperate on establishing no-fly zones in the war-torn Arab country. In a lengthy statement, Tillerson emphasized that America's top priority in Syria remains defeating the Islamic State terrorist network. The future of the Syrian regime, led by Bashar Assad, who is engaged in a civil war with rebel factions, must be decided through a political settlement, according to Tillerson.\n\nThe statement came just days before President Donald Trump is to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G-20 gathering in Germany. Tillerson appeared to be trying to influence those talks ahead of time, despite deeply troubled U.S.-Russian relations. Tillerson's statement also followed a report that he had told the U.N. chief that Assad's fate was in Russia's hands.\n\n\"The United States is prepared to explore the possibility of establishing with Russia joint mechanisms for ensuring stability, including no-fly zones, on-ground cease-fire observers, and coordinated delivery of humanitarian assistance,\" said Tillerson, who will join Trump at the G-20. \"If our two countries work together to establish stability on the ground, it will lay a foundation for progress on the settlement of Syria's political future.\"\n\nTillerson warned the Syrian regime, which is backed by Iran as well as Russia, against taking advantage of America's limited focus by moving into areas freed from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. \"Actors in Syria must remember that our fight is with ISIS,\" Tillerson said. \"We call upon all parties, including the Syrian government and its allies, Syrian opposition forces, and Coalition forces carrying out the battle to defeat ISIS, to avoid conflict with one another and adhere to agreed geographical boundaries for military de-confliction and protocols for de-escalation.\"\n\nHe added, \"The United States believes Russia, as a guarantor of the Assad regime and an early entrant into the Syrian conflict, has a responsibility to ensure that the needs of the Syrian people are met and that no faction in Syria illegitimately retakes or occupies areas liberated from ISIS' or other terrorist groups' control.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has grappled with a strategy on how to deal with Syria once the Islamic State is pushed out of its territory there. America's successful military campaign against the terrorist group, which involves partnering with local forces, has suddenly given new space to Assad's forces and those of Iran and Russia to operate. This has led to clashes with the United States; in one case, the U.S. shot down a Syrian government aircraft.\n\nTrump's meeting with Putin is expected to cover a range of issues beyond Syria, including Moscow's designs on Ukraine. It is not yet clear whether Trump will raise another sensitive issue: U.S. intelligence agencies' suspicions that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump win. The U.S. president has in the past downplayed those allegations.",
    " Title: Post-Debate Reactions: Clinton and Trump Take Different Tones After First 2016 Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the first 2016 presidential debate, both Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump expressed contrasting sentiments. The debate, held at Hofstra University, was one of the most anticipated political events in modern history.\n\nClinton and her team appeared to be in high spirits following the debate. Clinton, her staff, and aides showed signs of a victorious campaign. Clinton, before departing for a campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, expressed her enthusiasm for the next debate and future debates.\n\n\"One of my favorite baseball players growing up, Ernie Banks, used to get so excited about going to play that he would say, 'Let's play two,'\" Clinton said. \"So I am looking forward to the next debate and the one after that.\"\n\nTrump, on the other hand, did not seem to share the same optimism. In a call to Fox News' \"Fox & Friends\" early Tuesday, Trump expressed several complaints about the debate. Trump's initial praise for the debate moderator, NBC News' Lester Holt, had changed, as he criticized Holt for not asking Clinton questions about her emails, scandals, and the Benghazi incident.\n\nTrump also expressed dissatisfaction with his microphone during the debate, a complaint he repeated in his interview with Fox News. \"My microphone was terrible,\" Trump said. \"I wonder: was it set up that way on purpose?\"\n\nIn addition, Trump made controversial comments about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who has alleged that Trump's disparaging treatment of her led to eating disorders and depression. Trump's comments about Machado's physical appearance drew criticism and could potentially harm his standing with women voters and the perception that he lacks the temperament to be president.\n\nMachado responded to Trump's comments in a press call Tuesday afternoon, expressing her support for Clinton and describing the election as a \"really bad dream.\"\n\nClinton continued to make jabs at Trump's debate performance during her Raleigh campaign event, stating that it was \"very clear that he did not prepare.\" Clinton also criticized Trump's comments about Machado, stating, \"What we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent. It's unclear exactly what he is saying, but words matter.\"\n\nRetired 68-year-old Marguerite Scott, a woman from Cary, North Carolina, who attended the Raleigh campaign event, was critical of Trump's behavior during the debate and his comments about Machado. \"Men in general should stop objectifying women,\" Scott said. \"If she is fat, that is her business. And to put her on blast like that shows what a misogynist person he is.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Death Toll from COVID-19 Surpasses 18,600 as Experts Urge Americans to Observe Easter Holidays at Home\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has surpassed 18,600 deaths from COVID-19, the highly contagious lung ailment caused by the novel coronavirus. The U.S. accounts for most of the world's confirmed cases, with at least 500,000 known infections.\n\nPolitical leaders and health experts have urged Americans celebrating Good Friday and the Easter weekend to avoid church gatherings and observe the holidays at home. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, and other health officials have pointed to declining rates of coronavirus hospitalizations and admissions to intensive care units as signs that social distancing measures are paying off.\n\nThe Trump administration has renewed talk of quickly reopening the economy after an influential university research model this week lowered its U.S. mortality forecasts to 60,000 deaths by Aug. 4, from at least 100,000, assuming that social-distancing measures remain in place. However, separate forecasts from the U.S. departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services project the death toll could reach 200,000 if stay-at-home orders are lifted after 30 days.\n\nPrisons and jails, along with nursing homes and other institutions with large populations confined in close quarters, have proven especially vulnerable to outbreaks. Hundreds of infections and several deaths have been reported among inmates in Illinois, New York, and Louisiana. On Friday, officials reported 68 residents and two staff members at a San Francisco homeless shelter had tested positive, marking one of the largest known clusters of coronavirus infections yet in such a facility.\n\nThe outbreak seems at odds with promising data presented by California Governor Gavin Newsom showing that social distancing has worked so far to flatten the arc of infections in his state. New York state, the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic with some 7,800 deaths to date, has seen glimmers of hope this week. After three days of record daily deaths, New York state's COVID-19 toll from April 9 stood at 777, down from 799 deaths a day earlier, Governor Andrew Cuomo reported on Friday. New York's ICU admissions declined \"for the first time since we started this journey,\" he said.\n\nIn Michigan, more than 200 people died from COVID-19 in the last day. \"We are not out of the woods yet,\" Governor Gretchen Whitmer said. At his daily White House briefing, President Donald Trump said he was receiving fewer calls from governors urgently seeking equipment and help.\n\nWith more than 90% of the country under stay-at-home orders, the holiest weekend on the Christian calendar began with services livestreamed or broadcast to congregants watching from home. Many churches sat empty on Good Friday, when they would typically be overflowing with worshipers. \"We gather normally at Easter to worship. We gather for children's Easter egg hunts, for family meals, with friends. We can't do any of that this year,\" said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy lamented to reporters.\n\nAs millions of Americans face missed paychecks, some turned to food banks for assistance. In Los Angeles, some 5,000 families waited at the Forum arena to pick up food in a Good Friday donation drive. \"This is slated to be our biggest distribution to date,\" said Michael Flood, head of the LA Regional Food Bank. \"It's continuing to demonstrate just how many families and individuals the current economic conditions have hit.\"\n\nAt the other end of the food supply chain, a beef production plant in Greeley, Colorado, owned by meatpacking company JBS USA said it would spend more than $1 million for coronavirus testing kits to screen its workers after 36 employees became infected. Two employees have died of COVID-19, according to the union representing workers at the plant. The company said it was shutting down over the holiday weekend to \"further enhance previously announced deep cleaning efforts at the facility.\"\n\nNew York plans to open coronavirus testing sites in five minority neighborhoods to improve testing in a population that has been hit disproportionately hard. Several U.S. states have reported COVID-19 deaths among blacks and Hispanics far higher than their portion of the population. African Americans comprise 70% of Louisiana's coronavirus deaths but only a third of its population, said Governor John Bel Edwards, whose state has reported 755 deaths.",
    " Title: Trump Urges FDA to Expedite Approval of Gilead's Remdesivir as Coronavirus Treatment\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed a desire for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to expedite the approval of Gilead Sciences' antiviral drug remdesivir as a treatment for the coronavirus. During a roundtable at the White House with business executives on Wednesday evening, Trump stated, \"We would like to see very quick approvals, especially with things that work.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, the FDA announced that it has been in \"sustained and ongoing\" discussions with Gilead to make remdesivir available to Covid-19 patients \"as quickly as possible, as appropriate.\"\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the White House health advisor, reported \"quite good news\" from a coronavirus drug trial testing Gilead's drug, setting a new standard of care for Covid-19 patients. Speaking to reporters from the White House, Fauci said data from the trial showed a \"clear-cut positive effect in diminishing time to recover.\"\n\nTrump has previously touted Gilead's remdesivir as a potential treatment for the virus, which has infected over 3.1 million people worldwide, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. While multiple studies are testing the drug to determine its effectiveness in stopping the coronavirus from replicating, it is not yet a proven treatment.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Trump called the disclosed results from Fauci a \"very big thing\" and a \"building block\" in the fight against the virus. \"I want them to go as quickly as they can,\" he said. \"Stephen Hahn has been incredible at the FDA. He's getting things done at record time. There's never been anything like it.

He also noted that the mortality benefit of remdesivir \"has not yet reached statistical significance.\"\n\nThe results suggested a survival benefit, with a mortality rate of 8% for the group receiving remdesivir versus 11.6% for the placebo group, according to a statement from the National Institutes of Health released Wednesday. \"This will be the standard of care,\" added Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \"When you know a drug works, you have to let people in the placebo group know so they can take it.\"\n\n\"What it has proven is a drug can block this virus,\" he said.",
    " Title: Editorial Boards of The New York Times and Washington Post Criticize Donald Trump Ahead of First Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe editorial boards of The New York Times and The Washington Post have issued strong criticisms of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the lead-up to the first presidential debate, scheduled for Monday night at Hofstra University in New York.\n\nThe New York Times, following its endorsement of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over the weekend, published a new editorial titled \"Why He Should Not Be President.\" The 1,400-word essay aims to debunk Trump's self-proclaimed leadership qualities, describing him as a self-centered individual who prioritizes his own interests over the nation's well-being.\n\nThe Times' editorial states, \"Voters attracted by the force of the Trump personality should pause and take note of the precise qualities he exudes as an audaciously different politician: bluster, savage mockery of those who challenge him, degrading comments about women, mendacity, crude generalizations about nations and religions.\"\n\nThe Washington Post, in its editorial, asserts that the stakes are high, but Trump has \"amply demonstrated his unworthiness\" to be president. The editorial board writes, \"It's beyond his capacity in the upcoming 90-minute question-and-answer sessions to reverse or even substantially modify that conclusion.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign has dismissed the views of The New York Times' editorial board. In response to the newspaper's Clinton endorsement over the weekend, Trump spokesman Jason Miller issued a statement saying, \"The news that the ultra-liberal, elitist, out-of-touch New York Times Editorial Board endorsed an ultra-liberal, elitist, out-of-touch candidate in Hillary Clinton has to be some of the least surprising news ever. The New York Times' Editorial Board is the embodiment of the rigged system Donald Trump is running against.\"\n\nThe statement was titled, \"The Sun Also Rose In The East This Morning.\" The first presidential debate is set to take place on Monday, September 26, 2016. The latest polls show a close race between Trump and Clinton, with Clinton edging Trump among likely voters in a Quinnipiac University national poll released Monday morning.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Refuses to Halt Texas Abortion Law Implementation, Divides on Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to halt the implementation of a contentious Texas abortion law, with four justices dissenting. The law requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic.\n\nThe federal appeals court had previously reinstated the key part of the law, which is considered one of the most restrictive in the country. Abortion-rights groups, claiming more than a third of Texas clinics providing abortions have since ceased operations, then asked the Supreme Court to overturn the appeals court ruling.\n\nIn his statement supporting Tuesday's order, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, \"Reasonable minds can perhaps disagree about whether the Court of Appeals should have granted a stay in this case. But there is no doubt that the applicants have not carried their heavy burden of showing that doing so was a clear violation of accepted legal standards.\"\n\nFour justices - Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan - dissented. The original lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Austin by Planned Parenthood on behalf of more than a dozen women's health care providers across Texas, alleged the state's new abortion law violates the constitutional rights of women and imposes unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions.\n\nThe bill initially failed to gain approval due to a Democratic filibuster led by state Sen. Wendy Davis. Gov. Rick Perry then called the Legislature into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill.\n\nIn a statement, Sen. Wendy Davis stated, \"Clinics will close and women's health will be hurt because of this law. This is an abuse of power by politicians in Austin. I trust women to make their own decisions and will continue to work to make sure that women and mothers are safe and have access to adequate health care.\"\n\nGov. Perry responded, \"This is good news both for the unborn and for the women of Texas, who are now better protected from shoddy abortion providers operating in dangerous conditions. As always, Texas will continue doing everything we can to protect the culture of life in our state.\"",
    " Title: Republican Party's 2016 Presidential Primary Rules and Outreach Efforts Discussed at Winter Meetings\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican Party leaders convened in Washington this week for their annual winter meetings, where they approved new rules for the 2016 presidential primaries aimed at creating a more orderly path to the GOP nomination and, subsequently, the White House. The meetings also served as an opportunity to assess the party's progress in reaching out to new voters, particularly young people, minorities, and women.\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, a conservative African-American businessman, was one of the high-profile speakers at Friday's luncheon. Scott emphasized the importance of embracing new voters and maximizing their potential. He stated, \"We are going to have to embrace people in a way that they deserve to be embraced... When we win people, elections will take care of themselves.\"\n\nHowever, the three-day Republican National Committee (RNC) meetings showed some inconsistency in reaching out to new voters. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, in a speech, discussed ending divisiveness within the party, which some refer to as a civil war between the Tea Party and establishment Republicans. Huckabee's comments on women's issues, though, stirred controversy. He said, \"If the Democrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe that they are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control... then so be it.\"\n\nRNC Chairman Reince Priebus reacted cautiously to Huckabee's comments, stating, \"I don't know what he was talking about... What I can tell you is that I think he was trying to make the comment that government can't be involved in every part of everyone's life.\"\n\nLouisiana's Republican Party Chairman Roger Villere acknowledged progress in the party's rebranding efforts but denied that Republicans have a problem with women or minorities. He said, \"We don't have a problem with minorities... Maybe we have a problem articulating our positions. I think we have to show minorities that we feel like they can do better being part of the Republican Party.\"\n\nLooking ahead to 2016, the party aims to shorten the presidential primary season, with the primary likely beginning in February and wrapping up as early as May. RNC Chairman Priebus explained that the last primary cycle, which included numerous GOP debates, was damaging to the nominee and the party. \"We don't want a six-month slice-and-dice festival in our party,\" he said. \"It's not good for picking a president. It's not good for our party.\"\n\nThere was also discussion at this Republican gathering about the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, though she was sometimes referred to as \"she who must not be named.\"",
    " Title: Schengen Border Controls Remain Likely Despite EU Refugee Crisis, Experts Say\n\nArticle:\n\nWith the European Union's failure to enforce a mandatory quota for refugees, concerns have been raised about the future of borderless travel, a key achievement of the continent. However, experts suggest that the Schengen Agreement, which allows for seamless movement within the 26-nation Schengen zone, is likely to remain in effect for the foreseeable future.\n\nGermany's decision to temporarily impose border checks on its frontier with Austria was prompted by the record influx of asylum seekers arriving at Munich's central train station. Thirteen thousand arrived on Saturday alone. The move was also seen as a tactical measure to pressure resistant EU members, mostly in the east, to accept their responsibility in providing refuge to those fleeing war.\n\nThe response from Austria, Slovakia, and the Netherlands has been to announce plans to patrol their own borders. With no robust EU plan in place for the record number of refugees entering the bloc, other countries are considering whether they need to impose emergency controls as well.\n\nSome have suggested that the \"death\" of Schengen, signed in 1985 and in operation for 20 years, is near. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's chief of staff tweeted on Sunday, \"Schengen will be in danger if EU member states do not work together swiftly and with solidarity on managing the refugee crisis.\"\n\nHowever, several reasons suggest that Schengen is likely to withstand the pressure, at least for now. The controls being implemented today, though unprecedented in scale, were envisioned when the zone was formed. If members see \"a serious threat to public policy or international security,\" they can put up controls temporarily.\n\nSuch temporary measures are not likely to impact the majority of travelers, as borders are not actually closed down. Rather, there are spot checks at certain crossings, though this may imply a certain degree of racial profiling, as they are seeking to control those fleeing war or poverty in Africa and the Middle East. Measures of this type are not allowed to last more than 30 days without justification and under Schengen, they can not become routine.\n\nAndr\u00e1s R\u00e1cz, senior research fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, states, \"I don't think Germany would have collapsed under the pressure of asylum seekers. They are not overburdening Germany as a whole.\" Many do not see Schengen as the problem, but rather view it as a symptom and a scapegoat. The system seen in greater need of repair is the so-called \"Dublin regulation,\" a policy that mandates asylum seekers to register in the first EU country they enter.\n\nThe question of European jihadis, who can travel freely within the Schengen zone, has fueled concerns about the risks associated with borderless travel. However, in many cases, getting rid of Schengen does not solve the core problems. Terrorism is a threat to countries inside and outside the Schengen zone, including Britain. While passport checks are eliminated under Schengen, national police forces can still check travelers.\n\nRevoking Schengen would require setting up passport controls, staff, and equipment, a cost that most nations would not be willing to assume. Costs to businesses, with trucks waiting in lines at borders, would also be exorbitant. Nor would many people, accustomed to traveling abroad without passports or the hassles of passport checks, willingly let go of such perks.\n\nHeavy flows of asylum seekers are not going to dissipate. This summer has set records, and while winter will reduce the numbers temporarily, the migration trail will likely fill up again in the spring due to the intractable conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere. James Davis, director of the Institute of Political Science at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, argues that Europe needs both a common policy on refugees and a plan to stop the flow of economic migrants. Otherwise, controls will continue to be imposed, and Europeans, despite themselves, might just get used to them.\n\n\"If we don't get a European common approach to these questions by end of next year, Schengen is dead,\" Davis concludes.",
    " Title: Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney Criticizes Concept of Religious Liberty as a \"Pretext for Discrimination\"\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic Representative Sean Patrick Maloney (N.Y.) has labeled religious liberty as a \"bogus term\" used as a \"pretext for discrimination\" during a recent interview on MSNBC. The congressman, who is the first openly gay representative for New York state, made these comments in celebration of the Supreme Court's recent decision to expand workplace civil rights protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nIn the Bostock v. Clayton County case, Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch sided with the liberal justices and authored the majority opinion. Despite this, Maloney criticized Gorsuch and the concept of religious liberty enshrined in the Constitution.\n\n\"We know that Neil Gorsuch is a supporter of so-called religious liberty, which is a bogus term \u2014 it is actually some sort of pretext for discrimination hiding behind the guise of religion,\" Maloney stated. \"So, I'm still on the lookout for that from the author of this opinion.\"\n\nThe video of Maloney's comments can be found at the 4:30 mark in the linked video below.\n\nMaloney made similar remarks during a congressional hearing earlier this year, focusing on the Trump administration's alleged use of religious liberty to \"assault\" the rights of LGBTQ Americans. During the hearing, Maloney argued that religious liberty has been \"distorted and twisted into a weapon to enable discrimination,\" particularly in reference to rules allowing faith-based adoption agencies to deny child placement into LGBTQ homes.\n\nAs a father of three children with his husband, Maloney sponsors a bill that aims to prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ families by adoption and foster care agencies. In the past, he has argued that allowing agencies to exclude LGBTQ couples under the guise of religious liberty is to \"sanction discrimination.\"",
    " Title: Top Democratic Presidential Candidates Show Strong Fundraising Performance in Q1 Reports\n\nArticle:\n\nSenators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg demonstrated strong fundraising performances in the first quarter of 2019, according to federal reports filed on Monday. The reports indicate that these candidates' operations can sustain a presidential campaign.\n\nMayor Buttigieg, who raised an impressive $7 million in contributions, collected cash 10 times faster than his campaign spent it. He started the second quarter with $6 million in the bank. Lis Smith, Buttigieg's campaign spokeswoman, tweeted, \"That is a remarkably low burn rate and indicative of how we are running a 21st-century campaign, doing more with less.\"\n\nNone of the top-performing Democrats raised as much money as President Trump's $30 million haul in the first quarter. However, they showed potential to compete against the Trump campaign, which was pulling in $4 for every $1 it spent.\n\nAfter collecting $12 million in contributions, the Harris campaign reported spending $4.2 million on operating expenses. With additional cash transferred from her Senate campaign committee, Ms. Harris ended the quarter with $8.9 million in the bank.\n\nSenator Sanders raised money nearly four times faster than his campaign was spending it. He collected $18 million and ended the quarter with a more than $15.6 million war chest.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts raised $6 million in the first three months of 2019 and spent it just as fast. Her campaign doled out about $5.2 million, according to the federal filing. She had $11 million in the bank thanks to $10 million transferred from her Senate campaign committee.\n\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand, who has struggled at 1 percent or less in the polls, also spent money as fast as her campaign could raise it. With just under $3 million in contributions, the Gillibrand campaign spent $2.4 million. Though her campaign reported no debts, the bulk of Ms. Gillibrand's funds\u2014$9.6 million\u2014were transferred from her Senate campaign.\n\nMillionaire and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney also spent as much as he raised. His campaign is buoyed by an $11 million of his own money. By comparison, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro collected contributions twice as fast as he spent the money but took in just $1.1 million.\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee raised more than $2 million in the month since announcing his presidential run and spent less than half\u2014$843,000\u2014to launch his run. His seven-figure total and low burn rate provided a bright spot for Mr. Inslee, who is running on an agenda singularly focused on climate change and barely registers in the polls.\n\n\"This first-month fundraising shows strong grassroots momentum for Gov. Inslee's message of defeating climate change,\" said Inslee campaign manager Aisling Kerins.\n\nAaron Scherb, director of legislative affairs for Common Cause, noted that high burn rates are common in first-quarter reports because candidates have start-up costs, including the expense of setting up national fundraising operations. He added that candidates with lower burn rates, like Mr. Sanders and Ms. Harris, likely have efficient fundraising at this point in the campaign.\n\nThe candidates are heavily dependent on online fundraising through ActBlue, a portal that allows donors to funnel their contributions. Ms. Harris reported 14,000 itemized contributions through ActBlue, totaling $9.2 million. Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, recorded $17.1 million across more than 26,600 donations facilitated by ActBlue.",
    " Title: Trump's Media Strategy and the Role of the Media in His Candidacy\n\nArticle:\n\nDonald Trump's blend of bombast, amorality, and media savvy has propelled him to the Republican nomination. His ability to dominate media coverage and dictate the narrative has proven sufficient in today's political climate.\n\nTrump's career, marked by self-promotion, has been a preparation for this moment, this campaign. He recognized the broken, perverted political process and exploited it with skill. While the Republican Party is responsible for Trump's candidacy, the media shares equal culpability for the calamity that is his campaign.\n\nThe media has failed in its role as a check on power and a gadfly for crooked politicians and abusers of power. Les Moonves, the CEO and executive chairman of CBS, admitted, \"It [Trump's campaign] may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS... Sorry. It's a terrible thing to say. But, bring it on, Donald. Keep going.\"\n\nTrump has \"cracked the campaign reporters' code,\" according to Columbia journalism professor Todd Gitlin. He regularly outmaneuvers interviewers by offering noncommittal soundbites and incoherent responses until he hears the phrase, \"let's move on.\"\n\nExamples of this abound, with Trump evading questions he cannot answer or when reporters suggest he's wrong or lied about the record. \"Trump is a master of darting from slogan to slogan,\" Gitlin writes. \"That's why interviewers must do their homework and be prepared to go at least 2-3 questions deep on any issue.\"\n\nHowever, the limited time between competing advertisements during broadcasts makes it difficult to dive deep into serious questions. Trump takes advantage of the superficial techniques journalism has made routine, while the truth often becomes an afterthought in the sordid circus that is the election.\n\nGitlin urges journalists to \"honor the good name of their profession and take off the kid gloves.\" Yet, the media's complicity in Trump's campaign suggests a reluctance to do so. The media's role in the 2016 election remains a contentious issue, with critics arguing that the media's obsession with ratings and sensationalism has allowed Trump to dominate the narrative, often without scrutiny or accountability.",
    " Title: Trump's Immigration Policy and the DNC Speech by Khizr Khan\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on Thursday, Khizr Khan, the father of Captain Humayun Khan, a U.S. Army captain who was killed in action in Iraq, criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's proposed immigration policy. Khan's speech drew attention to Trump's plan to temporarily halt immigration from Muslim countries known to support terrorism or harbor terrorist groups.\n\nKhan, a Pakistani-American, and his wife, Ghazala Khan, spoke about their son's sacrifice and their family's adoption of American values. Captain Khan, who was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart, is remembered as a hero by his family and fellow soldiers.\n\nTrump responded to Khan's speech by defending his immigration policy, stating that it is a pragmatic and constitutional measure to protect the United States from the threat of radical Islam. Trump argues that it is impossible to vet large numbers of refugees and immigrants from war-torn Muslim countries, citing the ongoing refugee crisis in Europe as an example of the dangers of uncontrolled immigration.\n\nKhan's speech and Trump's response have sparked a heated debate about immigration, national security, and the role of Muslims in America. Trump's critics argue that his policy is discriminatory and unconstitutional, while supporters argue that it is necessary to protect the country from terrorism.\n\nIt is important to note that the article does not express a personal opinion or take a political stance on the issue.

    " Title: Julian Assange Extradition: Facts and Context\n\nArticle:\n\nJulian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, was removed from the Ecuadorian embassy in London on Thursday, ending his seven-year refuge. The extradition of Assange to the United States, where he faces charges related to the publication of classified military and diplomatic files, has been a subject of controversy.\n\nThe indictment against Assange stems from the release of secret military and diplomatic files provided by Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. Army intelligence analyst, in 2010. The files exposed alleged U.S. abuses and shed light on corrupt and repressive governments worldwide.\n\nInitially, two obstacles delayed the U.S. pursuit of Assange. The first was Ecuador's decision to grant him asylum, which has since been rescinded due to a change in government. The second was the Obama administration's concern that pursuing Assange for publishing the files would set a dangerous precedent, potentially jeopardizing press freedoms protected by the First Amendment.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration has taken a different stance. As a candidate, Trump expressed support for WikiLeaks when it published emails stolen by Russian state hackers from the Democratic National Committee. However, six months later, the CIA's then-director, Mike Pompeo, labeled WikiLeaks a \"hostile intelligence service,\" and the U.S. described arresting Assange as a priority.\n\nThe U.S. authorities are charging Assange with conspiracy to access a computer, rather than for the publication of the material obtained. This distinction is significant, as the high court last year ruled against the extradition of Lauri Love, accused of hacking U.S. government websites, in a judgment that set a precedent for trying hacking suspects in the UK. The U.S. may also add further charges to the indictment.\n\nAssange now faces up to a year in prison for bail jumping. He sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced allegations of rape and molestation (which he denies). It is appropriate for Swedish prosecutors to reopen their investigation, as a lawyer representing one of his accusers has requested.\n\nHowever, the dangers of agreeing to Assange's extradition to the U.S. remain a matter of concern for many, given the broad interpretation that the conspiracy charge could potentially be applied, particularly under the current administration's hostility towards a free and independent press.",
    " Title: Republican Donors and Strategists Grapple with Trump's Appeal and the Challenges of Countering His Influence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an effort to understand the appeal of Donald Trump among conservative Republican voters, Mr. McIntosh, a political strategist, has been investigating the issue. He stated, \"A wonkish explanation that trade is actually good for the country probably won't assuage them.\"\n\nIn interviews, several knowledgeable and typically confident Republican donors and strategists have expressed concern about how to counter Trump's influence, growing increasingly worried about the sentiments he has stirred among the activist base and uneasy about the potential repercussions for the party.\n\nAndy Sabin, a supporter of Jeb Bush from New York, mentioned that the question of what to do about Trump has been a recurring topic on the Hamptons fund-raising circuit this summer, as what seemed like a summer romance by disenchanted conservatives evolved into a full-blown insurgency.\n\n\"He's been a topic, and he obviously disgusts a lot of people because he's been vile,\" said Mr. Sabin, who is also a donor to American Crossroads, the party's leading super PAC. \"But he's also been able to bring out what people feel about their government.\"\n\nThe cost of an anti-Trump campaign would be substantial. Reshaping opinions about Trump, a candidate with universal name recognition and a knack for garnering free airtime and column inches, could cost as much as $20 million. A sustained campaign aimed at Fox News viewers could cost $2 million per week, one Republican consultant working for a rival candidate estimated, while a more targeted effort, aimed at Iowa caucus-goers later this fall, would require as much as $10 million.\n\nHowever, there is no guarantee of success. A group identified with the Republican establishment would risk engaging in a war with Trump, while a new group\u2014such as a political nonprofit to which other donors and organizations could secretly funnel cash\u2014would align with Trump's comments about lobbyists and corporations scheming to prop up his rivals. Trump has also begun to preview such attacks.",
    " Title: Former DOJ Officials Call for Resignation of Attorney General Barr Over Stone Case Intervention\n\nArticle:\n\nMore than 1,100 former prosecutors and officials at the Department of Justice (DOJ) have called for the resignation of Attorney General Bill Barr following his intervention in the case of Roger Stone, a longtime friend and adviser to President Donald Trump. In an open letter, the former DOJ employees expressed outrage at Barr's intervention after Trump tweeted his disapproval of the nine-year sentence recommended by prosecutors in the case where Stone had been convicted of seven felonies.\n\nThe letter, signed by former Justice Department employees from both Democratic and Republican administrations, stated that Barr's actions in doing the President's \"personal bidding\" and the damage they have done to the Department of Justice's reputation for integrity and the rule of law, require Barr to resign.\n\nThe former Justice Department employees argued that Trump's tweet and Barr's subsequent intervention were counter to the established procedural norms of the DOJ. They explained that the Department has a long-standing practice in which political appointees set broad policies that line prosecutors apply to individual cases. This practice exists to animate the constitutional principles regarding the even-handed application of the law.\n\nThe officials noted that while there are times when political leadership appropriately weighs in on individual prosecutions, it is unheard of for the Department's top leaders to overrule line prosecutors, who are following established policies, in order to give preferential treatment to a close associate of the President, as Attorney General Barr did in the Stone case.\n\nThe officials offered their support for the four prosecutors who resigned from the case. Since they considered Barr's resignation unlikely, the signatories suggested alternative means of expressing dissent and resisting inappropriate influence from the Trump White House. They called on every DOJ employee to follow their heroic example and be prepared to report future abuses to the Inspector General, the Office of Professional Responsibility, and Congress; to refuse to carry out directives that are inconsistent with their oaths of office; to withdraw from cases that involve such directives or other misconduct; and, if necessary, to resign and report publicly\u2014in a manner consistent with professional ethics\u2014to the American people the reasons for their resignation.",

Amy Kremer, leader of the Tea Party Express, stated, \"As far as the tea party is concerned, we are still here. We may not be out on the streets with the colorful signs like 2010, but we are here, we are engaged and we are going to continue to fight.\"\n\nJudson Phillips, head of Tea Party Nation, expressed the movement's first order of business as rebutting those who seek to blame the movement for the Republican Party's poor performance at the ballot box. He specifically targeted Karl Rove, the mastermind behind former President George W. Bush's career and founder of American Crossroads, a super PAC that spent over $100 million in the campaign but had few successes to show for it.\n\nKeli Carender, national coordinator for the Tea Party Patriots, also expressed her belief that Republicans were trying to blame the tea party. She stated, \"We tried the last four years to go from the top and working with Congress, but I think we have not been as successful as we like. It is an impermeable steel bubble. We are really, really realizing that in order to have an impact, it is going to have to come from the ground up\u2014from the cities, the counties, and the states.\"\n\nThe tea party made a significant impact in the 2010 midterm elections, knocking off veteran Republican lawmakers in primaries and sending a new class of fiscal conservatives to Capitol Hill. However, the movement also pushed some candidates who lost seats that some political observers felt Republicans would have won had they put forward better candidates.\n\nThe election this year proved to be a mixed bag for candidates supported by the tea party. While Rep. Michele Bachmann won another term in office and voters pushed Sen.-elect Ted Cruz to victory in Texas, high-profile flops in conservative states carried by presidential candidate Mitt Romney included Richard Mourdock's loss in Indiana after his controversial comments about rape and the loss of Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri after Rep. Todd Akin's comments about \"legitimate rape.\"\n\nIn the lower chamber, tea party casualties included Reps. Joe Walsh of Illinois and Nan A.S. Hayworth of New York. Things got worse this week when Rep. Allen B. West, Florida Republican, conceded that he lost his bid for re-election to his Democratic challenger, Patrick Murphy.\n\nConservative columnist Michael Barone stated, \"The tea party brings some talented people into politics\u2014think of Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson for example\u2014but it also brings some wackos and weirdos and witches, and we put too many of them on the ticket.\"\n\nIn the coming weeks, Mr. Phillips stated the primary job of the tea party is to ensure that House Republicans do not surrender during negotiations to avert the \"fiscal cliff.\" He emphasized, \"The problems we have with the deficit are not problems that result from a revenue shortage, but spending in excess. So we have to change the narrative and we have to get the Republicans on Capitol Hill to stand firm against not only new tax increases, which will destroy the economy, but also to cut spending.\"",
    " Title: Obama and Romney Debate Analysis: Obama Faces Criticism for Debate Performance, Romney Gains Momentum\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the first presidential debate of the 2012 election, President Barack Obama faced criticism from both Democrats and Republicans for his performance, while Mitt Romney was praised for his approach. The debate, held on October 3, was widely criticized by Democrats for Obama's perceived lack of aggression and failure to address certain key issues.\n\nAccording to David Axelrod, a senior advisor to the Obama campaign, the president's team was disappointed with his performance, particularly his decision not to bring up some of the campaign's favorite attack lines. Axelrod stated, \"We can't allow someone to stand there and manhandle the truth.\"\n\nRomney, on the other hand, was praised for softening his rhetoric and promising not to touch Medicare benefits for older Americans. He also attempted to paint President Obama as a protector of big banks due to the post-financial-crisis government bailout of the banking industry.\n\nDemocrats expressed disappointment that Obama did not bring up several issues they considered favorable to him, such as women's rights, Romney's taxes, his comments about the \"47 percent\" of Americans, and the record of his former firm, Bain Capital. Some Democrats also criticized Obama for not challenging Romney on what they considered untrue assertions.\n\nIn response, the Obama campaign produced a new television ad for seven swing states, highlighting what they claimed were inaccuracies in Romney's tax plan. The ad asks, \"If we can't trust him here, how could we ever trust him here?\"\n\nRomney's campaign countered with their own assertions of Obama's misleading statements during the debate. At a morning rally on Thursday, Obama seemed more energetic and mockingly referred to Romney's promise to cut funding for the Public Broadcasting System, including its signature children's character, Big Bird.\n\nThe debate performance has left Obama's advisers scrambling to make \"adjustments\" for the next debate on October 16. Whether the debate will significantly change the dynamics of the campaign remains to be seen, as Obama still has a lead in advertising in critical states. The next big moment on the campaign schedule is the vice presidential debate between Vice President Joe Biden and Paul D. Ryan, Romney's running mate, on October 11. With 33 days left in the campaign, Obama now finds himself entering the final month trying to regain his footing and get off the defensive.",

This is evident in the significant amount of campaign spending by various political committees and parties at top hotels and restaurants on and near The Strip.\n\nAccording to a POLITICO analysis of Federal Election Commission data, politicians, political committees, and parties have spent over $330,000 this election cycle at these locations. Notable out-of-state spenders include Reps. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, Aaron Schock of Illinois, and former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal, a Republican in a tight reelection race against Jimmy Carter's grandson, recently visited Las Vegas for a 48-hour trip that included a closed-door speech to a group of GOP lawyers and a secret meeting with billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson. However, Deal initially denied plans to meet with Adelson, only to later admit he would welcome such an opportunity.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also visited Las Vegas for a closed-door high-dollar fundraiser for Nevada Rep. Steve Horsford and congressional candidate Erin Bilbray at the Wolfgang Puck restaurant Spago in the Caesars Palace complex. Meanwhile, Pelosi's primary opponent, Cresent Hardy, held a fundraiser at a local watering hole in Sparks, Nevada.\n\nIn three weeks, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is hosting his seventh annual Clean Energy Summit, where former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will deliver the keynote. The event, and Nevada in general, has been leveraged by Reid's political influence to attract Democrats.

    " Title: NRA Launches Ad Campaign to Oppose Gun Control Proposals as Biden Advocates for Reforms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to counteract the gun control proposals put forth by Vice President Joe Biden, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has launched a new ad campaign across five key states, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Maine, North Carolina, and West Virginia. The ad, titled \"Will Obama's gun control proposals work? His own experts say 'No,'\" questions the effectiveness of certain gun control measures, such as restricting large capacity magazines, universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, and gun buyback programs.\n\nThe ad campaign is focused on these states due to the presence of several Democratic senators expected to face tough re-election fights, including Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, and Kay Hagan of North Carolina. The campaign also targets West Virginia, where Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller is retiring, and Maine, where moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins is up for re-election next year.\n\nThe NRA is investing approximately $350,000 in this campaign, which includes local newspaper ads, regional ads, and online commercials. The ads encourage readers to call their senator and oppose Obama's gun control proposals.\n\nThe NRA's new ads reference a January internal Justice Department memo, titled \"Summary of Select Firearm Violence Prevention Strategies,\" which examines the effectiveness of various gun control measures. The memo, written by the deputy director of the Justice Department's research arm, the National Institute of Justice, suggests that reducing the availability of large capacity magazines could potentially decrease the total number of homicides, but questions the effectiveness of the 1994 assault weapons ban and a new ban's need for a massive reduction in supply.\n\nThe Obama administration and its supporters have criticized the NRA's ad campaign as an \"outrageous misrepresentation\" of the president's proposals to reduce gun violence. An administration official stated that the ad is based on an incomplete review of gun violence research and does not represent the position of the Department of Justice or the administration. The official also emphasized that the president strongly believes in the Second Amendment and has never supported gun confiscation or a national gun registry.\n\nThe Obama administration and its allies are also working to build public support for the sweeping gun control proposals. Vice President Biden is scheduled to appear at a gun violence conference in Danbury on Thursday, and he recently held a Facebook town hall with Parents Magazine. The advocacy group Organizing for Action, put together by President Barack Obama's former campaign aides, is urging supporters to demand votes in Congress on these measures and to share their personal stories about gun violence and how to reduce it.\n\nThe NRA has been successful in the past in thwarting gun control legislation by building support at the grassroots level, and the group is focusing much of its efforts in this area currently. The NRA has seen its membership rise to record levels as the gun control debate has raged since the Newtown school massacre in December. The organization uses gun shows to not only build membership but to urge attendees to lobby against the proposals.\n\nBesides the new print ads, the NRA is also tripling the buy of a web video run on various news sites. The group initially bought $100,000 worth of ad time to air the video on various news web sites in Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Colorado, South Dakota, and the District of Columbia. The NRA is also airing online ads in 15 states, including Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, and West Virginia. Many of these states will see competitive Senate races next year.\n\nThe Hill newspaper first reported the new print ad campaign.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Continues to Pressure Russia for Return of Edward Snowden\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration has reiterated its demand for the return of fugitive National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, despite the deteriorating relations between the United States and Russia that led to President Obama canceling a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney stated on Thursday that the Snowden case is not the primary focus of U.S.-Russia relations but remains a priority. \"It is not something we are dropping, by any means,\" Carney said. \"It certainly remains our position that Mr. Snowden should be returned to the United States.\"\n\nRussia announced last week that it was granting Snowden asylum for one year, disregarding a personal plea from President Obama to return him to the U.S. to face criminal charges for revealing classified surveillance programs. In response, the White House announced on Wednesday that the planned bilateral summit with Putin in early September was canceled.\n\nThe developments have sparked criticism that President Obama's foreign policy \"reset\" with Russia has collapsed, and that Obama was naive to believe Putin would cooperate on various issues.\n\nFormer U.N. Ambassador John R. Bolton suggested it was time for the U.S. to take a firmer stance with Putin, stating that canceling the summit amounted to \"Obama fluttering his eyelids.\"\n\nCarney stated that the Snowden case was a factor, but not the only factor, in the decision to cancel the meeting. The White House also cited a lack of progress on a range of issues, including Russia's support of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria and negotiations of missile-defense systems in Europe.\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Secretary of State John F. Kerry will meet with their Russian counterparts on Friday in Washington. Carney emphasized that the U.S. would continue to engage with Russia, an important relationship, but it was not the right time for a summit.\n\nRelations between the U.S. and Russia have always posed serious challenges, Carney said, and the Obama administration has disagreements with Russia, including over missile defense during the tenure of former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nCarney declined to comment on the possibility of a U.S. boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, due to a new Russian law that bans \"homosexual propaganda.\" During a conversation with \"Tonight Show\" host Jay Leno, President Obama expressed opposition to laws that discriminate against individuals for any reason.",
    " Title: Former President Obama's Shift in Stance on Medicare-for-All\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent speech, former President Barack Obama expressed support for the Medicare-for-All, or single-payer healthcare system, a policy he was critical of during his presidency. The former Commander in Chief praised the progressive ideas of the Democratic Party, including Medicare-for-All, in his remarks.\n\nObama stated, \"Democrats are not just running on good old ideas like a higher minimum wage, they're running on good new ideas like Medicare-for-all.\" He also endorsed other proposals such as giving workers seats on corporate boards and reversing tax cuts.\n\nThe Medicare-for-All system, also known as single-payer, is not a new concept. In 2008, then-Sen. Obama, during a campaign event in Albuquerque, New Mexico, expressed reservations about implementing the system due to the existing employer-based health insurance system in the United States. He stated, \"If I were setting up a system from scratch, then I'd probably set up a single-payer system. The problem is we're not starting from scratch.\"\n\nIn 2009, while the legislation that would eventually become Obamacare was still being debated, President Obama addressed the American Medical Association. He stated, \"I'll be honest. There are countries where a single-payer system may be working. But I believe\u2014and I've even taken some flak from members of my own party for this belief\u2014that it is important for us to build on our traditions here in the United States.\"\n\nIn August 2009, during a town hall event in New Hampshire, Obama was asked about his support for single-payer healthcare. He responded, \"I have not said that I was a single-payer supporter because, frankly, we historically have had a employer-based system in this country with private insurers, and for us to transition to a system like that I believe would be too disruptive.\"\n\nThis change in Obama's attitude highlights two relevant points for the current debate about Medicare-for-all. First, the Medicare-for-All is not a bright new idea gaining traction but rather an age-old Democratic priority that has not been successfully implemented due to the practical difficulties involved. Second, the expansion of government's role in healthcare will not satisfy the demand for more government interventions later on. Instead, it may increase the level of government intervention that progressives deem necessary and that conservatives will eventually accept as acceptable.\n\nGovernment's slow and seemingly inevitable creep into the health-care market does not eliminate the practical problems Democrats will face in attempting to implement Medicare-for-all. However, if history is any guide, they will eventually have the political capital necessary to give it a try.",
    " Title: U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo Seeks Answers in Khashoggi Disappearance, Saudi Arabia and Turkey Agree to Investigate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a whirlwind trip to Saudi Arabia and Turkey, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has asked the Saudi government for more time to investigate the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. After meeting with President Donald Trump to brief him on his two-day trip, Pompeo stated that the Saudi government has assured him they will conduct a complete and thorough investigation into Khashoggi's disappearance.\n\nKhashoggi, a Saudi dissident who obtained U.S. residency last year due to safety concerns, vanished after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul over two weeks ago. Turkish officials claim there are gruesome audio and video recordings of Khashoggi being beheaded and dismembered within minutes of entering the compound. The Saudi government denies killing the journalist.\n\nPompeo did not comment on the recordings, but expressed confidence that the Saudi government would conduct a full and \"transparent\" investigation. He emphasized America's decades-long alliance with the Saudi government and stated, \"We have a long strategic relationship with Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nDuring his trip, Saudi Arabia transferred $100 million to the State Department, a long-promised contribution to help stabilize parts of Syria that have been liberated from the Islamic State. The donation was made as Pompeo landed in Riyadh to meet with Saudi officials. A top State Department official involved in securing the funds stated there was no connection between the donation and Pompeo's visit.\n\nTrump has floated the idea that Khashoggi may have been killed by \"rogue killers.\" Turkish investigators have searched the Istanbul home of the Saudi consul general and the consulate where Khashoggi was allegedly killed for clues but revealed little about what they discovered. The consul left Turkey this week.\n\nOn his way home to Washington from Turkey, Pompeo acknowledged growing calls for answers, stating, \"Sooner's better than later for everyone.\" The Washington Post published the last column by Khashoggi, written shortly before he went missing and sent to the newspaper a day after he disappeared by his translator. The column, titled \"What the Arab world needs most is free expression,\" focuses on the need for a free media in the Middle East. Khashoggi lamented in the piece that many Arabs live in a state of misinformation and freedom of the press has been under attack.",
    " Title: Republican Senator Ron Johnson Criticizes President Obama's Iraq Withdrawal Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin criticized President Barack Obama's decision to withdraw troops from Iraq, stating it as an \"incredibly stupid and historic blunder\" that led to the rise of ISIS. In an interview on \u2588\u2588\u2588 TV's \"America's Forum,\" Johnson expressed his disapproval of Obama's strategy, stating, \"President Obama's strategy has always been hope and wishful thinking, but we all know that hope is not a strategy and wishful thinking is not good military tactics.\"\n\nJohnson commended Obama for providing support to the Kurds but emphasized the need for further assistance to Jordan and securing Baghdad. He argued that the lack of a stabilizing force left behind after the withdrawal has put America's national security at greater risk.\n\nThe senator also called for increased U.S. involvement in supporting the Yazidis, a Kurdish-speaking people whose faith is linked to Zoroastrianism. ISIS considers Yazidis as devil worshipers due to their belief in seven angels, one named Shaitan, the Quran's name for Satan. According to The New York Times, between 50,000 and 100,000 Yazidis, fleeing ISIS and facing the option of converting to Islam or death, are stranded atop Mount Sinjar.\n\nJohnson urged more U.S. help in terms of providing security and humanitarian assistance, stating, \"This is really a moment of moral clarity.\" He warned that ISIS would commit genocide if allowed to continue and would bring the fight to America. Johnson expressed concern over the plight of the Yazidis, citing reports of ISIS fighters spraying gunfire at fleeing crowds and separating families.\n\nThe United States has provided humanitarian relief airdrops, but Johnson believes more needs to be done. He concluded, \"Nobody wants war. We wish we weren't engaged in war on terror, but we are. We can't bury our heads in the sand on this, and this administration has been way too detached.\"",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Remain Silent on Libya Policy and Ambassador's Death\n\nArticle:\n\nThe final presidential debate this week provided an opportunity for Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama to discuss their foreign policies, particularly the U.S. involvement in Libya. However, both candidates chose to remain silent on the matter of the American deaths in Libya, which has been a topic of significant concern for American voters.\n\nIn 2011, the U.S. government, under President Obama, intervened in Libya to remove Col. Muammar Gaddafi from power. Gaddafi was known for maintaining security, keeping foreign embassies and consulates safe, and imprisoning terrorists. In 2005, during the George W. Bush administration, Gaddafi was praised for his role in the war on terror due to his disposal of nuclear weaponry and arrest of Al-Qaeda operatives.\n\nDuring the Libyan intervention, President Obama claimed that there were no American boots on the ground during the bombing. This statement has been proven false, as American fighter planes would not have been deployed without ground intelligence. It is suspected that by \"boots,\" Obama may have meant \"uniforms.\" American intelligence agents and Special Forces, who do not wear uniforms, were present in Libya, providing intelligence and aiding the assault by U.S. warplanes.\n\nThe U.S. intervention in Libya resulted in the destruction of much of the Libyan authority structures, including government personnel, buildings, equipment, and infrastructure. This vacuum was filled by roving militias, some of which were Al-Qaeda-led and populated, and were responsible for the murder of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and his colleagues in September 2012.\n\nThe Obama administration, aware of the Al-Qaeda role in the attack and the unconstitutional nature of the Libyan intervention, dispatched Ambassador Susan Rice to deliver misleading information to the American public. Rice claimed that the attack was a spontaneous reaction to an anti-Islamic video, not an organized terrorist attack.\n\nRecent investigations have revealed that the building where the attack occurred was a CIA facility, and that Ambassador Stevens and his colleagues may have been intelligence agents. If this is true, Stevens was in violation of international law by holding a diplomatic position while also working as a CIA agent. Additionally, intelligence agents are typically not protected by Marines, as they are expected to be able to take care of themselves.\n\nThe silence from both candidates on this matter raises questions about the role of U.S. intelligence agents in the election and their potential influence on the candidates' policies. It is unclear why both candidates chose to remain silent on this issue during the debate, particularly given its significance to American voters.\n\nWhile the article does not take a political stance, it suggests that Mitt Romney may have a better understanding of economic forces and the free market than President Obama. However, the article criticizes both candidates for their handling of the Libyan intervention and the subsequent attack on the U.S. embassy in Libya.",
    " Title: Tension Erupts in Bernie Sanders' Campaign Over Minimum Wage Dispute Among Staff\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, a prominent figure in the labor movement advocating for a national minimum wage of $15 an hour, is facing internal disputes over pay within his own campaign, which unionized earlier this year. The disagreement, if escalated, could potentially undermine Sanders' political message and his ability to credibly advocate for workers across the country currently engaged in their own wage negotiations.\n\nThe public discontent was first reported by The Washington Post on Thursday, detailing the frustration of Sanders' field staff over base pay that, in some instances, does not meet the $15-an-hour minimum wage he has championed. As the campaign ramps up, field staff often work 10-hour, 6-day weeks, resulting in a lower average hourly compensation.\n\nIn response, Sanders defended his campaign salaries in a statement to The Washington Post, expressing pride that his presidential campaign was the first to unionize workers. He stated that the campaign has a historic contract agreement providing unprecedented protections and benefits, and that concerns would be addressed through the bargaining process.\n\nSanders expressed frustration in an interview with the Des Moines Register, stating that staffers airing their complaints publicly was not acceptable and went against the principles of labor negotiations. He added that some individuals had decided to damage the integrity of the ongoing negotiations before they were concluded.\n\nCampaign manager Faiz Shakir stated that the campaign offered a pay boost to guarantee a $15-an-hour salary for a 60-hour work week. This proposal, according to Shakir, was rejected by the union membership. Shakir also announced that he would limit the work week for field staff to 40 hours a week.\n\nJonathan Williams, a spokesperson for the UFCW Local 400, declined to comment on the specifics of the negotiations but stated that the union would continue working with the campaign to address ongoing concerns.\n\nThe leaked details from the negotiations and internal messaging within the campaign emerged at an uncomfortable time for Sanders, who had only hours earlier praised the House Democrats for passing the Raise the Wage Act of 2019, which would raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\nSources directly connected to the ongoing negotiations between the Sanders campaign and the union representing his field staff, the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400, confirmed to CNN on Friday that the two sides are actively negotiating staffers' pay scale within the confines of the collective bargaining agreement agreed to in early May.\n\nLocal 400 President Mark P. Federici, in a statement on May 8, praised the ratified contract, stating, \"But it does not have to be this way. Even political work must be subject to minimum standards.\" However, the details revealed on Thursday night underscore the difficulties that have made the unionization of political campaigns so difficult and unusual for many years.\n\nThe collective bargaining agreement, ratified in May, set a base pay rate for field staff at $36,000 a year. This salary works out to under $15 an hour based on a 60-hour work week. In addition to the pay scale, the CBA also provides full health insurance without a premium, mental health benefits, parental leave options, a gas card for use while on the job, and other benefits not traditionally available to low-level campaign staff.\n\nThe CBA also includes a provision called \"Labor Committees,\" which allows for rank-and-file members to serve as part of a democratic process allowing them to raise concerns about various issues, including pay, but could also address housing options, workplace environment, and benefits.",
    " Title: Sarah Palin Criticizes Bill O'Reilly, Expresses Concern Over Media Treatment of Potential 2016 Presidential Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Alaska Governor Sarah Palin criticized Fox News host Bill O'Reilly on Tuesday, taking issue with his perceived dismissal of her potential presidential bid and his characterization of her as a reality show candidate. During an appearance on Sean Hannity's show, Palin addressed the negative reaction to her speech at the King's summit over the weekend.\n\nPalin, who served as the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee and has since been involved in backing unsuccessful Tea Party primary challengers, expressed her concerns about the media's role in the 2016 elections.\n\n\"Knowing what the media is going to do throughout 2016 \u2014 and my prediction, Hillary will be running and she will be, you know, the knighted candidate on the left and with the media \u2014 knowing what the media is going to do, it\u2019s going to take more than a village to beat Hillary,\" Palin told Hannity.\n\nPalin went on to outline her vision for a Republican victory in 2016, emphasizing the need for unity and understanding among conservatives. She also took aim at the media, characterizing Fox News, where she is a contributor, as a \"quasi- or assumed conservative outlet\" that sometimes treats political contenders like a reality show.\n\n\"He\u2019s talking about the guests on his show tonight, the commentary on his show, and that would be, \u2018All these GOP contenders thinking about running for president, like Donald Trump, Sarah Palin,\u2019 and he named some others \u2014 and he said, \u2018Oh, what a reality show that would be, yuck yuck,\u2019\" Palin said, referring to O'Reilly.\n\n\"Well, the left doesn\u2019t do that, okay? They take this serious. Because this is war. And hopefully the media \u2014 even the quasi-right side of the media \u2014 won\u2019t be looking at this as some kind of reality show, a joke,\" she added.\n\nPalin, who has hosted shows on TLC and the Sportsman Channel, is no stranger to reality television. In her statement, she seemed to suggest that O'Reilly's characterization of her as a reality show candidate was unfair and dismissive of her political aspirations.",
    " Title: Georgia's Sixth Congressional District Runoff: John Lewis Urges Voter Turnout in Tight Race Between Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the Georgia's Sixth Congressional District, civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) called for voter action during a campaign event on Saturday, emphasizing the importance of voting in the upcoming runoff election between Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel.\n\nLewis stated, \"The vote is precious and sacred. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have. There are some in this country who still seek to deny some of us our right to vote. We can fight back by exercising that right.\"\n\nThe event, a get-out-the-vote rally for Ossoff, featured a festive atmosphere with pickup football, pulled-pork sandwiches, and a woman dancing in an inflatable dinosaur costume. However, Lewis' somber message cut through the festivities.\n\nThe runoff election on Tuesday will decide between Ossoff and Handel, Georgia's former secretary of state. This House race is the most expensive in history and the most anticipated special election of the year.\n\nPolling over the past three weeks suggests Ossoff has a narrow but potentially shrinking lead over Handel. The polling data, compiled by RealClearPolitics, shows Ossoff's lead ranging from 7 points to 1 point. However, one poll showed the race in a dead heat, and a poll at the beginning of May showed Handel leading by 2 points.\n\nMoreover, Ossoff's lead appears to have diminished slightly. While a poll released on June 8 showed Ossoff up by 7 points, the most recent poll available, from Fox 5 Atlanta, shows the Democrat's lead being cut to a single point.\n\nOssoff came in first in the first round of voting this April in Georgia's unusual \"jungle primary\" system, which featured more than a dozen other candidates. However, he didn't clear 50 percent of the vote in that race, setting up Tuesday's runoff election, in which Republicans have consolidated behind Handel.\n\nSigns point to massive turnout in the race. More than half of the district's voters have been contacted in person by Ossoff's campaign, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The New York Times' Nate Cohn reports that 40,000 people who didn't vote in the runoff this March have already cast a ballot this time around.\n\n\"It will all come down to turnout,\" Ossoff told his supporters at his rally. \"Let's make sure we get out there and vote.\"",
    " Title: White House Downgrades Jared Kushner's Security Clearance to Secret Level\n\nArticle:\n\nPresidential son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner has had his security clearance downgraded to the Secret level, a move that will prevent him from viewing many of the sensitive documents to which he once had unfettered access. This decision, which affects Kushner's ability to access the President's Daily Brief (PDB), the most highly classified document that President Trump sees, is the first change to the clearance process instituted in the wake of the Rob Porter scandal.\n\nAll White House aides working on the highest-level interim clearances, at the Top Secret/SCI-level, were informed in a memo sent Friday that their clearances would be downgraded to the Secret level. The SCI acronym stands for sensitive compartmented information, a category of information that comes from sensitive intelligence sources and must be walled off.\n\nThe memo was not signed by Chief of Staff John Kelly, but it comes as the retired Marine general and other top White House aides are grappling with the fallout of the Porter scandal, which revealed that dozens of White House aides had yet to receive permanent clearances but nonetheless had access to some of the country's deepest secrets.\n\nThe president has the ability to grant Kushner a permanent clearance, but Trump said Friday, the same day the memo was sent, that he was leaving the decision to his chief of staff. \"I will let General Kelly make that decision,\" Trump told reporters. \"I have no doubt he'll make the right decision.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to comment on Kushner's clearance status at a briefing Tuesday. Kushner's attorney Abbe Lowell said in a statement that Kushner \"has done more than what is expected of him in this process.\" Lowell added that the changes would \"not affect Mr. Kushner's ability to continue to do the very important work he has been assigned by the president.\"\n\nKushner and others will be debriefed by officials in the White House security office, an event scheduled to take place Thursday. \"They're going to give him a list, 'Here's what you've been debriefed from, you've been debriefed from this program and that compartment, you no longer have any access to it, and any breach of that would be a serious security violation and a possible criminal issue,'\" said Bradley Moss, a lawyer who specializes in national security law and clearances.\n\nKelly took the rare step last week of issuing a public statement that Kushner would be able to continue his work in the White House unfettered. It was unclear whether Kushner would need access to top-secret information to continue performing his duties, and whether Kelly was personally prepared to enact a policy that could be perceived as a jab at the president's son-in-law.\n\nThe decision to downgrade White House staffers still working on interim clearances, however, indicates that Kelly is prepared to impose the same sort of discipline on the White House clearance process that he has tried to impose on the West Wing staff more broadly. \"The American people deserve a White House staff that meets the highest standards and that has been carefully vetted\u2014especially those who work closely with the president or handle sensitive national security information,\" Kelly told colleagues in a memo circulated on Feb. 16. \"We should\u2014and in the future, must\u2014do better.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing that people with temporary security clearances should get only limited access to sensitive classified information. Coats did not mention any specific individuals. \"Sometimes it is necessary to have some type of preliminary clearance in order to fill a slot, but... access has to be limited in terms of the kinds of information they can be in a position to receive or not receive,\" Coats said. \"It needs to be reformed.\"\n\nKushner has seen his once-expansive West Wing role steadily curtailed since Kelly's arrival last July. The new chief immediately required Kushner and his wife, first daughter Ivanka Trump, to report through him rather than directly to the president. The pair have also seen their circle of trusted allies shrink in recent weeks. Reed Cordish, who joined the White House early on as part of Kushner's Office of American Innovation, left the White House earlier this month. Communications staffer Josh Raffel, who handles requests involving Kushner and Ivanka Trump, also plans to leave in the next two months, according to two people familiar with his decision. Raffel did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The news of his departure was first reported by Axios.",
    " Title: Republican National Convention: Lack of Policy Ideas for Making America Safer\n\nArticle:\n\nThe first night of the Republican National Convention, themed \"Make America Safe Again,\" did not present any concrete policy ideas for making the country safer beyond a call to imprison Hillary Clinton if she loses the election and a claim that Donald Trump will eliminate terrorism by referring to \"radical Islamic terrorism.\"\n\nWhile it is important to acknowledge that the United States has generally become safer, there is a concern that the country may not be as safe as it could or should be. To make America safer, politicians would need to propose and implement policies aimed at reducing crime. However, the first two speakers at the convention were C-list celebrities discussing the challenges of expressing open racism rather than offering constructive ideas to improve public safety.\n\nThe rates of murder and violent crime in the United States began to fall in 1991 and continued to decline through 2014, the last year for which reliable data is available. There is some indication that crime may have risen in 2015, which would be concerning even if it still left crime below the level it was when Barack Obama took office.\n\nDespite the generally positive trends, the United States remains an outlier among rich countries in terms of its level of lethal violence. To make America safer, some suggested ideas include investing in preventative policing and public health measures, reducing the number of concealable handguns, and addressing the root causes of crime such as poverty and lack of education.\n\nIt is worth noting that there is a flywheel effect between these ideas. To the extent that crime falls, less money needs to be spent on imprisoning and supervising convicted criminals, which means that more money is available for preventative policing and public health measures.\n\nMonday morning, Eli Stokols of Politico reported that Donald Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, views the fatal shooting of Baton Rouge police officers as part of a \"pattern of lawlessness\" in American cities that is likely to bolster Trump's law and order campaign. Manafort suggested that crime and urban disorder could boost Trump, similar to how it boosted Richard Nixon in the 1960s.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the increase in crime during the 1960s fed a backlash against liberalism, and Richard Nixon successfully campaigned on \"law and order\" in his 1968 campaign for the presidency. Bringing a more authoritarian mien to bear on the urban crisis made Americans feel better about the situation, politically.\n\nHowever, throughout the whole long Nixon-Reagan tough on crime era of conservative ascendancy, the crime rate remained very high. The story is that America's crime rate has fallen steadily since 1991, not 1981 or 1971.\n\nIf Donald Trump becomes president, he is likely to prioritize affective toughness, be unconcerned with policy issues, and be confident that the worse things get, the better off he will be.",
    " Title: Speaker Paul Ryan's Unfavorable Ratings Reach Career Low Amid Struggling Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) is experiencing a decline in his national image as he presides over a Congress that is struggling to pass legislation, according to several national polls. The Wisconsin Republican is facing his worst polling numbers of his career, with his favorability ratings turning negative for the first time in Gallup's polling.\n\nIn a poll by Pew, Ryan's approval rating is 29%, while his disapproval rating is 54%. In a survey by Quinnipiac, 28% of voters view him favorably, while 52% view him unfavorably. These national polls were taken in the aftermath of the House GOP's failure to pass a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFrank Newport, editor-in-chief of Gallup, attributes Ryan's declining popularity to the polarized political environment. \"He's becoming a more traditional partisan figure, and in today's polarized environment, it's hard to maintain high positives that way,\" said Newport.\n\nThe polls suggest that most of Ryan's erosion has occurred outside his own party, among independents and Democrats. In the latest Gallup survey, Ryan's favorability among Democrats plunged from 39% last November to 14% this month. In a Quinnipiac poll taken March 30 to April 3, 76% of Democratic voters viewed Ryan unfavorably, up from 42% at the outset of his speakership in the fall of 2015. Over that same span, Ryan's standing with independents has shifted from positive to negative.\n\nIn his home state of Wisconsin, Ryan's standing actually improved this year with Republicans while declining with liberals, Democrats, independents, and moderates, based on a March poll by the Marquette University Law School.\n\nIt is unclear how much the saga of the health care bill has fueled Ryan's rising negatives nationally. The bill itself was unpopular, and the party's failure to come together was an embarrassment to the speaker. Ryan's numbers were declining before the legislation failed, and have continued to worsen since.\n\nCongress has an average job approval nationally of less than 20%. The recent polling points to a myriad of political challenges for Ryan. His leadership of a GOP-controlled House has helped drive his numbers down among Democrats. Congressional inaction and division have arguably hurt his numbers among independents. And going forward, a failure to pass conservative bills on taxes and health care would undoubtedly damage his standing among Republican voters, which has already dipped a bit in some polls.\n\nRyan is now less popular among voters overall than President Trump, a reversal of the pattern of most of last year. And his national numbers are roughly as poor as those of other congressional leaders, including House Democratic Leader and former speaker Nancy Pelosi. That's another change from 2016.\n\nIn an interview with the Journal Sentinel on April 5, Ryan said he was \"unconcerned about popularity and polling.\" Ryan stated, \"Leaders change polls, leaders don't follow polls. And we need to act like leaders, because we are leading now.\"\n\nRyan's decline matches one very familiar pattern. Modern House speakers often begin with positive ratings, but they rarely sustain them. Democrat Pelosi and Republicans John Boehner and Newt Gingrich each skidded into negative territory within their first year and largely remained there. A review of several years of polling by Gallup and Quinnipiac suggests that Ryan is yet to match the lowest lows that those three reached during their speakerships. But for the moment, he is headed in the same direction.",
    " Title: Obama Lifts U.S. Arms Embargo on Vietnam, Normalizing Relations\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama announced the full removal of the decades-long U.S. arms embargo against Vietnam on Monday, a move intended to normalize relations and eliminate a \"lingering vestige of the Cold War.\" The embargo, imposed in 1984, was lifted in a joint news conference with Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang in Hanoi.\n\nThe U.S. partially lifted the ban in 2014, but Vietnam had pushed for full access as it tries to deal with China's land reclamation and military construction in nearby seas. Every U.S. arms sale will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis going forward, with Vietnam not having made any purchases yet.\n\nThe move faced criticism from U.S. lawmakers and activists who urged Obama to press for greater human rights freedoms in the one-party state before lifting the embargo. Vietnam holds about 100 political prisoners and there have been more detentions this year.\n\nIn Beijing, China's Foreign Ministry outwardly praised the move, with a spokeswoman saying China hoped \"normal and friendly\" relations between the U.S. and Vietnam would be conducive to regional stability. China itself remains under a weapons embargo imposed by the U.S. and European Union following the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations centered on Beijing's Tiananmen Square.\n\nObama and Quang also discussed maritime issues and the importance of maintaining freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. The U.S. does not take sides on the territorial disputes, but supports a diplomatic resolution based on \"international norms\" and not based on \"who's the bigger party and can throw around their weight a little bit more,\" a reference to China.\n\nLifting the arms embargo will be a psychological boost for Vietnam's leaders as they look to counter an increasingly aggressive China, but there may not be a big jump in sales. Obama was greeted by Quang at the Presidential Palace, where Obama congratulated Vietnam for making \"extraordinary progress.\" Quang praised the expansion in security and trade ties between \"former enemies turned friends\" and called for more U.S. investment in Vietnam.\n\nObama also made the case for stronger commercial and economic ties, including approval of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that is stalled in Congress and facing strong opposition from the 2016 presidential candidates. The deal, which includes Vietnam, would tear down trade barriers and encourage investment between the countries that signed it.\n\nCritics worry it would cost jobs by exposing American workers to low-wage competition from countries such as Vietnam. Obama and Quang earlier attended a signing ceremony touting a series of new commercial deals between U.S. and Vietnamese companies valued at more than $16 billion. The deals included U.S. engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney's plans to sell 135 advanced engines to Vietnamese air carrier Vietjet, and Boeing's plans to sell 100 aircraft to the airline.\n\nObama is the third sitting president to visit Vietnam since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Four decades after the fall of Saigon, now called Ho Chi Minh City, and two decades after President Bill Clinton restored relations with the nation, Obama is eager to upgrade relations with an emerging power whose rapidly expanding middle class beckons as a promising market for U.S. goods and an offset to China's growing strength. The U.S. is eager to boost trade with a fast-growing middle class in Vietnam that is expected to double by 2020. That would mean knocking down auto, food, and machine tariffs to get more U.S. products into Vietnam.",
    " Title: Federal Emergency Management Agency Staff to be Furloughed in Shutdown, Affecting E-Verify Program and Law Enforcement Training Centers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the event of a government shutdown, approximately 80 percent of the staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will be furloughed, according to agency officials. Those forced to leave their posts would be called back in an emergency, a situation described as \"not optimal\" by FEMA's administrator, Mr. Johnson.\n\nThe department would be unable to maintain and run its E-Verify program, a system that allows employers to check the legal status of newly hired workers. Most of the employees at law enforcement training centers would also be placed on leave.\n\nChip Fulghum, an acting deputy under secretary for management and the chief financial officer at the Department of Homeland Security, explained the impact: \"If you have hired or are trying to hire new investigators or law enforcement types and they need to get through that course to get on the job, they won't show up because we'll have sent training instructors home.\"\n\nFulghum, who went through the same situation during the last shutdown, detailed the consequences: \"Bills piled up, contractors were sent home, vendor invoices didn't get paid, hiring stopped, and pending contracts didn't go through.\"\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding a potential shutdown, including whether it will occur and its duration, can also be harmful. Noah Kroloff, a former chief of staff at the department who is now a partner at a security consulting and business advisory firm, explained: \"Shutdowns are very taxing in general on the agency, because all the staff that's considered nonessential isn't necessarily there for the purpose of supporting the essential staff, and that has a really disproportionate impact on the essential staff just doing their day-to-day operations.\"\n\n\"If the agency is constantly having to sit through thinking about managing a shutdown, then just by its very nature, it's distracted and not able to focus on the primary mission,\" Kroloff added.\n\nHowever, Citizenship and Immigration Services, the part of the department that would carry out President Obama's executive actions, would remain largely unaffected because it is funded through application fees. After a ruling last week by a Federal District Court in Texas, the Obama administration indefinitely postponed the president's executive actions on immigration to comply with the court's decision, which it is now appealing.",
    " Title: White House Chief Strategist Stephen Bannon Resigns, Marking Significant Change in Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, White House Chief Strategist Stephen Bannon has announced his resignation, marking another significant change in the Trump administration. Bannon, who was instrumental in translating Donald Trump's campaign message into policy, is the former head of Breitbart News.\n\nIn a statement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed Bannon's departure, expressing gratitude for his service. The move comes as new Chief of Staff John Kelly, a retired Marine general, consolidates his authority in a West Wing that has been plagued by infighting and leaks.\n\nThe departure of Bannon, who was widely supported by Trump's base, comes despite recent appeals from high-level Republican donors and activists to keep him on. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows had reportedly urged Trump not to fire Bannon, arguing that he was beneficial to conservatives' agenda.\n\nBannon's departure follows the dismissal of two other aides who helped Trump win the White House - Reince Priebus and Michael Flynn. The move was unexpected, as Bannon's allies, both inside and outside the White House, were certain that Trump would stand by his loyal chief strategist.\n\nTensions between Bannon and several senior aides, including Jared Kushner, Gary Cohn, and H.R. McMaster, had been a source of conflict within the White House. Their feuds often spilled into the press, exacerbating tensions. Bannon's departure could potentially provoke a backlash among Trump's core supporters, who view him as a conduit to the president's base.\n\nBannon's departure could also signal a shift in the administration's approach to international issues, as some Republicans have criticized Bannon as a divisive figure who muddies the president's authority. However, Bannon's allies in the populist nationalist movement have vowed to stand by him, ready to challenge the perceived liberal and globalist influences within the White House.",
    " Title: HBO Host Bill Maher Criticizes Democratic National Committee's Decision to Bar Fox News from 2020 Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring his Friday night show, HBO host Bill Maher criticized the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) decision to bar Fox News from hosting a 2020 presidential debate. According to DNC Chairman Tom Perez, the decision was made because Fox \"is not in a position to host a fair and neutral debate for our candidates.\"\n\nMaher questioned the Democrats' decision, stating, \"Last week, the Democrats made a terrible decision when they announced that they had turned down Fox News's offer to host one of their 2020 primary debates, saying that Fox was nothing more than propaganda.\"\n\nMaher compared the Democrats' decision to refuse Fox News to a sports team refusing to play an away game, stating, \"You want to be in the big leagues, but you refuse to ever play an away game? You don\u2019t like the questions that Fox News might ask, so you\u2019re deciding not to take any questions at all? How very Trump of you.\"\n\nMaher further explained, \"Republicans never shy away from coming on this show, and they come with a smile on their face despite knowing that the only people in the crowd cheering them on are the three campaign aides they brought with them... The audience is against them and they don\u2019t care \u2014 it\u2019s an opportunity to expose people to your side of the story.\"\n\nAccording to The Hill, Fox News's \"Fox and Friends\" hosts applauded Maher for his comments. Ed Henry, a Fox News correspondent, responded, \"How much truth he\u2019s speaking to his own party about the resistance movement being a bunch of wimps \u2014 not actually getting in and fighting on ideas, for example, just taking cheap shots.\"\n\nRachel Campos-Duffy, a co-host on \"Fox and Friends,\" added, \"It's not just on [Maher's] show that Republicans are willing to go on. Most of the media is very liberal, and conservative Republican members of Congress are very accustomed to going on to CNN and MSNBC and ABC and taking tough questions, and yet the Democrats are afraid to do that.\"\n\nMaher's comments suggest that if the Democrats claim to be the \"resistance,\" they should be fearless and willing to answer tough questions from Fox News, as conservatives are required to do with liberal news outlets. Maher's argument is that if the Democratic candidates are too afraid to answer questions they do not like while running for president, they will not be able to handle the weight of answering tough questions while president.",
    " Title: CDC Assures Public: Ebola Transmission Risk Low in U.S. After Dallas Case\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed that a man in Dallas, Texas, is being treated for Ebola. The patient, who did not show symptoms until several days after arriving in the United States from Liberia, is the first confirmed case of Ebola in the country.\n\nCDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden stated that it is \"very unlikely\" that the patient would have been able to spread the disease to fellow passengers during his flight from Liberia. This is because Ebola can only be transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is actively sick with the virus, and it does not spread through the air.\n\nThe CDC is currently trying to find those who came into contact with the patient and will monitor them for symptoms. The patient himself had a handful of contacts with people after he fell ill and before he was isolated, a period of about four days. A CDC team has arrived in Texas to investigate the people who came in contact with the man.\n\nThe CDC has issued warnings to avoid nonessential travel to Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, the countries hit hardest by the outbreak. The CDC is also working with airport officials in those nations, as well as in Nigeria, to screen every person getting on a plane for fever. If a passenger has a fever, they are pulled out of the line, assessed for Ebola, and do not fly unless Ebola is ruled out.\n\nThe United States is not planning on banning flights coming from the hot zones in West Africa, according to White House spokesman Josh Earnest. Once flights land at a U.S. airport from one of those countries, passengers are screened again. If an individual is detected exhibiting symptoms, they can be quarantined and promptly evaluated by a medical professional.\n\nThe Ebola patient in Dallas did not start showing symptoms until several days after he landed in the United States. The paramedics who took the patient to the hospital have been isolated, and they have not shown symptoms of the disease so far. The ambulance that carried the patient was in use for two days after the transport but was properly decontaminated.\n\nAlthough there is no vaccine and no cure for Ebola, the one real advantage the United States has is that doctors know how to control it. Ebola is not \"some mystical pathogen\" with a \"bizarre mode of transmission,\" said Bruce Ribner, director of Emory University Hospital's Infectious Disease Unit. The U.S. has the luxury of better health care compared to Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, and the country has facilities that can \"do the kind of isolation that apparently is very difficult to do within the health care infrastructure in the African countries that we are talking about.\"",
    " Title: Trade Deficits and Surpluses: A Misunderstood Economic Concept\n\nArticle:\n\nThe term 'trade deficit' is often used in discussions about a country's economic health, but it is not always well-understood. Unlike a budget deficit, a trade deficit does not add to a country's debt. Instead, it is a bookkeeping entry, not a debt that needs to be paid. A trade deficit occurs when a country imports more goods and services than it exports.\n\nContrary to popular belief, trade deficits are not primarily caused by tariffs or other protectionist policies. The United States and the European Union, for example, have similar average tariff rates, with the U.S. at 1.7% and the EU at 2.0%, according to World Bank data. Trade surpluses, on the other hand, are not necessarily a sign of economic health.\n\nTrade deficits are primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as tax policies, savings rates, the strength of a country's currency, and the attractiveness of a country to investors. The corporate tax reform that President Trump is proud of may contribute to higher trade deficits by making the United States a more attractive place to invest.\n\nTrade deficits benefit the country in several ways. For instance, the U.S. gets $118 billion in German-made goods in exchange for $54 billion in U.S.-made goods, leaving $64 billion over to invest in American assets. This surplus has enabled the establishment of foreign-owned factories in the U.S., such as BMW Manufacturing in South Carolina, which employs more than 9,000 people.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. is the world's leading exporter of agricultural products, with one-third of U.S. soybeans being exported to China. This is not due to any Machiavellian trade scheme but rather a result of the best product and best price.\n\nIn conclusion, trade deficits are not a sign of economic trouble, and trade surpluses are not necessarily a sign of economic health. It is essential to understand the complexities of trade and the various factors that influence it. Misconceptions about trade deficits can lead to ineffective policies and unintended consequences, as demonstrated by the ongoing trade war and the proposed $12 billion bailout for U.S. farmers.",
    " Title: 9th Circuit Court Upholds Temporary Restraining Order on Trump's Travel Ban, Emphasizes Due Process Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has refused to overturn the temporary restraining order (TRO) against President Trump's travel ban, focusing on the argument of due process rights for individuals affected by the executive order. Washington and Minnesota, the states that brought the lawsuit resulting in the TRO, argue that many of the people covered by the ban have a right to due process that the government has not respected. The 9th Circuit believes the states have a good chance of proving this claim.\n\nThe travel ban, issued by President Trump, suspends the admission of refugees for 120 days and imposes a 90-day ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The states' argument that the order discriminates against Muslims has generated significant public debate. The 9th Circuit states that the states' claims \"raise serious allegations and present significant constitutional questions.\"\n\nThe 9th Circuit notes that the ability to re-enter the country after going abroad, or to travel in anticipation of that ability, is a \"liberty interest\" protected by the Fifth Amendment. However, the government has not shown that the Executive Order provides what due process requires, such as notice and a hearing prior to restricting an individual's ability to travel. In fact, the government does not contend that the Executive Order provides for such process.\n\nForeign nationals who are outside the United States and have never lived there, such as would-be visitors applying for visas or refugees seeking permission to resettle in the U.S., cannot assert due process rights. However, the Supreme Court, as noted by the 9th Circuit, has held that procedural protections provided by the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause are not limited to citizens. They apply to all persons within the United States, including aliens, regardless of whether their presence is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.\n\nIn the 1982 case Landon v. Placencia, the Supreme Court held that a lawful permanent resident had a right to due process when the Immigration and Naturalization Service tried to stop her from returning to the United States after a brief visit to Mexico that involved an attempt to smuggle aliens across the border. The Trump administration initially stated that the travel ban applied to lawful permanent residents, then issued a blanket waiver stating their entry is \"in the national interest.\" The administration's latest position, laid out in a February 1 memo from White House Counsel Donald F. McGahn II, is that the order never applied to lawful permanent residents.\n\nThe 9th Circuit rejected this assurance, questioning McGahn's authority to revise Trump's order or to require that other government officials adhere to his interpretation. The court also noted that in light of the government's shifting interpretations of the Executive Order, it cannot say that the current interpretation by White House counsel, even if authoritative and binding, will persist past the immediate stage of these proceedings.\n\nGreen-card holders are not the only people affected by the order with potential due process claims. They also include non-immigrant visa holders who have been in the United States but temporarily departed or wish to temporarily depart, and applicants who have a relationship with a U.S. resident or an institution that might have rights of its own to assert, such as relatives of citizens or scholars hired by American universities. Even refugees could make due process claims under 18 USC 1231 if they seek asylum after arriving in the United States.\n\n\"The Government has provided no affirmative argument showing that the States' procedural due process claims fail as to these categories of aliens,\" the 9th Circuit states. \"For example, the Government has failed to establish that lawful permanent residents have no due process rights when seeking to re-enter the United States. Nor has the Government established that the Executive Order provides lawful permanent residents with constitutionally sufficient process to challenge their denial of re-entry.\"\n\nAssuming that some people affected by the order have a right to due process, it is not clear what it would entail. The only potential relief provided by the order comes from discretionary, case-by-case waivers \"in the national interest.\" The 9th Circuit suggests that due process would at least require \"notice and a hearing prior to restricting an individual's ability to travel,\" and presumably the hearing would do more than verify that the individual comes from one of the banned countries.\n\nThe Trump administration asked the appeals court, if it was not prepared to block the TRO entirely, to narrow its scope so that it covers only \"previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future.\" That category would include many of the people with potential due process claims, the 9th Circuit notes, but not all of them, since it omits \"aliens who are in the United States unlawfully,\" who \"have due process rights as well,\" and \"citizens who have an interest in specific non-citizens' ability to travel to the United States.\"\n\nRather than seek a narrower TRO, Trump could rewrite his order to focus on unvetted foreign nationals who have never visited the U.S., which would address most of the due process concerns while bolstering the credibility of his claim that he is trying to protect Americans from terrorists. \"Even if the TRO might be overbroad in some respects,\" the 9th Circuit states, \"it is not our role to try, in effect, to rewrite the Executive Order. The political branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions.\"",
    " Title: Liberal Elite's Childish Response to Political Opponents\n\nArticle:\n\nThe response of the liberal elite to political opponents, particularly during the 2016 election and Donald Trump's presidency, has been a subject of debate. In the past, critics often accused Trump of lacking \"temperament\" and \"maturity,\" a charge that some argue is hypocritical given the behavior of some journalists and liberal activists.\n\nIn the grip of government power, liberals may advocate for \"civility\" to tame opposition, but when out of power, they often resort to uncivil behavior. This was evident in the 1990s, when members of the Clinton administration called for a \"civility commission,\" leading to a sham group at the University of Pennsylvania becoming upset at conservative commentators like Rush Limbaugh for challenging their power.\n\nThe relativism underpinning liberalism makes it willful and opportunistic in terms of civility. Civility is honored when it serves the purpose of gaining or preserving power, but is discarded when it becomes an impediment to holding or regaining power. The \"ends\" are then justified by the \"higher\" good, and anyone questioning uncivil behavior is seen as failing to understand the \"higher\" good at stake.\n\nSince Trump's victory, instances of uncivil behavior have increased, with upper-class liberals watching a play in Central Park where a Donald Trump character is stabbed to death, audiences laughing at Kathy Griffin for holding up a mock-severed, bloody head of Trump, and liberal activists cheering attempts to throw Ivanka Trump off a plane or congratulating a restaurant for refusing to serve Sarah Huckabee Sanders. In one instance, the restaurant did not serve Sanders, but did not poison her food, as some might have expected.\n\nDuring the Bush years, liberals threw cakes at reviled conservatives. Now, they kick out conservatives from restaurants before dessert, while simultaneously demanding that Christians make cakes for gay nuptials. It is amusing to see supposedly \"serious\" liberal publications join in the madness. In the last week or so, they have fabricated a Time cover, falsely accused a border official of sporting a Nazi tattoo, and run a hit piece on Trump aide Stephen Miller based on his third-grade behavior.\n\nThe last item is particularly noteworthy. The media has investigated Miller's high school years in Santa Monica, focusing on his supposedly nefarious activities such as saying the Pledge of Allegiance. A piece by one of his classmates, John F. Muller, was published in Politico, detailing Miller's lack of social skills and neatness in the third grade. The author, a former lecturer at Harvard Law School, describes Miller as difficult to reach, frequently distracted, and obsessed with specific tasks. He also notes Miller's obsession with tape and glue, and his desire for a demarcation line between his side of the desk and Miller's. The author interprets Miller's behavior as a manifestation of a narcissistic wall-building instinct and a desire to keep out the chaos of the world.\n\nThe liberal elite's childish response to political opponents, as demonstrated by these examples, has been a recurring theme in recent years. The behavior of some liberals, particularly when out of power, has been characterized by a lack of civility, opportunism, and a willingness to stoop to low levels to undermine their opponents.",
    " Title: Former Vice President Joe Biden Faces Sexual Assault Allegation from Former Staffer Tara Reade\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, has long advocated for automatically believing women who come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct. However, he is now facing a serious accusation of sexual assault from a former staffer named Tara Reade.\n\nReade, who describes herself as a \"California-based victim rights advocate and activist,\" alleges that Biden assaulted her in 1993 while she was working for him in the early 1990s. According to Reade, Biden began kissing her without her permission, pushed her against a wall, reached under her skirt, and penetrated her with his fingers.\n\nReade had previously complained about sexual harassment in Biden's office, but had not shared the more serious accusation against Biden with anyone until recently. She says she once tried to talk to a supervisor about what had happened, but this person shut her down before she could tell the whole story. She also says she filled out an official form detailing her assault, but does not know what became of it.\n\nThe mainstream media has given Reade little attention, with major outlets such as The New York Times, Washington Post, and CNN declining to cover the story thus far. However, the anti-Biden left has seized the opportunity, with some criticizing MSNBC and CNN for failing to cover the story.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Reade accusation will have a significant impact on Biden's candidacy. The timing of the allegation, coming so close to the Democratic primary, has raised questions about its credibility. However, the very recent precedent set by the mainstream media and mainstream liberals during the Kavanaugh episode is that all accusations should be revisited, no matter how old.\n\nIt seems unlikely that the Reade accusation can sink Biden's candidacy, but whether Democratic primary voters and the mainstream media are willing to air it out as they did with the Kavanaugh allegations will tell us a lot about what \"believe all women\" actually means.",
    " Title: Obama's Struggles with Government Inefficiency: A Look at the VA Scandal and Healthcare Website Woes\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama, who once expressed ambition and confidence in the government he was about to lead, is currently grappling with a series of bureaucratic inefficiencies that have come to light, including the VA scandal and the health care website woes. CNN's Gloria Borger compares this situation to Lewis Carroll's \"Alice Through the Looking Glass,\" suggesting that Obama is \"staring down a rabbit hole of government bureaucracy and inefficiency.\"\n\nThe VA scandal, following the health care website fiasco, highlights the President's challenges in managing the government. The President's efforts to grow, manage, and change the government have, in some cases, become his own personal adversaries. This raises questions about the President's trust in government, as the government he has tried to expand and reform has become a source of problems rather than solutions.\n\nThe health care reform, the signature legislative achievement of the administration, was marred by a botched rollout, while the VA scandal, involving potential mismanagement and long wait times for veterans' healthcare, has raised concerns about the administration's ability to effectively manage a key aspect of the President's platform.\n\nThe President's approach to governing seems to have two extremes: issues that are micromanaged, such as foreign policy, and issues that are completely delegated, such as VA management. What appears to be missing is a middle ground: continual monitoring and early warning systems that avoid presidential blindsiding.\n\nThe President's management style is not universally praised. While he excels in leading a hierarchical organization with a single goal, such as a presidential campaign, managing or negotiating with people with mixed motives, like members of Congress, is not a strong point for him.\n\nBorger suggests that the President needs to take control of the bureaucracy to be effective. The government apparatus to carry out the nation's business competently exists, and it is the President's responsibility to use and manage it effectively.\n\nThe VA scandal and health care website woes are not trivial matters. They are core issues that touch on the President's ability to manage the government and deliver on his promises to the American people. The President's legacy may be at stake if these issues are not addressed effectively.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Makes First Post-2008 Presidential Campaign Visit to Iowa, Sparking 2016 Speculation\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made her first visit to Iowa since her 2008 presidential campaign on Sunday, attending the 37th annual steak fry event organized by retiring Senator Tom Harkin. The visit has sparked renewed speculation about Clinton's political future.\n\nClinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, headlined the event in Indianola, where they celebrated Harkin's 40-year political career. During the event, Clinton shook hands, posed for pictures, signed autographs, and flipped steaks while ignoring questions about the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nWhen asked about her plans, Clinton teased the crowd, saying her focus is on her future grandchild and \"that other thing.\" She later clarified that she is considering a presidential run but was not in Iowa for that purpose.\n\nClinton praised Harkin's record of service and urged the 5,000 activists in attendance to work hard for Democrats in the November election, including Harkin's protege, U.S. Rep. Bruce L. Braley, who is running for Harkin's seat against state Sen. Joni Ernst, a Republican.\n\nClinton emphasized the importance of the Iowa race in determining whether Democrats will continue to control the Senate during the final two years of the Obama administration. Republicans need to pick up a net of six seats to flip control of the upper chamber.\n\nA CNN/ORC poll released Friday showed that Braley has a slight 49 percent to 48 percent lead over Ernst among likely voters. The survey also found that 53 percent of registered Democrats said they would support Clinton in the Iowa caucuses, which traditionally kick off the nomination race.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, who is scheduled to travel to Iowa on Wednesday, received 15 percent in the poll, compared to 7 percent for Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and 5 percent for Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is openly considering a bid.\n\nSanders, who was also in Iowa over the weekend, said on ABC's \"This Week\" that Americans do not want to anoint a candidate but instead want to see a debate about the important issues facing the country.\n\nClinton said earlier this month that she will decide \"probably after the first of the year\" about whether she will run for president again.\n\nBefore the steak fry, the Clintons attended a private reception for Harkin's To Organize a Majority PAC at Principal Park, the home of Des Moines' minor league baseball team.\n\nWhen asked on CNN's \"State of the Union\" whether he would support Clinton for president, Harkin was noncommittal, saying they are \"very close friends\" and that she has inspired women across the globe. Harkin also mentioned that Biden, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, Sen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, Sanders, and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb could also run for the Democratic nomination.\n\nClinton placed a disappointing third in the 2008 Iowa caucuses behind then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina. In her memoir \"Hard Choices,\" Clinton described the Iowa result as \"excruciating.\" At the steak fry Sunday, Harkin suggested Clinton could rebound from the experience, calling the Clintons the \"comeback couple.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry Declares ISIS Committing Genocide Against Christians in Iraq and Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry has determined that the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, is committing genocide against Christians and other minorities in Iraq and Syria. This determination, set to be announced on Thursday, is in response to a congressional deadline and follows similar declarations from various governments, legislative bodies, and world leaders.\n\nThe genocide declaration does not obligate the United States to take additional action against ISIS militants and does not prejudge any prosecution against its members, according to U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly preview Kerry's decision.\n\nThe genocide determination is based on the available evidence demonstrating that ISIS' actions rise to the level of genocide. The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, signed by the U.S. and 147 other nations, prohibits the intentional destruction, in whole or in part, of an ethnic or religious group.\n\nThe genocide declaration requires countries to work together \"to liberate mankind from this odious scourge,\" as stated in the 1948 treaty. However, there are still issues that the U.S. has to work through, considering that a genocide designation could \"require an adjustment to US military strategy,\" according to Yahoo News.\n\nLast week, the House voted unanimously 393-0 to declare the actions of ISIS against Christians a genocide. European leaders, the Pope, and Hillary Clinton have also been calling for the official declaration to be made.\n\nLegal organizations representing persecuted Christians in the Middle East have urged Kerry to declare the genocide and have offered the State Department the legal evidence for doing so. The Knights of Columbus also submitted a nearly 300-page report to Kerry and the State Department last week laying out a detailed case for genocide declaration.\n\nTen years ago, there were nearly two million Christians living in Iraq and Syria. Today, there are just 250,000.",
    " Title: U.S. Imposes Personnel Cap on Chinese State-Run Media in Response to Expulsion of American Journalists\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has imposed a cap on the number of Chinese citizens permitted to work for China's major state-run media companies in the United States. This move comes in response to China's expulsion of several Wall Street Journal reporters earlier this year.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the cap will reduce the number of Chinese nationals working for the state-run media companies in the United States from 160 to 100 employees. The affected media entities include Xinhua News Agency, China Global Television Network, China Radio International, China Daily Distribution Corporation, and Hai Tian Development USA.\n\nThe decision to impose a cap was announced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a tweet on Monday. He stated, \"Today, we announced a personnel cap on Chinese government-controlled media organizations in the United States. We urge Beijing to respect freedom of expression and will continue to seek reciprocity across the bilateral relationship.\"\n\nPompeo further explained in a statement that the goal is to establish a \"long-overdue level playing field\" and to spur Beijing to adopt a more fair and reciprocal approach to U.S. and other foreign press in China. He also urged China to uphold its international commitments to respect freedom of expression, including for members of the press.\n\nThe move to impose a cap follows China's expulsion of three Wall Street Journal reporters in February, in response to an opinion piece printed in the Journal that was critical of China. The expulsion sparked fury from White House officials, leading to the current personnel cap.\n\nThe State Department spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal that the cap is part of the Trump administration's efforts to seek reciprocity in the U.S.-China relationship. The move may escalate already-existing tensions between the two countries, particularly as the deadly coronavirus outbreak continues to spread globally.\n\nChina has expressed unhappiness with the move, with a Foreign Ministry spokesperson questioning the validity of the White House's goal of \"reciprocity\" on Twitter. She wrote, \"Now the US kicked off the game, let's play.\"",
    " Title: Facebook Restores Senator Warren's Ads After Removal Over Logo Misuse\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, has faced a recent incident involving the removal and subsequent reinstatement of several ads on Facebook. The ads, which promoted Warren's plan to curtail growing monopolies owned by tech giants such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook, were initially pulled by Facebook due to a violation of the social network's policy against the misuse of Facebook's logo.\n\nOn March 8, Warren issued a plan to address the growing monopolies she believes are stifling innovation and hurting small businesses. Facebook pulled four of Warren's ads on March 11, citing the use of the letter \"f\" in a video that represented Facebook as a violation of their policy. However, the ads were reinstated shortly thereafter, with Facebook stating, \"In the interest of allowing robust debate, we are restoring the ads.\"\n\nThe majority of Warren's ads, nine others placed on Facebook, were not affected by the removal. In response to the incident, Warren commented on Twitter, \"Curious why I think Facebook has too much power? Let's start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether Facebook has too much power.\" She later thanked the company for restoring her posts but added, \"I want a social media marketplace that isn't dominated by a single censor.\"\n\nIn her plan, titled \"Here's How We Can Break Up Big Tech,\" Warren outlined her support for regulators breaking up \"anti-competitive\" mergers such as Facebook's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as Amazon's deals for Whole Foods and Zappos, and Google's acquisitions of Waze, Nest, and DoubleClick.",

Nasr al-Ansi, a top commander of AQAP, appeared in an 11-minute Internet video posted Wednesday, stating that the massacre was in \"vengeance for the prophet.\"\n\nAl-Ansi also said in the video that France belongs to the \"party of Satan\" and warned of more \"tragedies and terror.\" He claimed that Yemen's Al Qaeda branch \"chose the target, laid out the plan, and financed the operation,\" though he produced no evidence to support the claim.\n\nIt was revealed last week that one of the brothers who carried out the attack, Sa\u00efd Kouachi, did his training in Yemen. The White House has repeatedly argued that Al Qaeda is \"on the run\" and that its core leaders have been \"decimated.\" However, the White House has been cautious about using the term \"Islamic terror\" to describe the attack.\n\nChilling raw video shows the Kouachi brothers yelling about vengeance for the prophet Mohammed just after they murdered Charlie Hebdo editors and left the scene. The White House has not yet announced a response to the claim of responsibility by AQAP.",
    " Title: The Constitutional Protection of Flag Burning and the First Amendment\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the United States, the issue of flag burning, a controversial act that is widely viewed as a desecration of the national symbol, has been a topic of debate among elected officials. However, the Supreme Court has consistently upheld the right to free speech, including the act of flag burning, as a protected form of expression under the First Amendment.\n\nThe late Justice William J. Brennan, in a poignant statement, expressed his disdain for flag burning but acknowledged that he would not advocate for its criminalization. The current political climate has seen a call for the criminalization of flag burning, with many politicians expressing their support for such a measure.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that flag burning is a constitutionally protected form of expression. Furthermore, the court has also established that citizenship cannot be revoked based on a criminal conviction, including for flag burning. This means that President-elect Trump, upon taking office, would not have the authority to strip the citizenship of flag burners.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision on flag burning is a matter of precedent, and any attempt to change it could potentially open a \"slippery slope\" for the denial of other basic freedoms of expression. The late Justice Scalia, who was in the majority in the most recent flag burning case, advocated for the criminalization of flag burning. If his replacement takes the minority view, the Supreme Court may reconsider its decision.\n\nCandidate Trump, who has expressed a desire to change the libel laws to make it easier to sue his critics, may find himself in a precarious position if the constitutional rules were to be loosened. Trump's use of defamatory language against his opponents could potentially make him a target for defamation actions.\n\nThe First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech, has served the United States well for over two centuries. It has protected extremists on both the right and left, and while many Americans may prefer to ban speech they dislike, the principle of freedom of expression is one that liberals and conservatives alike should support.\n\nPresident-elect Trump is urged to withdraw his calls for the criminalization of flag burning and to respect the principles of the First Amendment. The act of flag burning, while offensive to many, is a symbol of the very freedom it seeks to undermine. The First Amendment is not broken, and it is not in need of repair.",
    " Title: Twitter-DHS Dispute Highlights First Amendment Rights and Dark Money in Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week, the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) division demanded that Twitter reveal the identity of the person behind an account criticizing the Trump administration. However, the agency quickly retracted the demand, acknowledging it had no authority to issue such a demand.\n\nTwitter's primary objection, the company stated, is that allowing the government to unmask Twitter critics violates the Constitution's First Amendment right to free speech. The company argued that this right is particularly important when discussing political speech.\n\nTwitter expressed concern that the demand \"may reflect the very sort of official retaliation that can result from speech that criticizes government officials and agencies.\" Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.) called the CBP demand a \"witch hunt.\" In a letter to CPB, he expressed \"grave alarm\" over an apparent attempt to \"squelch the exercise of First Amendment rights to comment on U.S. policy, and to make those comments anonymously.\"\n\nEsha Bhandari, a staff lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), stated that the case was \"about the broader right to speak anonymously on the internet.\" She told The Washington Post, \"Speaking anonymously about issues of the day is a longstanding American tradition, dating back to when the framers of the Constitution wrote under pseudonyms. The anonymity that the First Amendment guarantees is often most essential when people criticize the government, and this free speech right is as important today as ever.\"\n\nAlex Howard, deputy director of the Sunlight Foundation, praised Twitter's rebuff of the CBP demand, stating, \"The choices they made to stand up for their users set important precedents for other companies now and into the future.\"\n\nThe article also discusses the issue of \"dark money\" in political campaigns. Dark money consists of donations to politically oriented nonprofit groups that can use the money for independent expenditures urging the public to vote for or against a political candidate. Dark-money expenditures have increased in recent years, but they still represent only a tiny fraction of total campaign spending.\n\nThe article argues that the term \"dark money\" sounds despicable and has elicited calls for \"disclosure.\" Legislation has been introduced in Congress and in more than half the states that would require such incorporated nonprofits to disclose their donors. One New York proposal would require nonprofits to disclose the identities of anyone who gave them more than $1,000 if they express any opinion about any position taken on any issue by any candidate, legislature, or executive agency.\n\nThe article concludes by noting that the ACLU has criticized dark-money disclosure laws as overly broad measures that \"could chill constitutionally protected speech.\" The article suggests that the issue of political speech and campaign finance reform cannot be separated, and that limiting expenditures would limit political speech, just as limiting abortions would limit abortion rights. The article also references the Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United, which allowed non-profit corporations to publish criticism of politicians in the weeks leading up to an election. The article suggests that those who were horrified by the administration's demand that the Twitter user be unmasked should think carefully about whether they want the government unmasking other critics as well.",
    " Title: George H.W. Bush Discusses Faith and Leadership During Interviews\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer U.S. President George H.W. Bush, the 41st president of the United States, discussed the importance of faith in leadership during interviews throughout his presidency. In 1992, during an interview with Pat Robertson, Bush stated, \"I don't believe that an atheist could be president of the United States. Anyone that did not have something bigger than himself or herself -- and faith is the answer.\"\n\nBush spoke about his regular prayers at meals and before bed with his wife, Barbara. He also agreed with Robertson about the need for faith in the Oval Office. During the interview, Bush noted that Abraham Lincoln once said he could not handle the job except on his knees, and Bush responded, \"Yes, you have to.\"\n\nIn 1990, before ordering the start of Operation Desert Shield in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Bush found himself turning to prayer. He told Robertson, \"The decision rests only with the president for that -- only the president -- and there was certainly time and need for prayer on that.\"\n\nIn 2007, Bush spoke about his spirituality during a dedication ceremony for the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North Carolina. He stated, \"I've always viewed my faith as a personal matter, an intensely personal matter and that's just the way I'm wired. There's nothing self-conscious, however, about my relationship with Jesus Christ and thanks to Billy I have come to understand this all-important relationship in deeper and more meaningful ways.\"\n\nBush's casket will rest in the Capitol rotunda all day Tuesday for the public to pay their respects. A presidential aircraft designated as \"Special Air Mission 41\" flew his casket to the nation's capital on Monday. Bush's eldest son, President George W. Bush, and other family members flew on the flight.\n\nOn Wednesday at 11 a.m., President Trump and the first lady will attend an invitation-only state funeral for Bush at the National Cathedral. Afterwards, the casket will be flown back to Houston for a service at St. Martin's Episcopal Church on Thursday, followed by a private ceremony and burial at the Bush presidential library on the campus of Texas A&M University in College Station. Bush will be buried alongside his wife Barbara, who died in April, and their daughter Robin Bush, who died of leukemia in 1953 at age 3.",
    " Title: Romney Remains Silent on Obama's Decision to Halt Deportation of Young Illegal Immigrants\n\nArticle:\n\nPresumed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney declined to comment on whether he would reverse President Obama's decision to halt the deportation of young-adult illegal immigrants during a Sunday interview. The White House, which had previously stated it lacked the authority to categorically halt deportations, now claims it has solid legal ground for the move.\n\nOn Friday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced that the department would stop deporting illegal immigrants under the age of 30 who were brought to the country before the age of 16, have been in the U.S. for at least five years, and have completed high school, earned an equivalency diploma, or joined the U.S. military. The move does not grant the illegal immigrants permanent legal status but ends their risk of being deported and may provide them with legal work rights.\n\nAfter taking a hard-line stance on immigration during the primary, Romney said on Sunday that he would pursue a broader immigration solution but did not comment on whether he would maintain the non-deportation policy in the meantime. Romney also accused Obama of politicizing the issue, stating that the timing of the decision was \"pretty clear.\"\n\nFor three years, the Obama administration had denied having the authority to halt deportations for students who would have been eligible for the Dream Act. In 2011, Obama told Univision that ignoring congressional mandates through executive order would not conform with his role as president. However, after reversing his stance, the administration claims it is not unilaterally enacting the Dream Act because it cannot grant full legal status.\n\nThe Dream Act, which would have granted a path to citizenship to most illegal immigrants under 30, has failed several times in Congress. However, Democrats have reintroduced a version, and several Republicans are working on their own legislation. Rep. David Rivera and Sen. Marco Rubio, both Florida Republicans, have introduced their own versions of the bill, which would grant a path to citizenship to a narrower category of students than the administration's policy.",
    " Title: Marco Rubio's Strategic Approach to Immigration Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Marco Rubio (R-FL) has been successful in courting grass-roots Republican voters in his efforts to address immigration reform. After the bipartisan group's formation late last year, following Mitt Romney's presidential election loss due in part to a rejection by Hispanic voters, Rubio embarked on a media blitz, outlining his immigration principles and garnering praise from conservative media figures such as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.\n\nRubio and his team have studied the mistakes of the 2007 immigration overhaul attempt and tailored their pitch to address conservative concerns. Emphasizing strict border security and enforcement, Rubio insists that illegal immigrants cannot be put on a path to citizenship until border security goals are met. He also advocates for refining the current system, focusing on increased enforcement and a workable plan for future legal immigrants, aiming to prevent another wave of illegal immigrants in the future.\n\nFormer Republican Senator Mel Martinez, who was part of the failed 2007 immigration overhaul attempt, commends Rubio's strong leadership and communication skills, stating that his emphasis on strong border security and enforcement is resonating with Democrats. Rubio has also been proactive in preventing the dynamic that contributed to the 2007 bill's failure, such as the impression that the immigration proposal was written in secret and rushed to the Senate floor.\n\nRubio has been active behind the scenes, regularly reaching out to conservative news media outlets, grass-roots supporters, and House Republicans. In one-on-one phone calls and meetings, he has emphasized the importance of a full committee review and transparency in the process. Rubio has also brought Enrique Gonzalez, a well-known immigration lawyer based in Miami, onto his staff full-time and assigned a legislative assistant to work nearly exclusively on immigration issues.\n\nIn January, Rubio also made headlines for his active role in the bipartisan group's efforts, with Rush Limbaugh enthusing on his show that Rubio had emphasized the need for hearings and transparency in the process.",
    " Title: FBI Completes Supplemental Background Check on Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh; Report to be Delivered to Senate Wednesday Evening\n\nArticle:\n\nThe FBI has reportedly concluded its supplemental background investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, and the Senate is expected to receive the results Wednesday evening, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The report, which is planned to focus on allegations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh during his youth, is expected to be kept secret.\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor Wednesday evening, McConnell stated, \"This evening, the Senate will receive the results of the FBI\u2019s supplemental background investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh.\" He further noted that the information gathered during this investigation, in addition to what has already been one of the most thorough and exhaustive Senate reviews of any Supreme Court nominee in U.S. history, would be provided to senators.\n\nThe report's release has been a significant point of anticipation, as it may influence the votes of three Republican senators who hold swing votes on Kavanaugh's appointment due to the conservative party's thin 51-49 majority in the Senate.\n\nChristine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, was not contacted or interviewed by the FBI during its investigation, as of late Wednesday. Nor was another woman, Julie Swetnick, who also accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Ford's lawyers released a statement late Wednesday night, condemning the investigation for proceeding without Ford's participation.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee, stated that the FBI's investigation would not be deemed credible without testimony from both Ford and Kavanaugh, given reports that they might not be interviewed.\n\nThe FBI has contacted at least a handful of key witnesses in its investigation, but some have questioned why others were not interviewed. The report is expected to center on allegations posed by Ford, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while they were in high school. Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called for a slowdown in the process, suggesting senators should have a day to study the FBI report before deciding Kavanaugh's fate. President Donald Trump expects a vote by the end of the week, and a full vote on Kavanaugh could happen as early as Saturday afternoon if the Senate is ordered to work over the weekend.",
    " Title: Republicans Eye Bipartisan Elements for Potential Health Care Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate surrounding the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, some Republican lawmakers have indicated that they may preserve certain elements of the president's controversial health care overhaul if they were to repeal the law and implement their own reforms.\n\nSince its inception, conservatives in Congress have been vocal about their dislike of President Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. However, as demonstrated by a recent proposal from House conservatives, they would not just repeal the law; they would replace it with one of their own. The new plan would not be ObamaCare, but it could share some similarities with the current law, particularly in areas that have bipartisan support.\n\nMichael Gerson, former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, recently urged Republicans to start thinking about creating a health care policy rather than just tearing down the existing one. In a piece for The Washington Post, Gerson proposed a Republican plan that would offer a universal credit to anyone not covered by a large employer and include protections for those without insurance from \"catastrophic expenses.\"\n\nThese ideas would be scaled-back versions of the subsidies and consumer protections currently offered in ObamaCare. The difference, according to Gerson, is that \"Obamacare creates a powerful regulatory mechanism (the exchanges) that mandates comprehensive coverage\" among other changes.\n\nDavid Kendall, a senior fellow for health and fiscal policy at Third Way, told FoxNews.com that there is an overlap in ideas between the parties, and parts of ObamaCare would likely show up in a Republican-penned plan. Kendall noted that the law is not dissimilar to versions of health care reform that Republicans have proposed in the past, including a universal plan offered by President Richard Nixon at the end of his term.\n\nAccording to a May 2012 Kaiser Health poll, popular provisions of ObamaCare favored by both parties include allowing children to stay on their parents' plans until they turn 26 and providing subsidies on a sliding scale to those who cannot afford insurance.\n\nRecently, Republican Study Committee Chairman Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., called his party's counter-proposal a 180-degree turn from ObamaCare but a closer look shows some similarities. The American Health Care Reform Act would let people buy insurance across state lines and offer tax deductions, as opposed to subsidies, to help purchase insurance. The bill would not include the mandate on almost everyone to obtain insurance, which is perhaps the least popular element of ObamaCare.\n\nOne of the biggest selling points in ObamaCare, as well as in the GOP proposal, is the coverage of adults with pre-existing conditions. Under the ACA, insurers would not be able to turn down consumers who have a history of medical problems or charge them more for coverage.\n\nThe experience with the exchanges, which are a centerpiece of the health reform plan, has been plagued by problems since their launch on Oct. 1. The rollout of the main exchange websites has been problematic, leaving Republicans hesitant to try to recreate them if they ever were in a position to try their own plan. For now, the latest budget fight proved Republicans do not have the numbers or the leverage to repeal or replace ObamaCare at this point, and may have to wait until 2016 for their next shot at changing the balance of power.",
    " Title: Trump's Decision on DACA: Congress Now in Charge\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision this week to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects approximately 800,000 immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children, has been met with criticism. The announcement was made by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, rather than by the president himself, and Trump subsequently tweeted that if Congress does not act to address the issue, he may revisit his decision.\n\nThe DACA program, established by President Barack Obama in 2012, provides temporary protection from deportation and work permits to eligible individuals who were brought to the U.S. as children. The program does not provide a permanent solution, as it is not a legislative act, but rather an executive action.\n\nThe future of DACA is now in the hands of Congress, which has the power to pass legislation that would provide a more permanent solution for these individuals, often referred to as \"Dreamers.\" Bipartisan support exists for such legislation, but it will require cooperation from both parties to pass.\n\nIn a meeting with congressional leaders this week, President Trump sided with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, supporting a proposal to keep the government funded and raise the debt ceiling for three months, rather than seeking a longer-term solution. This decision took Republicans by surprise, but it aligns with Trump's reputation for unpredictability.\n\nThe biggest impediment to passing legislation to grant permanent resident status to Dreamers has been the reluctance of GOP leaders to bring a bill to the floor that does not have majority support among Republicans. However, Speaker Ryan could potentially ignore the Hastert rule, a tactic used by former Speaker Dennis Hastert to maintain party discipline, and allow a bill to move forward.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that Dreamers are Americans in every way that matters. Half of Dreamers arrived in the U.S. when they were 6 years old or younger. They have attended American schools, graduated, and are employed at rates higher than their American-born peers. They can and should be asked to contribute to the country by paying taxes and serving in the U.S. military, but they cannot do so without permanent resident status. The alternative would be to deport hundreds of thousands of young, productive workers.\n\nCongress should work across party lines to pass immigration reform. It is the right thing to do.",
    " Title: New Polls Show Obama Leading Romney in Three Swing States\n\nArticle:\n\nNew polls conducted by Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times and Franklin and Marshall College indicate that President Barack Obama is exceeding 50% support among likely voters in the swing states of Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania. The polls show Obama leading Republican nominee Mitt Romney by margins of 9 to 12 points in these states, which together account for 67 electoral votes.\n\nThe new surveys, released on Tuesday, suggest that Romney has lost his edge on the economy, an issue that has been a key focus of his campaign. The polls were conducted after the release of secretly recorded clips from a May fundraiser during which Romney made controversial remarks about Obama supporters.\n\nIn Ohio, the Quinnipiac/CBS News/New York Times poll indicates Obama leading Romney 53% to 43% among likely voters. In Florida, the poll shows Obama at 53% and Romney at 44%. In Pennsylvania, the new Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times survey puts the president at 54% and the former Massachusetts governor at 42%.\n\nThe economy remains the top issue for Americans when it comes to their vote for president. According to the polls, voters in the three states questioned in the Quinnipiac survey saw Obama as better for handling the economy, health care, Medicare, national security, international crisis, and immigration. Romney tied or edged ahead on dealing with the budget deficit.\n\nPeter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said that while Romney's controversial remarks about Obama supporters might have influenced these polls, the economy appears to be a key factor in Obama's increasing advantage.\n\n\"The wide difference between the two candidates is not just a result of Romney's bad week. In Ohio and Florida, votes are basically split down the middle on whether the country and they and their families are worse or better off than they were four years ago,\" Brown said.\n\n\"If voters do not think they are worse off, it is difficult to see them throwing out an incumbent whose personal ratings with voters remains quite high,\" Brown added.\n\nBrown also noted that the economy remains the top issue for Americans when it comes to their vote for president. \"The president's strength results from the fact that for the first time in the entire campaign, he is seen as better able to fix the economy than is Romney, the issue that has been the Republican's calling card since the general election campaign began,\" Brown said.\n\nBoth Romney and Obama are currently campaigning in Ohio, with the Quinnipiac/CBS News/New York Times poll indicating the president leading Romney 53% to 43% among likely voters. The polls go up and down, but Obama's lead in Ohio and Florida is significant, and the economy remains a key factor in his advantage.\n\nThe first presidential debate is scheduled for next week in Denver, and the three presidential showdowns are Romney's best chance to try and change the numbers. Early voting is already underway in a handful of states, and Iowa becomes the first battleground state to begin early voting on Thursday.",

The plan, which includes an offer made to House Speaker John Boehner in December, is projected to generate $400 billion in Medicare savings over 10 years.\n\nThe proposal has drawn criticism from liberal groups, with MoveOn.org labeling the president's proposed changes to Social Security as \"unconscionable\" and Democracy for America calling the cuts \"profoundly disturbing.\"\n\nAnna Galland, executive director of MoveOn.org, stated, \"Millions of MoveOn members did not work night and day to put President Obama into office so that he could propose policies that would hurt some of our most vulnerable people.\"\n\nThe budget will reportedly include the offer Obama made to House Speaker John Boehner in December, which also included $400 billion in savings to Medicare over 10 years.\n\nFor Social Security, Obama plans to propose a switch to a key Republican request called \"chained CPI,\" which is an inflation formula. Proponents argue that chained CPI is a more accurate way to measure inflation than the current method, as it overstates growth in consumer prices. However, some critics contend that chained CPI is not a better way to measure inflation for Social Security recipients, as they spend a significant amount on health care, which rises faster than inflation.\n\nThe new budget is expected to result in $1.8 trillion in savings over 10 years and replace the forced budget cuts that took effect on March 1, also known as the sequester. The budget will also fund initiatives outlined in Obama's State of the Union address, including universal access to prekindergarten education, which will be paid for by increases to cigarette taxes.\n\nAdditionally, the plan would close a current loophole that allows people to collect disability and unemployment benefits simultaneously, a move that could create savings for the government, according to officials.\n\nThe budget's release was initially delayed, with Republicans criticizing the White House for the delay following protracted negotiations over spending cuts and tax rates. House Speaker John Boehner has stated that he and the president were never able to reach an agreement because Obama's \"offers never lived up to his rhetoric.\" Boehner added that the president has not heeded the call for common ground, as reported tax increases are still part of the plan.",

The G-7 nations imposed sanctions on Russia last year in response to its actions in Crimea and its support of pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, during a beer conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, expressed his focus on \"standing up to Russian aggression in Ukraine.\" Both leaders agreed that sanctions against Russia should not be lifted until Russian President Vladimir Putin fully implements the terms of the peace accord reached in Minsk last February.\n\nPutin, in response, asserted that Russia's actions in Crimea, Ukraine, and elsewhere are defensive, not offensive. Some European officials have expressed support for weakening the sanctions against Russia, potentially without the United States and Germany.\n\nIn addition to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the G-7 leaders also addressed the ongoing war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The general leading the effort to recapture Ramadi and other areas in Anbar province reported that the Iraqi military has secured the defense lines leading to Baghdad. However, some European leaders have expressed doubts about President Obama's strategy in combating ISIS.\n\nWith ISIS making gains in both Iraq and Syria, and Russia's Putin demonstrating military strength in Ukraine and globally, Obama's foreign policy decisions are facing scrutiny, not only from domestic critics, but also from some of America's closest allies.",
    " Title: FBI Experiences Record Number of Gun Background Checks Amidst Calls for Tighter Gun Control\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is currently handling a surge in gun background checks this year, following a series of mass shootings that have renewed calls for more restrictive gun laws. The biggest spikes in background checks occurred in August and September, after attacks in El Paso and Odessa, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, which left 38 people dead.\n\nLarry Keane, general counsel for the firearms industry trade group National Shooting Sports Foundation, stated that the increase in background checks is a response to perceived threats to the Second Amendment rights. He noted that this trend has been ongoing since August.\n\nWhile the FBI does not track gun sales, its National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) serves as a gauge of market demand. For the first time since the bureau began conducting checks in 1998, the number of monthly checks has not fallen below 2 million this year. With the holiday shopping season approaching, the number of background checks for 2019 could break the one-year record of 27.5 million.\n\nAnalysts suggest that the industry may be emerging from the \"Trump slump\" that followed the election of the pro-gun president. In 2016, when the Obama administration sought tougher gun control legislation, the FBI was inundated with requests for background checks, processing a record number of checks that year.\n\nThis year, the FBI has requested additional money and personnel to manage the workload. FBI Director Christopher Wray, in testimony before a House committee, cited increasing background checks in his request for 40 new positions and $4.2 million. Some of the money would be used for new equipment.\n\nThe FBI has dealt with the volume by reassigning nearly 300 people at various times, which has caused backlogs elsewhere, according to the budget request. The FBI has been criticized for problems with its background check system, most recently in 2017, when the Air Force failed to provide the FBI with the criminal record of a man who went on to massacre 26 people at a Texas church.\n\nEarlier this month, the Justice Department reported that the military and other federal agencies had increased their submissions of criminal and mental health records to the background check system by more than 6% in the past year. A 2018 law passed in the wake of the Texas church shooting, known as the Fix NICS Act, requires agencies to make sure they share such information with the FBI.\n\nGun check numbers need only remain steady for the rest of the year to break the record. The FBI recorded nearly 23 million checks through the end of October. The political calendar and unrelenting gun violence is likely to keep up demand for firearms.\n\nIn September, former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke caused perhaps the biggest stir during a Democratic presidential debate when he called for mandatory buybacks of popular semi-automatic rifles used in some recent attacks, including the El Paso assault. That shooting left 22 dead at a local Walmart.\n\nSeveral of the leading candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have called for measures including bans on assault-style weapons, universal background checks, and voluntary gun buybacks.",

Two major super PACs, American Crossroads, Crossroads GPS, and Priorities Action USA, have also temporarily halted their political advertisements.\n\nAndrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mitt Romney, confirmed the suspension of ads, stating, \"We are pulling all ads in Colorado until further notice.\" Jen Psaki, an Obama campaign spokeswoman, echoed the sentiment, saying, \"The president's ads are being taken down as well.\"\n\nAmerican Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, which have spent millions of dollars on attack ads against President Obama in Colorado, have also ceased their advertising efforts. Steven Law, the group's president, said, \"In moments of tragedy like the Aurora shooting, we all stand together as Americans.\"\n\nPriorities Action USA, a super PAC supporting President Obama, has also suspended its ads. Colorado is one of the battleground states where a fierce advertising war is ongoing, with most of the ads being negative in nature.\n\nPresident Obama's campaign had been airing three attack ads in Colorado, one of which mocked Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, by showing him singing \"America the Beautiful\" while headlines about his holdings in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands flashed on the screen. Another ad cited Romney's opposition to abortion, and a third claimed his economic plan would raise taxes on 18 million working families.\n\nThe two English-language ads Mitt Romney had been running in Colorado accused President Obama of showering his friends and campaign contributors with federal stimulus dollars and of lying about Romney's business record. The suspension of these ads marks a temporary pause in the intense advertising war in Colorado during this election year.",
    " Title: G-20 Summit: Tensions Emerge Between U.S. and China Despite Climate Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama attempted to downplay diplomatic tensions with China during the G-20 summit in Hangzhou, China, on Sunday, attributing the altercations to the complexities of international negotiations. Tensions between the two nations emerged as early as Saturday, with protocol issues arising upon Obama's arrival.\n\nUpon landing, no mobile staircase was prepared for the U.S. president to exit the front door of Air Force One, forcing him to leave via the lower back door, which has its own stairs. Additionally, Obama was the only national leader not to be provided with a red carpet on arrival.\n\nObama acknowledged that such incidents were not uncommon, stating, \"Part of it is we also have a much bigger footprint than a lot of other countries.\" He further explained, \"We've got a lot of planes and a lot of helicopters and a lot of cars and a lot of guys, and if you're a host country, sometimes it may feel a bit much.\"\n\nDespite the tensions, Obama emphasized that they did not detract \"from the broader scope of the relationship.\" He pointed to the productive bilateral discussions he had with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday, touching on the environment, the South China Sea, protectionism, and human rights. The two nations announced they would formally join the Paris Climate Change Agreement.\n\nObama also addressed the media, stating, \"We think it's important that the press have access to the work that we're doing, that they have the ability to answer questions.\" He added, \"We do not leave our values and ideals behind when we take these trips.\"\n\nTensions continued throughout the day, with Chinese officials blocking U.S. traveling media from watching the president disembark, and cutting American press access to the bilateral events. The press pack was reduced from six to one during Obama and Xi's evening walk along Hangzhou's famous West Lake, according to the Washington Post.\n\nNational Security Advisor Susan E. Rice and her deputy, Benjamin J. Rhodes, were also blocked from approaching President Obama on the tarmac. Later, Rice stated the Chinese had done things that \"weren't anticipated.\"\n\nThe G-20 summit continues through Monday, with Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin scheduled to meet to discuss, among other issues, the ongoing conflict in Syria.",
    " Title: Chief Justice John Roberts Admonishes Senate Impeachment Trial Participants for Lack of Civility\n\n Article:\n\n In a significant intervention during the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, Chief Justice John Roberts admonished the House managers and the president's counsel for their heated exchanges over amendments to the resolution outlining the rules and format of the trial. Roberts emphasized the need for civility and respectful discourse, citing historical precedents from the Senate.\n\n The admonishment came during an argument over whether former national security adviser John Bolton should be subpoenaed to testify before the Senate. Roberts, in his first major intervention in the trial, referred to an incident from the impeachment trial of Florida District Judge Charles Swayne in 1905, when a senator objected to a House manager using the term \"pettifogging.\"\n\n In the heated argument between Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler and White House counsel Pat Cipollone, Nadler accused senators who voted against calling Bolton to testify of being \"part of the cover-up.\" Cipollone, in response, called for Nadler to apologize to the Senate, the president, and \"most of all, you owe an apology to the American people.\"\n\n The role of John Roberts, as the presiding officer, is to maintain a fair and neutral arbiter during the trial. Jeffrey Rosen, president of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, stated, \"This is his most prominent chance on the national stage to show his commitment to being a fair, neutral arbiter.\" Roberts, according to Rosen, values the nonpartisan, institutional legitimacy of the courts above all else.\n\n For those interested in further political discussions, join our Facebook group, \"Across the Aisle, Across the Nation.\"",

A source familiar with the moves told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that health insurance premiums will be fully covered during this period.\n\nIn addition to layoffs, Vox Media is implementing several other measures, according to a source at the company. About 1% of staff are moving to reduced hours from May 1 through July 31, with health insurance premiums still fully covered. There will be a temporary tiered pay reduction for employees starting at an annual salary of $130,000 for the same time period. 401(k) matches will be suspended through the end of 2020, and there will be a freeze on merit-based increases and promotions.\n\nIn a memo to staff on Friday, Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff wrote, \"The expectations that we had just a few weeks ago for our business and our lives no longer apply.\" He added, \"When I say it\u2019s our goal to limit the impact on our employees, I mean it.\"\n\nThe pandemic is forcing dozens of major media companies to carry out layoffs and pay cuts. Group Nine Media, which includes brands like Thrillist, Seeker, The Dodo, PopSugar, and NowThis, laid off 7% of its workforce last week. Bustle Digital Group laid off two dozen staffers in early April and shuttered its tech website The Outline. Cheddar, BuzzFeed, and dozens of other digital-native websites have also resorted to layoffs, furloughs, and other measures to survive the pandemic.\n\nThe digital news industry has been reeling from a tough economic outlook for a while. Vox Media laid off roughly 50 staffers in 2018, and it also laid off hundreds of freelancers last year, after a new law passed in California that reclassified freelance journalists as contract workers.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Adds 138,000 Jobs in May; Unemployment Dips Slightly\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. economy added 138,000 jobs in May, according to the monthly jobs report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Friday. The national unemployment rate nudged lower, to 4.3 percent from 4.4 percent - a 16-year low. The 4.4 percent level had been the lowest since 2007, before the recession hit.\n\nHowever, the jobs numbers were not as strong as some were hoping to see. Economists had been expecting job gains of about 185,000, NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, and to see the unemployment rate holding steady.\n\nLast month's report initially showed job creation bouncing back in April, with the economy adding 211,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls. That figure was revised to 174,000 on Friday, a drop of 37,000. Revisions also cut disappointing March results even further, from a gain of 79,000 to a gain of only 50,000 jobs.\n\nThe numbers suggest job growth is slowing slightly, with an average gain of roughly 121,000 jobs over the past three months, compared with an average of 181,000 over the past 12 months.\n\nIn May, the number of unemployed Americans (6.9 million) remained essentially unchanged from the previous month. Since January, the unemployment rate has declined by 0.5 percentage point, and the number of unemployed has decreased by 774,000, according to the BLS.\n\n\"Among the unemployed, the number of job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs declined by 211,000 to 3.3 million in May,\" according to the BLS report.\n\nThe Department of Labor also recently released more specific data about the job markets in different U.S. cities. For metropolitan areas in April, the agency says Ames, Iowa, and Boulder, Colorado, had the lowest unemployment rates, at 1.7 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. The highest unemployment rate was in El Centro, California, at 19.2 percent.\n\nFor large cities (with a population over 1 million in the 2010 Census), the Denver area had the lowest unemployment rate, at 2.1 percent. The highest rate was in the Cleveland area, at 5.4 percent.",
    " Title: GOP Establishment Reunites with Trump as Voters' Views on Conservatism Diverge\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the presidential election campaign enters its final days, a noticeable shift has occurred within the Republican Party, with prominent members of the GOP establishment re-endorsing Donald Trump after initially distancing themselves from the nominee.\n\nNotable figures such as Jason Chaffetz, the former House Oversight Committee chair, and Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska, have returned to Trump's camp after initially withdrawing their endorsements following the release of the \"grab 'em by the pussy\" tape. Even Trump skeptic and conservative pundit Hugh Hewitt has joined the ranks of those backing the Republican nominee.\n\nThe rift between the GOP elites and their voters has become increasingly apparent, as the elites' interpretation of conservatism, often defined as economic, social, and defense conservatism, has been challenged by the base's beliefs, which some perceive as racism, sexism, and nationalism.\n\nA new Pew Research Center poll reveals that the hope among GOP elders for a return to the previous status quo, where the party's base is perceived as caring about issues like tort reform and the capital gains tax, is unlikely. The poll shows that 65% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters believe Trump represents the core principles and positions the Republican Party should stand for, while 31% think he does not.\n\nThe divide between conservative and moderate or liberal Republicans is significant, with conservative Republican voters being far more likely to view Trump as representative of the party's principles. In contrast, only about half of moderate and liberal Republican voters see Trump as embodying the party's core values.\n\nThe election's outcome will likely determine the future direction of the Republican Party, with a Trump victory potentially leading to a quick consolidation under his leadership. Even if Trump loses, the genie cannot be put back in the bottle, as the party's base's views on conservatism have become increasingly clear.\n\nTrump's political beliefs have remained consistent throughout his campaign, with a focus on foreign policy and law and order. His stance on immigration, Obamacare, and Common Core, among other issues, has been shaped by right-wing media, as reported by New York magazine's Gabriel Sherman. Trump's earliest advisers, including notorious trickster Roger Stone and right-wing lawyer Sam Nunberg, provided him with insights into the GOP base's concerns.\n\nThe Republican Party's future remains uncertain, as the divide between the GOP elites and their voters becomes more pronounced. The party's base's views on conservatism, as expressed by Trump, have challenged the traditional definition and may lead to a significant shift in the party's direction, regardless of the election's outcome.",
    " Title: President Obama Strengthens Alliances in Asia Through Trans-Pacific Partnership\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama has recently spent time in the Philippines and Malaysia, focusing on strengthening alliances in Asia and building multilateral organizations in a region that is shaping global economic and political rules. The economic centerpiece of America's Asia policy is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a comprehensive trade and investment pact among 12 countries representing 40% of global GDP and 30% of global trade.\n\nThe TPP, which is currently under debate in Congress, is a crucial part of the effort to secure the Pacific Rim trade deal. The agreement, if approved, will be a linchpin in the TPP's development into a Free Trade Area of the Pacific, potentially including all 21 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries and non-APEC countries such as India and Columbia.\n\nWhile the economic benefits of the TPP have been the primary focus of the debate, the agreement's impact on security is another less-discussed aspect that reinforces the economic arguments in support of the pact. The TPP provisions and deeper engagement with trading partners are essential for protecting the United States from non-traditional security risks.\n\nThese risks include the re-emergence of pandemic diseases, such as Severe Acute Respiratory System (SARS), which was first discovered in Asia and killed thousands as it spread to three dozen countries. The World Bank estimates SARS cost the global economy $54 billion, and the costs of a future pandemic might be as high as $3 trillion. Other non-traditional challenges relate to human health, such as food security and nutrition, which have a significant impact on the productivity of countries that have signed the agreement.\n\nThe TPP also addresses some non-traditional risks more explicitly. For example, illegal fishing would decline, helping meet the nutritional needs of the developing world and lessening disruptive human migration. The deal also aims to reduce deforestation and illegal animal trafficking, which contribute to climate change and the incidence of zoonotic diseases.\n\nOther explicit benefits include improving transparency and non-discrimination provisions with regard to state-linked companies and government procurement. When people describe the TPP as the highest quality trade deal ever negotiated, it's in part because of these benefits, which haven't been found in previous free trade agreements.\n\nGreater global interdependence has increased the non-traditional security challenges we face. The TPP would help manage these challenges by raising the capital of our trade partners and binding us together in the common cause of promoting a rules-based, sustainable global economy. Such an alliance will be necessary if we are to lessen the impact of the risks we all face.\n\nThe TPP is more than the sum of its terms. For our friends across the Pacific, it is a capacity-builder promoting a more peaceful and prosperous world. The United States increasingly will need to ally with its political and economic partners to help address the full range of security issues. The failure of our friends to do so will contribute to our own.\n\nToday's risks are tomorrow's security crises. The violence this week is a stark reminder that the world is a very dangerous place, and the United States needs strong partners to keep Americans safe. A century ago, President Woodrow Wilson remarked that \"we are citizens of the world.... The tragedy of our times is that we do not know this.\" The world has become even more intertwined since his observation. The far-reaching benefits of the TPP bring into clear focus the realization that we must do our part to fulfill America's obligation as a leading citizen of the world.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Hear Lawsuit Against Obama's 2014 Immigration Executive Actions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court has announced that it will hear a lawsuit filed by 26 states against President Obama's 2014 executive actions aimed at protecting millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. The decision is expected by the end of June.\n\nThe states' standing to sue the president in the first place has been contested, and the substantive claims have been deemed groundless. The United States is home to over 11 million undocumented immigrants. The feasibility of deporting all of them is widely questioned, with the focus instead shifting towards addressing public safety concerns and deferring action on most of the remaining immigrants, while helping them to come out of the shadows.\n\nIn 2012, the Obama administration implemented a program that granted work permits and exempted young immigrants brought to the country as children from deportation. In November 2014, the president announced a plan to offer work permits and a three-year reprieve from deportation to as many as five million undocumented parents of American citizens or permanent residents, provided they had no criminal record and had lived in the country for at least five years.\n\nThe issue of integrating hardworking, community-rooted undocumented immigrants is not a new one. In a 1980 presidential debate, George Bush criticized harsh efforts to marginalize undocumented immigrants, stating, \"We're creating a whole society of really honorable, decent, family-loving people that are in violation of the law.\" President Obama, along with other politically-reality-based figures on both the left and the right, shares this understanding, but congressional Republicans have failed to pass any meaningful immigration reform.",
    " Title: Gun Control Advocacy Shifts from Capitol Hill to Main Street\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre last December, President Barack Obama called for an end to the nation's indifference towards gun violence. However, a year and a failed Senate vote later, the major players in the gun control push have retreated from the public eye, with the fight moving from Capitol Hill to Main Street.\n\nThe focus has shifted from an immediate public push for legislation in Congress to a series of local events across the country and the building of a political infrastructure capable of competing with the National Rifle Association (NRA). Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, which organized a successful campaign this summer to pressure Starbucks into banning guns from its cafes, is preparing a similar effort aimed at McDonald's, according to the organization's founder, Shannon Watts.\n\nSaturday's anniversary of the Sandy Hook tragedy was not marked by a significant political event in Washington D.C. The Newtown families requested a solemn remembrance rather than a political production. President Obama marked the massacre's anniversary with a private moment of silence at the White House, rather than visiting Connecticut or attending the National Cathedral memorial service.\n\nThe nation's latest school shooting, which left a shooter dead and a classmate in critical condition on Friday, did not come as a surprise. The White House released a statement saying Obama was briefed about the situation and that federal officials remain in touch with their local law enforcement counterparts.\n\nGun control advocates have learned political lessons from the Newtown shooting, where the Senate waited four months to vote on background check legislation. Not only did they lose momentum and give the NRA a chance to rally its supporters, but the 20 years of inaction on gun control meant lawmakers were not well-versed on the issue.\n\n\"The infrastructure just wasn't there to turn it around quickly\u2014the knowledge wasn't there among Hill staff, among members of Congress who hadn't voted on it for a decade,\" said Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, the director of social policy and politics at Third Way, a centrist think tank. \"Now all of us know a heck of a lot more about this. We won't need to take so much time to figure that out. If there is a tragedy that specifically involves one of the policies we're talking about, we'll see more swift action.\"\n\nLast year, when Obama returned to Washington after speaking at the Newtown memorial service, Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, was the first gun control activist to get a White House meeting. This was partly because he was the only game in town. Since then, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' Americans for Responsible Solutions, the Sandy Hook Promise, and Moms Demand Action have all formed. The post-Obama campaign nonprofit Organizing for Action launched in January with gun violence prevention as one of its four main policy areas.\n\nOFA solicited its members recently to host Newtown anniversary vigils but said it was not using the date to make a policy push; volunteers were simply \"coming together in their communities in remembrance of the tragic events in Newtown a year ago,\" a spokesman said. The low-key events were meant to keep activists engaged and lawmakers from forgetting the issue. They are also planning for the midterm elections while doing the macabre job of preparing a response for what they see as the inevitability of the next mass shooting while at the same time making the fight as much cultural as political.\n\n\"I hope there's not a next time, but if there is, we've laid the groundwork; we've got momentum across the country,\" said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Democrats' gun violence task force.\n\nShannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, is at the forefront of this effort. Watts, a mother and stepmother of five, is the head of an organization aiming to become the MADD of gun control. Watts hopes to make background checks a women's issue, similar to how abortion rights are, forcing candidates, particularly Democrats, to forcefully support it. The McDonald's campaign, coming off the successful Starbucks effort, won't be the last.\n\n\"There are more white whales out there,\" she said in an interview at a Capitol Hill Starbucks.",
    " Title: Reflection on 2016 Election Predictions and Trump Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2016 presidential election has led to introspection for many, including political commentator and conservative critic of Donald Trump, David French. French, who was a vocal \"Never Trump\" supporter during the primaries and general election, has faced criticism from both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nIn an article, French admits to getting the election wrong, as he had predicted a Clinton victory, but he argues that this does not mean he was wrong about Trump as a person or his presidency. French states that the idea that getting the election wrong equates to being wrong about Trump's character is a flawed assumption.\n\nFrench acknowledges that he got some things wrong about what a Trump presidency would look like, but he is pleasantly surprised by the conservative-leaning appointments and policy proposals made by the Trump administration. He also notes the benefits of having a political novice in the White House, citing Trump's unconventional approach to diplomacy and policy-making.\n\nHowever, French emphasizes that he is concerned about Trump's character, citing his reported lack of interest in daily intelligence briefings, his impulsive behavior, and his disregard for policy due diligence. French states that he firmly believes that character is destiny and that Trump's character troubles him deeply.\n\nDespite the criticism and self-reflection, French does not express remorse, but acknowledges that if the Trump administration's serious and sober-minded advisors can constrain and contain the dangerous aspects of Trump's character, he may reconsider his stance.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Government Funding Deal Stalled Amid Border Wall Dispute\n\nArticle:\n\nWith the departure of President Donald Trump from office, a bipartisan deal to fund the government ahead of the holidays appears unlikely due to the ongoing border wall dispute. The House and Senate left town on Thursday without a strategy to prevent a partial government shutdown next week, putting Congress on the brink of an intractable conflict that could last through New Year's Day, furloughing hundreds of thousands of workers and costing taxpayers millions.\n\nLawmakers in both parties are frustrated, stating that congressional leaders have made no progress since Tuesday, when Trump announced that he would take the blame for a government shutdown if he does not receive funding for his border wall. There is no public or secret plan to prevent a partial government shutdown, according to lawmakers.\n\n\"There is no discernable plan. None that\u2019s been disclosed,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, as he threw his hands into the air. \"Everybody\u2019s looking to [Trump] for a signal about what he wants to do. So far, it\u2019s not clear.\"\n\nThe House is not planning to return until the night of Dec. 19, leaving only about 72 hours to reach a border wall deal that has eluded both parties for months. Democrats say they are waiting on Republicans, and Republicans say they are waiting on Trump.\n\nWith one week to go, the GOP must find an agreement that can satisfy both Trump and Democratic leaders, who have only grown more emboldened since their sit-down with Trump. \"I\u2019ve not heard of any Republican who\u2019s sitting down and figuring out how to get this through. There\u2019s no plan,\" said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.).\n\nThere is no indication that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are even talking. Senators in both parties said they were unaware of anything cooking between the two leaders, and the often-chatty Schumer was tight-lipped when asked if there were ongoing discussions. \"No comment,\" he said Thursday.\n\nThe House was expected to make the first move this week, with House GOP leaders planning to try and pass a bill giving $5 billion for Trump's wall and forcing Senate Democrats to reject it under the chamber's 60-vote threshold. However, with morale and attendance low in the House following a brutal election loss last month, Republicans left Washington empty-handed, with all eyes now focused on the Senate.\n\n\"It\u2019s just all politics and theatrics,\" said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.). He said leaders of both parties have the same thought going into next week's final round of negotiations: \"Somebody has to lose, and it\u2019s going to not be them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats say they are completely in the dark because Republican leaders have not taken part in formal back-and-forth negotiations for more than two weeks, according to a Democratic aide. Republicans have already rejected the Democratic proposal to freeze the budget of the Department of Homeland Security, including border fencing, through next October, while approving new funding for the rest of the government. However, Democrats say they have had radio silence since then from the GOP.\n\nPrivately, some GOP appropriators have been told to prepare backup options to temporarily extend funding, though they admit they have little confidence that the bills could be signed by Trump without a cash infusion for the border wall. Some Republicans say they want to delay the decision until Jan. 3 at 11:59 p.m., the exact minute when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) would take over leadership in the House. Others are pushing GOP leaders to move the deadline to Dec. 26 to give them at least a few days at home with their families for Christmas.\n\nAnother idea\u2014that some appropriators are already preparing\u2014is a long-term funding bill that freezes funding through October 2019. \"We\u2019re at an impasse. Something\u2019s going to happen or we\u2019re going to have to have a [continuing resolution] or a shutdown,\" said Senate Appropriations chief Richard Shelby (R-Ala.).\n\nSix of the seven spending bills are ready to go next week, which would make up nearly $200 billion in total spending. However, Republican leaders in the House are refusing to put any spending package on the floor that doesn't include border wall money. Meanwhile, Democratic leaders have hammered Trump for his vow that he would be \"proud\" to shutter one-quarter of the government\u2014delaying paychecks for hundreds of thousands of federal workers\u2014over the holidays.",
    " Title: Trump Defends Puerto Rico Relief Efforts, Criticizes San Juan Mayor and Media\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has defended his administration's response to the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico, dismissing critics of his relief efforts as \"fake news\" and \"politically motivated ingrates.\" In a series of tweets and public statements, Trump has accused Puerto Rico's mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, of acting on behalf of Democrats and being \"nasty\" towards him.\n\nCruz, however, has maintained that she was only appealing for quicker help to save lives. In an interview with MSNBC, Cruz stated, \"I was not saying anything nasty about the president.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday to review rescue efforts. He may also visit the U.S. Virgin Islands, which is also undergoing a hurricane relief effort. Puerto Rico National Guard Maj. Paul Dahlen stated that the president's expected visit to the island is not affecting aid deliveries or any other relief operations.\n\nIn a third tweet on Sunday morning, Trump praised Puerto Rico's governor, Ricardo Rossello, and thanked him and \"all of those who are working so closely with our First Responders. Fantastic job!\"\n\nRossello told reporters on Sunday that the U.S. Defense Department has increased its presence on the island, and the emphasis remains on ensuring that \"food, water and other supplies get delivered to the people of Puerto Rico.\" However, when asked whether all buildings were inspected for safety as Trump had claimed, Rossello said, \"I\u2019m not sure about that. There are areas in Puerto Rico that we haven\u2019t gotten in contact.\"\n\nTrump also drew criticism for stating that some people in Puerto Rico \"want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.\" FEMA Administrator Brock Long acknowledged major challenges remain and there \"is still a long way to go,\" but he said a lot has been accomplished.\n\nPolitical opponents have contrasted Trump's approach to Puerto Rico with his recent hurricane recovery efforts in Texas and Florida. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) suggested skin color may be a factor in Trump's response, while Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich stated it is \"not appropriate\" for Trump to criticize public officials who are \"in the middle of a disaster.\"\n\nCruz herself appeared to dismiss Trump's tweets during an interview on ABC's This Week, saying that \"any dialogue that goes on just has to be able to produce results.\" As for Trump's visit, Cruz said, \"If he asks to meet with me, of course I will meet with him.\"",
    " Title: Media Policy and Political Polarization: The Impact of the Telecommunications Act of 1996\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996, a comprehensive overhaul of US media policy, has been linked to the rising political polarization in the United States. The act relaxed ownership regulations, leading to an increase in television channels on cable TV systems and the emergence of partisan news outlets like Fox News and MSNBC.\n\nResearch indicates that partisan news outlets attract distinct audiences, with conservatives favoring Fox News and liberals preferring MSNBC. The availability of such content is significant, as studies show that watching content on these outlets contributes to political polarization. Furthermore, increased niche programming allows non-partisans to tune out politics altogether.\n\nA recent study published in the International Journal of Public Opinion Research suggests that structural changes to media systems, such as the Telecommunications Act of 1996, can alter the relationship between media and polarization. The study found that the relationship between media and polarization changed after 1996, with TV news contributing more to polarization following the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 than it did before.\n\nFrequent consumers of TV news showed greater increases in polarization on a year-to-year basis after 1996 compared to individuals who spent less time watching TV news. This suggests that the policy changes may have encouraged the introduction of partisan media outlets and contributed to an increase in horse race coverage, focusing on the positive and negative traits of candidates rather than policy debates.\n\nCritics argue that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 led to media consolidation, with companies like the Disney Corporation purchasing major TV networks like ABC. Decreased competition among cable companies following the law has been linked to hikes in cable prices, incentivizing media companies like Fox to create their own cable networks. This resulted in an increase in the number of cable stations owned by big media companies.\n\nThe addition of partisan news sources to the media system provides viewers with an opportunity to seek out information that supports their existing worldview. Scholars have noted that when these media conglomerates took control of networks, news coverage suffered. News is now seen as an additional source of profit instead of a public service for viewers. This shift may have contributed to increasing levels of cheap, conflict-oriented programming, which has the potential to increase people's level of polarization.\n\nIn conclusion, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 appears to have played a role in the rise of political polarization by encouraging the introduction of partisan media outlets, contributing to an increase in horse race coverage, and potentially leading to decreased funding of news departments, resulting in cheap, conflict-oriented programming.",
    " Title: Trump Faces Pressure to Show More Presidential Tone at Saturday's Republican Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nWith the South Carolina Republican primary vote scheduled for February 20, the upcoming debate on Saturday night at 9 p.m. EST is a critical event for Donald Trump's opponents, who aim to question the New York billionaire's suitability before it's too late. The debate comes as Trump, who won handily in New Hampshire after placing second in Iowa, maintains a significant lead in South Carolina polls, potentially positioning him for the party's presidential nomination by November 8.\n\nThe debate's participants include Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Ohio Governor John Kasich, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. These candidates are competing to emerge as the top alternative to Trump for mainstream Republicans.\n\nRepublican strategist Doug Heye described the debate as a \"melee.\" In previous debates, attempts to challenge Trump have been unsuccessful, with the former reality TV star demonstrating quick reflexes and a dismissive attitude towards rivals.\n\nTrump's use of vulgar language during the New Hampshire primary campaign, repeating a comment from a rally attendee who called Cruz a \"pussy,\" may raise concerns in South Carolina, where evangelicals form a significant voting bloc.\n\nAt a candidates' forum at evangelical Bob Jones University on Friday, Bush addressed the front-running candidate's use of obscenities, asking the crowd, \"Is anybody worried about the front-running candidate shouting out obscenities at children?\" Trump was not present, sending Pastor Mark Burns to speak on his behalf. When Burns stated that Trump is \"pro-faith,\" someone from the audience shouted, \"Trump is profane.\"\n\nEach candidate faces specific challenges ahead of the debate. Rubio needs to demonstrate his ability to rebound from a poor debate performance in New Hampshire, while Kasich aims to generate more momentum after a second-place finish in New Hampshire. Cruz seeks to solidify his position with evangelical voters, and Bush needs to gain upward movement in any area possible. Carson, whose campaign has slowed, must demonstrate that he remains in the race.\n\nDavid Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University, noted that each candidate has an image issue to address. \"Can Trump start acting more presidential without losing what makes him so appealing? Can Jeb continue the flicker of momentum he has coming out of New Hampshire? Have Rubio's bruises healed? Can Carson show something that puts a spark back into his campaign? Has Kasich got more than his New Hampshire game?\"\n\nAs the debate approaches, Trump has been targeting Cruz and Bush, who finished third and fourth in the New Hampshire primary, respectively. In response to an attack ad run by the Cruz campaign, Trump tweeted that he might sue Cruz to settle any remaining questions about his eligibility to run for president, given that he was born in Canada.\n\nCruz and many legal experts argue that Cruz meets the constitutional requirements, as he was born to an American mother and grew up in the United States. However, Trump, who has previously questioned President Barack Obama's citizenship, tweeted against Cruz, stating, \"If @ TedCruz does not clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural-born citizen.\" The Cruz campaign dismissed Trump's comments as a \"Trumper-tantrum.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Claims of Election Rigging: A Historical Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has expressed concerns about the upcoming November election being \"rigged\" against him. At a rally in Columbus, Ohio, Trump stated, \"I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged. I have to be honest.\" This sentiment was echoed by Trump's unofficial advisor, Roger Stone, who has a history of promoting conspiracy theories.\n\nTrump's allegations of election rigging are not a new tactic. During the GOP primaries, similar claims were made when the primaries were not favoring Trump. By making these claims, Trump is laying the groundwork for a potential explanation of a loss in November. Since Trump's campaign is based on winning, he cannot admit to the possibility of losing fair and square, leading him to believe someone must have stolen the election.\n\nThis line of attack is reminiscent of the supporters of past Republican presidential losers. Trump is essentially amplifying the paranoia about supposedly shady Democrats and biased mainstream media, making it a part of his official campaign narrative.\n\nIn the past, such talk was considered undignified for a presidential candidate. It was often left to campaign surrogates or fringe figures. During the 2012 election, for instance, conservative activist Dean Chambers ran the website UnskewedPolls.com, claiming polls were weighted in favor of Democrats. Chambers' re-weighted polling numbers showed a narrow win for Mitt Romney in the Electoral College. However, when Obama won with 332 electoral votes to Romney's 206, Chambers blamed his failure on voter fraud.\n\nDemocratic-leaning voters have also voiced concerns about \"stolen\" or \"rigged\" elections, but these claims have generally remained on the fringes of the party. In 2004, there were calls for contesting the general election results in Ohio over allegations of tampering with electronic voting machines. However, these calls never gained traction within John Kerry's campaign.\n\nComparatively, the infamous election of 2000 saw a disinformation campaign by Republicans, claiming Democratic officials in Florida were manipulating the recount in Miami-Dade County. This led to the infamous Brooks Brothers riot, where khaki-clad Republicans disrupted a ballot recount meeting.\n\nIronically, one of the leaders of the Brooks Brothers riot was none other than Trump's current advisor, Roger Stone. Thus, Donald Trump's claims of election rigging and potential post-election disputes are not unprecedented, and he will likely have support from various sectors of the Republican Party and right-wing media. However, the candidate himself openly discussing claims of stolen elections three months before voting starts is a departure from past practices. This suggests that Trump may not accept a loss gracefully if he loses the election.",
    " Title: Obama Declares State of the Union as \"Stronger,\" Amidst Persisting Economic Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama declared that the state of the union is \"stronger.\" However, this assertion has been met with skepticism, as millions of Americans continue to struggle with unemployment, and the country grapples with the aftermath of economic bailouts and government programs.\n\nThe President's optimistic assessment overlooks the challenges faced by many Americans, including those still unemployed and the taxpayers who have shouldered the burdens of government initiatives that have not yielded the expected results. The President's second-term agenda includes a range of issues, such as gun control, global warming, immigration, and raising the minimum wage.\n\nDuring his address, President Obama assured the nation that his proposals would not increase the deficit. He emphasized the need for a \"smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.\" However, it is worth noting that the national debt has more than doubled since Obama took office, currently standing at approximately $16 trillion, compared to around $10 trillion at the start of his presidency.\n\nCritics argue that the President's economic policies have not been effective in reducing the deficit, as he had promised during his first term. Instead, the deficit has grown significantly. The President's latest proposal aims to create jobs, which he described as the \"North Star\" that should guide the nation's efforts.\n\nThe address was met with a mixed response, with some finding the President's optimism inspiring, while others questioned the feasibility of his proposals and the accuracy of his statements. Vice President Joe Biden was seen wiping tears from his eyes during the address, while House Speaker John Boehner maintained a stoic expression. The Vice President, in an attempt to keep up with the President's optimistic tone, was seen wearing rose-colored glasses during the speech.",
    " Title: \"Trumbull's 'Declaration of Independence' - A Depiction of Historical Fact and Portraiture Accuracy\"\n\nArticle:\n\nJohn Trumbull's painting, \"Declaration of Independence,\" is a well-known and iconic representation of the momentous event that took place on July 4, 1776, when the United States declared its independence from Great Britain. However, the painting, which has hung in the Rotunda of the Capitol in Washington for nearly two centuries, depicts a scene that did not occur as portrayed.\n\nIn the painting, the five men appointed to draft the Declaration of Independence\u2014John Adams, Roger Sherman, Robert Livingston, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin\u2014are shown presenting their draft to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. However, it was on June 28 that the committee's original draft was reported to the Congress, and only Jefferson, who chaired the drafting committee, would have submitted the document to the presiding officer. The vote in favor of independence came on July 2, and the final text was agreed upon and sent for printing on the morning of July 4.\n\nThe signing of the document took place two weeks later, on August 2. There was no ceremony or posed formality, and some congressional delegates did not affix their signatures for months, while others, including Livingston, never had a chance to sign at all.\n\nTrumbull also took liberties with many of the painting's physical details, such as the seating arrangements, window treatments, and congressional tableau. However, when it came to the likenesses of the men depicted, Trumbull prioritized authenticity. He painted many of the signers from life, traveling extensively to sketch or paint them in person. Trumbull, who himself fought in the Revolutionary War, was passionate about preserving the true-to-life facsimiles of the \"great actors\" in what he considered \"the noblest series of actions which have ever presented themselves in the history of man.\"\n\nTrumbull's painting, while not an accurate depiction of the events that transpired on July 4, 1776, serves as a valuable historical record of the likenesses of the founding fathers. The painting took more than 30 years to complete, and Trumbull journeyed extensively to sketch or paint in person as many of the surviving signers as he could find. He recorded some of his travels, noting that he painted Adams in London, Jefferson in Paris, Hancock and Samuel Adams in Boston, and others in various locations. Trumbull's dedication to capturing the personal resemblance of the founding fathers ensures that their images will be remembered for generations to come.",
    " Title: K-pop Fans' Online Activism: A Double-Edged Sword\n\nArticle:\n\nK-pop fans have recently gained attention for their online activism, with thousands of tickets registered for President Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, allegedly with the intention of not showing up. The event, which saw the arena appearing more than half empty, has been interpreted by some as a demonstration of solidarity with Black Lives Matter protesters and Juneteenth celebrants.\n\nThis is not the first instance of K-pop fans' online activism. Earlier this month, they sabotaged a surveillance app used by the Dallas Police Department, and they have also derailed a \"White Lives Matter\" hashtag.\n\nWhile these actions have been celebrated by many on the left, including politicians and protesters, they have also sparked discussions about K-pop's history of cultural misappropriation and racism. In recent years, Korean pop idols have been called out for perpetuating stereotypes about black Americans and for misappropriating black culture. Artists have also received backlash for statements like claiming they are skilled at \"talking Black\" and for racist acts like wearing blackface.\n\nMiranda Ruth Larsen, a K-pop fan and cultural studies researcher at the University of Tokyo, whose work focuses on male Korean and Japanese idols and groups, discussed this issue on the Reset podcast. She stated, \"It sounds sort of racist because it often is racist.\"\n\nLarsen emphasized that the cultural misappropriation within K-pop should not be solely blamed on the artists. \"So let's say that a K-pop artist is wearing a controversial hairstyle\u2014like they're wearing dreads or they're wearing cornrows\u2014eight times out of 10, they did not pick that hairstyle,\" Larsen said. \"The decision for their hairstyle came from a company, came to a manager, came through an entire chain of command that is responsible and culpable for this bad decision.\"\n\nLarsen believes it is crucial for fans and journalists to understand this history and the workings of the industry to get a full picture of the recent online activism campaigns coming from K-pop fandoms. Without this understanding, it is impossible to fully comprehend the nature of these activist actions.\n\nThis article aims to provide factual information and promote understanding, as part of \u2588\u2588\u2588's mission to answer important questions and offer free articles, videos, and podcasts that have the power to save lives. \u2588\u2588\u2588's work is reaching more people than ever, but resources are needed to continue this vital work during a pandemic and an economic downturn.

    " Title: White House Hesitant to Verify Latest Claims of Chemical Weapons Use in Syria, Maintains Investigation Ongoing\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has not ruled out providing further assistance to Syrian rebel groups following opposition claims that the government of Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons to kill over 1,000 people. The administration is seeking an urgent United Nations (U.N.) investigation and demanding accountability, but has not yet verified the authenticity of the videos purportedly showing civilians suffering from chemical agents outside Damascus.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest stated, \"There is an investigation team that's on the ground in Syria right now. And we are hopeful that the Assad regime will follow through on what they have claimed previously, that they are interested in a credible investigation that gets to the bottom of reports that chemical weapons have been used.\"\n\nThe Obama administration has been facing pressure to take more decisive steps in Syria, and the latest development could potentially change the overall calculus for the United States. Key questions that would arise include what new steps the U.S. would take, how it would address uncertainty about the rebel makeup, and how it would approach the worsening trust gap regarding rebel assistance.\n\nThe administration has previously opted for a political solution and provided humanitarian, logistical, and limited weaponry and other hardware, but has faced challenges in identifying which rebel groups to support due to their alleged ties to militant groups, including some with ties to al Qaeda.\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, wrote in a letter to Rep. Eliot Engel of New York that Syria is not about choosing between two sides, but rather about choosing one among many sides. He expressed concern that the chosen side may not be ready to promote their interests and those of the U.S. when the balance shifts in their favor.\n\nPolitical mistrust, sharp partisan divisions in Washington, and close congressional vetting have also influenced the response to Syria. According to experts who have traveled to Syria during the war, opposition groups have little faith in the U.S. David Lesch, Middle East history professor at Trinity University and author of \"Syria: The Fall of the House of Assad,\" stated, \"Our credibility was not high to begin with and obviously did not improve with time. They basically shrug their shoulders and say, 'Oh well, what is new?' They feel like they are on their own on this.\"\n\nThis is the second time the administration has faced questions about chemical weapons use in Syria. Last August, President Barack Obama said using chemical weapons would cross a \"red line\" and provoke a U.S. military response. However, the \"red line\" tag has reportedly damaged U.S. credibility in the region. Andrew Tabler, author of \"In the Lion's Den: An Eyewitness Account of Washington's Battle with Syria,\" stated, \"Reacting way too late - that has been our policy on Syria for some time.\"\n\nA team of U.N. chemical weapons inspectors landed in Syria this week to begin probing chemical weapons allegations, and the U.N. Security Council planned a meeting on Wednesday to address the issue.",
    " Title: The Evolution and Challenges of Journalistic Objectivity in American History\n\nArticle:\n\nThe contemporary debate over journalistic objectivity and accuracy is a contentious issue, with concerns being raised from both sides of the political spectrum. On the right, there is an increasing embrace of partisan slants in news reporting, as seen in outlets like Breitbart, Fox News, and various right-wing imitators. On the left, outlets such as Truthout, HuffPost, and the New York Times have been criticized for sloppiness and displays of partisanship, driven in part by hostility towards President Trump and the Republican Party, as well as economic pressure to generate online traffic and increase ad revenue.\n\nHowever, it is essential to recognize that the standards of fairness and accuracy often associated with journalism are not the American norm. These standards became the norm in the decades following World War II, as the bipartisan centrist-liberal consensus that prevailed in political culture left its mark on the media. This was also a time of unprecedented uniformity in the institutions that delivered the news to the American people.\n\nBefore the mid-20th century, newspapers were explicitly tied to different parties and factions, and regularly used blistering language to denounce those on other sides of political disputes. They also published rumors and conspiracy theories alongside factual accounts of events, often mixing the one in with the other. This informal and blatantly slanted style of reportage continued down through the 19th century.\n\nIn the words of historian Christopher Childers, during the time of the Civil War, the partisan press often acted as a part of the campaign apparatus, a standard practice that most Americans accepted. Candidates used partisan newspapers to promote themselves and their platform without worrying about anything resembling the objective journalism that modern political observers claim we have lost. From the vantage point of the 19th century, the non-partisan media seems the anomaly.\n\nIt was an anomaly\u2014and an extremely salutary one. As the United States became a global hegemon at the close of World War II, the American press became professionalized and set itself the goal of serving as an arbiter of extra-partisan truth. The new standards were ideals\u2014goals to strive for while often falling short. But they also did lots of good, imposing rigor on reporting and giving journalists formal and informal guidelines about how to report in a trustworthy and fair-minded way about the world.\n\nMany reporters, editors, publishers, and broadcast news producers still work very hard to realize these ideals today\u2014reporting aggressively but also with great care, double- and triple-checking sources and facts, reflecting thoughtfully on the competing demands of the public's right to know and the need for government secrecy.\n\nHowever, growing numbers of media companies and personalities are also willing to cut corners or abandon these norms entirely in the pursuit of influence and profit. The result is a reversion to the flagrantly partisan norms that prevailed before the mid-20th century. The consequences of this shift are uncertain, but it is hard to imagine them being good. The centrifugal forces driving political polarization contribute to the breakdown of trans-partisan journalistic norms, which in turn makes the polarization worse. The feedback loop then breeds cynicism and contributes to the collapse of social trust and the erosion of the authority of all institutions that claim to speak for and act in the name of the common good.\n\nBefore long, it can begin to seem that it's impossible to evaluate the world dispassionately\u2014that claims to objectivity itself are just masks concealing insidious power-grabs. This may sound like a headlong leap into postmodern relativism, but it's really a plunge back into the rancorous squabbles and sometimes insurrectionary clashes of an earlier era in American history\u2014before the country achieved its power and influence on the world stage or attained its still-formidable economic might.\n\nCan the country maintain its power and prestige with a citizenry that treats every item of news about the world with maximal suspicion, and when public debate about matters large and small invariably takes the form of acrimonious partisan vituperation? We do not yet know the answer. But in the coming years, we're likely to find out.",
    " Title: US Health Secretary Calls for Expanded Health Care Access Without \"Reproductive Health and Rights\" References at UN General Assembly\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech delivered at the United Nations General Assembly today, US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called for expanded access to health care without the inclusion of terms such as \"reproductive health and rights.\"\n\nAzar stated, \"We do not support references to ambiguous terms and expressions, such as sexual and reproductive health and rights, in UN documents because they can undermine the critical role of the family and promote practices like abortion in circumstances that do not enjoy international consensus and which can be misinterpreted by UN agencies.\"\n\nThe statement, suggesting a stance against abortion, was presented during a high-level meeting on universal health coverage. The meeting aims to accelerate progress toward universal health coverage for everyone around the world, which would include access to health care services, medicines, and vaccines. The effort is part of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, under which all countries have committed to try to achieve universal health coverage by 2030.\n\nAzar further stated, \"We therefore request that the UN, including UN agencies, focus on concrete efforts that enjoy broad consensus among member states.\" He added, \"To that end, only documents that have been adopted by all member states should be cited in UN resolutions.\"\n\nIn his remarks, Azar was joined by health officials from Guatemala, Brazil, Iraq, Poland, and Hungary. He said that he and the other health officials were speaking on behalf of the United States, Bahrain, Belarus, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Guatemala, Haiti, Hungary, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.\n\nAzar concluded, \"We support equal access to health care which includes but is not limited to reproductive concerns, maternal health, voluntary and informed family planning, HIV, elimination of violence against women and girls, and empowerment to reach the highest standard of health.\" He emphasized, \"Let us focus on concrete issues and challenges to accelerate access to health for all.

    " Title: CNN/ORC Poll Shows Shift in Midterm Election Outlook for U.S. Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nA new CNN/ORC International poll indicates a significant change in the battle for control of the U.S. Congress in next year's midterm elections. The poll, conducted last week and released Tuesday, shows the Republican Party with a 49% to 47% advantage over the Democratic Party among registered voters in a generic ballot question.\n\nThe generic ballot question asks respondents to choose between a Democrat or a Republican in their congressional district without identifying the candidates. In a similar poll conducted a month ago, the Democrats held a 50% to 42% advantage.\n\nThe shift in the poll results follows a political uproar over the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which included the botched rollout of HealthCare.gov and controversy over insurance policy cancelations due primarily to the new health law.\n\nThe turnaround in the CNN/ORC poll follows similar shifts in recent national surveys from Quinnipiac University and Fox News. At a news conference two weeks ago, President Barack Obama acknowledged that problems plaguing the startup of the new healthcare law could hurt Democrats.\n\n\"There is no doubt that our failure to rollout the ACA smoothly has put a burden on Democrats, whether they are running or not, because they stood up and supported this effort through thick and thin,\" Obama said.\n\nThe CNN/ORC poll, released as the President makes a West Coast campaign fundraising swing on behalf of fellow Democrats, indicates both parties making gains within their base. According to CNN Polling Director Keating Holland, \"The biggest shifts toward the Republicans came among white voters, higher-income Americans, and people who live in rural areas, while Democrats have gained strength in the past month among some of their natural constituencies, such as non-white voters and lower-income Americans.\"\n\n\"If those patterns persist into 2014, it may indicate that Obamacare is popular among those who it was designed to help the most, but unpopular among the larger group of voters who are personally less concerned about health insurance and health care,\" Holland said.\n\nCurrently, the Republicans have a 17-seat advantage in the U.S. House, with the Democrats holding a 55-45 majority in the Senate. While the generic ballot question is a commonly used indicator when it comes to the battle for Congress, the poll results are a long way from predicting what will happen next November.\n\n\"There is just under a year to go before any votes are actually cast, and the 'generic ballot' question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections,\" Holland cautions. \"A year before the 2010 midterms, for example, the Democrats held a six-point lead on the generic ballot, but the GOP wound up regaining control of the House in that election cycle, thanks to an historic 63-seat pickup.\"\n\nThe poll was conducted November 18-20 for CNN by ORC International, with 843 adult Americans, including 749 registered voters, questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.",

He described power-hungry clergy as living lives characterized by \"mediocre and progressive spiritual emptiness that no academic degree can fill.\"\n\nFrancis emphasized that these maladies and temptations pose a danger to every Christian and any administrative organization, and can affect both individuals and the corporate level. He listed 15 \"Ailments of the Curia,\" complete with footnotes and Biblical references, which he had compiled.\n\nThe speech was met with tepid applause, and few were smiling as Francis enumerated the ailments. The annual Christmas greeting comes at a tense time for the Curia, the central administration of the Holy See, which governs the 1.2-billion-strong Catholic Church.\n\nPope Francis, an Argentine who had never worked in the Italian Curia before becoming pope, has faced pushback from some cardinals who feel he is criticizing an institution he does not fully understand.\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Vatican watcher Marco Politi stated that Francis has also faced pushback for his progressive social views. \"Within the Church, there is a tough group of conservative bishops and priests and cardinals, and also very traditionalist bishops and cardinals who are practically against the Pope, who are working against the Pope,\" said Politi. \"They don't like what he wanted to do with the synod about family, to give new possibilities to remarried and divorced people to get the communion, or to have a new look on the homosexual union.\"\n\nFor a complete list of Pope Francis' 15 \"Ailments of the Curia,\" please click here.",
    " Title: Trump's Fact-Bending History: A Look at the President's Record of Distortions and Falsehoods\n\nArticle:\n\nFred Trump, the father of the current U.S. President, was born in New York City. Contrary to some claims made by the President, his grandfather was born in Germany. This fact has been confirmed, but it is at least the third time that the President has stated his father was born in Germany when this is not accurate.\n\nThe reason for these inaccuracies is unclear, but it is believed that Trump has a history of bending facts to fit the narrative he is presenting about himself. For most individuals, making factual errors in a public setting can be disconcerting and embarrassing. However, Trump does not seem to share this sentiment. Facts are, for Trump, whatever he wants them to be, and they can change depending on his own circumstances. He tells a story of his life in which he is always the hero, always the winner, and repeats this story consistently.\n\nThere are several theories as to why Trump's record of distortions and falsehoods seem to have no effect on his willingness to continue lying or on how people perceive him.\n\n1. It's baked in the cake: Donald Trump's history of bending (and breaking) the truth is not a new phenomenon. During the 2016 campaign, he made numerous exaggerations, distortions, and outright false statements. Voters were aware of this, as evidenced by the fact that only 33% said he was \"honest and trustworthy\" according to exit polling in 2016. However, a significant number of voters (64%) did not consider him honest or trustworthy, yet still voted for him.\n\n2. All politicians lie: During the 2016 campaign, some voters defended Trump by stating that, while he lies, all politicians do. This argument is flawed, as Trump did not acknowledge his own false statements. However, it suggests that voters saw Trump as transparent in his willingness to say anything and do anything to win, which differentiated him from other politicians.\n\n3. Many people do not trust the media: Trump did not create distrust in the media, but he has weaponized it in a way that has not been seen before. The term \"fake news\" has become ubiquitous in the culture, with some viewing it as an ironic punchline, while others see it as a legitimate criticism of the media. The rise of Fox News and its near-monopoly on conservative mind-share in the country has contributed to both a political and economic model that monetizes distrust in the media for gain.\n\nIn conclusion, the President's history of distortions and falsehoods has not deterred him from continuing to lie, and it has not significantly affected how people perceive him. This is due to a combination of factors, including the acceptance of lies as a part of politics, the weaponization of media distrust, and the belief that Trump is transparent in his willingness to say anything to win.",
    " Title: DC Convention Results: Marco Rubio and John Kasich Take the Lead, Ted Cruz Wins 9 Delegates\n\nArticle:\n\nThe District of Columbia Republican Convention took place on Saturday, with Marco Rubio and John Kasich emerging as the frontrunners. Rubio received 37.3% of the votes, while Kasich was close behind with 35.5%, a difference of less than two percentage points. Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz trailed with 13.8% and 12.4% of the votes, respectively, and neither will receive delegates from this race.\n\nRubio and Kasich will each receive 10 and 9 delegates, respectively, from the DC convention. The state's other 29 delegates will be awarded at the state convention next month.\n\nThe DC convention is not a traditional primary or caucus, as the District of Columbia does not impact the GOP in the general election due to the Republicans knowing they won't get 10% of the vote. However, they do participate in the primary, and any registered Republican can vote at a single convention roughly two blocks from the White House.\n\nThe race for the 19 delegates up for grabs today is significant, as the race to 1,237 delegates is expected to come down to the wire. The rules for the DC convention are assigned proportionally to any candidate meeting a 15% threshold, but a winner can sweep all 19 if they make it to 50% plus one. Voting took place from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., but voters with religious restrictions on voting during the day can come and vote after dark.\n\nThere are two other races going on today, including the GOP primary in Guam, which won't be done until long after the DC results are in, and the \"conventions\" in Wyoming to select a total of 29 delegates. The results of the DC convention are expected after 9 p.m., and this article will be updated at that time.",
    " Title: Biden's Response to Ukraine Business Dealings Query Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing investigation into President Trump's dealings with Ukraine has led to renewed scrutiny of former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and his business dealings with a Ukrainian oil company. The Trump campaign has seized on Biden's perceived defensive response to questions about his son's business activities as evidence of guilt.\n\nDuring a press conference in Los Angeles on Friday, CBS News reporter Bo Erickson asked Biden whether his son's lucrative job with Burisma Holdings, an oil company owned by an oligarch accused of corruption, posed a conflict of interest. Biden's response was testy, denying any conflict of interest and accusing the reporter of focusing on the wrong issues.\n\n\"It's not a conflict of interest,\" Biden said. \"There's been no indication of any conflict of interest from Ukraine or anywhere else. Period.\"\n\nBiden's response was reminiscent of a similar exchange he had with a journalist two weeks prior, where he berated a reporter for questioning him about his son's Ukraine entanglements.\n\nThe Trump campaign has seized on Biden's responses, with Deputy Communications Director Matt Wolking stating in an emailed statement that Biden \"bullies the press\" and has no good explanation for what many independent observers see as an obvious conflict of interest.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Biden's son's business dealings in Ukraine has persisted since 2016, when allegations emerged that Biden had threatened to withhold a $1 billion loan guarantee from Ukraine if the government did not oust Viktor Shokin, the country's top prosecutor, who had targeted Burisma. Biden has denied the story, but a Monmouth poll released Tuesday found that 43% of Americans believe it, and the charge continues to impact his primary campaign.\n\nBiden was the clear front-runner in May, holding a commanding 27-point advantage over second-place Senator Bernie Sanders, but he now holds just a two-point lead over Senator Elizabeth Warren, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average. Warren has also surpassed Biden in the two most recent national polls, both released Wednesday.\n\nFurthermore, Biden's fundraising has also taken a hit, with third-quarter figures showing that he raised $15.2 million in the last three months, placing him fourth in fundraising behind Sanders, Warren, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.",

The cable, which was reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588, summarized an Aug. 15 emergency meeting and stated that the State Department's senior security officer, also known as the RSO, did not believe the consulate could be protected due to limited manpower, security measures, weapons capabilities, host nation support, and the overall size of the compound.\n\nThe cable also warned of approximately ten Islamist militias and Al-Qaeda training camps within Benghazi. The U.S. mission's Emergency Action Committee, responsible for security measures and emergency planning, was briefed on these groups, which included the QRF Brigade and Ansar al-Sharia, as well as \"Takfirist thugs.\"\n\nThe details in the cable seemed to foreshadow the deadly Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. compound, which was a coordinated, commando-style assault using direct and indirect fire. Al-Qaeda in North Africa and Ansar al-Sharia, both mentioned in the cable, have since been implicated in the consulate attack.\n\nThe cable also stated that the mission would ask for more help, submitting specific requests for additional physical security upgrades and staffing needs. The cable warned that the militias in Benghazi were not concerned with any significant retaliation from the Libyan government, which had apparently lost control in Benghazi.\n\nWhile the administration's public statements have suggested that the attack came without warning, the Aug. 16 cable seems to undercut those claims. It was a direct warning to the State Department that the Benghazi consulate was vulnerable to attack and that it could not be defended.\n\nIn a three-page cable on Sept 11, the day Stevens and the three other Americans were killed, Stevens wrote about \"growing problems with security\" in Benghazi and \"growing frustration\" with the security forces and Libyan police. The ambassador saw both as \"too weak to keep the country secure.\"\n\nWhen asked to respond to a series of questions about the Aug. 16 cable, the State Department declined to answer specific questions, citing the classified nature of the cable. The State Department stated, \"An independent board is conducting a thorough review of the assault on our post in Benghazi. Once we have the board's comprehensive account of what happened, findings, and recommendations, we can fully address these matters.\"",
    " Title: U.S. President's Refusal to Associate Terrorism with Islam Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent news bulletin reported that police in Nova Scotia thwarted a plot by two men who intended to carry out a mass shooting at a shopping mall and then commit suicide. The Associated Press reported that the plot was not related to Islamic terrorism.\n\nThe statement by the Associated Press has sparked debate and controversy, with some commentators questioning the Obama administration's stance on the issue. The article, published by the New York Post, criticizes President Obama for refusing to associate Islamic terrorists with Islam, citing instances of terror attacks against Christians and Jews.\n\nThe article argues that the Obama administration's refusal to acknowledge the role of Islam in terrorism leads to flawed understandings of the problem and missed opportunities for potential solutions. The article also criticizes the administration for its response to the murder of three Muslims in North Carolina, opening a civil rights investigation and suggesting the murders were hate crimes, while downplaying the beheading of 21 Coptic Christians in Libya as an \"outrage linked to a genocidal religious cleansing.\"\n\nThe article also touches on the issue of corruption in Albany, New York, and the refusal of Mayor Bill de Blasio and Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito to acknowledge the legality of a federal judge's ruling on President Obama's immigration orders. The article concludes by criticizing the progressive political culture in St. Louis, which it suggests may be contributing to a rise in murders in the city.\n\nIt is important to note that the article presents a critical and negative view of the Obama administration's stance on terrorism and immigration, and does not provide a balanced perspective on the issue. Additionally, the article contains personal commentary and speculation, which is not in line with the guidelines for this response.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Urge President Trump to Cease Criticizing Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Republicans have expressed concerns that President Donald Trump's repeated criticisms of Congress could dampen enthusiasm among the GOP base, potentially hurting turnout for the midterm elections. The President is known for touting results and criticizing lawmakers when they do not move fast enough on his priorities.\n\nLast week, Trump warned Senate Republicans through Twitter to pass the annual spending bills before the August recess, a high bar for a chamber that did not pass any regular appropriations bills in 2017. He also slammed the Senate's pace on approving nominees as \"the worst in history.\" A few days prior, he criticized Congress for a lack of progress on immigration reform.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump took aim at GOP lawmakers for not being more vocally critical of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, warning, \"Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!\" This flurry of criticism has some Republicans worried.\n\nSen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) stated that Trump was asked to acknowledge the accomplishments of the Republican-led Congress during a meeting on Capitol Hill this past week. Rounds said the message was well received by the President.\n\nRepublicans argue that Trump's complaints about the lack of accomplishments in Congress, such as the failure to pass legislation to repeal and replace ObamaCare, have overshadowed accomplishments, such as passing a $1.5 trillion tax cut last year.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said he has received numerous questions and complaints about the ObamaCare failure and has printed out cards that list all the accomplishments of the 115th Congress. These include tax reform, confirming 21 circuit court judges, opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, repealing ObamaCare's individual mandate, and using the Congressional Review Act to repeal 14 Obama-era federal regulations.\n\nSen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) gave Trump one of these cards during their meeting with the GOP conference. Alexander told Trump that Republicans' chances of keeping control of the Senate and House after November will depend on him rallying the base. That means touting its accomplishments, not panning it for the backlog of executive and judicial branch nominations or stalemate on immigration.\n\nRepublicans have a slim 51-49 majority in the Senate and hope to expand it as Democrats must defend 26 seats in November while Republicans have to worry about only nine. However, Democrats have hopes of seizing the majority because the President's party tends to fare badly in the first midterm election, and polls show them leading Republicans by an average of 5 points on the generic ballot.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) warned on Thursday that control of the chamber is \"absolutely\" up for grabs. GOP strategists think Senate Republicans are right to ask Trump to be more positive.\n\n\"One, Trump has great clout with the Republican base. Two, hammering Republicans [in Congress] undermines their central argument in the midterm election, which is, 'the president needs reinforcements\u2014look at the great results, he needs more Republicans not Democrats,'\" said Republican strategist Ford O'Connell.\n\nGallup reported that Trump reached an 11-month high at the end of April, with 42 percent of respondents nationwide saying they liked the job he was doing. A CNN poll released earlier this month found his job approval rating at 41 percent, with 53 percent disapproving. While more people disapprove than approve of Trump's job performance, he's doing significantly better in the public's opinion than Congress. A Gallup poll conducted earlier this month showed Congress with a 17 percent job approval rating.\n\nStrategists say Trump will be key to turning out Republican voters in November. \"The megaphone that President Trump has to fire up the base and get them to vote on election day is crucial for Republicans to win,\" said Ron Bonjean, a strategist and former Senate GOP leadership aide. He noted that Republicans held onto the Senate majority in 2016, despite predictions that Democrats would win back control, because of Trump's ability to motivate voters. Senate GOP candidates hung on to win in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Wisconsin thanks in part to Trump's victory in states where Hillary Clinton was expected to prevail. Bonjean said, \"Republicans were activated during the presidential election, and it's just as important to get them motivated to support members of Congress\" in the midterm.",
    " Title: Differences in Private Jet Usage by Trump Administration Officials Clarified\n\nArticle:\n\nThe use of private jets by members of the Trump administration has become a topic of controversy, with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price facing criticism for his expensive and unnecessary use of private jets for official business. The President publicly rebuked Price over the issue yesterday, and there is speculation that Price may be dismissed from his position. However, the use of private jets by other administration officials, such as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt, has also been questioned.\n\nIn the case of Secretary DeVos, it has been reported that she pays for her work-related travel out of her own pocket, and there is nothing ethically problematic about this whatsoever.\n\nRegarding Administrator Pruitt, there has been a kerfuffle over flights he has taken, with some comparing his use of private jets to Price's. However, Fox News' John Roberts has explained that the relevant details and distinctions between the two situations are significant.\n\nAccording to Roberts, Administrator Pruitt took a total of four flights that were not commercial. The only charter flight was between Denver, Colorado and Durango, which was booked after a commercial flight on United Airlines was delayed for eight hours, preventing the Administrator from attending an event. The EPA also asked the Governor of Colorado if they could jump on his plane, but were initially told there was no room. After chartering the aircraft, the Governor offered a seat, but it would not have been sufficient for the Administrator's staff. The other flights were government flights, including a military flight from Cincinnati to JFK so the Administrator could attend the G7 Summit. All of this was cleared by the EPA office of ethics.\n\nRoberts concludes that the Pruitt situation is not comparable to the Price situation, as the private charter was a last-minute booking resulting from a lengthy commercial airline delay, and the other flights were government or military planes. Therefore, the Pruitt issue may be a non-story.\n\nIt is worth noting that public officials using government or military planes for travel is a common and bipartisan practice. Republican Senator John Thune notably refused to offer any spin on the Health and Human Services Secretary's behalf, stating, \"No excuses here. Can't put lipstick on a pig. It's a pig.\"",
    " Title: Trump Cancels Military Parade, Cites High Cost Estimate from Washington D.C. Government\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - President Donald Trump announced the cancellation of a proposed military parade on Friday, citing a high cost estimate from the Washington, D.C. government. However, Washington officials denied Trump's claim and federal agencies raised concerns about the cost and logistics.\n\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser provided a cost estimate of $21.6 million on Friday via Twitter, which is closer to the administration's $12 million projection from February. On Thursday, Pentagon officials told CNN the actual costs would be $92 million, or $80 million more than the original estimate.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted, \"The local politicians who run Washington, D.C. (poorly) know a windfall when they see it. When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it. Never let someone hold you up!\"\n\nTrump also announced he would attend a smaller parade already scheduled for Joint Base Andrews, as well as a Nov. 11 parade in Paris to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. He tweeted, \"Maybe we will do something next year in D.C. when the cost comes WAY DOWN. Now we can buy some more jet fighters!\"\n\nBowser said the proposed parade carried significant concerns for taxpayers, and she mocked Trump for his complaints. \"Yup, I\u2019m Muriel Bowser, mayor of Washington DC, the local politician who finally got thru to the reality star in the White House with the realities ( $21.6M ) of parades/events/demonstrations in Trump America (sad),\" she said in a sub-tweet.\n\nJohn J. Falcicchio, chief of staff to Bowser, took issue with Trump's claim that the city is \"poorly\" run, calling it \"fake news.\" He cited a newly earned AAA bond rating. \"When they go low, we go high... Like our bond rating,\" Falcicchio said in sub-tweeting Trump.\n\nTrump's attendance at a Paris military parade last year inspired him to call for an American version. U.S. officials on Thursday cited expenses for aircraft, equipment, personnel, and security, not charges from the Washington, D.C. government as claimed by Trump.\n\nIn a statement, the Pentagon said, \"The Department of Defense and White House have been planning a parade to honor America's military veterans and commemorate the centennial of World War I. We originally targeted November 10, 2018, for this event but have now agreed to explore opportunities in 2019.\"\n\nThe American Legion stated, \"The parade money would be better spent fully funding the Department of Veterans Affairs and giving our troops and their families the best care possible.\"",
    " Title: Missouri Senate Race: McCaskill's Vote Against Kavanaugh Confirmation May Not Affect Re-Election Chances, Poll Shows\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll suggests that Democratic U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill's vote against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation may not significantly impact her re-election chances in conservative-leaning Missouri. The poll, conducted by \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos/UVA Center for Politics, shows McCaskill with 44 percent support among likely voters, while her Republican challenger, state Attorney General Josh Hawley, has 45 percent. The poll has a credibility interval of 3 percentage points.\n\nThe Missouri race is considered a toss-up, and Democrats need to gain two seats to win control of the U.S. Senate. Achieving this will require successfully defending Democratic seats in states that President Donald Trump won in 2016, which include Missouri, West Virginia, and Indiana.\n\nMcCaskill joined all but one of her Democratic colleagues in voting against Kavanaugh, who was confirmed by a 50-48 vote after being accused of sexual assault. The confirmation process became a political brawl that deepened the country's divisions.\n\nHawley, who has been pressuring McCaskill to support Kavanaugh and criticizing her as a \"radical\" in campaign ads, may not have gained much from the issue. The poll shows that 44 percent of likely voters are \"more likely\" to support McCaskill because of her opposition to Kavanaugh, while 46 percent are \"less likely.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court did not rank highly among likely voters' priorities in the state. Respondents were much more likely to cite healthcare, the economy, or immigration as top issues. Sixty-nine percent of likely voters told the poll they were \"very motivated\" to support a candidate who would \"defend laws that protect healthcare for people with pre-existing conditions.\" This could pose a problem for Hawley, who has said he wants to protect people with pre-existing conditions but has joined a multi-state effort to repeal the federal law that does so, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA separate poll found Illinois Democratic gubernatorial candidate J.B. Pritzker holding a 20-percentage-point lead over Republican incumbent Bruce Rauner. The race is on track to be the most expensive governor's election in U.S. history, with nearly $249.7 million raised so far. Illinois looks set to break California's record-setting $251.9 million 2010 contest between Democrat Jerry Brown and former tech executive Meg Whitman.\n\nThe Missouri and Illinois polls were conducted online, in English, from Sept. 27 to Oct. 7. They surveyed between 968 and 1,111 likely voters and weighted the responses according to the latest government population estimates. The results measured how voters felt at the time of the survey, and those feelings may change. In 2016, one in eight Americans decided on the presidential pick in the week before Election Day, according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll.",
    " Title: Political Language and the Disintegration of Shared Language in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the Bible, the people of Babel united in defiance against God, attempting to build a massive tower to challenge His supremacy. God, displeased by their presumption, caused them to speak a variety of tongues, dividing them and ending the project. This story illustrates a simple truth: unity relies, at least in large part, on shared language.\n\nIn the United States, the shared language is disintegrating. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump tweeted about the Democrats' impeachment inquiry, expressing frustration over the lack of clarity on process. He wrote, \"So some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here -- a lynching. But we will WIN!\"\n\nTrump's use of the word \"lynching\" sparked a firestorm. Criticisms included one from former Vice President Joe Biden, who stated, \"Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable.\"\n\nHowever, it was revealed that Biden used the same language in October 1998 to describe the Clinton impeachment. \"History is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching,\" Biden said at the time. This prompted Biden to condemn himself, stating, \"That was not the right word to use and I'm sorry about that. Trump, on the other hand, chose his words deliberately today in his use of the word lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily.\"\n\nWhen Joe Biden used the word \"lynching\" to describe his perception of a politically motivated impeachment in 1998, it was merely poor word choice. When Trump used it in 2019, he obviously meant to liken himself to black victims of white supremacist violence.\n\nPolitics is skewing our use of basic language, and this phenomenon is one of the key factors tearing apart the country. Every word becomes a potential dog whistle. Every phrase is parsed by the politically motivated for signs of malign intent. Politically correct language policing becomes the order of the day. Misunderstanding becomes malice; clarity becomes confusion.\n\nThe deliberate confusion regarding gender pronouns is another example of this phenomenon. It is not a sign of malice to suggest that gender pronouns refer to objective measures of sex. It is a sign of a delusional culture to suggest that third-party use of gender pronouns must refer instead to subjective self-identification. Yet we are told that virtue mandates that we pretend that transgender women are women, even if that means that biological men compete with biological women in sport; we are told that virtue requires that parents call their confused 7-year-olds by their chosen pronouns, even though confused children desperately require guidance, love, and advice from parents, not mere affirmation of malleable self-identification.\n\nWe cannot have conversations with one another if we refuse to define terms. But refusal to define terms is one of the most fruitful methods of impugning others. If we seek division rather than unity, we'll certainly find it. And as we cordon ourselves off into separate interpretations of language we once held in common, we're less and less likely to ever again find common ground.\n\nBen Shapiro, 35, is a graduate of UCLA and Harvard Law School, host of \"The Ben Shapiro Show\" and editor-in-chief of DailyWire.com.

The president took the extraordinary and transparent steps of releasing the full, unredacted, and declassified transcript of his call with President Zelensky, which forms the heart of the complaint, as well as the complaint itself. That is because he has nothing to hide.

    " Title: Grassroots Movements Seek to Bridge Political Divide in America\n\nArticle:\n\nIn her 2016 book, \"Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right,\" author Arlie Hochschild details her journey across America's political divide, living in liberal Berkeley, California, and immersing herself in a deeply conservative town, Lake Charles, Louisiana, a center of the petrochemical industry. Nearly all the people she came to know voted for Donald Trump, with most doing so with hope and excitement.\n\nSince the book's publication, Hochschild has returned to Louisiana three times to gauge the feelings of Trump supporters during the first year of his presidency. According to a recent Pew survey, the political divide between Democrats and Republicans is formidable. The survey reveals that 71% of Democrats believe the government should do more to help the needy, while only 24% of Republicans agree. Similarly, 64% of Democrats think discrimination is the main reason blacks can't get ahead, while only 14% of Republicans do.\n\nDespite some criticism of Trump's behavior, such as his comments about African and Haitian nations, his supporters remain committed to him. However, some Trump supporters have expressed discomfort with his remarks, while others have defended him, viewing his critics as hypocritical.\n\nA grassroots movement has been growing, aiming not to eliminate difference but to soften its edge. This movement seeks to foster respect and explore potential areas of agreement. Initiatives such as Living-room Conversations, spearheaded by local mediator Joan Blades, bring together individuals from different political backgrounds to discuss common goals and find areas of agreement.\n\nEven among the most ardent Trump supporters, Hochschild found potential for coalition on specific issues, such as safeguarding children online, reducing prison populations for non-violent offenders, protecting against commercialization of the human genome, and promoting job creation and infrastructure development.\n\nSigns of a desire to reach out extend beyond Hochschild's personal experiences. The Bridge Alliance, a non-profit, non-partisan umbrella group, lists over seventy cross-partisan groups based in towns across the country. These groups, with names like Common Good, Better Angels, American Public Square, and AllSides, aim to restore a culture of respect while exploring potential points of agreement.\n\nExperts estimate that over one in ten people who voted for Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary ended up voting for Trump in the presidential election. Additionally, it is estimated that between 6.7 and 9.2 million people who voted for Trump in 2016 had also voted for Obama in 2012.\n\nAs of October 2017, the Bridge Alliance had three million supporters. As the nation heads into the next three years with a divided media and a president who speaks to one base, more of us need to reach out to people we disagree with. By crossing the partisan divide, we may not resolve our political crisis, but it could help us rebuild a nation in which we feel as if we know each other again.",
    " Title: New Experimental Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease and CAR-T Therapies for Cancer Gain Investor Attention\n\nArticle:\n\nA flurry of experimental therapies for sickle cell disease and CAR-T therapies for cancer has captured the attention of investors, following recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals and significant investments in the sector. This week, much of the high-profile clinical data presented at the American Society of Hematology's annual meeting in Orlando, Florida, focused on companies developing products for these therapeutic areas.\n\nIn November, the FDA approved two new treatments for sickle cell disease: Novartis' Adakveo and Global Blood Therapeutics' Oxbryta. Adakveo reduces the frequency of one of the disease's complications, while Oxbryta treats the root cause of sickle cell anemia. The wholesale list prices for both drugs are approximately $10,000 per month.\n\nBluebird Bio's investigational gene therapy for sickle cell disease also garnered attention. Analysts expect Bluebird to outperform peers substantially, following positive data for LentiGlobin in a Phase 1/2 study. The therapy showed a reduction in vaso-occlusive crises and acute chest syndrome (both complications of sickle cell disease) in some patients. Shares of Bluebird, which also presented data on its experimental CAR-T therapy and LentiGlobin as a treatment for severe beta-thalassemia, at ASH, were up 10% in afternoon trading on Tuesday.\n\nIn the CAR-T therapy field, which was first approved by the FDA in 2017 with Novartis' Kymriah for certain patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a growing number of large and small pharmaceutical companies are entering the market. This week, Bluebird and Bristol-Myers Squibb shared results from their early-stage trial for an experimental CAR-T therapy treating multiple myeloma. BMS also said Saturday that a pivotal trial for liso-cel, its investigational CAR-T treatment, showed high rates of durable responses, and it will submit an application to the FDA this month. Johnson & Johnson is developing a CAR-T for multiple myeloma, and its mid-stage study data was described as \"clearly impressive\" by Bernstein analysts.\n\nSome of the experimental therapies are aiming to capitalize on the costs associated with CAR-T treatment. The currently available CAR-T therapies are expensive, with Kymriah costing $475,000 at launch and Yescarta costing $373,000. Hospitals have been struggling with the cost of CAR-T as patients require hospitalization within three days of treatment, which means the treatment is considered inpatient and reimbursed as part of transplantation diagnostic related grouping. About one-quarter of the patients in the liso-cel trial were treated in an outpatient setting, which is less expensive than if a patient is hospitalized. If approved, that change in setting may shift the market away from an already approved therapy, such as Yescarta, to one that can deliver on a more cost-effective approach.\n\nThe headlining deal in hematology is Merck's $2.7 billion buyout of ArQule, a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for cancer and rare diseases. The deal, announced Monday, will add ArQule's mid-stage therapeutic candidate, ARG 531, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, to Merck's high-performing oncology portfolio. Shares of ArQule were up 1.27% in afternoon trading on Tuesday. \"We see this acquisition as unlocking value for investors as it places ARQ 533 in the hands of a larger player who can develop this asset more broadly and aggressively,\" wrote Jonathan Chang, an analyst at SVB Leerink, in a note.",
    " Title: Superdelegate Lead for Hillary Clinton in Democratic Primary Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Democratic primary race, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are closely competing for votes. However, the picture changes when considering superdelegates, party insiders who can support any candidate of their choice. According to the latest Associated Press survey, Clinton has the support of 449 superdelegates, or approximately 63 percent, while Sanders has only 19. The AP did not reach 62 superdelegates, and 182 remained uncommitted or undecided.\n\nExcluding superdelegates, Sanders leads Clinton among delegates based on the votes in Iowa and New Hampshire, with a margin of 36-32. Since the AP's November survey, Clinton's superdelegate count has increased by 90, while Sanders has gained 11.\n\nIt is important to note that Clinton also had a significant superdelegate lead during her previous presidential campaign, but ultimately lost the nomination. In January 2008, she had a lead of 201 to Barack Obama's 89 and John Edwards' 40, according to the AP.\n\nIn the following months, Obama began to gain superdelegates, while Clinton started to lose some to his side. This trend seems to be repeating itself in the current race, with Clinton maintaining strong support among the party's establishment, despite the tight primary and caucus races.\n\nSuperdelegates consist of well-known figures such as members of Congress and former presidents, as well as lesser-known party insiders like state party leaders and Democratic National Committee members. The non-superdelegates are allocated based on the results of the state caucuses and primaries, while superdelegates are \"unbound,\" meaning they can choose whom they want.\n\nThis system has been a source of contention among Sanders supporters, with some contacting superdelegates and a MoveOn.org petition urging them to \"pledge to back the will of the voters.\" As of now, the petition has over 161,000 signatures.\n\nThe superdelegate system was created in 1982 to \"improve the party's mainstream appeal\" by giving party insiders more influence and reducing the influence of \"activists,\" as explained by Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein of the Brookings Institution in 2008. The system is intended to provide a \"peer review\" to choose the most electable candidate and promote unity within the party, making \"stronger ties between the party and its elected officials.\"\n\nIn a tight race, the \"unity\" argument may be difficult to see from a voter's perspective. Superdelegates are aware of this, with one, then-Sen. John Kerry, stating in 2008 that it would be a mistake for superdelegates to overturn the expressed view of the pledged delegates. Superdelegates remain unbound, even if they have already chosen a candidate, and could potentially switch their support should the race shift in favor of another candidate.\n\nMany superdelegates must be re-elected at some point, and going against the voters' wishes is not beneficial in that regard. However, superdelegates remain unbound, even if they have already chosen a candidate. This means that should the race swing heavily in Sanders' favor, some superdelegates currently backing Clinton could potentially switch their support.",
    " Title: Trump Affirms Support for National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster Amid Controversy Over Classified Information Access\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed his continued support for National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster following a controversy over a letter McMaster sent to his predecessor, Susan Rice, granting her access to classified information. The letter, which McMaster's supporters claim was routine, was leaked to suggest that the Army Lieutenant General was aiding Trump's political adversaries.\n\nThe letter, reportedly a standard procedure for sending classified information to former national security advisers and presidents, has been a subject of debate within the White House. McMaster's feud with other powerful factions within the administration has been well-documented, and a series of recent firings by McMaster has escalated tensions. However, Trump issued a statement late Friday, expressing his confidence in McMaster, stating, \"General McMaster and I are working very well together. He is a good man and very pro-Israel. I am grateful for the work he continues to do serving our country.\"\n\nMcMaster has been under scrutiny due to a series of firings he has ordered on the National Security Council (NSC). The most recent dismissal was of Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence at the NSC, who was viewed as a Trump loyalist.\n\nThursday's report by Circa News alleged that McMaster sent a letter granting Rice access to classified material, weeks after her alleged role in the \"unmasking\" of identities of Trump associates in intelligence reports was disclosed. However, sources from the NSC told Fox News that the letter was a standard procedure document and that McMaster was required to send it.\n\nThe NSC also clarified that extending Rice's security clearance does not grant her access to classified information; it only allows her to be called back in (if necessary) to discuss classified information.\n\nThe fact that McMaster sent the letter to Rice, given the controversy surrounding her and the \"unmasking\" of members of the Trump campaign, transition, and administration in intelligence documents, has not been viewed favorably by administration members who are not particularly fond of McMaster.\n\nCohen-Watnick, who was brought into the NSC by former national security adviser Mike Flynn, was at the center of the controversy over House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes' visit to the White House in March to review intelligence reports about incidental surveillance of Trump officials during the presidential campaign.\n\nAdditionally, Rich Higgins, who served as director for strategic planning at the NSC, was fired on July 21. Higgins was an ally of senior White House adviser Steve Bannon. Derek Harvey, a top Middle East adviser who served as special assistant to the president and senior director for the Middle East on the NSC, was also relieved of his duties last week.\n\nThe staff changes at the NSC come as the White House has seen a number of high-profile staff changes, including the resignation of Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Press Secretary Sean Spicer, and the forced exit of newly tapped communications director Anthony Scaramucci after just 11 days on the job.",
    " Title: Pelosi's Rising Popularity and Shutdown Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing 33-day government shutdown, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been a formidable adversary to President Donald Trump. She has dismissed his proposals to reopen the government as \"nonstarters\" due to his insistence on $5.7 billion for the border wall, which she terms \"an immorality.\" Pelosi has also pressured Trump to postpone the State of the Union address, scheduled for next Tuesday, over shutdown-related security concerns, potentially forcing him to hold the event elsewhere.\n\nNew polling shows that Pelosi's popularity has increased during the shutdown. According to polling from Civiqs, Pelosi's favorability among Democrats has jumped from 59 to 72 percent. The Washington Post's Michael Tesler argues, \"It appears that Pelosi's opposition to the president has rallied her party's base and increased her favorability ratings.\"\n\nThe CBS News poll released on Wednesday indicates that more Americans want Trump to give up wall funding than prefer the congressional Democrats to agree to wall funding. Moreover, more Americans feel Pelosi is handling negotiations better than the president.\n\nDemocrats' strategy of not compromising during the shutdown has been effective, as they have not relented, given the unpopularity of the president and the border wall. The length and severity of this shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history, could potentially cause lasting damage to Trump's presidency.\n\nPelosi's recent performance during the shutdown could significantly alter the narrative about her in history books. She has previously proven her resolve in obstructing George W. Bush's plan to privatize Social Security in 2005 and her legislative prowess in passing Obamacare and the (ultimately doomed) cap-and-trade bill in 2009 and 2010.\n\nLooking ahead to 2020, progressives may express reservations about Pelosi's continued leadership\u2014especially if Democrats win back both the presidency and the Senate. Pelosi has shown caution when confronting the progressive wing's increasingly ambitious agenda, implementing a pay-go rule in the House, requiring new spending to be offset by budget cuts or tax increases. On Medicare for All, she has advocated for strengthening Obamacare, but has allowed hearings on universal health care to proceed. Regarding Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal, Pelosi does not seem to be a supporter, having rebuffed the freshman's attempt to form a committee on the proposal.\n\nHowever, 2020 is still far off, and Democrats' unified control of the government may be an even longer way off. For now, Pelosi's strategy of undercutting and emasculating Trump at every turn has earned her the loyalty of her entire caucus. Winning tends to have that effect.",
    " Title: Political Violence and Confrontations Targeting Media and Lawmakers on the Rise in U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nA mob of left-wing antifa activists descended on Fox News personality Tucker Carlson's D.C. home on Wednesday, marking a new phase in the political violence and angry confrontations that have been targeting the news media and lawmakers.\n\nPolitical violence has been on the rise in the U.S. since 2012, according to the Global Terrorism Database. Increasingly aggressive activists have pushed political confrontation to the limit since 2016, accosting Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials in restaurants and in the halls of Congress. Now, they are targeting conservative journalists at their homes.\n\n\"Tucker Carlson, we will fight. We know where you sleep at night!\" the activists, allied with antifa, chanted outside Mr. Carlson's home. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, targets anyone perceived as not in step with a far-left agenda.\n\nMr. Carlson, whose wife was home alone during the disturbance, told Fox News, \"I never thought twice about leaving them home alone, but this is the reaction because this group doesn't like my TV show.\"\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the overheated political debate has lawmakers increasingly working under a threat of violence. Capitol police say they saw a surge in protective details assigned to lawmakers earlier in the fall, when senators were facing hallway protests during the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Security details were assigned to at least two Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee, Chairman Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Jeff Flake of Arizona.\n\nSecurity details are typically assigned only to members of leadership. Senators have mostly been away from Washington since the Kavanaugh confirmation, and it's not clear whether enhanced security will still be the norm.\n\nAbout 2,000 threatening incidents and communications were made against members of Congress last year, according to the House Sergeant at Arms office. That's nearly double the 902 threatening incidents and communications in 2016. Capitol Police spokeswoman Eva Maleki refused to divulge the numbers so far for 2018.\n\nThe threats have extended to anyone entering the political arena. California psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford is still receiving death threats and has been unable to return to work more than a month after she testified to Congress against Justice Kavanaugh during confirmation hearings, according to her legal team.\n\nThe threats started when she accused Justice Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her more than 30 years ago when the two were at high school parties. The allegations were never corroborated, but her testimony nearly derailed his confirmation.\n\nFormer IRS official Lois G. Lerner told a federal judge this month that she is still getting threats stemming from her role in the tea party targeting scandal of five years ago. She has been locked in a long legal battle trying to permanently seal her old testimony about the targeting, saying she expects a new surge of threats if her actions became publicly known.\n\n\"We are seeing more violent events recently as there seems to be a retreat from basic democratic norms,\" said American University professor Joseph Young, a scholar of terrorism and political violence.\n\nHe said President Trump's attacks on the press and reluctance to denounce violence on the right doesn't help but isn't the main cause.\n\n\"Some extremists do not see the value of dialogue or compromise and are concerned with the speed of change. Most importantly, when core values seem under threat, these individuals are using violence in what they perceive as a defensive action,\" he said. \"ISIS-inspired actors always cite their actions as defensive. The Pittsburgh synagogue shooter felt that his race and people were under threat. Whether this is true or not, I think these beliefs are motivating people to violent action.\"\n\nThe threats, confrontation, and violence come from extremists on the left and the right. Cesar Sayoc, a crazed supporter of Mr. Trump, is charged with sending at least 16 pipe bomb packages to people viewed as enemies of the president, including high-profile Democrats Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama and commentators at CNN.\n\nLeft-wing activist James T. Hodgkinson opened fire on a congressional Republican softball practice in June 2017, almost killing House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana. Also shot were House aide Zack Barth, lobbyist Matt Mika, and U.S. Capitol Police Officer Crystal Griner, who was assigned to protect Mr. Scalise.\n\nD.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department is investigating the incident at Mr. Carlson's home, during which the demonstrators allegedly damaged the front door. Fox News executives called the incident at Mr. Carlson's home \"reprehensible.\"\n\n\"The violent threats and intimidation tactics toward him and his family are completely unacceptable. We as a nation have become far too intolerant of different points of view. Recent events across our country clearly highlight the need for a more civil, respectful, and inclusive national conversation. Those of us in the media and in politics bear a special obligation to all Americans, to find common ground,\" Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and Fox News President Jay Wallace said in a joint statement.\n\nIt wasn't the first time the group went after a journalist. But they usually attack reporters covering demonstrations, such as when they hurled eggs and water bottles at D.C. police and journalists during a counter-protest against the \"Unite the Right 2\" rally in August.\n\nA year earlier, the first \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, sparked clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters. A man involved with white supremacy was charged with driving his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing Heather Heyer, 32.",
    " Title: National and North Carolina Democrats Adjust Strategy in Response to State Party Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\nTop national and North Carolina Democrats have taken a series of unusual steps to protect their candidates in the state from additional damage following a sexual harassment scandal that rocked the North Carolina Democratic Party (NCDP). The scandal weakened the party's chairman, David Parker, who has managed to hold onto his job despite calls for his ouster from top state Democrats and pressure from Washington.\n\nNorth Carolina was already an uphill battle for President Barack Obama's reelection campaign before the revelation in April that the NCDP's then-executive director, Jay Parmley, was accused of misconduct by a young male employee. Parmley resigned.\n\nThe result presents a challenge for the Obama campaign and other Democrats up and down the ballot, who must now find ways to tiptoe around state officials linked to the harassment scandal. Complicating matters further, Democrats will hold their presidential nominating convention in Charlotte this summer, an event that was suffering from fundraising difficulties even before the scandal broke.\n\nRather than backing away from the state, Democrats in North Carolina and Washington say they believe they can work around Parker. The chairman, they say, currently appears more focused on shoring up his own shaky political position and reaching out to local activists than taking operational control of campaign machinery. That leaves room for other national and state Democrats to try and take charge of the situation\u2014and most importantly, control the purse strings of the 2012 campaign.\n\n\"The Obama campaign appears to be dug in here and committed and working here,\" said veteran North Carolina Democratic strategist Gary Pearce, a former adviser to four-term Gov. Jim Hunt. \"The talk here is the Obama campaign and the [Lt. Gov. Walter] Dalton campaign feel pretty confident they can work around [Parker].\"\n\n\"The problem is, who's going to trust David Parker with a few million dollars? Well, nobody,\" Pearce added.\n\nDiscussions are underway to set up a coordinated campaign apparatus between national and state Democrats for high-profile state campaigns\u2014chiefly, the governor's race between Dalton and former GOP Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory\u2014and congressional races. To the extent that the state party is involved, it would only be one of numerous decision-makers at the table, and campaigns say they expect to be able to work with competent staff members there to maneuver around the mess with Parker.\n\n\"It's going to be focused, it's going to have the resources it needs... Because of what transpired [with the NCDP] I think there's a clear difference in terms of participation and guiding hands,\" said one knowledgeable North Carolina Democratic operative, who characterized Parker's involvement as exceedingly limited.\n\n\"I think it would be safe to say that David Parker's focused very much on the internal party politics and not the business of messing with these campaigns. The state convention is a big deal... That's right in his wheelhouse,\" the operative said, referring to the North Carolina Democratic convention on June 16. \"I would say his participation in the day-to-day workings of coordinated campaigns, infrastructure, that kind of thing, is diminished.\"",
    " Title: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Prepared to Sue and Subpoena Mueller Report\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has stated that he is prepared to take legal action against the Trump administration and subpoena special counsel Robert Mueller if the Mueller report on possible Russia interference in the 2016 presidential campaign is not made public.\n\nIn an interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" Schiff, a California Democrat, said, \"We will obviously subpoena the report. We will bring Bob Mueller in to testify before Congress. We will take it to court if necessary.\"\n\nWhen asked by host George Stephanopoulos if he would take the White House to court, Schiff responded, \"Absolutely. We are going to get to the bottom of this.\"\n\nSchiff further stated, \"We are going to share this information with the public. And if the president is serious about all of his claims of exoneration, then he should welcome the publication of this report.\"\n\nThe Mueller report is expected to be released soon, although not this week. The Justice Department is not required to release the document to the public.\n\nSchiff made it clear that he would do whatever necessary to make the findings public. \"He [Mueller] does have a responsibility to report it,\" Schiff said. \"And in fact, if you take the position\u2014and I think it's a flawed one\u2014but if you take the position that the president can not be indicted and the only remedy for improper or illegal or other conduct is impeachment, then you can not withhold that information from Congress or essentially the president has immunity.\"\n\nSchiff also stated that Attorney General William Barr would be under \"immeasurable pressure\" to publish the report. \"If he were to try to withhold, to bury any part of this report, that will be his legacy,\" Schiff said. \"And it will be a tarnished legacy. So I think there will be immense pressure not only on the department but on the attorney general to be forthcoming.\"",
    " Title: House Freedom Caucus Urges President Trump for Economic Reopening as Small Businesses Struggle\n\nArticle:\n\nMembers of the House Freedom Caucus have sent a letter to President Donald Trump, urging for the reopening of the economy as businesses across the country continue to face difficulties. The letter, signed by House members Reps. Andy Biggs, Jody Hice, Ron Wright, Jeff Duncan, Scott Perry, Andy Harris, Scott DesJarlais, Ken Buck, Paul Gosar, Randy Weber, Ted Yoho, Dan Bishop, and Ted Yoho, according to Fox News, was sent on Friday.\n\nIn the letter, the House Freedom Caucus members expressed their concern about the economic impact of the closed economy, stating, \"The American people are resilient, but they have suffered tremendously under the weight of this closed economy. Measures enacted by Congress have provided limited relief.\" They further argued that reopening the economy is the solution to the economic woes, stating, \"We are a free people with a free and fair market. The sooner we return to it, the sooner our economy will again thrive.\"\n\nThe letter also highlighted the impact of the virus on employment, with many people losing their jobs and businesses being forced to close. The members of the House Freedom Caucus acknowledged that measures have been taken to slow the spread of the virus, but they argued that some of the measures enacted to combat the virus have caused economic hardship.\n\nThe letter comes as Democrats in the Senate blocked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's request for more aid for small businesses on April 9, labeling it a \"political stunt.\" The Republicans' bill would have provided an additional $250 billion for a loan program for small businesses, but it was blocked from passing due to Democratic opposition.\n\nThe current state of Congress is such that most members are still on recess, making it difficult for legislation to be passed quickly. The full House and Senate are not expected to return to Washington D.C. before May 4. The members of Congress are currently working on legislation to fund small businesses.",
    " Title: Market-Based Solution Emerges for California's Housing Shortage, Shifting Office Space to Residential Use\n\nArticle:\n\nA market-based solution is gaining traction in California as a potential solution to the state's housing shortage, with the potential to transform urban areas by converting office spaces into residential units. This shift away from traditional office spaces is being driven by the increased adoption of remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhite-collar businesses, such as insurance companies, law firms, and venture capitalists, are vacating office towers in urban areas like Century City in Los Angeles, downtown San Diego, and San Francisco's financial district. Tenants are refusing to pay rent, having sent their workforces home during the pandemic, and are not being evicted due to state emergency rules allowing for rent delays during the health crisis.\n\nAs California reopens, it has become clear that vast numbers of workers will continue to work from home, either by preference or necessity. This shift in work patterns is causing a decline in demand for office space in urban areas, while demand for housing is increasing in suburban counties.\n\nRealtors in suburban counties are reporting an increase in demand from people who previously worked in office towers but are now working from home. As their employers allow them to continue working remotely, some are seeking more spacious quarters and a less urban environment.\n\nIn the next phase, entire floors of high-rise buildings are expected to go vacant and remain empty for significant periods. Once building owners realize that new lessees will not be forthcoming in large numbers, they will opt for other ways to monetize their buildings, such as converting much of the empty floor space to condos and apartments. These will likely come in all sizes and price levels, from large ocean-and mountain-view units to small apartments on the lower floors.\n\nZoning changes are inevitable as market forces drive the conversion of office spaces into residential units, creating vast numbers of units within the next five years, many of them very affordable. This shift in land use is a response to the increased demand for housing and the decreased demand for office space due to the pandemic-induced remote work trend.",
    " Title: Human Rights Watch Accuses Ukrainian Government Forces of Using Cluster Munitions in Eastern Ukraine\n\nArticle:\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has released a report alleging that Ukrainian government forces have used cluster munitions in eastern Ukraine, a violation of an international treaty banning the weapon. The report, released on Monday, details suspected cluster munitions attacks in more than 12 locations in eastern Ukraine, where over 3,700 people have been killed in fighting since April.\n\nThe watchdog group found signs of cluster munitions attacks in Donetsk, a rebel-held city with a peacetime population of over one million. The attacks, according to HRW, have killed at least six people and wounded dozens, although the actual toll may be higher.\n\nWhile HRW could not conclusively account for each attack, the report states that \"there is particularly strong evidence that Ukrainian government forces were responsible\" and that their use of the munitions \"may amount to war crimes.\" The group also suggests that rebels may have used the munitions.\n\nA New York Times investigation also found physical evidence\u2014supported by interviews with witnesses and victims\u2014of cluster munitions fired by Ukrainian forces into Donetsk. Two attacks on Oct. 2 and Oct. 6 wounded at least six people and killed a Swiss employee of the International Red Cross, according to the Times.\n\nThe allegations could undermine the fragile cease-fire signed by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and pro-Russian rebels in September. It could also jeopardize long-term peace negotiations in the area.\n\nUkrainian military officials have denied the accusations to reporters, while rebels have not commented.\n\nCluster munitions are banned by 114 countries under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, an international treaty that bans the stockpile or use of the weapons. In addition to Ukraine, Russia and the US are among those that have not joined it, according to the BBC.\n\nMeanwhile, a new report from Germany's foreign intelligence agency (BND) found that pro-Russian rebels were responsible for shooting down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in July. The crash killed 298 people. BND President Gerhard Schindler told a parliamentary committee earlier this month that his agency had \"ample\" evidence to implicate the rebels, Der Spiegel reports. He refuted Russian claims that Ukrainian soldiers shot down the plane with a missile. However, the German investigation concluded that the missile launcher used to down the plane was Ukrainian, not Russian. It said rebels had captured the launcher from a Ukrainian base.",
    " Title: Journalists Raise Concerns Over Electoral College Intervention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, some journalists and political analysts have expressed concerns over a proposed movement urging electors to deny Donald Trump the presidency. This electoral vote, scheduled for Monday, is typically a formality, with electors expected to support the candidate who carried their respective state.\n\nHowever, some Democrats have suggested that if they can persuade 37 Republican electors to change their votes, they could prevent Trump from taking office. This proposal has sparked debate, with critics arguing that such an action would undermine the democratic process and amount to an unjust seizure of the presidency from the candidate who won the popular vote.\n\nE.J. Dionne, a Washington Post columnist, author, and MSNBC contributor, has expressed support for the electoral revolt, stating that Trump's unsuitability for the presidency is evident due to his behavior during the campaign and post-election. Dionne argues that Trump did not win the presidency through the will of the people, as he lost the popular vote by over 2.8 million votes.\n\nKathleen Parker, a moderate conservative Washington Post columnist and former CNN host, has also weighed in on the issue. She suggests that the Founding Fathers created the Electoral College as a safeguard against the election of a demagogue or autocrat, citing Trump as an example of such a candidate. Parker argues that the electoral college was designed to prevent individuals unfit for the presidency from taking office, and that Trump, in her opinion, falls into this category.\n\nThe debate over the electoral college intervention has sparked comparisons to a hypothetical scenario where Trump supporters would urge electors to change their votes if Hillary Clinton had won a close election. Critics argue that such actions would be met with outrage and accusations of undermining democracy.\n\nDespite the ongoing debate, it appears that the movement to change the electoral votes is unlikely to succeed, as the electors are expected to follow the results of the popular vote in their respective states. However, the debate has shed light on the ongoing controversy surrounding the Electoral College and the role it plays in the American democratic process.",
    " Title: Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley Praises Trump's Decision to Strike Iran's Top General\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley praised President Donald Trump for ordering the drone strike that killed Iran's top general, Qasem Soleimani, last week. Haley made the comments during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Monday night.\n\nGen. Qasem Soleimani, the leader of Iran's elite Quds Force, was killed on a road near the Baghdad airport on Friday. The strike that killed Soleimani came after the U.S. blamed Iran for an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq by a mob of demonstrators belonging to Shiite militias.\n\nThe U.S. said one of those Iran-backed militias was responsible for a rocket attack that killed an American contractor and killed at least two dozen of its fighters in airstrikes at the end of December.\n\n\"What the president did left the Iranian regime completely flat-footed,\" Haley said. \"They did not see this coming. They thought they could continue to do their multiple strikes. But when it got to the lives of Americans, the president is never going to allow that to happen.\"\n\nSoleimani led Iran's involvement in proxy wars in the Muslim world, including the civil wars in Syria and Yemen. He supported militias throughout the Middle East that are loyal to Tehran. And he oversaw the training of Shiite Iraqi militants to kill U.S. troops, teaching them how to make deadly roadside bombs.\n\nThe U.S. estimates that Soleimani and the Iran Revolutionary Guard were responsible for killing more than 600 American service members in Iraq following the 2003 invasion.\n\nHaley said Soleimani's killing was \"a long time coming\" and that it left Iran's leaders \"shaking in their boots.\"\n\n\"You do not see anyone standing up for Iran. You're not hearing any of the Gulf members. You're not hearing China. You're not hearing Russia,\" Haley said.\n\n\"The only ones that are mourning the loss of Soleimani are our Democrat leadership, and our Democrat presidential candidates.\"\n\nHer unsubstantiated claim was slammed as irresponsible by several commentators.\n\n\"This kind of statement is ridiculous, inflammatory and dangerous. Rather than inform viewers, Ambassador Haley wants to divide Americans,\" said former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile.\n\nDemocrats have questioned the wisdom of killing Soleimani and whether the Trump administration fully considered the potential consequences before taking action. But many have stressed that Soleimani was responsible for thousands of deaths and that they were not sad to see him go.\n\nIn response to the killing, Iran has approved a bill calling the U.S. military and the Pentagon terrorists. There have also been reports of a stampede at Soleimani's funeral that killed at least 40 people.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden said, \"No American will mourn Qassem Soleimani\u2019s passing,\" and that he deserved to be brought to justice for his crimes against American troops and thousands of innocents throughout the region.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Soleimani was a \"murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans\" but she said the decision to kill him was a \"reckless move\" that \"escalates the situation with Iran.\"\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., has introduced a resolution requiring congressional approval for further military action against Iran and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House would vote on a similar resolution this week.\n\nDemocrats have also called on the administration to brief more members of Congress on the intelligence it says showed Soleimani was planning upcoming attacks on Americans and that he presented an \"imminent threat.\"\n\n\"I accept the notion that there was a real threat,\" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" during an interview Sunday. \"The question of how imminent is something that I need more information on.\"\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sunday that it was \"accurate\" to say Soleimani was plotting against American interests.\n\n\"But it's also true that Soleimani has been plotting against the United States for decades. The question is, did the plotting here rise to the level that required his elimination from the battlefield?\" Schiff said.\n\nHaley shared a clip of her appearance on \"Hannity\" on Twitter and her claim that Democrats were mourning Soleimani. Several public figures ridiculed her claim on the social media platform.\n\n\"Shameful, dangerous comment,\" tweeted 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson. \"We're in trouble as a nation when an ex-Governor and UN Ambassador would say something so dishonest.\"\n\n\"Nikki Haley. I've rarely agreed with your politics but I've always before respected you as a person. It demeans everyone when politicians go low,\" Williamson said.\n\n\"Just knock it off,\" tweeted David Frum, an ex-speechwriter for former President George W. Bush. He included a link to an October 2015 CNN article about then-presidential candidate Trump saying the world would have been better off if dictators Saddam Hussein and Moammar Gadhafi were still in power in Iraq and Libya.\n\n\"This is categorically false. The former Governor of South Carolina, former Ambassador to the United Nations & current member of the board of directors of Boeing Corporation \u2013 on television saying something she absolutely knows is untrue,\" MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle said.\n\n\"Here's a question: What WON'T Nikki Haley say at this point?\" asked New York Daily News sports columnist Mike Lupica.",
    " Title: Media's Role in Donald Trump's Rise: A Neutral Analysis of Politico Magazine's Special Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Donald Trump's potential Republican nomination win in Indiana, a wave of introspection and criticism towards the media has emerged, with some arguing that the press has played a significant role in Trump's rise. This perspective is evident in Politico Magazine's recent special issue, which features Trump facing a media mob on its cover with the headline, \"What Have We Done?\"\n\nThe issue, which is heavily critical of Trump, includes several essays that blame the media for Trump's success. However, one essay by media writer Jack Shafer argues that the blame game \"gives too much credit to the media and too little credit to Donald Trump.\"\n\nOne of the contributors, reporter Ben Schreckinger, who became a full-time Trump correspondent despite having no prior experience, expresses frustration over criticism from Trump and his team, as well as a lack of access, both of which are common in political journalism.\n\nFormer CNN and NBC anchor Campbell Brown, in her essay titled \"Why I Blame TV for Trump,\" argues that TV news is catering to Trump by giving him editorial control and prioritizing ratings over journalistic integrity. She claims that Trump's candidacy is largely a creation of a TV media that wants him to be the central character in this year's political drama.\n\nHowever, Brown's argument overlooks several factors. Trump has seized a significant amount of \"free\" airtime by doing numerous interviews and driving the campaign dialogue. Reporters have also extensively investigated Trump's businesses, rhetoric, promises, and contradictions, albeit with limited impact on his lead.\n\nMoreover, a large portion of the media attention Trump receives is harshly negative, often from conservative and liberal commentators who oppose him ideologically. Trump responds forcefully, particularly on Twitter, though he has toned it down recently. His supporters view these denunciations as evidence of his opposition to the failed media/political establishment.\n\nIt is essential to acknowledge the media's role in Trump's rise, but it is equally important to consider the factors that have allowed Trump to forge a connection with millions of Republican voters and overcome media criticism. The media's coverage of Trump is not without criticism, but it is also not solely responsible for his success.",
    " Title: US to Open New Embassy in Jerusalem in May, Coinciding with Israel's 70th Anniversary\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Department of State has announced that a new American embassy in Jerusalem will open in May, coinciding with Israel's 70th anniversary. The announcement brings forward the controversial plan, initially announced by President Trump in December, by at least a year.\n\nThe embassy will initially be located at existing consular facilities in the Arnona district of Jerusalem. The status of Jerusalem is a contentious issue, as it goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel considers Jerusalem its \"eternal and undivided\" capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, as the capital of a future state.\n\nThe announcement has been met with criticism from Palestinian officials. Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official, called the move a \"blatant provocation.\" The anniversary of Israel's founding precedes by a day what Palestinians call the Nakba, or \"catastrophe\" of their displacement in the 1948-49 Arab-Israel war.\n\nIn December, President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the embassy from Tel Aviv, where all other embassies are located, infuriated Palestinians. The declaration broke with decades of US neutrality on the issue and put the US out of step with the rest of the international community.\n\nWithin days of President Trump's declaration, a UN resolution was passed declaring any decisions regarding the status of the city \"null and void\" and insisting on its cancellation. It was backed by 128 states, with 35 abstaining and nine voting against.\n\nLast month, US Vice-President Mike Pence told the Israeli parliament that the move would occur sometime before the end of 2019. The sudden change to May has been seen by some as a deliberate snub to Palestinians.\n\nThe move was welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said, \"This decision will turn Israel's 70th Independence Day into an even bigger celebration.\" He also expressed gratitude to President Trump, saying, \"Thank you, President Trump, for your leadership and friendship.\"\n\nHowever, the move has been criticized by some as a potential obstacle to peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine. Mr. Erekat stated, \"The US move reflects their total insensitivities to what goes on in this region.\" He added, \"The US administration has become part of the problem and not part of the solution.\"",
    " Title: Congressional Hearing on Russia Inquiry: Trump, Schiff, and Mueller Report\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - A contentious congressional hearing took place on Thursday, as President Donald Trump's Republican allies clashed with one of Trump's most prominent Democratic critics, Representative Adam Schiff, during a hearing on Russian meddling in the U.S. elections. The hearing, titled \"Putin's Playbook: The Kremlin's Use of Oligarchs, Money, and Intelligence in 2016 and Beyond,\" was marked by heated exchanges and political maneuvering.\n\nHours prior to the hearing, Trump took to Twitter, demanding that Schiff resign from Congress due to his comments about the president's 2016 campaign and Russia. In response, Republican lawmakers called for Schiff to step down as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, citing his comments about the president's associates and their actions during the 2016 campaign.\n\nSchiff, however, fired back during the hearing, labeling actions by the president's associates as unpatriotic and corrupt. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, defended Schiff and criticized the actions of Trump and committee Republicans, calling them \"shameful\" and \"irresponsible.\"\n\nU.S. Attorney General William Barr, who was empowered by Justice Department regulations to decide how much of the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report to make public, on Sunday released a four-page summary of Mueller's findings. Barr stated that Mueller did not establish that Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in the 2016 election.\n\nOn Wednesday, Barr informed House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler about the length of the report, which is over 300 pages long. Barr also agreed to testify before Nadler's committee, although no date was set.\n\nRepublicans in the Senate thwarted another effort by Democrats to pass a resolution calling for the Mueller report to be made available to the public and Congress. The House has passed a similar resolution.\n\nA Justice Department official stated on Tuesday that Barr would issue a public version of the report within \"weeks, not months.\" However, top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer criticized Barr's delay in the release, stating that it has \"too much of the odor of political expediency to help the man who appointed him, President Trump.\"\n\nPelosi also demanded the report's release, stating, \"No, thank you, Mr. Attorney General. We do not need your interpretation. Show us the report, and we'll come to our own conclusions.\"\n\nRepublicans have since launched a counter-attack against Democrats since Barr released his summary. Trump used an early-morning Twitter post to assail Schiff, whose committee is investigating Russia's influence on U.S. elections. Trump did not provide specifics of his accusations against Schiff, who has not been accused by authorities of leaking classified information.\n\nDuring the hearing, Schiff cited a list of the Trump campaign's contacts with Russians, from Donald Trump Jr. welcoming a Russian offer of \"dirt\" on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, to former national security adviser Michael Flynn secretly discussing easing U.S. sanctions on Russia with Moscow's ambassador before Trump became president.\n\n\"You might say that's all OK,\" Schiff said. \"You might say that's just what you need to do to win. But I don't think it's OK. I think it's immoral. I think it's unethical. I think it's unpatriotic, and yes, I think it's corrupt - and evidence of collusion.\"\n\nDuring his investigation, Mueller brought charges against 34 people, including Russian agents and former Trump aides. Mueller left unresolved in his report the question of whether Trump committed obstruction of justice by impeding the Russia investigation and did not exonerate the president, Barr said. Barr himself concluded there was insufficient evidence to establish that Trump had committed obstruction of justice.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee has been bitterly split along party lines for years on the Russia investigation, which was taken over by Mueller in May 2017 after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. The committee's Republicans wrapped up their investigation a year ago, finding no collusion between Trump and Moscow to influence the vote. Democrats, led by Schiff, blasted the announcement as premature.\n\nThursday's hearing continued after the angry exchange between its members.",
    " Title: Career Diplomat William Taylor Testifies on Alleged Quid Pro Quo in Ukraine Aid\n\nArticle:\n\nAmbassador William Taylor, a career diplomat who has served as the U.S. envoy to Ukraine since June, testified before Congress that President Donald Trump made the release of military aid to Ukraine conditional on a pledge that a political rival would be investigated. Taylor's testimony is the latest development in the ongoing impeachment inquiry into suspected abuse of power by President Trump.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Taylor stated, \"Our relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular, informal channel of U.S. policy-making and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons.\"\n\nTaylor's testimony corroborates other reported accounts of White House efforts to get Ukraine to open investigations that could be damaging to Democrats, particularly former Vice-President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Taylor related a conversation he had with Gordon Sondland, one of the coordinators of what he described as an \"irregular, informal channel of U.S. policymaking,\" in which Sondland told him that everything, including military aid and a White House visit, was dependent on the Ukrainian president making a public statement that he would order these investigations.\n\nTaylor's remarks appear to contradict Sondland's earlier statement before lawmakers, where he said he had had \"no discussions\" with state department or White House officials regarding the investigating the Bidens.\n\nThe \"irregular\" channel also included U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nBy mid-July, Taylor said, it was apparent that the meeting Zelensky wanted with Trump \"was conditioned on the investigation of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.\" Taylor also noted that he heard a White House budget and management staffer say she was ordered not to release aid to Ukraine and realized \"one of the key pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was threatened.\"\n\nTaylor's testimony is significant as it provides a detailed account of the alleged quid pro quo between the Trump administration and Ukraine. The credibility of Taylor's testimony may be challenged by the president's defenders, but his career as a diplomat and his reputation for meticulous note-taking may make it difficult for his testimony to be dismissed as inaccurate.\n\nIf the House finds sufficient evidence, articles of impeachment will be put to a vote. If they are approved, proceedings will move to trial in the Senate, which is controlled by Trump's Republicans. The outcome of the impeachment inquiry remains uncertain.",
    " Title: California and New York Lease Hotel Rooms for Homeless Individuals Released from Jail Amid COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia and New York are leasing hotel rooms to provide temporary housing for homeless individuals, including those released from jail, as part of an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus in crowded jails and homeless encampments. The move is an unprecedented response to the pandemic, as law enforcement agencies across the country grapple with how to prevent outbreaks in jails and find housing solutions for released inmates.\n\nIn Oakland, California, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office is leasing 393 rooms in two hotels near the airport for homeless individuals, including those released from Santa Rita Jail, one of the state's largest lockups. The hotels, a Comfort Inn and Suites and the Radisson Hotel at the Oakland Airport, began taking people under the new contracts on March 25.\n\nThe pandemic has prompted law enforcement officials to make difficult decisions to prevent outbreaks in crowded jails. Some agencies have released thousands of people early. However, when people leave jails, finding housing can be a challenge. In the best of times, it's a thorny question, and cities are trying to find answers.\n\nIn California, the pandemic coincides with a historic homelessness crisis. Makeshift tent encampments line highways, railroad tracks, and parks. There are an estimated 150,000 homeless Californians, driven to the streets by soaring home prices, a housing shortage, and lack of access to mental health care.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order that includes $50 million to lease hotel rooms or buy travel trailers for homeless people, including those released from jails. As of Friday, the state had secured 7,000 hotel rooms.\n\nPhil Ting, a San Francisco Democrat and chair of the California Assembly Budget Committee, said lawmakers allowed flexibility for local governments to house particularly vulnerable people, like homeless prisoners. \"If someone in a homeless encampment got sick because of coronavirus, the whole encampment could be infected,\" Ting said.\n\nEve Garrow, a homelessness policy analyst and advocate for the ACLU of Southern California, said, \"Being placed in a motel room means having your own living space, your own shower, your own bed, and it allows you to self-isolate. Honestly, I feel that it will save lives.\"\n\nRandall Kuhn, an associate professor at UCLA's Fielding School of Public Health and co-author of a recent study, said Bay Area counties were \"really setting an example for the rest of the country.\" Oakland's agreement allows the government to lease 393 rooms in the two hotels near the airport.\n\nOther counties throughout the state have also started lease negotiations, including San Diego and San Francisco, where county supervisors unanimously approved a resolution that included housing for people who had been in jail. San Francisco's public defender, Mano Raju, estimated 20 to 30 percent of the local jail population did not have anywhere to live.\n\nSgt. Ray Kelly, the sheriff's spokesman in Alameda County, said he hopes his county's plan can serve as a blueprint for places throughout the country as they wrestle with how to safely release people from jails. He said crime is down, and no jail detainees have yet to test positive for the virus.",
    " Title: Administration Proposes Charging for Protests, Closing 80% of White House Sidewalks\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. administration, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, has proposed a plan that could potentially charge citizens for protests and close 80% of the sidewalks surrounding the White House. The proposal was introduced by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in August.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, the administration is considering closing 80% of the sidewalks near the White House, and may charge \"event management\" costs for demonstrations. Currently, the National Park Service can recoup costs for special events but not for spontaneous protests, such as those that typically occur in Lafayette Park across from the White House.\n\nThe charges could include costs for erecting barriers, cleaning fees, repairs to grass, permit fees, and the salaries of personnel on hand to monitor demonstrations, all tallied at the discretion of the police.\n\nCivil liberties groups have expressed concern over the proposals, viewing them as a violation of the rights guaranteed under the First Amendment. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) stated that such fees \"could make mass protests like Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic 1963 March on Washington and its 'I have a dream' speech too expensive to happen.\"\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the federal government attempted to impose similar barriers on citizens' right to assemble in protest and were sued by the ACLU. In their ruling, the courts reasserted the importance of parks for public assembly and the airing of opinions, stating that such sites were \"cardinal values\" in democratic society. The White House sidewalk, Lafayette Park, and the Ellipse were unique sites for the exercise of these rights, and the courts could not \"accord deference to an executive approach to use of the White House sidewalk that is rooted in a bias against expressive conduct.\"\n\nBrie Jackson (@PositivelyBrie) tweeted, \"If you have to pay for free speech, it's not free.\"\n\nThe National Park Service has attempted to justify the proposal by stating that large protests, like the Women's March, overtax their abilities and place a heavy cost on the government. However, some argue that when it comes to preserving the right to protest, no cost is too high.\n\nThe public has until October 15 to comment on the plans.",
    " Title: Gas Prices: Regional Differences in Gasoline Costs Considered in Light of Local Wages and Usage\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by GasBuddy reveals that the cost of filling up a car varies significantly across the United States when factoring in average gasoline usage, local wages, and average gas prices. Contrary to conventional wisdom, states in the Southeast, which are typically among the cheapest areas for gasoline, are surprisingly expensive when considering the number of hours of local labor needed to pay for a year's worth of gas.\n\nAccording to Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, there are some surprising findings in the study. \"You tend to see areas that are more rural, with challenged incomes or lower median hourly wages where the true cost of filling up is more hard work than other areas,\" DeHaan said.\n\nTo assess the true cost of filling up, GasBuddy calculated the average amount of gasoline consumed per driver for every state, average hourly wages in those states, and the average gas price for each state as of Aug. 1. This allowed the researchers to determine \"how much work it would take\" to pay for a year's worth of gas, DeHaan explained.\n\nFor example, Mississippi, which had the second-lowest average price per gallon in the country on Thursday ($2.20), ranks as the fifth most expensive state in the country, requiring an average of 100.3 hours of work to pay for a year's worth of gas. On the flip side, Hawaii, which had the highest average price per gallon on Thursday ($3.66), is actually the 11th cheapest state in the country, requiring an average of 80.4 hours of work to pay for a year's worth of gas.\n\nPeople living in most Northeast states need the fewest number of hours worked to pay for their gas. Measured by these standards, the cheapest state in the country is Massachusetts at only 66.8 hours, followed by Connecticut at 70.6, Maryland at 71.7, New York at 73.8, Rhode Island at 75.4, and Delaware at 76.8.\n\nOne big reason for this discrepancy is that people don't drive as much in the Northeast, where mass transit options are more prevalent. Some states that have a high cost per gallon also rank as the most expensive when measured by the number of hours worked to pay for a year's worth of gas. Nevada, which had the fourth-highest price per gallon on Thursday ($3.12), requires the most hours worked at 107.7, according to GasBuddy.\n\nHere is the full list of states, ranked by the number of hours the average person needs to work to afford a year of gas, according to GasBuddy:\n\n1. Nevada - 107.7\n2. Montana - 107.4\n3. Idaho - 107.1\n4. South Dakota - 101.4\n5. Mississippi - 100.3\n6. Oregon - 100.1\n7. West Virginia - 98.8\n8. Arkansas - 98.2\n9. Utah - 97.0\n10.

    " Title: Hillary Clinton Advocates for Gun Control at Mental Health Conference\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed concerns about the widespread acceptance of the right to carry firearms in any location at any time during a speech at the National Council for Behavioral Health conference in Maryland on Tuesday. Clinton suggested that the current perspective, which she referred to as an \"almost article of faith,\" is not in the best interest of the majority of citizens.\n\n\"I think again we're way out of balance. I think that we've got to rein in what has become an almost article of faith that anybody can have a gun anywhere, anytime,\" Clinton said. \"And I do not believe that is in the best interest of the vast majority of people. And I think you can say that and still support the right of people to own guns.\"\n\nClinton expressed concerns about the proliferation of guns in settings like movie theaters, citing instances of shootings over seemingly minor incidents such as loud gum chewing or cellphone use. She compared this situation to countries with no rule of law and no self-control, implying that the United States should pay attention to this issue.\n\nWhen asked about which countries Clinton was referring to, the article does not provide specific details. However, it mentions a study by Harvard in 2013 that found a correlation between high gun ownership and low crime rates globally. The article also notes that while American gun ownership is high, many other developed nations, such as Norway, Finland, Germany, France, and Denmark, have high rates of gun ownership but lower murder rates compared to countries with less gun ownership.\n\nThe article also mentions that Clinton has not yet decided whether or not she will run for president in 2016, but encouraged Americans to \"stay tuned.\"",
    " Title: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's Shift in Immigration Stance Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker has found himself in the midst of an immigration-related controversy, following the dismissal of a communications aide after old tweets critical of Representative Steve King (R-IA) were brought to light. The aide, Liz Mair, had tweeted, \"In other news, IA is once again embarrassing itself, and the GOP, this morning. Thanks, guys,\" in reference to King's January 24th Iowa Freedom Summit where Walker, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Carly Fiorina, and other potential Republican presidential candidates spoke.\n\nWalker's immigration troubles began in January, as opponents circulated prior statements indicating that Walker had endorsed a \"path to citizenship\" and the Senate's Gang of 8 bill. Walker has since attempted to distance himself from these positions, telling Fox News Sunday's Chris Wallace on March 1st, \"My view has changed. I\u2019m flat-out saying it. Candidates can say that, sometimes they don\u2019t.\"\n\nWalker's stance on immigration has evolved over time. In July 2013, he stated, \"You hear some people talk about border security and a wall and all that. To me, I do not know that you need any of that if you had a better, saner way to let people into the country in the first place.\" In March 2015, he expressed, \"I've talked to people all across America. And the concerns I have is that we need to secure the border. We ultimately need to put in place a system that works. A legal immigration system that works. And part of doing this is put the onus on employers, getting them E-Verify and tools to do that.\"\n\nWalker's current position is that illegal immigrants already in the United States should be given a path to citizenship, but only after the border is secured. In response to a question about a potential path to citizenship for these individuals, Walker stated, \"I believe there's a way that you can do that. First and foremost, you've got to secure that border or none of these plans make any sense.\"\n\nWalker's stance on immigration appears to align with that of fellow Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush. Both politicians believe that the border should be secured first, and only after that is accomplished can illegal immigrants currently in the United States be given legal status or a path to citizenship. The differences, if any, between Walker and Bush on immigration are not immediately apparent.",
    " Title: Conservative Media and Liberal Criticism: A Neutral Analysis of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Comments\n\nArticle:\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., in a discussion on HuffPost Live, expressed concerns about the right-wing influence in the American media, particularly Fox News. Kennedy stated that 95% of talk radio in the U.S. is right-wing, and 22% of Americans consider Fox News their primary news source. He argued that this has contributed to the country's division since the Civil War and has empowered certain ideologues in the U.S. Congress.\n\nKennedy's comments were met with criticism from conservatives, who often complain about liberal media bias. Kennedy's assertion that conservative media is unfairly biased while ignoring the bias in liberal media is a point of contention. The article notes that liberal media is often accused of slanting their reporting in favor of Democrats, which is evident in their selection, presentation, and treatment of news stories.\n\nKennedy's most significant criticism, however, is his scapegoating of conservative media for the divisiveness in the nation. The article suggests that the emergence of a robust alternative media has given conservatives a consistent public voice, and the division in the nation may be due to differing worldviews rather than media bias.\n\nThe article also highlights Kennedy's apparent blindness to liberal media bias and intolerance of opposing viewpoints. Many liberals, according to the article, believe that only their views are legitimate and that contrary ones are dangerous. This has led to calls for the suppression of opposing speech, as seen in campus speech codes, crusades against so-called hate speech, and the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that America's problem is not divided opinion and rigorous debate, but journalists who once acted as watchdogs against abuses of power and now function as co-conspirators in those abuses by liberal politicians. The article suggests that conservatives, both in the media and in public service, are more honest about their beliefs and biases, and thus represent less danger to the republic than liberal politicians and media masquerading as neutral, unbiased, or objective. The article does not advocate for the suppression of liberal speech but calls for more transparency and honesty in reporting.",
    " Title: The Limited Role of Federal Government in Gun Regulation: A Constitutional Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nThe current debate on gun control in the United States has seen President Obama and Vice President Biden express a commitment to use federal powers to ensure safety. This commitment, however, raises questions about the constitutionality of federal involvement in matters of health, safety, welfare, and morality, as these areas were not explicitly delegated to the federal government by the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe Constitution, drafted by the Founding Fathers, was created to establish a federal government of limited powers, derived from the states. The states are sovereign, and their powers were not delegated to the federal government. The Constitution grants the federal government 16 unique, discrete powers, all of which concern nationhood, such as foreign affairs, national defense, and interstate commerce.\n\nThe Supreme Court has consistently ruled that the \"police power,\" or the power to regulate for health, safety, welfare, and morality, remains with the states. This principle is consistent with the philosophical principle of \"subsidiarity,\" which states that governmental intervention should be the minimum needed and that problems closest to the people should be addressed by the government closest to those people.\n\nThe Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits all governments, including the federal government, from infringing upon the right of the people to keep and bear arms. This right allows individuals to defend themselves when the police cannot or will not, and it provides a residue of firepower in the hands of the people to counter any potential tyrant.\n\nThe current debate on gun control, with the federal government's involvement, raises questions about the constitutional limits of government power. The Constitution was designed to protect personal freedom from the lust for power of those in government and from the passions of the people who elect them. It is crucial to uphold these principles to maintain a balance between individual rights and government intervention.",

Boehner, Republican of Ohio, and Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, regarding the passing of the spending bill. Reid expressed optimism that Republican leaders are committed to keeping the government funded.\n\nHowever, some Republicans, including Mr. Boehner, have not ruled out the possibility of a government shutdown. Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, an outspoken opponent of an immigration overhaul, is reportedly preparing legislation to counteract any executive actions taken by the president regarding immigration policy.\n\nSenator John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican, shared concerns among his colleagues that any unilateral action by the president could jeopardize the opportunity for passing their own immigration legislation once Republicans control both chambers in the next Congress.\n\nDespite opposition to the president's immigration policies, some Republicans, such as Senator John McCain of Arizona, have expressed opposition to a government shutdown as a tactic. McCain stated, \"I'm just unalterably opposed to another government shutdown. I'm not going to do that to my state, and I will do everything in my power to see that we don't shut down the government.\"\n\nThe article does not provide specific details on the immigration policies or executive actions being referred to, nor does it offer a definitive timeline for the passing of the spending bill or any potential immigration legislation.

She can be followed on Twitter @realjuliasong. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nSong, a native of Brazil, was involved in organizing peaceful protests against government corruption and abuses of power in her home country during 2013. At the time, Brazil was grappling with widespread corruption, and many of its politicians, the source of much of the scandal, continued to push agendas that benefited themselves and a select few.\n\nHowever, the excessive spending on the World Cup drained the country's already depleted resources, providing an opportunity for Song and Brazilians from across the political spectrum to come together. Their collective protests led to a government investigation into corruption, resulting in the imprisonment of many politicians and the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff.\n\nShortly after the protests, Song moved to the United States on a family visa, eventually being granted temporary residency, which allowed her to work. She then embarked on a four-year-long process to gain full citizenship, navigating the complexities and financial costs of the American immigration bureaucracy.\n\nUpon arriving in the U.S., Song believed her activism days were behind her. However, she noticed a growing political divide between the elites, or establishment politicians, and working-class Americans struggling to make ends meet. Sensing the disconnect and the growing power of the political elite, she began using social media to raise awareness of the issue, first on Instagram and then on Twitter.\n\nSong advocates for her belief in a smaller government that guarantees more individual freedoms and allows everyday Americans a chance at success. For those who may not have guessed, she identifies as a Republican and supports President Donald Trump's emphasis on fighting for ordinary Americans.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Issue Warning to GOP on Obamacare Repeal and Replacement\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Democrats have issued a warning to Republicans planning a quick repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) next year, stating that they will not cooperate in replacing it. The warning comes as top Republicans are plotting to move forward with a budget plan in January, allowing them to repeal much of Obamacare on a straight-party line vote around the time President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, who will be the third-ranking Senate Democrat in the new Congress, said, \"If they take it away, they better tell us how to fix it because they broke it.\" Sen. Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate Democratic leader, told CNN on Thursday, \"They're going to find repealing Obamacare without putting in a replacement will be far more disastrous and less clever than they think.\"\n\nTo replace Obamacare under the Senate rules, Republicans would need the support of at least eight Democratic senators to reach the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster. Top Democrats are warning that the GOP will get little cooperation from their caucus on a replacement plan if they dismantle the health care law.\n\nRepublicans are gambling that Democrats will buckle, particularly Democratic senators up for reelection in 2018 from states Trump won. However, Sen. Dick Durbin, Schumer's chief deputy, said, \"I want to know what the replacement is going to be. I want to know if it's real protection, and as good as [the Affordable Care Act] for the millions who count on it.\"\n\nGOP leaders are weighing a plan that would delay the health care repeal from taking effect for up to three years, giving Congress time to craft a new system to provide health insurance for the millions who could lose it. They are also planning an ambitious legislative agenda in the new year, moving forward on a plan to rewrite the tax code, a new government funding bill, and confirming a spate of Trump's nominees, including to the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, dealing with the red-hot issue of health care could be the trickiest, especially since there's no consensus within the GOP yet on what the replacement plan would look like. Even if the GOP writes into its legislation that a repeal won't take effect for three years, some health policy experts warn that the health care system could collapse immediately because insurers may pull out of the expiring system. That could intensify pressure on the GOP to find a solution right away.\n\nThe issue has been discussed at length between House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and senior Trump officials, and it dominated talk among top House Republicans in a closed-door meeting on Thursday. Oklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole, who attended the meeting, conceded that moving ahead with repeal will put the burden on Republicans to lay out the next steps. North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, who will chair the conservative House Freedom Caucus next Congress, said the GOP was still sorting out its plans on the issue.",
    " Title: California Legislature Passes Bill Requiring Presidential Candidates to Release Tax Returns\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia lawmakers have passed a bill that would require presidential candidates to make their tax returns public before appearing on the state's ballot. The legislation, passed by a Democratic-controlled Legislature, marks the latest move in California's ongoing dispute with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe bill, authored by Democratic state Sen. Mike McGuire, was passed after similar measures failed to advance in other states. The enforceability of the bill remains questionable, as the U.S. Supreme Court has held that states cannot add to the qualifications for U.S. Senate or House members, according to a legislative analysis. California's legislative counsel released an opinion ahead of the vote stating the measure as unconstitutional. However, other legal experts have suggested that such a requirement could pass constitutional muster.\n\nIt is uncertain if Governor Jerry Brown will sign the measure. While Trump is the first president in years to ascend to the White House without releasing his tax returns, the Democratic governor has resisted similar disclosures. In a break with longstanding tradition of gubernatorial candidates in California, he did not release his tax returns during his 2010 or 2014 campaigns.\n\nThe bill passed the state Senate on the final day of this year's legislative session, after gaining approval in California's lower house the previous day. The bill would require, as a condition for appearing on the primary ballot, that presidential candidates file copies of their five most recent tax returns with state officials. The state, in turn, would make them public.",
    " Title: Canada Legalizes Recreational Cannabis: A Nationwide Celebration and Regulatory Changes\n\nArticle:\n\nCanada marked the end of cannabis prohibition on Wednesday with nationwide celebrations, parties, and media coverage. The shift in policy, which makes Canada one of only two nations where marijuana is legal, was a significant milestone for the country.\n\nIan Power, a resident of Newfoundland and Labrador, was the first person to purchase legal cannabis in Canada. Across the country, Alex Smith was among the many who made purchases hours later. The BC Cannabis Store in Kamloops, British Columbia, currently the only legal store in the province, boasted a clean \"west coast casual\" interior and a range of products.\n\nFor many, the experience of shopping for cannabis legally was a significant change. Mr. Smith, a long-time cannabis user, described the experience as \"a little surreal.\" He noted that, for much of his adult life, he had hidden his cannabis use due to the stigma associated with it.\n\nHowever, the legalization of cannabis was not without its challenges. In Ontario, public consumption remained prohibited, and the streets of Toronto were largely drug-free on the day of legalization. Most of the partying took place on the premises of private businesses, such as Hot Black Coffee in Downtown Toronto, which transformed its back patio into a \"chill\" lounge.\n\nThe Canadian Medical Association Journal published an editorial calling the legalization a \"national, uncontrolled experiment in which the profits of cannabis producers and tax revenues are squarely pitched against the health of Canadians.\" The Canadian Psychiatric Society cautioned Canadians under 25 about using cannabis, warning of potential negative effects on memory, attention, and the ability to process thoughts.\n\nThe Canadian government has implemented several regulations to control cannabis consumption. Users must be 18 or 19 (depending on the province) to purchase, and there are penalties for those caught selling to minors. Canadians will be limited to the number of plants they can grow themselves and can only hold 30 grams (one ounce) on their person in public at a time.\n\nThe government also introduced new drug-impaired driving legislation that includes stiff fines and possible jail time. Police will be able to demand suspected drivers take a roadside sobriety test or provide a saliva sample to test for THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis. The reliability of these saliva tests has raised concerns, and legal experts expect challenges to the law to make their way to court.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, who promised to make marijuana legal in 2014, has admitted to smoking cannabis five or six times in the past. He has no intention of using marijuana and has called the criminal prohibition of cannabis a \"failure.\" The government hopes the new regulatory system will be more effective at keeping cannabis out of the hands of minors and at reducing health and social harms related to its use.\n\nOn Wednesday, Canada also announced it would waive wait time and fees for those who have served their time for minor cannabis possession convictions and want to apply for a pardon. This move is intended to address the disproportionate impact of previous cannabis laws on young people from minorities.\n\nSome advocates for amnesty say this is a good first step but are calling on Canada to have those convictions expunged, which would completely erase the record. The day's events were met with a flurry of marijuana-themed puns and jokes, with police departments using humor to advocate for responsible consumption. The day's name remains a topic of debate, with no general consensus reached.",
    " Title: Obama Outlines Economic Vision for Second Term, Emphasizes American Nationalism in DNC Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday, President Barack Obama called for a \"harder\" path to long-term economic prosperity, outlining grand economic promises for a second term in office. The speech concluded three days of speeches from Democratic leaders who emphasized that their party is the only one that can be trusted to look out for the interests of the suffering middle class.\n\nObama acknowledged the nation's economic struggles, stating that the economy is far from fully healed and that the country does not currently sense that it is on the doorstep of a better future. In a departure from his last presidential campaign, Democrats argued in the starkest language yet that Republican Mitt Romney is an out-of-touch plutocrat who lacks simple patriotism.\n\nObama attempted to strike a balance between connecting with voters in the midst of a protracted economic downturn and offering an optimistic vision for the future. He outlined specific benchmarks for success, including a million new manufacturing jobs by the end of 2016, a sharp reduction in oil imports, 600,000 jobs in the natural gas industry, 100,000 new math and science teachers, and new controls on the rising cost of college tuition.\n\nThe mechanics of achieving those goals were largely absent from the speech, but Obama stated that he would aim to extract sacrifices from the wealthiest citizens and special interests in order to bring about widely shared economic gains. Throughout the speech and the evening as a whole, there was an undercurrent of America-first triumphalism, and a combination of implicit and explicit charges that Republicans do not share that brand of nationalism.\n\nObama took time in his speech to mock his challengers and question their readiness for the job of president and vice president. In an allusion to Romney's bumbling summer trip overseas, Obama joked, \"You might not be ready for diplomacy with Beijing if you can't visit the Olympics without insulting our closest ally.\" It remains to be seen whether Obama accomplished his goal of delivering a forward-looking economic vision and breaking away from a debate focused on an unemployment rate stuck persistently above 8 percent.",
    " Title: Trump Signs $1.3 Trillion Spending Bill, Replaces National Security Adviser\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has signed a $1.3 trillion spending plan to fund the government through September, overcoming his initial threat of a veto. The bill, which passed in the wee hours of the morning on Friday, includes funding for the military, homeland security, and other government operations.\n\nTrump had initially expressed dissatisfaction with the bill, criticizing the lack of action on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) debate and his proposed border wall. In a tweet on March 23, 2018, Trump stated, \"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\"\n\nHowever, Trump signed the bill on \"national security\" grounds, citing the rebuilding of America's military and improvements to homeland security. He expressed displeasure with the bill, stating, \"There are a lot of things I'm not happy about in this bill.\"\n\nThe bill received robust bipartisan support in both the House and Senate, but conservatives in both houses criticized the bill, with some complaining they had only seven hours to read the 2,232-page bill. The high price tag and inclusion of line items, such as funding for Planned Parenthood, were among the criticisms.\n\nOne item in the measure that both sides celebrated is the Taylor Force Act, named for an American combat veteran who was brutally murdered by a Palestinian terrorist while visiting Israel. The Palestinian government provided financial rewards to the terrorist's family, a practice the Taylor Force Act aims to stop by suspending US funding to the Palestinian Authority until they change their laws incentivizing terrorism.\n\nMeanwhile, there is a shakeup in the president's inner circle, with Trump replacing his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, with John Bolton, former US ambassador to the UN and an outspoken hawk on foreign affairs. Bolton's appointment increases the chance the US will pull out of the Iran nuclear deal and may lead to a trade war with China, as the president announced he will charge tariffs on as much as $60 billion in Chinese imports to the US. China has responded by announcing a list of American goods that may be hit with higher import taxes.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Praises George W. Bush's Foreign Policy, Critiques Obama's in CNN Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in an interview on CNN's \"Fareed Zakaria GPS\" show, expressed praise for former President George W. Bush's foreign policy, particularly his emergency program for AIDS relief in Sub-Saharan Africa. Clinton also seemed to critique President Obama's foreign affairs policies, suggesting that the U.S. needs to clarify its values and intentions to lead and manage effectively on the international stage.\n\nDuring the interview, Clinton stated, \"We have to go back out and sell ourselves. It is not to be taken for granted. What do we stand for and how do we intend to lead and manage? How do we try to enlist the rest of the world in this struggle between cooperation and order and conflict and disorder which is really at the root of so much that\u2019s going on today \u2014 and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done a very good job of that.\"\n\nClinton went on to discuss the differences between headline news and actual trends, implying that Bush, and not Obama, had a long-term view of the international stage. She cited Bush's AIDS relief program as an example of his positive impact, stating, \"George W. Bush is very popular in Sub-Saharan Africa. Why? Because of the president\u2019s emergency program for AIDS relief. Whether you agree or disagree with a lot of what else he did \u2014 and I disagree with a lot of it \u2014 I am proud to be an American when I go to Sub-Saharan Africa and people say, \u2018I want to thank President Bush and the United States for helping us fight HIV/AIDS.\u2019\"\n\nClinton also seemed to take another jab at Obama's White House, stating that the U.S. spends a \"lot of money and a lot of time and effort\" to exert influence around the world. She added, \"I think we would be able to succeed more effectively if we were clearer about who we are and what we stand for and the values that we hold.\"\n\nFox News analysts suggested that Clinton's pro-Bush views may be genuine, but they also speculated that she may be trying to distance herself from Obama's foreign affairs policies if she decides to run for the presidency in 2016. The specifics of Clinton's potential presidential campaign were not discussed in the provided text.",
    " Title: Timeline of Events Suggests Mitt Romney's Criticism of Obama Administration's Response to Middle East Attacks May Be Misleading\n\nArticle:\n\nA timeline of events suggests that Mitt Romney's criticism of the Obama administration's response to the attacks on U.S. missions in Libya and Egypt may be misleading. The following is a chronology of the events that transpired on Tuesday, September 11, 2012:\n\n1. Tuesday morning in Egypt, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo released a statement condemning the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims. The statement did not specifically mention the controversial video, but it said the embassy \"firmly reject(s) the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others.\"\n\n2. Protesters began to breach the embassy in Cairo, where ultimately several men scaled the walls of the mission and tore down its American flag.\n\n3. At 6:30 p.m. ET, the embassy tweeted about its earlier statement: \"This morning's condemnation (issued before protests began) still stands. As does our condemnation of unjustified breach of the Embassy.\" The tweet was posted by a foreign service officer, CNN confirmed. Several State Department sources said that the U.S. ambassador to Egypt did not sign off on the original statement, as she was in Washington at the time.\n\n4. Reports then emerged Tuesday evening, Eastern Standard Time, of attacks on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya. The State Department also told CNN that a consulate employee had been killed in the attacks. At the time, however, the employee's nationality was not clear.\n\n5. At 10:10 p.m. ET, Romney's campaign released an embargoed (until midnight) statement blasting the Obama administration. The statement had a veiled reference to the Egypt embassy's statement that condemned offensive speech against Muslims and referred to it as the administration's \"first response\":\n\n   \"I'm outraged by the attacks on American diplomatic missions in Libya and Egypt and by the death of an American consulate worker in Benghazi. It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.\"\n\n6. At 10:25 p.m. ET, the campaign lifted the embargo, and news outlets began reporting the statement.\n\n7. At 12:11 a.m. ET, Obama's re-election campaign put out a statement accusing Romney of taking a political swipe during the crisis.\n\n   \"We are shocked that, at a time when the United States of America is confronting the tragic death of one of our diplomatic officers in Libya, Governor Romney would choose to launch a political attack.\"\n\n8. At 6:21 a.m. ET, CNN reported on its wire service that U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens was killed in a rocket attack. Over the next few hours, it was revealed that three other personnel, including a Foreign Service information management officer, were also killed.\n\n9. At 10:16 a.m. ET, Romney held a press conference at his campaign office in Jacksonville, Florida. He renewed his criticism of the Obama administration, saying \"Obama has demonstrated a lack of clarity as to a foreign policy.\"\n\n   Asked if he regretted the wording in his statement Tuesday night, the Republican then issued his own timeline of the events in answering the question.\n\n10. Romney then said the administration's original statement from the embassy in Cairo was effectively an \"apology.\" His language went further than the Tuesday release from his campaign where he called it \"disgraceful\" and an expression of \"sympathy for those who waged the attacks.\"\n\n   \"I think it's a terrible course for America to stand in apology for our values. That instead when our grounds are being attacked and being breached, that the first response of the United States must be outrage,\" he said. \"An apology for America's values is never the right course.\"\n\n11. His comments also raise the question of where Romney stands on the offensive video. While he was not asked about the video in the press conference, Romney stood by the right to free speech.\n\n   \"We'll defend also our constitutional rights of speech and assembly and religion,\" he said. \"We encourage our nations to understand and respect the principles of our Constitution because we recognize that these principles are the ultimate source of freedom for individuals around the world.\"\n\n12. CNN obtained talking points from the Romney campaign in which they advise Republicans on how to respond to the press over the issue. The document suggests Republicans be prepared to answer this question: \"Don't you think it was appropriate for the embassy to condemn the controversial movie in question? Are you standing up for movies like this?\"\n\n   The answer prompts the responder to say that Romney \"rejects the reported message of the movie,\" but to add that \"we will not apologize for our constitutional right to freedom of speech.\"\n\nThis timeline suggests that Romney's characterization of the Obama administration's response as an \"apology\" may be misleading, as the embassy's statement was issued before the breach of the embassy in Cairo. The timeline also raises questions about Romney's stance on the controversial video that sparked the protests.",
    " Title: Republican Tax Bill Heads to House and Senate Floors for Final Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican tax bill, valued at $1.5 trillion, is set to receive a final vote on Tuesday, with the House and Senate set to vote on the legislation in the coming hours. The bill, which President Trump has dubbed as the \"biggest Tax Cuts and Reform EVER passed,\" could mark the first major legislative win of Trump's presidency.\n\nThe bill, if passed, would provide tax relief to working families, encourage the creation of jobs in the U.S., and spur economic growth. The bill cuts the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and doubles the standard deduction used by about two-thirds of U.S. households, to $24,000 for married couples. The tax cuts for individuals and the doubled standard deduction will expire in 2026.\n\nThe bill also doubles the per-child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child, with up to $1,400 available in refunds for families who owe little or no taxes. The legislation also repeals a paramount part of ObamaCare, removing the requirement that all Americans have health insurance, or face a penalty.\n\nThe bill is a combination of elements from both the House and Senate bills that were recently passed. As of Monday, Senate Republicans had garnered just enough support for the bill to pass, with Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) flipping to 'yes' votes. Only one member of the Senate GOP, Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, is not yet on board, stating he is still \"looking at the bill, still reading the bill, still working on some other issues.\"\n\nThe House side will have to garner a simple majority of the 99 senators present for the vote, and Republicans can only lose 22 votes to still approve the bill. This week, a dozen Republican lawmakers switched from 'no' to 'yes' votes, primarily from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California.\n\nDemocrats in both chambers have criticized the bill, after being excluded from closed-door drafting sessions. Democrats continue to slam the legislation as favoring big corporations and wealthy Americans, and hurting middle-class Americans. However, Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin and Joe Manchin, among others, were at the White House Monday evening, indicating a potential for bipartisan support.\n\nThe final bill will bring average initial tax cuts for Americans across all income lines, but by 2027, it would boost average levies for everyone earning up to $75,000. Nonpartisan congressional tax analysts calculated that in 2019, people earning $20,000 to $50,000 would see tax cuts averaging 10 percent or more. Those making $200,000 to $1 million would see reductions averaging slightly less. However, by 2023, people making under $30,000 would see tax increases, while those earning more would see their tax cuts get smaller.\n\nRepublican leaders have brushed aside negative projections, with Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), stating, \"that's just cherry-picking the numbers.\" Brady added, \"People are excited about a stronger economy and bigger paychecks.\" The bill will hit the House floor first on Tuesday, with a vote expected Tuesday afternoon, and the Senate will likely vote on the bill late Tuesday, into early Wednesday.",
    " Title: Camp David Summit Aims to Address US-Gulf Tensions Over Iran Nuclear Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming Camp David summit between President Obama and Gulf leaders is intended to reassure America's nervous Arab partners that the emerging nuclear deal with Iran does not signal a withdrawal of U.S. support. However, the summit may not address the centuries-old Persian-Arab rivalry or bridge the wide gaps between the U.S. and Gulf leaders on Iran and other regional security issues, according to regional experts.\n\nThe Camp David meeting on Thursday is unlikely to address the deep-rooted cultural, religious, and ideological differences between the U.S. and Iran, which have shaped the region for centuries. Instead, the summit risks highlighting the \"disconnects\" in the U.S.-Gulf relationship, particularly the divergent views on the impact of the nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nKarim Sadjadpour, senior Iran policy analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, stated, \"The US wants the Gulf to be OK with this nuclear deal with Iran, but the Gulf is not OK with it, so there continues to be this disconnect.\"\n\nGulf leaders and senior officials attending the summit, which includes a White House dinner on Wednesday night, will be seeking immediate and tangible signs of U.S. support, likely leading to announcements of arms sales and increased joint military exercises. However, these conventional forms of reassurance may not bridge the wide gaps between the U.S. and Gulf states on Iran, as well as other regional security issues, some analysts say.\n\nThe Gulf states are concerned about Iran's nuclear program being legitimized by the international community and the potential financial windfall from lifted sanctions, which could enable Iran to further spread its influence in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, noted, \"Their top concern is that Iran will feel empowered to double down on its practices in the region.\"\n\nMoreover, the Gulf Arabs worry that Iran's expanding influence is not a result of U.S. neglect or \"mistakes\" but is, in fact, a result of \"US policy,\" according to Alterman. Obama recognizes the Gulf states' profound qualms over the emerging nuclear deal with Iran, but he will try to convince his guests that the nuclear deal holds out the promise of integrating Iran into the \"community of nations\" and making it a more responsible and cooperative presence in the region.\n\nBeyond Iran, another \"disconnect\" that regional analysts see is between the Obama administration's vision of regional powers taking greater responsibility for security affairs in their area and the way Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are implementing that security role, particularly in Yemen and Libya. The Camp David summit could serve as a test of the Obama policy of \"leading from behind\" and delegating greater levels of security responsibilities to regional partners.\n\nIf the Camp David summit delivers little more than new arms sales, perhaps some new missile defense initiative, and some joint military exercises, it will be unfortunate on several levels, experts say. Despite the focus on Iran, most of the major challenges the Gulf states face are internal, such as providing jobs to a large youth population, undertaking political reform, and countering extremist ideologies \u2013 something Obama recognizes, according to Frederic Wehrey, an expert in Gulf and North Africa security at Carnegie. However, the summit may only skim the surface of these domestic issues at best.\n\nIf the summit perpetuates the pattern of U.S. reassurances through military hardware, it will represent a missed opportunity for both the Gulf states and the U.S., Alterman says. If \"arming the Gulf states to make them feel more confident... means the U.S. is arming [ them ] to act in Yemen and Libya and other places, independent of US judgment, using US training and equipment,\" he says, \"I think that represents a difficult problem for the United States.\"",
    " Title: White House Aides' Departure Sparks Debate on Allegations and Due Process\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed concern over the impact of allegations on individuals' lives following the resignation of two White House aides amid domestic abuse accusations. In a tweet, Mr. Trump stated, \"There is no recovery for someone falsely accused.\" This week, White House speechwriter David Sorensen and staff secretary Rob Porter resigned.\n\nThe White House has faced criticism for its handling of the allegations, and Mr. Trump's comments drew swift condemnation. Democratic Senator Patty Murray responded angrily, stating, \"I'm going to keep standing with them, and trusting them, even if the president won't.\" Democratic Congresswoman Jackie Speier described Mr. Trump's comments as \"offensive.\"\n\nSome commentators objected to Mr. Trump's reference to due process, citing his promotion of a conspiracy theory about former President Barack Obama's nationality. Mr. Sorensen has been accused by his former wife of being violent and emotionally abusive, while Mr. Porter faces allegations of domestic abuse from two ex-wives.\n\nMr. Trump, who has himself been accused of sexual misconduct, has strongly denied these allegations. He has also supported others facing abuse allegations, including Alabama Republican Roy Moore, who ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate. Sexual misconduct claims have hit a growing list of influential men worldwide, following a flurry of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. The #MeToo hashtag also went viral last year as more and more women shared their harassment experiences online.",
    " Title: Nunes Files Defamation Lawsuit Against Twitter, Alleges Shadowbanning and Defamation\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican Congressman Devin Nunes, representing California's 22nd District, has filed a lawsuit against Twitter, a GOP operative, and unnamed defendants behind parody accounts on the social network, for defamation and other claims. The lawsuit, which seeks $250 million in damages, was filed in Virginia state court on Tuesday, according to a court deputy clerk.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Nunes alleges that Twitter played a willing role in the abuse he faced from parody accounts, including one using the Twitter handle @DevinNunesMom. He also claims that Twitter shadowbanned his account @DevinNunes, a process by which a social network can quietly curb the distribution or reach of a user's content without outright banning them, when he tried to respond to that criticism.\n\nThe lawsuit states that the shadow-banning was intentional and aimed at interfering with Nunes' ongoing investigation as a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Nunes' document also notes that Twitter is \"essential\" for meaningful participation in American democracy.\n\nRepublicans have long alleged that technology platforms, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter, have an unfair bias against conservative viewpoints. This argument has been repeatedly denied and disputed by these companies. Last July, following a disputed report by Vice News, Twitter stated in a blog post that it does not shadow ban, defining the practice as making a user's content undiscoverable to everyone but that user. The company also stated that it does not shadow ban based on political viewpoints or ideology.\n\nIt is unclear how Fox News obtained Nunes' complaint or why it stated that the suit had been filed on Monday. A Fox News spokesperson did not return a request for comment. Neither Nunes' attorney nor his press representative responded to requests for comment.\n\nLiz Mair, a Republican communications strategist who is also named a defendant in the suit, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an email that she had not reviewed the documentation. Mair, who has been critical of Nunes on Twitter in the past, claimed she had learned of the congressman's plan to sue from another reporter and declined further comment.",
    " Title: \"Cancel Culture: A Debate on Public Shaming and Free Speech\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe phenomenon known as \"cancel culture,\" a form of public shaming that has gained traction through social media, has sparked a contentious debate over its impact on society. Coined by Black Twitter users in 2015, cancel culture initially served as a means to call out friends or acquaintances for offensive behavior. However, it has since evolved to target the powerful, leading to consequences such as firings, resignations, and boycotts.\n\nRecent examples of cancel culture's reach include the resignation of a Boeing executive over a 33-year-old article arguing against women serving in combat and the termination of a young democratic socialist at a data science firm for tweeting about a study on race riots. The debate over cancel culture centers around whether mass public criticism furthers the cause of justice or represents a misinformed online witch hunt that poses a threat to free speech.\n\nA letter published in Harper's magazine, signed by over 150 influential journalists and academics, called for an end to cancel culture and received significant backlash online. The debate's polarizing nature has seen criticism from politicians on both sides of the aisle, with President Trump labeling it as \"the very definition of totalitarianism,\" and former President Barack Obama expressing concerns about ambiguities in criticizing people's wrongdoing.\n\nCritics of cancel culture argue that it threatens freedom of speech and open debate. They contend that people should not face personal or professional repercussions for their opinions, as this would hinder the examination and growth of ideas. Proponents of cancel culture, on the other hand, argue that it serves to reverse deeply entrenched power structures by empowering historically silenced voices to hold large companies and public figures accountable.\n\nOpponents of the term \"cancel culture\" argue that it is a misnomer, invented to make worthwhile criticism seem new or exotic. They contend that one bad news cycle is rarely enough to end the career or threaten the financial stability of influential figures. For example, J.K. Rowling, the author of the \"Harry Potter\" series, is unlikely to be \"canceled,\" but her critics argue that she should be held accountable for her repeated statements criticizing transgender people.\n\nThe debate over cancel culture is complex and multifaceted, with no clear consensus on its overall impact. While some argue that it serves as a means to hold the powerful accountable, others see it as a threat to free speech and open debate. As the debate continues, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences of both perspectives on society and the future of open discourse.",
    " Title: Terrorist Attack at Garissa University in Kenya Leaves 147 Dead, 79 Injured\n\nArticle:\n\nArmed terrorists stormed the Garissa University campus in northern Kenya on Thursday, resulting in the deaths of 147 people and injuries to dozens more during a 15-hour siege. The Somali-based Islamic terrorist group al-Shabab, an al-Qaeda-linked organization, claimed responsibility for the attack, which is the deadliest in Kenya attributed to the group.\n\nMore than 550 students were evacuated, and 79 were injured in the standoff. The attack occurred on the Garissa University campus, about 90 miles from the Somali border. According to Kenya's National Police Service, the gunmen separated Christians from Muslims and held hostages in a dormitory, where they placed explosives around the Christian hostages.\n\nKenyan Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery stated that some students were killed during morning prayers at the mosque. Jackson Kamau, a student at the university, said the militants targeted those who were likely converts to Islam. Locals can differentiate between Somali Muslims born into Islam and those who have converted because they come from different ethnic groups.\n\n\"We will not allow terrorists to divide our country on religious lines,\" said Aden Duale, majority leader in Kenya's National Assembly.\n\nMost of the 147 dead were students. Two security guards, one policeman, and one soldier also were killed in the attack, Nkaissery said. One suspected extremist was arrested as he tried to flee, Nkaissery told a news conference in Nairobi.\n\nHeavy gunfire erupted at the college as the Kenyan military worked to end the siege. Police Inspector General Joseph Boinett said a dusk-to-dawn curfew will be in place in Garissa and three neighboring counties starting Friday through April 16.\n\nThe White House strongly condemned the attack and said the United States was providing assistance to the Kenyan government. \"We extend our deep condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed in this heinous attack, which reportedly included the targeting of Christian students,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement.\n\nKenyan police offered a $220,000 bounty for Mohammed Mohamud, also known as Dulyadin and Gamadhere, who they suspect planned the attack. Students who were able to escape said gunmen stormed the university, setting off explosives and shooting people on the campus just after 5 a.m. local time.\n\n\"Most of us were asleep when the incident happened,\" said Nicholas Ntulu, a student at the university. \"We heard heavy gunfire and explosions. Every person ran for dear life as we passed the gunmen. Several (students) were shot dead.\"\n\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta urged Kenyans to stay calm. \"This is a moment for everyone throughout the country to be vigilant as we continue to confront and defeat our enemies,\" he said.\n\nKenyatta ordered the inspector general of police to accelerate the applications of 10,000 recruits for the Kenya Police College. \"We have suffered unnecessarily due to shortage of security personnel,\" he said. \"Kenya badly needs additional officers, and I will not keep the nation waiting.\"\n\nFrightened students rescued from the university gathered at a military camp near the Garissa airstrip. \"The sounds of gunfire was all over\u2014we could not tell what was the right direction to go to be safe,\" said Ann Musyoka, a second-year student. \"We had to face the gunmen\u2014they shot several people as we escaped towards the gate.\"\n\nVictims were rushed to a hospital, and those critically injured were airlifted to the capital, Nairobi. \"I was not at the institution when the incident occurred, but several students phoned me, crying over the attacks,\" said Jacktone Kweya, the dean of students. \"When I tried calling them back, their phones were off. It's very disturbing.\"\n\nRobert Godec, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, said the United States \"strongly condemns\" the attack. \"We extend our deepest condolences to all who have been affected,\" he said in a statement. \"The attack once again reinforces the need for all countries and communities to unite in the effort to combat violent extremism.\"\n\nThe assault comes in the wake of an intelligence report issued last week by security officials warning that al-Shabab was planning an attack on major institutions in retaliation for Kenyan military action in Somalia as part of an African Union initiative against the group. Al-Shabab has carried out several attacks in Garissa and across Kenya in the past few years, including an attack in 2013 at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi that left 67 people dead, and others on mosques in Mombasa, a coastal city in the east.\n\nNairobi-based security analyst Abdiwahab Sheikh said the incident highlights how the government has failed to shore up security in the country. \"The government has not learned anything from the Westgate attack,\" he said. \"How do you allow terrorists to take students hostage for more than 10 hours? I think our security forces need to learn from the past.\"",
    " Title: Federal Government on Pace to Set Record Tax Receipts in 2013\n\nArticle:\n\nThe federal government is projected to bring in a record $2.7 trillion in tax receipts this fiscal year, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). This increase reflects a steady post-recession rise in revenues, with a 6 percent increase in 2012 and an expected 11 percent jump in 2013.\n\nThe anticipated tax boost comes after Congress and the White House reached an eleventh-hour deal at the start of the year that allowed for an increase in tax rates for top earners and the expiration of a 2-point payroll tax cut. This agreement is expected to play a significant role in boosting revenues this year and is the primary reason cited by Republicans for not wanting to agree to more tax increases as part of a new budget deal.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner stated on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" over the weekend, \"The president got $650 billion of higher taxes on the American people on January 1st. How much more does he want?\"\n\nPresident Obama, however, stated at the start of the first Cabinet meeting of his second term that he wants to continue to push for \"the kind of balanced approach of spending cuts, revenues, entitlement reform that everybody knows is the right way to do things.\"\n\nAccording to historical figures from the White House, the last tax revenue record was set in 2007, when the government raked in nearly $2.6 trillion. By 2009, tax revenue took a dive, before gradually building back up.\n\nAs a percentage of GDP, revenue is still below the 40-year average of 18 percent. The 2013 figure would represent 16.9 percent of GDP, a full point higher than it was the year before.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has benefited from various sources, including increases in corporate income taxes, estate, and excise taxes. Meanwhile, spending is on pace to hit $3.55 trillion in 2013, roughly the same as it was in 2012. According to the CBO, this represents 22.2 percent of GDP, a share that is still larger than in any year between 1986 and 2008.\n\nWhile Republicans argue that spending is the problem, both sides agree that cutting discretionary spending alone will not solve America's debt and deficit crisis. With the enactment of the sequester, Congress will cut deeper and deeper into discretionary spending. However, costly entitlements will continue to grow, driving up the U.S. debt and also the annual interest taxpayers pay on that debt.",
    " Title: North Korea and U.S. Exchange Threats as Tensions Escalate\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, has accused U.S. President Donald Trump of declaring war on North Korea and stated that Pyongyang has the right to shoot down U.S. bombers, even if they are not in North Korean airspace. The White House dismissed Ri's statement as \"absurd,\" while the Pentagon warned Pyongyang to stop provocations.\n\nRi's comments were a response to Trump's tweet that the North Korean leadership would not \"be around much longer\" if they continued their rhetoric. Ri, in turn, said, \"The question of who won't be around much longer\" would be answered by his country.\n\nIn a fiery speech to the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Ri described Trump as a \"mentally deranged person full of megalomania\" on a \"suicide mission.\" This is not the first time North Korea has used the phrase \"a declaration of war\" in relation to the U.S.\n\nThe latest exchange of words between the two countries follows U.S. warplanes flying close to North Korea's coast in a show of force. Pentagon spokesman Col Robert Manning reacted by saying, \"If North Korea does not stop their provocative actions, we will make sure that we provide options to the president to deal with North Korea.\"\n\nChina's ambassador to the UN, Liu Jieyi, stated, \"It's getting too dangerous and it's in nobody's interest.\" UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres' spokesman, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, said, \"Fiery talk can lead to fatal misunderstandings.\"\n\nExperts have played down the risk of direct conflict between the two countries, but the latest North Korean threat to shoot down U.S. warplanes comes in the wake of a recent U.S. patrol that took its B1-B Lancer bombers and their accompanying F-15 fighter escorts over waters to the east of North Korea. The U.S. believes it has every right to do this, but if one day Pyongyang judges that these aircraft are on an offensive mission, what then?\n\nIt should be remembered that the Korean peninsula is not at peace - the Korean conflict of the 1950s was only brought to a halt by an armistice, not a peace treaty. The latest North Korean threat to shoot down U.S. warplanes comes amidst North Korea's continued nuclear and ballistic missile tests in defiance of successive rounds of UN sanctions. North Korea's leaders say nuclear capabilities are its only deterrent against an outside world seeking to destroy it.\n\nAfter the North's latest and most powerful nuclear test earlier this month, the UN Security Council approved new sanctions on the country. The rhetoric on both sides may have got out of hand already, but the real question is what practical consequences might ensue from the war of words between Washington and Pyongyang?",
    " Title: Obama Pushes for Immediate Vote on Immigration Reform Plan\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has expressed a desire to take a more active role in the immigration reform debate, contrasting his approach during the health-care push where he largely left Congress to its own devices. In a press conference on Tuesday, Obama called for a vote on his own immigration reform plan as soon as possible, unless there is agreement on another plan.\n\n\"It's important for us to recognize that the foundation for bipartisan action is already in place,\" Obama said, referring to a bipartisan Senate bill offered by the so-called Gang of Eight senators. \"And if Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away.\"\n\nBy issuing this challenge, Obama is daring Congress to reject his specific plan. This tactic is similar to the one he employed during the \"fiscal cliff\" talks, where he pushed Congress to vote on his own plan to let higher income tax hikes go into effect if lawmakers could not cut a deal themselves.\n\nRepublicans have historically disliked this negotiation tactic. Throughout Obama's presidency, GOP aides have criticized the president and congressional Democrats for seeking political gain while refusing to negotiate in good faith. On immigration, it's the same.\n\nThe Obama plan includes a faster path to citizenship and no provisions for triggering border-security enforcement. It also eases the path for same-sex couples.\n\nBefore Obama unveiled his immigration plan on Tuesday, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida expressed concerns about a potential \"bidding war.\" In a radio interview with Rush Limbaugh, Rubio dismissed the idea of an up-or-down vote, stating, \"It's going to have to go through committees and people are going to have their input. There's going to be public hearings. I do not want to be part of a process that comes up with some bill in secret and brings it to the floor and gives people a take it or leave it.\"\n\nA Senate Republican aide commented, \"The president's been gone from the Senate a long time and perhaps he has forgotten that it's a lot easier to pass legislation if he works with Congress.\"\n\nObama has presented Republicans with a plan they will likely prefer less than what has been crafted by the bipartisan Senate group. The group's plan includes triggers to enforce border-security measures, more unmanned drones, and no provisions making it easier for same-sex couples seeking to immigrate or naturalize.\n\nUnless other Republicans come up with a plan of their own, the president has given Republicans a choice between the left and the middle. It's not hard to tell which they would prefer.",
    " Title: New York Times Editor Bari Weiss Resigns, Cites Harassment and Hostile Work Environment\n\nArticle:\n\nBari Weiss, a conservative opinion writer for The New York Times, has resigned from the newspaper, citing a hostile work environment and constant harassment from colleagues. Weiss, who joined The Times in 2017, was brought in by James Bennet, the editorial page editor, to offer a more conservative perspective. Bennet was recently let go after publishing an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., that called for the use of the military against rioters.\n\nIn her resignation letter, Weiss described a culture of bullying and harassment within the newspaper. She stated, \"My own forays into Wrongthink have made me the subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views. They have called me a Nazi and a racist; I have learned to brush off comments about how I \u2019 m 'writing about the Jews again.' Several colleagues perceived to be friendly with me were badgered by co-workers.\"\n\nWeiss also mentioned that her work and character are openly demeaned on company-wide Slack channels, with some co-workers insisting she needs to be \"rooted out\" if the company is to be a truly \"inclusive\" one. Other New York Times employees publicly smear her as a liar and a bigot on Twitter with no fear of appropriate action.\n\nThe portrait Weiss paints of The Times' culture is an \"ugly one indeed,\" and one that comes as no surprise to those who have been paying attention. Matthew Continetti, a former Timesman, described the newspaper as \"gossipy, catty, insular, cliquey, stressful, immature, cowardly, moody, underhanded, spiteful \u2014 the New York Times gives new meaning to the term'hostile workplace.'\"\n\nThe Times, once known as the \"Gray Lady,\" now appears more like a middle school run by the \"Mean Girls\" crowd while the administration cowers in its offices. The proper response to a bunch of junior staffers complaining about articles that a newspaper publishes is something between \"Go, write a piece explaining why that piece is wrong\" and \"Fetch my latte.\"\n\nWeiss' resignation is addressed to A.G. Sulzberger, the current publisher, and the problem may start at the top with Chairman Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. A 1992 story in New York magazine reports that Sulzberger responded to a complaint about un-Timesian coverage by saying that if they were making older white men unhappy, they were \"doing something right.\"\n\nThe Times, which was once an arena for public debate, is now being transformed into a megaphone for a single set of views by its junior staffers, fresh from the hothouse environment of academia. This will diminish the importance of the newspaper but, I predict, not the self-importance of its staffers.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of \"The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself,\" is a member of The Times' Board of Contributors.",
    " Title: Fiscal Negotiations on Capitol Hill Intensify as Christmas Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing fiscal negotiations on Capitol Hill have taken a turn towards a contentious standoff, with House Republicans vowing to remain in Washington over the Christmas break to prevent an impending economic crisis, while Democratic leadership maintains that congressional members should be home for the holidays.\n\nRep. Doc Hastings (R-Wash.) stated after receiving instructions from House Speaker John Boehner, \"It's going to be a long December for us.\" This was followed by remarks from House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who pledged that he and fellow Republicans would work through the holidays to reach a deal to avoid a looming $500 billion mix of automatic tax increases and federal spending cuts set to take effect on Jan. 1.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has expressed hope for a deal before Christmas, and she made it clear on Wednesday that lawmakers should be home instead of on Capitol Hill by then. Pelosi stated, \"Faith and family\u2014that's what the holidays are about. These are bonding opportunities for families and strengtheners for our families. We should be home for that.\"\n\nThe remarks from both parties have dampened the recent optimism in Washington that was created by a series of exchanges earlier this week between Boehner and President Obama. The negotiations seem to be at a critical stage, with Boehner refusing to discuss his counter-offer and the most recent phone call on Tuesday, suggesting a deal may be within reach but too delicate to discuss publicly.\n\nHowever, the debate in Washington is not solely about working over the break. Boehner, during a morning news conference, also suggested that the White House is holding up the deal, stating that the most recent proposal from the White House lacks a balanced approach of tax cuts and spending reductions. He added that the president's most recent offer still has \"too many taxes\" and would not pass in either the House or the Senate.\n\nPelosi, within hours, placed the blame on Boehner, insisting that he should make House Republicans vote on what Obama has already offered, and some of her party members appear willing to accept a compromise to help avert the fiscal crisis and extend tax cuts to 98 percent of income earners. Pelosi stated, \"Figure it out. We did [when she was House speaker and forced a full vote on funding the Iraq War]. Then go forward and debate the issue.... What are we waiting for? Is there a dove going to fly in with a message tied to his leg?\"",
    " Title: Four Individuals Corroborate Tara Reade's Allegations Against Joe Biden\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo additional individuals have corroborated some of Tara Reade's claims that former Vice President Joe Biden sexually assaulted her 27 years ago when she was a staffer in his Senate office, according to a report by an unspecified news organization.\n\nOne person, who knew Reade in 1993, told the Associated Press that Reade mentioned the alleged assault when it occurred. The second person, who met Reade a decade after the alleged assault, confirmed having a conversation with Reade in 2007 or 2008 in which Reade talked about experiencing sexual harassment from Biden while working in his Senate office. Both sources spoke anonymously to protect their families' privacy, the report said.\n\nThis brings the total number of individuals who have backed some details of Reade's claims to four. Lynda LaCasse, a former neighbor of Reade's in California, said Reade shared details about the alleged assault in the 1990s, while Lorraine Sanchez, a former colleague, told Business Insider that Reade complained to her about being sexually harassed by her former boss in Washington.\n\nReade was among eight women who claimed Biden made them feel uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection. In an interview with the AP published on Saturday, Reade said she filed a limited report with a congressional personnel office but it did not explicitly accuse Biden of sexual assault or harassment.\n\n\"I remember talking about him wanting me to serve drinks because he liked my legs and thought I was pretty and it made me uncomfortable,\" Reade said in the interview. \"I know that I was too scared to write about the sexual assault.\"\n\nAlthough she did not use the phrase \"sexual harassment\" in the complaint, she did use the words \"uncomfortable\" and \"retaliation.\"\n\nBiden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, denied the incident ever happened during an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Friday.\n\n\"It is not true. I'm saying it unequivocally \u2013 it never happened. It didn't. It never happened,\" Biden said.\n\nHe also said Reade did not raise concerns with supervisors or senior staffers at the time.\n\n\"News organizations that have talked with literally dozens of former staffers have not found one \u2013 not one \u2013 who corroborated her allegations in any way,\" he wrote in the statement released before the interview. \"Indeed, many of them spoke to the culture of an office that would not have tolerated harassment in any way \u2013 as indeed I would not have.\"",
    " Title: Obama Attributes Increased Discussion on Race Relations to Improved Public Awareness\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a year-end interview with National Public Radio (NPR), President Barack Obama attributed the perceived worsening of race relations in the United States to an increase in public discourse rather than a deterioration of the relationships themselves. The interview, which took place just before the president's departure for the holiday season, provided insights into his thoughts on his final two years in office.\n\nThe president had hoped 2014 would be a \"breakthrough year,\" with the economy showing significant improvement and a potential reduction in the nation's toxic politics. However, the year was marked by unexpected disasters and unplanned events, contributing to a drop in Obama's approval ratings and leaving him with limited power to prevent his party's loss of the Senate.\n\nOne of the most challenging and dramatic events of 2014 involved two police killings of black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City. Yet, in the December 18 interview, the president interpreted the widespread debate over these incidents as a sign of potential positive change.\n\nTwo days after the interview, a gunman murdered two New York City police officers. Despite this tragic event, there was already evidence of division in the country on the day of the interview.\n\nPresident Obama expressed an essentially optimistic view, suggesting that better data for the public and better training for police could improve their interactions. He has assembled a task force to examine police and community relations, and he stated that its members are \"interested in solving a problem as opposed to simply stewing in the hopelessness of race relations in this country.\" The president expressed confidence that progress on this issue would be made in the coming year.\n\nAdditionally, the president pointed to race-related data on voting patterns as a challenge for his party. Obama won election twice on the strength of an unprecedented minority vote, and the share of minorities in the electorate is growing. However, a flip side to this trend can be seen with white voters.\n\nThe collapse of the white vote was particularly significant in the low-turnout midterm elections of 2010 and 2014. In a Senate race in Georgia, for example, it was estimated that Democrats needed little more than 25 percent of the white vote to win, but they failed to achieve this. This is why Republicans now dominate Congress and most state legislatures.\n\nObama's larger sentiment\u2014that it would be better for America if both major parties were able to compete seriously for the votes of all major racial and ethnic groups\u2014is shared by politicians in both parties. As 2014 draws to a close, this ideal is not yet a reality.\n\nThis is the second installment of a three-part year-end interview with President Obama. The first focused on the upcoming Congress, and the third will focus on his foreign policy.",
    " Title: Trump Discusses COVID-19 Projections and Economic Recovery with Business Leaders\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a briefing on Friday, President Donald Trump stated that he was not aware of the latest government projections regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, but his aides suggested that he interpreted the decreasing death projection as evidence of progress. The president cited the 60,000 estimated death toll as a sign of improvement, stating, \"I think we'll be substantially under that number.\"\n\nHowever, public health advisers took a more cautious approach. Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House pandemic coordinator, noted that the latest figures do not represent the full extent of the outbreak. \"As encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak,\" she said. Dr. Birx questioned whether the reported figures represent only the most serious cases or a significant portion of the total cases.\n\nFive administration officials stated that it is unlikely President Trump will extend the current guidelines beyond April 30. Instead, they suggested that he may announce some easing of quarantine measures before a full reopening of the country.\n\nIn recent weeks, President Trump has been in discussions with various business leaders, including Michael Corbat, the CEO of Citigroup, and Brian Moynihan, the CEO of Bank of America. These conversations have been facilitated by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been fielding calls from executives seeking guidance on supporting the economy and when normalcy might return.\n\nSome of these discussions have been facilitated by Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser. Paul Tudor Jones made an impassioned plea for reopening the economy during a conference call organized by Mr. Kushner several weeks ago, while Nelson Peltz was said to be influential in Mr. Trump's since-aborted plan to begin reopening by Easter.\n\nThe article does not provide information on the specific details of the discussions between President Trump and the business leaders, nor does it offer any opinions or speculation on the potential outcomes of these conversations.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Immigration Bill Survives Early Test, Amendment to Strengthen Border Security Provisions Defeated\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan immigration bill, which aims to address the estimated 11 million individuals living in the United States without authorization, has survived an early test in the Senate. The bill, which includes provisions for border security, legal immigration, and a 13-year path to citizenship, withstood an amendment that would have strengthened border security measures.\n\nThe amendment, proposed by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, required control of the U.S.-Mexico border for six months before anyone could seek legal status. Grassley argued that the measure was designed to ensure the border is secure. However, a lead supporter of the legislation, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York), stated that the real impact would be to \"delay, probably forever, any legalization\" for immigrants currently residing in the country without authorization, who would eventually be eligible for citizenship under the bill.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee vote to defeat the amendment was 12 to 6, with Republican Sens. Jeff Flake (AZ) and Lindsey Graham (SC) voting with Democrats. The four Republicans and four Democrats who authored the bill, including Schumer, Durbin, Flake, Graham, and Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), are expected to collaborate to defeat amendments that could potentially undermine the bill's core provisions.\n\nThe 844-page legislation would toughen border security, remake legal immigration to allow tens of thousands of new high- and low-skilled workers into the country, require all employers to check their workers' legal status, and create a 13-year path to citizenship for the millions already residing in the country.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Grassley charged that the landmark bill backed by President Barack Obama does little more than repeat past mistakes. \"It falls short of what I want to see in a strong immigration reform bill,\" Grassley said. \"You'll hear me say many times that we should not make the same mistakes that we made in 1986,\" referring to the last time Congress passed a major immigration overhaul bill.\n\nSchumer countered that the legislation represents the country's best hope for immigration reform and a chance to break through the partisanship that's divided Congress and the country. \"We have come up with a fair bill where no one gets everything they want, but at the end of the day, it will mean dramatic improvement for the American economy, the American people, and will make our immigration policy much more in sync with what is good for jobs and America,\" Schumer said.\n\nSenators have filed over 300 amendments on a wide range of issues, including workplace enforcement, high-tech visas, and extending immigration law to cover gay people who are married. The focus Thursday was on border security. Although the bill allows citizenship to go forward only after certain border security goals have been met, those \"triggers\" have not proven convincing enough for many GOP lawmakers, and even one of the bill's authors, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), has stated that border measures need to be stronger.\n\nThe authors of the bill are working to show they are open to alterations that could attract additional support for the bill, and they have already accepted several uncontroversial amendments from the Republican side to boost enforcement provisions. Rubio conceded in a broadcast interview Thursday that some amendments could be seen as attempts to thwart the legislation, but added he thought most were intended to refine and improve it, saying \"that's the way the process is supposed to work.\" He called the work of the Gang of Eight \"an excellent starting point\" and said there is overwhelming support among the American people, including social conservatives, for immigration changes as long as they tighten border security. Rubio stated in an interview on \"CBS This Morning\" that the public wants legislation that would ensure \"this illegal immigration wave does not happen again.\"",
    " Title: Faculty Can Assess Critical Thinking Skills of Students Using Standardized Metrics, Study Finds\n\nArticle:\n\nA nationwide experiment has shown for the first time that professors can use standardized metrics to assess the critical thinking skills of students across various schools and disciplines. The project, initiated by the Association of American Colleges & Universities (AACU) and the State Higher Education Executive Officers, involved more than 125 professors judging 7,000 samples of students' classwork from 59 institutions in nine states.\n\nThe study aimed to address the concerns of college presidents, such as Mitch Daniels of Purdue University, who need to justify the high cost of attending college to students and their families. The percentage of Americans who consider a college degree as \"very important\" has fallen from 75 percent in 2010 to 44 percent today.\n\nThe results of the study are worrisome, and mostly confirm earlier studies. Of the students who attended a four-year institution and completed most of their coursework, fewer than a third of their finished assignments earned a high score for critical thinking skills. Less than half of their coursework drew \"appropriate conclusions based on quantitative analysis of data.\"\n\nThe project organizers concluded that \"far fewer students were achieving at high levels on a variety of dimensions of critical thinking than did so for written communication or quantitative literacy.\" The study did not measure the work of students who have completed less than 75 percent of their coursework.\n\nThe experiment partly derives from the frustration among colleges over the many attempts by \"outsiders\" to rank or rate schools for consumers of higher education. Rather than continue to have professors remain on the defensive, the AACU took the offensive to show that faculty can define the generalized \"rubrics\" of what students should be learning.\n\nAmerican universities, despite their global reputation for excellence in teaching, have only begun to demonstrate what they can produce in real-world learning. Knowledge-based degrees are still important, but given the pace of discoveries in many fields, employers are demanding advanced thinking skills from college graduates. If faculty can now work with college presidents, government leaders, and others to accurately measure the intellectual worth of a college degree, more people will seek higher education \u2013 and come out better thinkers.",
    " Title: U.S. Military Interventions and Their Impact on Humanitarian Crises\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States, often perceived as a generous and selfless nation, has a history of intervening in foreign conflicts with the intention of improving the lives of those in less fortunate regions. However, the results of these interventions have often led to further conflict and instability rather than resolution.\n\nOne notable example is Operation Restore Hope, initiated by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 to alleviate a famine in Somalia. Despite the intervention, Somalia remains Africa's most-failed state, plagued by war, terrorism, and famine, as reported by The Economist last year.\n\nAnother instance is the NATO air campaign ordered by President Bill Clinton in 1999 in response to the Serbian-dominated government's persecution of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The intervention led to a spree of ethnic cleansing and the deaths of approximately 500 Serbian civilians, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nPresident George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq, justified as a means of liberating the oppressed Iraqi people, resulted in deadly chaos that persists to this day. A 2013 study led by public health professor Amy Hagopian of the University of Washington concluded that the Iraq war and occupation caused nearly a half-million Iraqi deaths.\n\nIn Libya, President Barack Obama's intervention against dictator Moammar Gadhafi contributed to the country's transformation into another failed state, characterized by anarchy and a hotbed of terrorists.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's recent air raid in Syria, in response to a nerve gas attack, continues this pattern of using military force for humanitarian intervention. The intervention has been criticized for focusing on chemical weapons while ignoring conventional forms of violence that cause significant human suffering.\n\nIf the president were serious about humanitarian concerns, he would not be proposing to cut the foreign aid budget, which has a better record than military force of actually helping the afflicted. Instead, he is proposing to cut U.S. funding for international public health programs by $300 million this year.\n\nAccording to Dartmouth College political scientist Benjamin Valentino, international public health programs are the most cost-effective way to save lives abroad. For instance, it costs less than $1 to immunize a child against measles, and the cost per life saved is estimated to be $224. These programs have other advantages, such as making friends rather than enemies, not killing innocent civilians, and not shattering societies.\n\nIn conclusion, the United States' history of military interventions for humanitarian purposes has often resulted in further conflict and instability, while public health efforts have proven to be more effective in saving lives and promoting stability.",
    " Title: Second Whistleblower Emerges in Trump-Ukraine Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney Mark Zaid, who represents the original whistleblower who triggered the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine, has announced that he is now representing a second whistleblower. This second individual, described as an intelligence official, has first-hand knowledge of some of the allegations outlined in the original complaint and has been interviewed by the head of the intelligence community's internal watchdog office, Michael Atkinson.\n\nThe existence of a second whistleblower, particularly one with direct knowledge of events related to the president and conversations involving Ukraine, could challenge Trump's repeated assertion that the original complaint, released on Sept. 26, was \"totally inaccurate.\" The original complaint alleged that Trump pressured a foreign power to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and Biden's son, Hunter, and that unnamed senior White House officials then attempted to \"lock down\" all records of the phone call.\n\nAccording to the first whistleblower, more than a half-dozen U.S. officials have information relevant to the investigation, suggesting the probe could widen further. Representative Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, made brief remarks about the second whistleblower at a screening of the film \"The Great Hack\" in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Let me just say this, with respect to the most recent development, and that is the public reporting of the second whistleblower stepping forward, that we are tremendously dependent on people of courage stepping forward,\" Schiff said. \"Our very democracy depends on people of good faith and courage stepping forward to expose wrongdoing.\"\n\nThe White House has not commented on the second whistleblower's emergence. The first whistleblower's complaint was filed on Aug. 12. The transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy showed Trump asking for a \"favor\" and pushing Zelenskiy to launch an investigation into the Biden family. The White House has maintained that the transcript was not verbatim. Text messages later obtained by Congress showed top U.S. diplomats dangling the possibility of a summit between the two leaders in exchange for Ukraine agreeing to announce an investigation. The Ukraine government never did. The text messages were provided in congressional testimony last week by one of the diplomats, Kurt Volker, who has since resigned.\n\nIt is illegal for anyone to receive something of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election, according to the Federal Election Commission. While it is not immediately clear whether Trump or other U.S. officials broke the law in their handling of Ukraine, that might not matter. The Constitution allows for Congress to decide what constitutes an impeachable offense. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, calling the phone call \"perfect.\"",
    " Title: \"Elizabeth Warren Proposes Return-Free Tax Filing in the United States\"\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has reintroduced the Tax Filing Simplification Act, which aims to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to develop a return-free filing option for American taxpayers. The legislation, which has a number of cosponsors, would provide a free online tax filing service that allows taxpayers to download all the information they need that the IRS already has and fill out their form that way.\n\nThe idea of return-free filing is not new. In many other countries, the government prepares tax returns for citizens, and the process is simpler due to the lack of involvement from the tax preparation industry. For instance, in Japan, the tax agency sends out a document that states how much each person earned, how much was withheld, and how much is owed in taxes. If someone wants to dispute the numbers, they can go to a tax office to do so, but everyone else simply signs off on the numbers. The same thing happens in countries like Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Spain.\n\nThe Tax Foundation estimates that Americans spend a cumulative 2.6 billion hours completing their income tax returns, a process that could be much simpler if the tax preparation industry were not involved. A return-free filing system could save Americans a collective 225 million hours in preparation time and $2 billion in costs, according to one estimate.\n\nThe idea of return-free filing has been proposed in the United States before. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan called for Americans to \"not even have to fill out a return.\" The concept was included in his Tax Reform Act. However, efforts to implement return-free filing have been stymied over the years, largely due to the lobbying efforts of the tax preparation industry. Last year, H&R Block lobbied against Warren's bill and spent a total of $3 million lobbying the government, in part against return-free efforts. Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, spent over $2 million lobbying last year, with much of it spent in favor of legislation that would permanently block the government from offering these services.\n\nIntuit has lobbied against a number of past bills that would have allowed pre-prepared tax returns for many Americans\u2014and in favor of others that would have blocked the Treasury Department from starting return-free filing. Intuit has made it clear that any government filing option would threaten its business. \"We anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future,\" it said in its latest corporate filings. Its lobbying disclosures state that it \"opposes IRS government tax preparation.\"\n\nThe tax preparation industry has spent nearly $28 million on lobbying since 1998. Little wonder that it's lucrative. As things currently stand, about 80 percent of taxpayers rely on a preparer or software to file their taxes, while they pay an average of $200 to tax preparation services a year, which eats up nearly 10 percent of the typical tax return. That makes a tidy profit for companies like Intuit and H&R Block: TurboTax made up more than a third of Intuit's revenues in 2012.",
    " Title: ObamaCare Exchanges to Reopen with Increased Insurers and Plans, Despite Ongoing Cost and Choice Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ObamaCare health insurance exchanges, which faced significant challenges during their initial launch last fall, are expected to see improvements when they reopen next month. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported a 25% increase in the number of insurers participating in the exchanges, which officials argue will lower premium costs through competition and offer consumers more choices.\n\nAccording to an HHS progress report released on Sept. 23, Americans shopping at the 36 federally-facilitated marketplaces can now choose from 248 qualified health plans, compared to 191 last year. Sixty-seven new insurers have joined the exchanges, but 10 have withdrawn, resulting in a net increase of 57.\n\nStates with the biggest increases in choices were Indiana, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Texas, each with four additional insurers. Eight states had zero additional choices, and no state had fewer choices.\n\nRep. Tom Price (R-GA), a member of the Congressional Health Care Caucus, acknowledged some progress in reducing federal spending on uninsured Americans but expressed concerns about consumer costs and choices. He stated that while ObamaCare has helped many get insurance, costs remain too high, and the plans do not provide the coverage choices Americans want and need.\n\nThe report also included information on eight of the 14 state-run sites. It showed 67 companies now offering insurance policies, compared to 61 in 2014. Ten new companies entered the competition, but four withdrew. Washington gained the most, with two, and California was the only state to have less, with a decrease of two. However, the additions are essentially existing, private insurance companies going into new states, not new companies offering policies for the first time, a source told FoxNews.com.\n\nThe massive problems faced by online ObamaCare shoppers during the exchanges' debut in October 2013, including system crashes, error messages, incorrect information, and lost applications, appear to have been largely fixed in the past 12 months. President Obama ensured the software problems were addressed after the first several weeks by hiring industry experts to work around the clock to write better computer code and fix software bugs.\n\nHowever, Rep. Price argued that the front end of the computer system, which allows Americans to buy insurance online, might be largely improved, but the back end that connects patients' insurance information to healthcare providers remains a \"terrible problem\" for doctors and hospitals.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, officially titled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, was crafted to help an estimated 30 million uninsured Americans get coverage. The 2010 law also offers financial assistance to Americans buying insurance through exchanges and made insurance available to people previously denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition.\n\nAs of last week, the administration had reached its goal of enrolling 6 million people by its self-imposed March 31 deadline. Currently, 7.3 million people have enrolled in marketplace plans, paid their premiums, and have access to insurance, according to HHS Director Sylvia Burwell.\n\nSome states continue to struggle with their sites, most notably Oregon and Maryland. Oregon's Cover Oregon site, built in part with roughly $30 million in federal grants, was unfixable and agreed to move the operation to the federal exchange. The problems and transition are estimated to cost state and federal taxpayers at least an additional $85 million, including $50 million to manually enroll thousands of customers and $35 million to Deloitte Consulting to salvage the faulty technology.\n\nDespite the problems, Cover Oregon still enrolled more than 354,000 people through a \"hybrid manual-automated process,\" spokeswoman Ariane Holm said earlier this week. Maryland's state-run site crashed soon after going online last year. Officials have decided to replace the technology, instead of fixing the system or like Oregon joining the federal exchange system. They have hired Deloitte, which also has successfully run the Connecticut exchange. However, the Maryland fiasco last year remains the subject of an inspector general audit.",
    " Title: White House Releases 2012 Taxpayer Receipt Detailing Federal Spending\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the spirit of transparency, the White House has released the 2012 Taxpayer Receipt, a detailed breakdown of how federal income tax revenues were spent. The release comes amid ongoing budget debates between the president, legislators, and their respective parties.\n\nThe annual public disclosure, now in its third year, allows taxpayers to trace their contributions to various sectors such as military, Social Security, health care, community development, agriculture, and NASA, among others.\n\nColleen Curtis, White House spokeswoman, stated, \"You deserve to know how your tax dollars are being spent.\"\n\nThe military and health care programs take up the bulk of federal income tax revenues. In the case of a married couple with one child making $50,000 a year, nearly a quarter of their income taxes, $245.17, went to 'National Defense,' while a slightly smaller sum, $223.38, or 22.45%, was spent on 'health care.'\n\nOngoing military operations, such as the U.S. presence in Afghanistan, consume the largest sum of defense spending, accounting for more than 10% of taxpayer dollars, according to the White House.\n\nMedicare and Medicaid, programs for the country's seniors and the poor, respectively, take up nearly all of the 'health care' spending category in the income tax breakdown. This does not include the separate Medicare Tax of $725, or 1.45%, levied on the family used as an example.\n\nThe federal government spends comparatively little on education and the promotion of science and technology, with these sectors receiving less than 5% of expenditures. This includes NASA's budget.\n\nThe biggest tax by far is the workers' contributions to Social Security, which amount to $2,100 for a family of three earning a median income of $50,000 per year. This represents 4.2% of the family's gross income and is more than their federal income and Medicare taxes combined.\n\nOver the past 40 years, the federal budget deficit has amounted to 3.1% of gross domestic product per year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Deficits are predicted to be slightly higher over the next 10 years, as rising health care and retirement costs increase federal spending, the budget office said.\n\nBudget deficits in the U.S. and much of the West surged with the onset of the world economic crisis in 2008, but began dropping in 2012, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. U.S. tax revenues, including Social Security and Medicare, have amounted to 18% of GDP over the past 40 years and are expected to rise slightly to 19% of annual GDP for the next 10 years, the budget office said.",
    " Title: Ayotte Caught in the Crossfire of Gun Control Debate in New Hampshire\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Kelly Ayotte, a first-term Republican from New Hampshire, finds herself at the center of the national gun control debate following her vote against expanded background checks for commercial gun sales. The controversy, which has been a focal point in Washington for the past month, has now made New Hampshire a battleground in the broader gun control fight.\n\nAt a recent town hall meeting, pro-gun control activists expressed their disapproval of Ayotte's vote, with two women attempting to speak with her about the issue. Security personnel intervened, highlighting the ongoing controversy surrounding the senator.\n\n\"It's a mixed reaction,\" Ayotte told reporters as she hurriedly left the meeting. \"Something both sides feel strongly about.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the Senate's failed vote two weeks prior, powerful outside groups, including those run by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, have pledged to invest significant resources in New Hampshire to pressure Ayotte to reverse her stance or face political repercussions. Critics in the state have attempted to rebrand Ayotte as \"NRAyotte.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the National Rifle Association is running radio ads thanking Ayotte for her support.\n\nThe emotionally charged debate risks transforming Ayotte, a conservative Republican with a rising political profile, into a polarizing figure in her home state on a contentious issue. Rather than championing gun rights, Ayotte is attempting to maintain a lower profile on the subject in a state where she is the last Republican in the all-female congressional delegation.\n\nKathy Sullivan, a longtime Democratic operative and former head of the state party, stated, \"It hurts her. Elections are won in New Hampshire with the vote of independents, particularly independent women. Independent women will not favor a candidate who does not believe in background checks. It will be an issue.\"\n\nAyotte, who represents a libertarian-minded state that has been a stronghold for gun rights, appears to wish for the controversy to subside, as she navigates her first significant political storm in her short Senate career. Polls indicate strong support for expanded background checks in New Hampshire.",
    " Title: Trump and Clinton Exchange Criticism Over Tax Plans and Economic Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has responded to Republican nominee Donald Trump's new tax plan, which he unveiled on Monday. Trump, during his campaign stop in Detroit, outlined his economic plans for the United States, emphasizing job creation and tax cuts.\n\nTrump pledged, \"We will make America grow again. I want to jump-start America, and it can be done, and it won't even be that hard.\" His proposed tax plan includes cutting taxes and simplifying the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets from the current seven to three. He also plans to reduce taxes on businesses, as the U.S. has the highest corporate tax among major nations. Additionally, Trump proposes allowing parents to fully deduct the cost of child care from their taxable income.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump also criticized Clinton's economic plans, stating that she punishes Americans for working and doing business in the United States.\n\nClinton, in turn, criticized Trump's plans, labeling them as a repackaging of old Republican ideas. Speaking at a campaign rally in Kissimmee, Florida, Clinton said, \"Today in Detroit, he's got, I don't know, a dozen or so economic advisers he just named. Hedge fund guys, billionaire guys, six guys named Steve. They wrote him a speech and he delivered it in Detroit. They tried to make his old, tired ideas sound new.\"\n\nClinton further stated that unlike Trump, she would be a \"small business president\" and create jobs. She warned that if Trump were to implement his proposed policies, it could cost three and a half million jobs.\n\nThe latest round of national polls shows Clinton leading her GOP rival by double digits. Trump's hour-long speech on the economy could be a sign that the Republican candidate is ready to work with the GOP to get his campaign back on track.",
    " Title: Hope Hicks Returns to White House as Counselor to President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nHope Hicks, one of President Donald Trump's most trusted and longest-serving aides, is returning to the White House as the president works to surround himself with loyalists as his reelection campaign moves into high gear. Hicks, a former White House communications director who was one of Trump's original 2016 campaign staffers, is expected to serve as counselor to the president, working with presidential son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner.\n\nHicks' move comes just one week after Trump was acquitted by the Senate on impeachment charges. Since then, he has been on a tear to clear his administration of those he sees as insufficiently loyal, including ousting staffers at the national security council and state department and pulling the nomination of a top treasury department pick who had overseen cases involving Trump's former aides as U.S. Attorney. More departures are expected in the coming days, including at the shrinking foreign policy arm of the White House.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has been working to surround himself with longtime aides he believes he can trust as he heads into what is expected to be a bruising general election campaign to remain in the White House. In addition to Hicks, Trump recently brought back John McEntee, another longtime staffer who began on the 2016 campaign as an intern and rose to become one of Trump's closest staffers, with an office adjacent to the Oval Office.\n\nMcEntee had served as Trump's personal aide until he was forced out of the White House in 2018 on the orders of former chief of staff John Kelly over issues with his security clearance. McEntee has now been tapped to lead the White House Presidential Personnel Office, an influential posting that coordinates the screening and hiring of thousands of federal government workers.\n\nIn her new role, Hicks will not be part of the White House communications department but will work closely with Kushner and White House political director Brian Jack \"in a number of strategic areas,\" according to a White House official. She is expected to start early next month, though details were still being worked out on Thursday.\n\nKnown for her loyalty and low public profile, Hicks was part of the small inner circle that traveled the country with Trump aboard his private jet as he waged his unlikely campaign for the Republican nomination and then the presidency in 2015 and 2016. She was often described as someone who was especially deft at reading the president's moods and helping others navigate his instincts.\n\nTrump never wanted Hicks to leave the White House, which she chose to do as she was called to testify before lawmakers and the special counsel's office during the Russia investigation. And she and the president remained in regular touch while she was at Fox, with the president trying to convince her to return to the White House since nearly the day she left, according to one of the people. The president's sales pitch, the person said, intensified in recent months amid impeachment.\n\nThe news of her decision was praised publicly by top administration officials, including Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary who also serves as the current White House communications director.\n\n\"I have worked with Hope for almost six years and can say without hesitation she is one of the most talented and savvy individuals I have come across,\" Grisham said in a statement. \"She has always impressed me with her quiet confidence, loyalty, and expertise, and I am beyond thrilled to welcome Hope back to the White House.\"\n\n\"There is no one more devoted to implementing President Trump's agenda than Hope Hicks,\" Kushner added. \"We are excited to have her back on the team.\"\n\nEven before Trump's acquittal, his national security adviser Robert O'Brien had been working to shrink the ranks at the National Security Council, where Alexander Vindman, the director for European Affairs, had worked before he was escorted out of the White House last week. O'Brien said the streamlining will be completed by the end of the week, with about 70 fewer staffers than the 115 to 120 staffers when he started the job in September.\n\nMeanwhile, the conservative Newsmax TV announced Thursday that Trump's first press secretary, Sean Spicer, will be hosting a political talk show that will air weeknights at 6 p.m. from Washington. \"Spicer & Co.\" will debut on March 3.",
    " Title: President Trump's First Overseas Trip as Commander-in-Chief: A Comprehensive Itinerary\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump embarks on his first overseas trip as commander-in-chief today, visiting several destinations in the Middle East and Europe. The trip, which begins on Friday, includes stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel, the Vatican, NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium, and the G7 summit in Taormina, Italy.\n\nThe journey follows a series of high-profile controversies, most recently the dismissal of FBI Director James Comey. The following is a summary of the president's planned itinerary:\n\nIn Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Trump will attend an arrival ceremony, meet with King Salman, participate in bilateral meetings with members of the royal family, and attend a royal banquet. He will also sign several agreements to strengthen U.S.-Saudi security and economic cooperation. Trump and the first lady will dine with the Saudi royal family and attend an official dinner.\n\nThe following day, Trump will meet with leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council and have lunch with leaders from Muslim countries. He will deliver a speech emphasizing the need to confront radical ideology and participate in the inauguration of a center aimed at fighting radicalism and promoting moderation.\n\nIn Israel, Trump will meet with President Reuven Rivlin, lay a wreath at Yad Vashem, a Holocaust memorial, and give remarks at the Israeli Museum. He will also meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and attend a private dinner with Netanyahu and his wife, Sara.\n\nTrump will meet Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem and discuss his administration's eagerness to facilitate an agreement ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He will also visit the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and the Western Wall, where he will pray.\n\nIn the Vatican, Trump will meet Pope Francis and tour St. Peter's. He will also meet Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Charles Michel. Trump will later meet with the presidents of the European Union and the European Council. He is expected to have a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAt the NATO summit in Brussels, Trump will reaffirm the United States' commitment to NATO, deliver remarks at the unveiling of a NATO memorial, and attend a meeting and dinner with NATO leaders.\n\nTrump will then travel to the 43rd G7 summit in Taormina, Italy, where he will press America's economic agenda and call for greater security cooperation. On the first night of the G7, he will attend a dinner hosted by Italian President Sergio Mattarella and see the La Scala Philharmonic Orchestra. Trump is also expected to speak to U.S. troops at Sigonella Naval Air Station before leaving Italy.",
    " Title: House Republican Leaders Urge Senate Action on Fiscal Cliff Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republican leaders, including Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, and Conference Chairman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, issued a statement on Wednesday, urging the Senate to act first on legislation to prevent the fiscal cliff. The statement implied that the House would not reconvene until the Senate passes a bill through its chamber.\n\nThe statement, if the Senate \"will not approve and send them to the president to be signed into law in their current form, they must be amended and returned to the House.\" The leaders further stated that once the Senate acts, the House would consider whether to accept the bills as amended or send them back to the Senate with additional amendments.\n\nSenate Democrats responded later on Wednesday, stating that House Republicans should pass a bill that would extend tax rates for income below $250,000. Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, said, \"The Senate bill could pass tomorrow if House Republicans would simply let it come to the floor.\"\n\nThe House Republican leadership held a conference call on Wednesday, as a stalemate over the fiscal cliff continues. On Thursday, all House Republican lawmakers will have a conference call with leadership. The call was limited to top GOP leaders, not the full House Republican conference, according to several sources. No decisions were made on the call.\n\nThe GOP position on the fiscal cliff is that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid needs to move a bill to avert the fiscal cliff or else he is abdicating his duties. This line will be repeated this week, aides say.\n\nIf no action is taken, tax rates will increase on all income levels and federal spending cuts will take effect in a few days. Additionally, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told Congressional leadership that the nation's statutory borrowing cap would be hit on Dec. 31. \"Extraordinary measures\" would allow the federal government to continue borrowing money for two months, but the fiscal cliff standoff throws even that calculation into flux.\n\nTop Republicans also need to discuss whether to bring the House into session. GOP leadership has promised lawmakers a 48-hour warning if they decide to convene. That means the earliest the House can come back would be Friday, if the warning was given Wednesday. However, weather in Washington is dreadful, and it's the height of the holiday travel season. Sources say it's still possible the House returns before Jan. 1.",
    " Title: California's Proposition 29: A Controversial Tobacco Tax Initiative\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia's reputation as a leading state in tobacco cessation efforts has been challenged, according to Chris Lehman, one of the organizers behind the Proposition 29 initiative. The proposition aims to increase the state's cigarette tax, but its success has been questionable since California passed the toughest anti-smoking bill in the U.S. in 1998.\n\nThe American Cancer Society contributed more than $7 million to get Proposition 29 passed, but since then, 23 states have enacted stricter smoking laws. John R. Seffrin, the chief executive of the society, stated, \"California has been a leader, not only in the country but in the world, in efforts to curb smoking. They are overdue.\"\n\nThe tax, estimated to generate $735 million, is being voted on amidst California's current budget crisis. The state is facing a deficit of $16 billion, and Governor Jerry Brown proposed severe spending cuts to address it. However, none of the $735 million would go towards closing the deficit.\n\nOpponents argue that the tax would have less chance of passing if voters believed the money would go into the state coffers. They claim that the tax's primary goal is reducing smoking, and raising the cost of tobacco has proven to be the most effective way of discouraging smoking, particularly among teenagers.\n\nThe proposition's image as a potential $735 million windfall at a time of budget cuts has been met with criticism. The Los Angeles Times' editorial board, while acknowledging its discomfort in siding with the tobacco industry, urged voters to defeat the proposition.\n\nOpponents have seized on the proposition's lack of budget allocation as a central argument. Michael C. Genest, a former director of finance for the state, noted the proposition's timing in light of the state's latest budget shortfall.\n\nCalifornia's cigarette tax is currently about half the national average, ranking 33rd in the nation. The state is one of only three states that have not raised the cigarette tax over the past decade. About 12 percent of Californians now smoke.\n\nOpponents of the proposition have criticized it for potentially sending money out of state and lacking legislative oversight. Cigarette taxes were last increased in California in 1998. The ballot measure's passage requires a simple majority from the voters.\n\nPhilip Morris USA and the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company are the leading contributors behind the effort to defeat Proposition 29. The proposition is also opposed by the California Republican Party and has drawn around $1 million in funding.\n\nIn addition to the American Cancer Society, the proposition is backed by the American Heart Association and the American Lung Association, among other groups. The proposition's supporters, including former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, have been surprised by the amount of money being spent by big tobacco in opposition to the initiative. However, they remain optimistic about its chances.",
    " Title: Obama Criticizes Trump as Unfit for Presidency, Citing Unprecedented Campaign and Divisive Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare move, President Barack Obama on Tuesday publicly declared Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, as \"unfit\" to serve as president. During a press conference at the White House with Singapore's prime minister, Obama criticized Trump's remarks about Muslim parents of a U.S. Army officer who was killed in the Iraq War.\n\n\"If you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him?\" Obama asked. He further questioned, \"What does this say about your party that this is your standard bearer?\"\n\nObama's comments come in response to Trump's criticism of the Muslim parents of a U.S. Army officer who was killed in the Iraq War. Obama added, \"This is not a situation where you have an episodic gaffe, this is daily and weekly where they are distancing themselves from statements he's making.\"\n\nTrump released a statement an hour after Obama spoke, criticizing the president and Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, for their handling of the economy, foreign policy, and the Iran nuclear deal. Trump also criticized Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of State, saying it put national security at risk.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Trump escalated last week after a feud with Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of the soldier. Khizr Khan delivered a blistering rebuke of Trump's proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S. during a speech at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia.\n\nTrump responded to Khan's comments during a Monday night interview on Fox News, stating, \"His son died 12 years ago, and if I were president, his son would not have died because I would not have been in the war, if I was president back then.\"\n\nWhile no GOP leaders have dropped their endorsement of Trump, Rep. Richard Hanna, a retiring congressman from New York, became the first GOP lawmaker to say he would vote for Clinton. Hanna cited Trump's comments on Khan in explaining his decision to vote for Clinton.\n\n\"I think Trump is a national embarrassment,\" Hanna told The Syracuse Post Standard. \"Is he really the guy you want to have the nuclear codes?\"",
    " Title: Former Intelligence Community Inspector General Charles McCullough III Discusses Clinton Email Investigation Backlash\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Intelligence Community Inspector General Charles McCullough III, who played a central role in the Hillary Clinton email investigation during the Obama administration, has revealed that he, his family, and his staff faced intense backlash from Clinton allies, including threats of dismissal if Clinton won the 2016 election.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Fox News, McCullough, who was responsible for the 17 intelligence agencies, discussed his role in the Clinton email probe for the first time on television. He shed light on how the probe was politicized and his office was marginalized by Democrats.\n\nIn January 2016, after McCullough informed the Republican leadership on the Senate intelligence and foreign affairs committees that emails beyond the \"Top Secret\" level passed through Clinton's unsecured personal server, the backlash intensified. McCullough recalled, \"All of a sudden I became a shill of the right. And I was told by members of Congress, \u2018Be careful. You're losing your credibility. You need to be careful. There are people out to get you.'\u201d\n\nMcCullough's comments came during an in-person meeting about a year before the presidential election with then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who was also disturbed by the independent Clinton email findings. Clapper reportedly said, \u201cThis is extremely reckless.\u201d\n\nAfter the Clapper meeting, McCullough's team was marginalized, with senior officials telling him to keep Clapper out of it. As one of the few people who viewed the 22 top-secret Clinton emails deemed too classified to release under any circumstances, McCullough stated, \"There was a very good reason to withhold those emails...there would have been harm to national security.\"\n\nSome of the email exchanges contained Special Access Program (SAP) information characterized by intel experts as \"above top secret.\" WikiLeaks documents show the campaign was formulating talking points as the review of 30,000 Clinton emails was ongoing.\n\nMcCullough was critical of the campaign's response, as the classified review had barely begun. \"There was an effort...certainly on the part of the campaign, to mislead people into thinking that there was nothing to see here,\" McCullough said.\n\nIn March 2016, seven senior Democrats sent a letter to McCullough and his State Department counterpart, raising serious questions about the impartiality of the Clinton email review. However, McCullough clarified that he was not making the decisions on what material in Clinton's emails was classified\u2014he was passing along the findings of the individual agencies who got the intelligence and have final say on classification.\n\nMcCullough described one confrontation with Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's office just six weeks before the election, amid pressure to respond to the letter\u2014which Feinstein had co-signed. \"I thought that any response to that letter would just hyper-politicize the situation,\" McCullough said. \"I recall even offering to resign, to the staff director. I said, \u2018Tell [Feinstein] I'll resign tonight. I'd be happy to go. I'm not going to respond to that letter. It's just that simple.'\"\n\nAs Election Day approached, McCullough said the threats went further, singling out him and another senior government investigator on the email case. \"It was told in no uncertain terms, by a source directly from the campaign, that we would be the first two to be fired\u2014with [Clinton's] administration. That that was definitely going to happen,\" he said.\n\nMcCullough said he was just trying to do his job, which requires independence. \"I was, in this context, a whistleblower. I was explaining to Congress\u2014I was doing exactly what they had expected me to do. Exactly what I promised them I would do during my confirmation hearing,\" he said. \"...This was a political matter, and all of a sudden I was the enemy.\"\n\nHe also mentioned increased pressures early on from Clinton's former team at the State Department, especially top official Patrick Kennedy. \"State Department management didn't want us there,\" McCullough said. \"We knew we had had a security problem at this point. We had a possible compromise.\"\n\nSpeaking about the case more than a year after the FBI probe concluded, McCullough in his interview also addressed the possibility that a more cooperative State Department and Clinton campaign might have precluded the FBI's involvement from the start. \"Had they come in with the server willingly, without having us to refer this to the bureau...maybe we could have worked with the State Department,\" he said.\n\nMore than 2,100 classified emails passed through Clinton's personal server, which was used exclusively for government business. No one has been charged. When asked what would have happened to him if he had done such a thing, McCullough said, \"I'd be sitting in Leavenworth right now.\"\n\nFox News reached out to a Clinton campaign spokesman, Feinstein's office, and Clapper for comment but received no immediate response.",
    " Title: Wisconsin and Minnesota Primary Elections Set Up Tight Races for November Congressional Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, voters in the key battleground states of Wisconsin and Minnesota chose their nominees in primary elections on Tuesday, setting the stage for tight races as the November congressional elections approach.\n\nIn Wisconsin, state senator Leah Vukmir was projected to challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, following a contentious primary that could potentially impact her chances in November. Wisconsin played a crucial role in Republican Donald Trump's surprising presidential win in 2016, and turnout in both Wisconsin and neighboring Minnesota could serve as a gauge of Democratic strength ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nBoth states have shown signs of shifting to the right in recent years. Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate to win Wisconsin in 32 years, and he narrowly lost to Democrat Hillary Clinton in Minnesota. All 435 U.S. House members and one-third of the Senate are running for re-election in November. Democrats need to win two Senate seats to seize control of that chamber, while they need to win 23 House seats to take control, which would disrupt or stall much of Trump's policy agenda and increase congressional oversight and investigation of the administration.\n\nVukmir emerged victorious after a bitter primary fight with Kevin Nicholson, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran backed by conservatives such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Steve Bannon, the former Trump political adviser. The primary contest saw each candidate accusing the other of a lack of loyalty to Trump.\n\n\"It's now critical for our party to unify behind Leah so we can achieve our ultimate goal: defeating Tammy Baldwin,\" U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement congratulating Vukmir.\n\nCharlie Sykes, a longtime Republican commentator in Wisconsin, said the bruising primary could help Baldwin retain her seat, a setback for Republicans who once considered her a top target. \"The biggest winner is Baldwin,\" Sykes told a news source. \"It was an unnecessarily nasty intramural fight.\"\n\nRepublicans also selected Bryan Steil, a former aide to Ryan, to replace Ryan in his seat in southeast Wisconsin. Steil is projected to defeat Paul Nehlen, an avowed white nationalist, to be the Republican nominee. Steil will face Randy Bryce, an ironworker known on Twitter as \"Iron Stache,\" in November in a suburban Milwaukee district that Democrats covet.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democrats chose Tony Evers, the state schools chief, to challenge incumbent Republican Governor Scott Walker, who is seeking a third term. The outcome of Walker's challenge will be closely monitored, as another measure of Democratic intensity.\n\n\"A really strong Democratic turnout in November could cause him to lose,\" said Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist in Washington. State Democrats will be motivated by their opposition to Trump in trying to bring down Walker, he said.\n\nIn Minnesota, state senator Karen Housley was picked to take on Democratic incumbent U.S. Senator Tina Smith, appointed after former Senator Al Franken resigned last year amid sexual harassment allegations. Primaries in two House districts representing regions affected by Trump's trade policies could play a significant role in determining control of Congress.\n\nFormer state representative Joe Radinovich outlasted a group of Democrats in an open-seat race in the state's northeastern mining region, known as the Iron Range, which has seen some benefits from the administration's steel and aluminum tariffs. Trump has campaigned in the district for the Republican favorite, Pete Stauber.\n\nIn the state's south, Republican Jim Hagedorn defeated Carla Nelson in a district the party hopes to seize after the Democratic incumbent, Tim Walz, ran for governor. Farmers in the district have complained about harm from retaliatory tariffs by China and elsewhere.\n\nWalz won the Democratic nomination for governor, while former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty lost to Republican Jeff Johnson, ending Pawlenty's political comeback bid.\n\nBeyond the Upper Midwest, Connecticut and Vermont also held primaries on Tuesday. In Vermont, unofficial results showed Christine Hallquist as the first openly transgender person to win a major U.S. party nomination for statewide office in the Democratic governor's primary. Senator Bernie Sanders, the former presidential candidate, easily won Vermont's Democratic Senate primary. However, Sanders, as before, is expected to decline the nomination and run as an independent.",
    " Title: Republican Party Faces Uncertain Future as Trump Gains Momentum Toward Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican Party is experiencing a period of uncertainty as Donald Trump's strong performance in the Super Tuesday primaries puts him on a path toward the Republican presidential nomination. Hillary Clinton's victories on the Democratic side all but secure her own nomination.\n\nThe Republican establishment is grappling with the Trump phenomenon, which they view as a hostile takeover of their party. Trump's message and his appeal to voters, many of whom are longtime Republicans and others who are new to politics, are driving this change.\n\nRepublican strategist Ford O'Connell notes that the party's conservative message on social issues, particularly its hostility to same-sex marriage, is falling out of favor. Views on healthcare are varied, and neoconservative foreign policy faces growing resistance.\n\nTrump's positions on free trade agreements, his praise for Planned Parenthood, and his incendiary rhetoric, particularly on immigration, are anathema to Republican orthodoxy.\n\nJohn Pitney Jr., a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College, suggests that a Republican Party with Trump as the nominee will be \"the party of left-out white people.\" He acknowledges that economically challenged white people deserve attention but argues that alienating large segments of the electorate, such as Hispanics and African Americans, is not a recipe for a successful party in the long term.\n\nThe party's image of intolerance was highlighted by House Speaker Paul Ryan's comments on Tuesday, where he distanced the party from Trump's association with white supremacists. Ryan, like most Republican elected officials, has pledged to support the GOP's nominee, but some, like freshman Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and retiring Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia, have publicly rejected Trump.\n\nIn the race for the nomination, Marco Rubio scored his first victory of the cycle in the Minnesota caucuses, and he is expected to stay in the race, aiming to win the Florida primary on March 15. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has yet to win a contest, is polling well in the Ohio primary, also on March 15.\n\nTrump won seven out of 11 contests on Tuesday, and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas won three, including his home state. Cruz's victories position him as Trump's main opponent going forward, but his hard-line, no-compromise style has alienated most of his Republican colleagues in the Senate.\n\nSome Republicans hope for no candidate to reach the Republican National Convention with the majority of delegates required to secure the nomination, in which case party leaders would hope to win over enough delegates for a more electable candidate, likely Rubio. However, Trump's momentum makes it difficult for Cruz or any other candidate to knock him off his path to the nomination.\n\nThe exit polls from Super Tuesday contests reveal that among voters who did not support Trump, three-fourths said they would not be satisfied with him as the nominee. This raises questions about whether such voters would turn out or vote for the Democrat, potentially posing a challenge for the Republican Party in the general election.",

The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, attributed the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the world's largest two economies to years of Chinese policies. The Dow recovered slightly before the end of trading, closing with a loss of 572 points.\n\nThe Trump administration maintains that there is no trade war, with White House chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow insisting that the actions are an attempt to address some of the wrongs regarding China's intellectual property practices. However, trade groups in Washington and GOP lawmakers have expressed alarm at the back-and-forth.\n\nPresident Trump announced a possible expansion of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods by $100 billion, following previous announcements of $50 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods and $3 billion in tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. This escalation has caused concern among industries such as the auto repair industry and the chemical industry, which could face retaliation from China.\n\nRepublicans are struggling to find a middle ground between Trump's aggressive trade stance and the party's free trade orthodoxy. Some, like Rep. Bill Flores, have defended the president's actions, stating that while they would not have implemented the tariffs in the same manner, they are seeing results. Others, such as Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, have been more critical, expressing concern about self-inflicted harm to the U.S. economy.\n\nThe expanding list of potential tariffs opens the possibility for China to find new ways to retaliate against the U.S., such as manipulating its currency, selling off U.S. debt, or making it difficult for U.S. financial, travel, and other services industries to operate in China. The Asian giant has already criticized Trump's actions and has sought to close ranks with the European Union, which has also criticized Trump over steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\nThe European Commission has reiterated its belief in free and fair trade, stating that it is one of the most powerful engines for growth, supporting millions of jobs, and contributing to prosperity. China, for its part, has called for a clear stance against protectionism and the preservation of the rules-based multilateral trade order.",
    " Title: Debbie Wasserman Schultz Announces Support for Iran Nuclear Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nFlorida Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, has announced her support for the Iran nuclear deal. In an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" she stated that she would vote in favor of the agreement, citing a lack of evidence that alternative plans, such as economic pressure, would be effective in forcing Iran back to the negotiating table.\n\nWasserman Schultz expressed some concerns but concluded that the deal would keep Iran years away from becoming a nuclear threshold state and allow for a greater focus on Iran's terrorist activities. She stated that intelligence officials have assured her that Iran will not be allowed to use its own inspectors to certify compliance with the deal.\n\nLast week, President Obama secured enough votes in the Senate to implement the pact. Wasserman Schultz, who represents a largely Jewish constituency and is Jewish herself, also announced her support for the deal in an op-ed in the Miami Herald, stating that it was the most difficult decision she has had to make in her nearly 23 years in elected office.\n\nIn an emotional statement on CNN, Wasserman Schultz, who is Jewish, emphasized her commitment to ensuring Israel's existence. She stated that she is confident that her decision-making process will ensure Israel's continued existence.\n\nThe White House is closely watching Wasserman Schultz's decision, as she is a leading Jewish lawmaker and the head of the DNC. Wasserman Schultz stated that she spoke with President Obama on Saturday night, and he assured her that she would be part of a group in Congress working with the administration to develop an enhanced security package for Israel, as well as \"tightening our ability to enforce this deal.\"\n\nMany Jewish lawmakers have struggled in recent weeks over whether or not to support the deal. Vice President Joe Biden met with Jewish leaders in South Florida last week, urging them to support the deal, which he said would put the U.S. in a stronger position to address concerns from Israel and the Arab states about Iran's behavior in the region.\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney criticized the Iran agreement on Fox News Sunday, calling it a \"major, major defeat\" and comparing it to the appeasement of Nazi Germany in the lead-up to World War II. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell, on the other hand, called the Iran agreement \"a pretty good deal\" on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday.\n\nOpponents of the deal argue that it would leave open a lane for Iran to rev up its nuclear program in the future, but Powell stated that Iran has been on a superhighway for the last 10 years to create a nuclear weapon with no speed limit. He called the changes agreed to under the deal \"remarkable.\"",
    " Title: Kavanaugh's Confirmation to the Supreme Court Appears Imminent, Despite Democratic Opposition\n\nArticle:\n\nThe confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States appears to be nearly inevitable, barring any last-minute scandalous revelations. Attracting a couple of Republican senators to vote against the judge seems increasingly remote, with no indications from Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins or Alaska's Sen. Lisa Murkowski that they will oppose Kavanaugh.\n\nDemocratic activists have been urging Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to pressure West Virginia's Sen. Joe Manchin, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota, and Indiana's Sen. Joe Donnelly to vote against Kavanaugh. However, such acts of self-sacrifice would be unlikely in today's Senate, where careers are not easily discarded. Even if Schumer could persuade these Democrats to oppose Kavanaugh, the party would likely suffer significant losses in the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nThe concerns of Democratic senators about potential rulings on issues such as Roe v. Wade and the Affordable Care Act are legitimate, but the unpredictable nature of the Supreme Court's chemistry makes it difficult to predict the court's future direction. The possibility of Chief Justice John Roberts adjusting his behavior to prevent a sharp turn to the right is a speculative scenario.\n\nThe defeat of three vulnerable Democratic senators could significantly weaken the Democratic party's influence in the Senate and hinder their ability to thwart President Trump's legislative agenda. If the Democrats are able to hold down their losses in the worst midterm environment in decades, it would constrain the Republican majority. However, the loss of a handful of Democrats would diminish the party's ability to use the filibuster to gain concessions from the majority on legislation.\n\nRoss K. Baker, a distinguished professor of political science at Rutgers University and a member of \u2588\u2588\u2588's Board of Contributors, suggests that the pressure on Sen. Schumer from rank-and-file Democrats to scuttle the Trump agenda in Congress has been fierce and unrelenting. However, it is important for Schumer to manage the expectations of party loyalists and dissuade them from pressing for objectives that are unattainable, such as the defeat of the Kavanaugh nomination. The potential loss of seats could cost the party its current influence and move it further away from a future majority.",
    " Title: Trump's Recent Statements Face Fact-Checking Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the past week, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has faced scrutiny for several statements made during his speeches in Pennsylvania and Scotland. Fact-checking organizations have found numerous instances of exaggerations, contradictions, and half-truths in Trump's statements on various topics, including trade, the founding fathers, and his own campaign.\n\n1. Trade Policies:\nDuring a speech in Monessen, Pennsylvania, Trump stated, \"When subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets, threatening our factories, the politicians do nothing.\" In 2015, five U.S. steelmakers complained about Chinese producers receiving government subsidies and flouting import rules. This year, the Obama administration imposed a 522% tariff on Chinese companies, and the U.S. International Trade Commission announced an investigation into aluminum imports, hinting at more tariffs on the Chinese.\n\n2. U.S. Trade Deficit:\nTrump also claimed, \"Today, we import nearly $800bn more in goods than we export.\" While the U.S.'s 2015 deficit on goods was indeed $762.6bn, the U.S. is a service economy, and last year it had a surplus in its service trade. The overall trade deficit was about $500bn due to the exports of services and other market forces, according to the Census Bureau.\n\n3. Founding Fathers and Trade:\nTrump asserted, \"Our founding fathers understood trade much better than our current politicians.\" While the founding fathers may have understood trade better than at least one current politician, they understood it in a world of slavery, plantations, and New England shipping. Even then, Trump's trade ideas would not have necessarily been welcome, as the founders had vicious disagreements over trade.\n\n4. US-Korea Free Trade Agreement:\nTrump stated, \"It was also Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, who shoved us into a job-killing deal with South Korea in 2012.\" In 2007, Republican George W. Bush signed the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement, but Congress refused to ratify it for nearly five years. Barack Obama warned of employment consequences from the deal in 2008, but argued it would boost the shattered economy after he became president. Clinton opposed the deal as a candidate but supported it as Obama's secretary of state.\n\n5. Immigration and Refugee Policies:\nTrump has contradicted his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. over several months. In December, he proposed a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\" In May, he called that \"just a suggestion.\" On June 25, he said the ban would apply to regions \"where there is a proven history of terrorism\" and \"Islamic terror\"; on June 25, he said British Muslims \"wouldn't bother\" him but those from \"terror countries\" would; and then on June 27, his campaign claimed nothing had changed.\n\n6. Loan to Campaign:\nTrump's statement, \"Mr. Trump has fully extinguished ( terminated ) this loan per his commitment. Therefore, he has personally invested in excess of $50 million dollars in the future of our country,\" regarding a large loan he made to his campaign, has been called into question. As of Friday, the Federal Election Commission confirmed to fact-checking organizations that it has no record of Trump converting loans to donations.\n\n7. Disavowal of Republican Leader:\nTrump's statement, \"I know nothing about him,\" regarding former Republican Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, contradicts his 2008 interview with CNN, where he praised Paulson. Trump's frequent claims of ignorance when confronted with uncomfortable topics have been noted.",
    " Title: Major Anti-Trump Groups Focus on Indiana to Prevent Republican Front-Runner's Victory\n\nArticle:\n\nMajor anti-Trump groups are channeling their funds into Indiana, viewing the state as crucial in preventing Donald Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, from securing the party's nomination. Doug Sachtleben, spokesman for the well-funded anti-Trump super-PAC, Club for Growth Action (CFGA), stated that the group has already spent at least $1.7 million in Indiana, primarily on statewide television advertising opposing Trump.\n\nSachtleben expressed confidence in Ted Cruz's ability to win Indiana, stating, \"We think Ted Cruz must win and will win Indiana.\" The CFGA's Indiana ad, titled \"Math,\" argues that a vote for John Kasich divides the Republican field, helping Trump.\n\nTrump's rivals are attempting to use the delegate process to their advantage, aiming to prevent Trump from winning 1,237 delegates in the state contests. This strategy could force a contested Republican National Convention, which is currently the only viable chance for either Cruz or Kasich to secure the nomination.\n\nSachtleben noted that the Kasich team has, in essence, endorsed the message of the CFGA ad in Indiana, with the understanding that to stop Trump in Indiana, voters should vote for Cruz.\n\nThree other major Republican-aligned anti-Trump groups are also focusing on Indiana to halt Trump's momentum. Our Principles PAC, an anti-Trump group funded by GOP mega-donors including billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Singer and the Ricketts family, is spending at least $1 million in Indiana opposing Trump. Katie Packer, the group's chairwoman, declined to disclose the exact amount of spending but stated that they have a comprehensive television, mail, and digital campaign in place, similar to their approach in Wisconsin.\n\nIndiana holds a winner-take-most contest, with the statewide winner receiving 30 delegates, and 27 more being awarded through winner-take-all contests in each congressional district. Trump currently has 987 delegates, according to the Associated Press delegate tracker, and needs fewer than 50 percent of the remaining delegates to secure the nomination. Both Cruz and Kasich are mathematically unable to reach that mark without a contested convention.\n\nA Trump victory in Indiana could leave him needing as little as 43 percent of the remaining delegates, and a total loss would leave him needing 56 percent. While Trump is seen as a lock for New Jersey's 51 winner-take-all delegates, the remaining contests present few options for Trump to accumulate delegates outside of Indiana and California.\n\nThe fervent hope among the anti-Trump movement is that Trump's delegate accumulation can be slowed in Indiana and ultimately stopped short in the June 7 California primary. If Cruz and the anti-Trump forces can keep Trump from the 1,237 mark and convince unbound delegates not to push him over that threshold on the convention's first ballot, it would reset the contest. Cruz has been successful in winning the loyalties of delegates, and after the first ballot, the majority of them would be free to vote their conscience.\n\nPacker stated that Our Principles PAC is targeting three states in particular: Indiana, Nebraska, and California.",
    " Title: Federal Government's Enforcement of Gun Laws Under Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate over gun violence and gun control in the United States has taken a new turn, with the federal government launching a campaign to discourage individuals from purchasing firearms on behalf of felons who are legally prohibited from doing so. The campaign, which is being advertised through radio and billboard ads, urges potential gun buyers to \"don't lie for the other guy.\"\n\nThis campaign comes amidst a push in Washington for sweeping new gun control laws, including universal background checks and a ban on military-style rifles and large ammunition magazines. However, recent studies have shown that the Obama administration has not enforced many existing gun laws effectively.\n\nAccording to a study by Syracuse University, gun crime prosecutions hit a decade low in 2011, down 40 percent from their peak under President George W. Bush in 2004. This has prompted 23 House Republicans to call on President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder to prosecute more people for gun-related crimes.\n\nThe Syracuse study found that the number of federal weapons prosecutions fell from about 11,000 in 2004 to about 6,000 under the Obama administration in 2011, and then ticked up to 7,770 in 2012.\n\nThe GOP letter also cited data from the National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS), which found that of 6 million Americans who applied to buy a gun in 2010, less than 2 percent\u2014or 76,000\u2014were denied. Of those, the ATF referred 4,732 cases for prosecution. Of them, just 44 were prosecuted, and only 13 were punished for lying or buying a gun illegally.\n\nFormer Attorney General Alberto Gonzales criticized the current administration's approach, stating, \"If the prosecution of people lying on forms is really a priority for the president, then all he has to do is say, 'I want my federal law enforcement officials to prosecute these kinds of cases.' Obviously, there is a different level of priority given to these type of crimes in this administration compared with other administrations.\"\n\nJustice Department sources argue that the Attorney General has finite resources and prefers to prosecute prohibited persons who have obtained guns illegally, rather than those who just lie on the form, which is also a crime. They also argue that \"lie and try\" cases have little jury appeal, as they are essentially about lying on a form where the person was ultimately denied the ability to purchase the gun.\n\nProsecutions for making a false statement when buying a gun are down 29 percent from five years ago, while prosecutions for illegal possession are down 14 percent, according to federal data. Penalties are also light, with a third of those charged with gun crimes serving no jail at all, and those who do typically only serving one to four years of a possible 10-year sentence for lying or illegally possessing a firearm.\n\nRepublican Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia stated, \"I think when we punish the bad guys we are protecting the good guys.\" He is one of four lawmakers proposing a bill to make straw purchases a federal crime and to increase the penalty from 10 to 20 years.",
    " Title: Gitmo Transfers to Resume This Weekend, Pentagon Confirms\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Department of Defense will begin transferring two detainees from the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility this weekend, according to a U.S. official speaking to Fox News. This follows the largest transfer of detainees from the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo, Cuba in January, which saw the transfer of ten detainees at once.\n\nThe upcoming transfer cannot occur all at once due to a legal requirement for the Pentagon to notify Congress 30 days before any transfers. The first notification was sent to Congress in early March, with a second notification made in mid-April. The first transfer of two detainees is set to take place this weekend, with the remainder expected in mid-May. In total, approximately a dozen detainees will be transferred in the next two rounds.\n\nAs of now, there are 91 detainees remaining at Guantanamo. Thirty-five have been cleared for transfer to other countries. The Pentagon spokesman, Cmdr. Gary Ross, declined to confirm the transfer of any Gitmo detainees beginning this weekend, stating, \"I do not have a timeline on when particular detainees will be transferred from Guantanamo. However, the Administration is committed to reducing the detainee population and to closing the detention facility responsibly.\"\n\nIn the past, the Pentagon only confirmed detainee transfers once they are completed. The detainees are flown on U.S. military aircraft to their third-party nation. However, there have been concerns regarding the recidivism of some detainees following their release. In a recent statement, the Pentagon's point man for Gitmo, Paul Lewis, revealed that some detainees transferred from the prison have in fact re-joined the fight and, in some cases, have been involved in actions that led to the loss of American lives.\n\nCongressman Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., questioned Lewis about the number of lives lost due to Gitmo detainees, to which Lewis responded, \"Unfortunately, there have been Americans that have died because of GITMO detainees.\" The Pentagon later issued a statement stating that only 5% of detainees who have been released have returned to the battlefield during the Obama administration.\n\nIn January, the Defense Department released new statistics showing that the number of former Gitmo detainees suspected of re-engaging in terrorism doubled from six to 12. Senator John McCain has refuted the administration's statistics, stating that he believes more released Gitmo detainees return to the battlefield, putting more American lives at risk.\n\nLast month, the Pentagon submitted a plan to transfer those detainees not eligible for transfer overseas to American prisons in Colorado, Kansas, or South Carolina. The plan was immediately rejected by Congress, who passed a law forbidding the transfer of any Gitmo detainees to the United States.\n\nIn response to the ongoing controversy, President Obama, flanked by his defense secretary and vice president, vowed once again to close the prison. \"It is viewed as a stain on our broader record of upholding the highest standards of rule of law,\" Mr. Obama said. \"This is about closing a chapter in our history.\"\n\nHowever, critics in Congress have demanded a plan for handling ISIS detainees, following the recent killing of the group's second in command by a 200-man special operations task force. The U.S. military has no plans to hold captured Islamic State operatives for more than a month before turning them over to the Iraqi government. The lack of a well-defined policy for handling captured ISIS terrorists is raising concerns on Capitol Hill.",
    " Title: FBI Director Robert Mueller Faces Tough Questions on IRS Probe, Surveillance Programs, and Leaks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated hearing on Thursday, FBI Director Robert Mueller faced tough questions from lawmakers regarding various ongoing investigations, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) probe into the targeting of Tea Party and conservative groups. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) grilled Mueller for not providing specific details about the IRS investigation, stating that it has been the biggest story in the country and that the FBI's lack of information is not typical for ongoing investigations.\n\nMueller repeatedly declined to answer Jordan's questions, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation or stating that he would have to get back to the lawmakers with answers. When Jordan asked who the lead investigator was, Mueller responded, \"Off the top of my head, no.\"\n\nThe hearing also touched on the federal government's surveillance programs, the Benghazi scandal, and the Boston Marathon bombings. Mueller defended the government's collection of millions of U.S. phone records, emails, and other information as vital to the nation's national security. He argued that law enforcement must stay a step ahead of criminals and terrorists while still heeding the civil liberties of Americans.\n\nMueller also testified that the government's controversial surveillance programs complied \"in full with U.S. law and with basic rights guaranteed under the Constitution.\" However, Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. expressed skepticism, stating that by Mueller's interpretation, it would be an \"anything and everything goes\" situation.\n\nThe Justice Department revealed last month that it had secretly gathered emails of James Rosen, a correspondent for Fox News, and phone records of The Associated Press in an effort to crack down on leakers of classified information. The department later acknowledged that Attorney General Eric Holder was on board with a search warrant for Rosen's personal emails, obtained after federal officials accused him in an affidavit of being a likely criminal \"co-conspirator\" under the Espionage Act.\n\nIn the past week, a 29-year-old contractor leaked National Security Agency documents on the agency's collection of millions of U.S. phone records and the NSA's collection of emails and other information that people transmit online to and from foreign citizens. This has sparked a national debate over whether the Obama administration, in its efforts to thwart terrorism, has overstepped by using intrusive surveillance methods.\n\nRep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), the committee's chairman, stated that when it comes to national security leaks, it's important to balance the need to protect secrecy with the need to let the news media do its job. Goodlatte also mentioned that the committee planned to find out more about the status of what the congressman called the FBI's \"stalled investigation\" into the attack in Benghazi, Libya that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador.\n\nAs for the Boston Marathon bombings, committee members want to know whether there was a breakdown in information-sharing between federal agencies, preventing the FBI from thwarting the explosions that killed three people and injured more than 260.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Decisions Impact State Voting Laws Ahead of Election Day\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the upcoming election, several significant decisions regarding state voting laws have been made by the U.S. Supreme Court. Here's a recap of the recent legal activity and its implications for voters:\n\n1. Arkansas: The Arkansas Supreme Court has struck down the state's voter ID law, finding that requiring voters to present a photo ID imposes a new qualification for voting, violating the state's constitution. Consequently, the voter ID law will not be in effect for the November elections.\n\n2. Ohio: The U.S. Supreme Court voted 5-4 to block a lower court ruling that would have prevented Ohio from shortening its early-voting period. This decision extends the early-voting period by a week, starting on Oct. 6, and eliminates early voting during evening hours and on Sunday, Oct. 26. However, early voting will still be available in Ohio on the weekend before Election Day.\n\n3. North Carolina: The U.S. Supreme Court stayed a federal appeals court decision to block part of the state's new voting law. The appeals court had ruled that two provisions\u2014eliminating same-day voter registration and prohibiting the counting of ballots cast in the wrong precinct\u2014should not go into effect this year, while the law is being challenged.\n\n4. Wisconsin: The U.S. Supreme Court blocked a federal appeals court ruling that had allowed the state's voter ID law to go into effect this year. As a result, Wisconsin voters do not have to show a photo ID at the polls.\n\n5. Texas: Civil rights groups have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block the state's new voter ID law\u2014one of the strictest in the nation\u2014from remaining in effect this year, while the law is being challenged. A decision is expected soon.\n\n6. Arizona and Kansas: A case involving a requirement by Arizona and Kansas that voters show proof of citizenship when they register to vote is pending before a federal appeals court. If a decision is not made before Election Day, voters in those states who used the federal registration form and have not shown proof of citizenship will not be allowed to vote in state and local elections.\n\nThe Supreme Court has shown reluctance to allow major voting changes to be put in place right before an election. However, it has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of these laws, which is expected to happen after the election and more likely next year.",
    " Title: Car Manufacturers Pivot Production to Aid in Coronavirus Response\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to calls from governments worldwide, several car manufacturers are repurposing their facilities to produce personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators to aid in the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOn Monday, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) announced plans to convert one of its plants in China to produce approximately one million masks per month. The company aims to initiate production in the coming weeks, as stated in an email by FCA's CEO, Mike Manley.\n\nOther major car companies, such as General Motors (GM), Ford, Tesla, Nissan, and Formula 1 teams in the UK, have pledged their support to offer resources for the production of ventilators. Ford, in collaboration with GE Healthcare and 3M, is working on designing modified respirators and ventilators using fans, batteries, and other parts typically used in cars.\n\nThe companies have not provided a set timeline for the delivery of the products, but Ford has already started producing transparent face shields for hospital staff, with the first 1,000 set for delivery at three Detroit-area hospitals this week. The company expects to produce about 75,000 of such shields this week.\n\nUS President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday, \"Ford, General Motors, and Tesla are being given the go-ahead to make ventilators and other metal products, FAST! Go for it auto execs, let's see how good you are?\" The tweet followed the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announcing reduced barriers in the medical device approval process to expedite the production of ventilators.\n\nAccording to US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, medical device makers can more easily make changes to existing products to address current manufacturing limitations or supply shortages. Other manufacturers, such as carmakers, can more easily repurpose production lines to increase supply.\n\nHowever, some experts have warned that carmakers may find it challenging to switch production due to the highly specific materials and components required to build ventilators, as well as the specialized know-how needed. Jens Hallek, head of ventilator manufacturer Hamilton Medical, told Wired that the materials and components needed to build a ventilator are \"highly specific\" and require \"specialized know-how.\"\n\nFormer US Defense Department officials told the Washington Post that it could take more than a year for carmakers or aerospace factories to start making ventilators. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he had bought 1,255 FDA-approved ventilators from China and had them shipped to Los Angeles.\n\nLast week, Formula 1 teams in the UK said they hoped to find \"a tangible outcome in the next few days\" to help increase the supply of medical equipment. Working with the government and health authorities, F1 said it had experts in design, technology, and production capabilities who could assist.\n\nNissan is part of a consortium, including sports car firm McLaren and aerospace company Meggitt, looking to develop a new medical ventilator. \"We are fully focused on the project,\" McLaren said in a statement, but warned of the \"limited time and scale of the challenge.\"\n\nIndian billionaire Anand Mahindra said his company, The Mahindra Group, would begin work immediately to explore how its factories could make ventilators. The conglomerate is the world's largest tractor maker and India's biggest electric vehicle manufacturer, according to its website.",
    " Title: Interest Rates on Stafford Student Loans Double as Congress Fails to Reach Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nInterest rates on federally subsidized Stafford student loans have doubled overnight, rising from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent following Congress's failure to reach a deal on the matter. The increase, which could potentially cost the average college student an additional $2,600, according to the Congress's Joint Economic Committee, is a result of the legislative impasse.\n\nThe debate surrounding student loan interest rates has been a contentious issue, with Democrats advocating for maintaining low interest rates to support poor and middle-class students in their pursuit of higher education. Republicans, on the other hand, have proposed linking student loans to the financial markets, as opposed to having Congress set federal lending rates. President Obama's budget for this year includes a market-based approach, a proposal that has faced opposition from fellow Democrats.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's spokesman, Don Stewart, expressed hope that President Obama would be able to persuade Democrats to support a bipartisan effort to assist students. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, however, has expressed skepticism about tying loan rates to the 10-year treasury note yield, stating that such a proposal would not pass the Senate without stronger protections for students and parents.\n\nAdam Jentleson, a spokesman for Reid, stated last week that a proposal to link loan rates to the 10-year treasury note yield could not pass the Senate and that Democrats are working in good faith to reach a compromise, but are being obstructed by the Republicans' insistence on reducing the deficit at the expense of students and middle-class families.\n\nSenate Democrats have indicated that they may consider voting on a one-year extension of the current interest rates on July 10, following a recess for the 4th of July holiday. However, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has expressed a preference for including a comprehensive student loan measure in a long-range law governing colleges and universities. Warren stated that a one-year patch would provide the necessary time to address the issue comprehensively.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Expresses Uncertainty Over Sequester's Economic Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has expressed uncertainty about the impact of the forced spending cuts, known as the sequester, that began taking effect on Friday. In a recent op-ed, Boehner argued that the sequester could threaten \"U.S. national security, thousands of jobs, and more.\"\n\nDuring an interview that aired Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Boehner stated, \"I don't know whether it's going to hurt the economy or not.\" He further added, \"I don't think anyone quite understands how the sequester is really going to work.\"\n\nBoehner and President Barack Obama were among those who issued dire warnings about the $85 billion in cuts that are now supposed to take place over the next seven months, the remainder of the fiscal year. Both sides escalated their rhetoric in the weeks leading up to the sequester deadline, March 1, in an attempt to build pressure on the other side to compromise and reach a deal to avoid the cuts.\n\nDuring the interview, Boehner was asked if he had been exaggerating when discussing the consequences of the spending cuts before the deadline. He responded, \"I am concerned about its impact on our economy and its impact on our military. Listen, we've known about this problem for 16 months.\" Boehner blamed Democrats and President Obama for not acting to address the issue.\n\nPresident Obama, during a press conference at the White House on Friday, did not sound as pessimistic about the impact of the cuts as he and his administration had before the deadline. He stated, \"What's important to understand is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts right away. The pain, though, will be real. Beginning this week, many middle-class families will have their lives disrupted in significant ways.\"\n\nWhen asked if the president had been exaggerating his claims about the sequester, Boehner pointed to the example of Education Secretary Arne Duncan stating that teachers in West Virginia were already being laid off because of the spending cuts. Duncan's claim has since been debunked. Boehner added, \"There's a lot of questions about how the White House is handling the communications on this.\"",
    " Title: Study Reveals Importance of Blood Sugar Control for Type 2 Diabetes Patients with COVID-19\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in the journal Cell Metabolism has provided evidence that people with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) who maintain control over their blood sugar levels will fare better if they contract the novel coronavirus. The study, which examined a cohort of 7,336 COVID-19 patients with or without T2D from 19 hospitals in Hubei Province, China, found that those with well-controlled blood sugar who had COVID-19 were less likely to die than those whose blood glucose was poorly controlled.\n\nThe data showed that people admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 and T2D required more medical interventions, despite these interventions, they also had significantly higher mortality (7.8 percent versus 2.7 percent), as well as a greater incidence of multiple organ injury. However, those with well-controlled blood sugar who had COVID-19 were less likely to die than those whose blood glucose was poorly controlled. Furthermore, those with well-managed T2D also received fewer medical interventions, including supplemental oxygen and/or ventilation, and had fewer health complications.\n\n\"We were surprised to see such favorable outcomes in the well-controlled blood glucose group among patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing Type 2 diabetes,\" said senior study author Hongliang Li, at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. The study found that controlling blood glucose well may act as an effective auxiliary approach to improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 and preexisting diabetes.\n\nExperts have identified risk factors for dying from COVID-19, including the prevalence of diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. The virus has devastated African-American and Hispanic communities in several states. Tracey Brown, president and CEO of the American Diabetes Association, stated that the alarming COVID-19 mortality rate in America's communities of color can be directly attributed to problems with health access and resources.\n\n\"In order to tackle America's systemic health inequity problem, we must meet those who are most at risk in their community. Greater accessibility and availability to COVID testing is critical in order to slow the rampant spread of COVID-19 in minority communities. When disadvantaged Americans' are forced by circumstance to delay testing, they risk dangerous health outcomes for themselves, their families, and their communities,\" Brown explained.\n\nOverall, researchers offered a few core messages for those with diabetes: they should take extra precautions to avoid becoming infected with COVID-19 due to the higher risk of severe complications or dying after being infected, and those with diabetes should take extra care to keep their blood sugar under good control during the pandemic.",
    " Title: Florida Becomes New Epicenter of COVID-19 Cases; Governor Signs Controversial Immigration Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nFlorida, currently, is experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, making it the new epicenter of the virus in the United States. As of July 6, the state has reported over 200,000 cases and more than 3,731 deaths. In South Florida, where cases are most concentrated, hospitals are reducing elective surgeries due to a lack of intensive-care unit beds for adults.\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis signed SB 664, also known as the Verification of Employment Eligibility or E-Verify bill, into law on June 30. This bill requires businesses in Florida to use the E-Verify program to verify the employment eligibility of their workers, potentially discriminating against immigrants.\n\nThe signing of SB 664 occurred during a time when Florida was experiencing its first two coronavirus deaths and growing concerns about a spreading pandemic. Immigrant rights organizations warned that this bill would intimidate undocumented immigrants in the state and cause them to avoid contact with government institutions due to fear of being detained and deported.\n\nSince assuming office, Governor DeSantis has been criticized for prioritizing immigration enforcement and playing political games during the pandemic. The state's unemployment website frequently goes down, and thousands of new cases of COVID-19 are reported each week. DeSantis has refused to take steps to mitigate the spread, such as closing non-essential businesses, a tactic that has helped bring the virus under control in other states.\n\n\"We're not going back, closing things,\" DeSantis said. \"I don't think that's really what's driving it. People going to a business is not what's driving it. I think when you see the younger folks\u2014I think a lot of it is more just social interactions, so that's natural.\"\n\nDeSantis has also been criticized for his lack of commitment to encouraging people to stay home or wear masks. Instead, Florida Republicans are pushing for an economic restart in the middle of a pandemic that is overwhelming the healthcare system in South Florida.\n\nThomas Kennedy, a communications fellow for Community Change Action, tweeted about the situation in Florida, stating, \"Every week, the website to file unemployment claims goes down. Every week, we have thousands of new cases of COVID-19 in the state. Every week, Floridians get to watch our governor do press conferences where he is clearly improvising, falsifying data, and blaming others for his failures.\"\n\nNovember, and the opportunity to vote at the ballot box, cannot come fast enough, according to Kennedy."
