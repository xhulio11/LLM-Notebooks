    " Title: Activists Prepare for Intense Battle Over Supreme Court Nominee as Abortion Rights and Healthcare Remain Key Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The confirmation process for the next Supreme Court justice is expected to be a contentious one, with abortion rights and healthcare issues at the forefront. Abortion activists are already mobilizing against the president's pick, targeting two Republican senators in states where they believe they can sway votes.\n\nSens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Susan Collins (R-ME) are known for their tendency to vote against their party, and both women are pro-choice and do not want to see Roe v. Wade overturned. The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL) has been in high gear since Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement. The group hosted a call with 10,000 activists this week to discuss the threats to abortion rights and is using social media to galvanize its supporters.\n\n\"We know\u2014and we know for sure\u2014that any of Trump's list of 25 will vote to decimate our rights under Roe v. Wade. Period,\" said NARAL President Ilyse Hogue. \"We know\u2014and we know for sure\u2014that any of Trump's list of 25 will vote to decimate our rights under #RoevWade. PERIOD.\"\n\nIndivisible, a group established in opposition to President Donald Trump after he was elected, is also rallying its members. It has reportedly set up a hotline to connect people with their senators and created a script for callers to read. Abortion is not the only driving issue behind the protests \u2013 groups in support of Obamacare are also gearing up for the fight.\n\nProtect Our Care, a coalition designed to maintain the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and which was active during the Republican drive to repeal and replace the law last year, is warning the new justice could be a deciding vote that gets rid of protections for pre-existing conditions. Their ad, \"Emergency,\" airs nationwide and targets voters in Maine and Alaska.\n\nHowever, there's another challenge for activists who care about abortion rights and the ACA: Three Democratic senators may also break ranks with their party to join Republicans in voting to confirm the president's nominee. Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), and Joe Donnelly (D-IN) all voted to confirm the president's first Supreme Court pick, Justice Neil Gorsuch, and all three are seeking re-election in states that President Trump won in 2016.\n\nIt's also important to note that the man or woman President Trump nominates to replace Justice Kennedy may or may not be as predictable as everyone assumes. Kennedy was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, who described him as a conservative \u2013 something that's been true of Kennedy only about half of the time. Also, Chief Justice John Roberts, appointed by President George W. Bush, has issued some rulings on the high court that make many conservatives cringe.\n\nRegardless, senators can expect a summer full of activist-filled lobbies, protests, and threats against their political futures as they weigh their votes for or against the next justice of the Supreme Court.",
    " Title: Maryland Lawmakers Propose Replacing Roger Taney's Bust in U.S. Capitol with Thurgood Marshall\n\nArticle:\n\nMaryland lawmakers have introduced legislation to replace a bust of former Chief Justice Roger Taney, who authored the Dred Scott decision, with a bust of Baltimore native Thurgood Marshall in the old Supreme Court chamber of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe proposal, backed by Democratic members of the Maryland House delegation, aims to replace the bust that has been in the Capitol for 143 years with a tribute to Marshall, a jurist renowned for his staunch defense of civil rights and his role in dismantling the system of racial segregation.\n\nGeorge Templeton Strong, a contemporary of Taney, once wrote upon Taney's passing, \"the Hon. old Roger B. Taney has earned the gratitude of his country by dying at last. Better late than never.\" During the initial debate to place Taney's bust in the Capitol, a New Hampshire senator criticized Taney, stating that he \"sank into his grave without giving a cheering word or a helping hand to the country he had vainly sought to place forever by judicial authority under the iron rule of the slave-masters.\"\n\nDespite the criticism, Taney's bust remained undisturbed in the Capitol for almost a century and a half, even as the Maryland statehouse quietly removed their tribute. However, the time for change has come, as Maryland's senators seek to replace Taney's bust with a symbol of progress and equality.\n\nThurgood Marshall's legacy as an attorney, Johnson administration official, and Supreme Court justice is deserving of tribute in the Capitol, but replacing Taney's bust with Marshall's would serve as a poignant reminder of the significant strides made in civil rights since the Dred Scott decision.\n\nIf successful, the replacement would provide a fitting closure to the history of Maryland's place in the old chamber, with a jurist who fought for equality replacing one who worked to uphold racial inequality. The legislation, if passed, would be a testament to the enduring impact of Thurgood Marshall's work and a step towards acknowledging the past and moving forward.",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader McConnell Urges Roy Moore to Step Aside Amid Sexual Misconduct Allegations; Moore Responds on Twitter\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called for Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore to step aside from the upcoming Senate race, following allegations of sexual misconduct against him.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at a plant in Kentucky on Monday, McConnell expressed his belief in the women who have come forward with allegations that Moore pursued romantic relationships with them when they were teenagers. The December election is to replace ex-Sen. Jeff Sessions, a Republican who stepped down to become President Trump's attorney general.\n\nMcConnell, a Kentucky Republican, also mentioned that he is exploring other Republican options for the seat, including incumbent Luther Strange, who lost a primary to Moore earlier this year. He suggested the possibility of a write-in campaign for an alternative candidate.\n\n\"We're looking at whether or not there is not someone who can mount a write-in campaign successfully,\" McConnell said.\n\nThe allegations, reported by the Washington Post last week, include claims by one woman, Leigh Corfman, that Moore, then 32, took her to his home in 1979 when she was 14, undressed her, and allegedly touched her inappropriately. Another woman, Gloria Deason, claimed she was 18 when Moore took her on a date and bought her wine.\n\nMoore, in response to these allegations, has maintained his innocence, stating on Saturday that he was \"not guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone\" and had never purchased alcohol for underage women. Both Moore and his GOP allies in Alabama have questioned the timing of the story, suggesting it was planted to derail his political career.\n\nIn a Twitter response on Monday, Moore fired back at McConnell, saying the Senate Majority Leader is the one who should step aside.\n\nThis development comes after GOP Sen. Pat Toomey also called for Moore to drop out of the race, and Moore's own comments questioning the timing of the allegations and the motivations behind them. The Alabama Republican primary election is set for December 12.",
    " Title: Escalating Political Tensions: Increased Violence and Intimidation Against Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent times, the political climate has been marked by a surge in violence and intimidation directed towards Republican officials and supporters. This week alone, several incidents have come to light, highlighting the growing tension and unrest.\n\nOn Thursday, a woman in Tennessee was charged with felony reckless endangerment for allegedly attempting to run Republican Congressman David Kustoff off the road following a town hall meeting. The woman, Wendi Wright, was reportedly enraged over Kustoff's support for the American Health Care Act and was seen screaming at the congressman and his aide, striking his car windows, and reaching inside the vehicle.\n\nSimultaneously, in North Dakota, police escorted an enraged man from another town hall after he became physical with Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer over his support for the GOP Obamacare replacement. The man, in a heated exchange, questioned the financial benefits of the health care reform and shoved cash down Cramer's collar, saying, \"There you go, take it.\"\n\nCNN's Poppy Harlow downplayed the incident, describing the man's actions as expressing his \"disgust\" with Cramer.\n\nThe day before, a Huffington Post article titled \"How to Really Turn Up the Heat on Elected Officials\" went viral. The author, Michaelangelo Signorile, called on protesters to harass Republicans at dinner, while shopping, and even at home. Signorile argued that societal norms for basic levels of decency no longer apply to liberals.\n\n\"It's time to move beyond polite protests within specified boundaries. It's time to escalate the expression of our outrage and our anger in a massive way,\" he wrote.\n\nSignorile's article has already been shared over 29,000 times.\n\nPolitical violence has become increasingly common as left-wing organizations have whipped up mobs against Republicans and supporters of the president. A popular parade in Portland, Oregon, was cancelled after threats of violence against a local Republican organization. An email warning parade organizers promised 200 or more protesters would rush into the parade and drag the Republican marchers out if necessary.\n\nThe threat was sent from an email address registered with RiseUp.Net, an organization that provides communication and computer resources to allies engaged in struggles against capitalism and other forms of oppression.\n\nPortland has been a site for organized left-wing protests, which have often turned into violent riots. Similarly, far-left groups have resorted to violence to keep Pro-Trump speakers or free speech marchers from appearing in public.\n\nPro-Trump speaker Milo Yiannopoulos had his speech at the University of California-Berkeley cancelled after rioters set the campus ablaze to keep him from speaking. Protests against Milo at UC Berkeley resulted in chants of \"This is what community looks like.\"\n\nPolitical commentator Ann Coulter, who staunchly supported Trump during his presidential campaign, had her speech at UC Berkeley cancelled after the protest groups vowed a repeat performance of the Milo riots.\n\nA North Carolina GOP office was even firebombed a month before the election, and a building adjacent to it was spray-painted with graffiti: \"Nazi Republicans get out of town or else.\"\n\nBeing a Republican in high school or college is increasingly treacherous\u2014and not just at Berkeley. Shortly before the election, a female high school student was attacked after declaring her support for Trump. A fellow female student took the girl's glasses off and punched her in the face, saying, \"Fuck you, you bitch.\"\n\nOlivia Corn, president of Cornell University's College Republicans, said she was physically assaulted the night after Trump won the election. \"Fuck you, racist bitch, you support a racist party,\" her attacker reportedly said. Ironically, Corn said she was \"not Donald Trump's biggest fan,\" and added that she \"was saddened that I was not afforded the same respect that I offer others.\"\n\nA Maryland high school student wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat after the election was punched and kicked by students protesting Trump after he started arguing with them. Similarly, police in Florida arrested a 17-year-old high school student after he punched a classmate for carrying a Trump sign at school.\n\n\"It definitely had a political motivation,\" said Lt. Mike Bandish of the Palm Bay Police Department. \"The boy was carrying a Trump sign and walked into the gym. The other boy punched him in the face.\"",
    " Title: White House Criticizes CNN and MSNBC for Cutting Away from Coronavirus Briefing\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has criticized CNN and MSNBC for cutting away from Monday evening's coronavirus briefing led by President Donald Trump and his administration. White House spokesman Judd Deere described the networks' decision as \"pretty disgraceful.\"\n\nIn a tweet, Deere expressed his disapproval, stating, \"If the White House wants to ask for time on the network, they should make an official request. Otherwise, we will make our own editorial decisions.\"\n\nMSNBC and CNN were not the only networks to cut away from the briefing. Fox News also cut away from the briefing, but only just before it ended.\n\nIn response to Deere's tweet, a CNN spokesperson issued a statement, saying, \"If the White House wants to ask for time on the network, they should make an official request. Otherwise, we will make our own editorial decisions.\"\n\nAn MSNBC network spokesperson explained that the network aired the briefing for more than an hour before cutting away \"because the information no longer appeared to be valuable to the important ongoing discussion around public health.\"\n\nThe administration's daily coronavirus briefings have been a source of controversy, with some critics alleging that they spread misinformation. Last week, President Trump got into a spat with NBC News reporter Peter Alexander over a question about the president's message to Americans who are \"scared\" about the coronavirus.\n\nIn Monday's briefing, Trump indicated that he wants to work with local economies to \"cautiously resume\" activities after the pandemic has shut down industries.\n\nCOVID-19 has infected more than 43,000 people in the U.S., leading to at least 552 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The virus has caused widespread disruption and uncertainty, prompting many to question the information being presented during the daily briefings.",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Calls for Gun-Control Debate in Response to Connecticut School Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the deadly shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, which left 20 children and six adults dead, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has called for a gun-control debate in Congress. This marks a shift in stance for Reid, who has previously voted against gun-control measures.\n\nReid, who controls whether the Senate will take up any legislation that could be sent to the House of Representatives, stated on Monday that a \"meaningful conversation and thoughtful debate\" about gun laws and culture is necessary to address the causes of such tragic crimes.\n\nThe shooting, which also claimed the lives of the suspected gunman, Adam Lanza, and his mother, involved a semi-automatic rifle and two semi-automatic handguns, as well as hundreds of rounds of ammunition. In the days since, calls for action have come from lawmakers who previously fought more restrictions.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat who famously shot a bullet through President Obama's \"cap-and-trade\" energy bill in a 2010 campaign ad, said that \"everything should be on the table.\" He called for a discussion on mental health treatment, military-style assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, and the culture that seems to glorify violence.\n\nSen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, who previously held a pro-gun stance, has changed his position on so-called assault weapons in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., tragedy. Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California have also announced plans to reintroduce and introduce bills, respectively, aimed at banning magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition and assault weapons, respectively.\n\nWhile some, such as St. Louis County Police Chief Tim Fitch, have called for increasing access to guns for teachers to prevent such attacks, others, like Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, have expressed a desire for more gun rights in schools.\n\nReid's vow to hold a gun debate could free up the necessary time to bring a bill to the Senate floor, where the last major gun debate was in 2004. The Nevada Democrat has been a supporter of gun rights, including voting against renewal of the assault-weapons ban during that debate.\n\nThe White House has pledged to engage citizens, from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators, in an effort to prevent more tragedies like this. However, specific legislative actions remain to be seen.",
    " Title: Political Divide and Candidate Allegations: A Comparative Analysis of Biden and Trump's Sexual Assault Claims and Policy Responses\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing political landscape is witnessing a significant divide within the left, as the allegations against Tara Reade and Joe Biden's response to the young voters' demands for a comprehensive health policy are under scrutiny.\n\nIn a recent article published by The New York Times, the authors, Lerer and Ember, delve into the sexual assault allegations against both candidates. The article attempts to address the inevitable calculus voters will have to make in November by providing a thorough accounting of the 'pattern of behavior' laid out by the more than 20 women who have accused Donald Trump of sexual harassment or assault.\n\nThe article notes that the allegations against Trump go 'far beyond the accusations against Mr. Biden.' It is not wrong to consider how a sexual assault allegation might affect a political candidate's chances. However, Lerer and Ember chose to forgo any informed political analysis in favor of a simpler comparison: Whose sexual assault allegations are worse?\n\nRegarding Biden's plan, critics note that Biden's response to the young people demanding a better health policy is to offer a policy that won't help any of them for decades. The article suggests that Biden's plan, which aims to lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60, is not nothing, but it's about as close to nothing as a policy can get without literally being nothing, and it shows that Biden isn't serious about courting the left.\n\nOthers, however, point out that in state after state, young voters' enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders failed to translate into cold, hard votes. Fair or not, their inability to deliver on his behalf will not go unnoticed in political circles, and going forward, candidates will be that much more hesitant to pin their chances on this demographic. Sitting this election out for whatever reason would not serve young voters' interests in the short or long term. They need to show up and be counted like never before, even if only to write in a protest candidate. Once they establish themselves as a reliable force, they won't again have to beg and bargain with politicians to take them seriously.\n\nThe article underscores the complexities and nuances of the current political climate, where voters are faced with making difficult decisions based on the candidates' past actions and policy proposals. The comparison of the sexual assault allegations against Biden and Trump, however, risks obfuscating the issues at hand and detracting from the serious nature of the allegations. Journalists should strive for more informed and nuanced analyses, rather than engaging in comparisons that may not serve the best interests of the readers or the candidates themselves.",
    " Title: Steyer's Climate-Change Super PAC Expands Ahead of Midterms, Raising Questions About Targets and Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape, the name Tom Steyer, a billionaire hedge fund manager and environmental activist, has become synonymous with climate change and Democratic campaign contributions. Steyer, who made a significant impact during the 2014 elections, is now expanding his political organization, NextGen Climate Action, aiming to rival the conservative political network of the Koch brothers.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Steyer is seeking to raise $50 million from other donors to match his own $50 million investment, making NextGen Climate Action one of the largest outside groups in the country. In early February, Steyer gathered a group of leading liberal donors and environmental philanthropists at his ranch in California to discuss his plans.\n\nThe new fundraising push signals a shift within the environmental movement, as donors are increasingly directing their funds from philanthropy and education towards campaign vehicles designed to win elections. This month, NextGen Climate Action asked supporters to choose one congressional candidate from five running this year for the group to target in its next ads. Four of the five candidates were Republicans, including Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. However, the fifth was a vulnerable Democratic incumbent, Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, who has close ties to the oil and gas industries and has been an outspoken supporter of the Keystone pipeline.\n\nSteyer's self-funded, serial ad campaign against the Keystone XL pipeline has been criticized for its misinformation, earning four Pinocchios from the Washington Post's fact-checker. The campaign is seen as an attempt to influence the midterms by expanding Steyer's super PAC into a climate-change equivalent of Michael Bloomberg's single-issue Mayors Against Illegal Guns.\n\nHowever, it remains unclear whether Steyer's operation will focus solely on attacking Republicans or also target non-true-believing Democrats. With at least $100 million at stake for an all-climate-change, all-the-time approach to various midterm campaigns, the impact of Steyer's super PAC could be significant in shaping the political landscape in the coming months.",
    " Title: Democratic-Leaning States Face Significant Impact from Republican Tax Overhaul\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Republican tax overhaul plan, unveiled on Thursday, is set to disproportionately affect Democratic-leaning states, as the bill aims to reduce federal revenues by approximately $1.5 trillion over a decade by targeting state and local tax deductions. The bill, introduced by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means, eliminates the most widely-used deduction - income tax - and caps property tax deductions at $10,000.\n\nThe bill's impact is particularly pronounced in high-tax states that predominantly voted against Donald Trump in the 2016 elections. These states, including California, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, are expected to bear a significant portion of the tax burden.\n\nKevin Sullivan, Connecticut's Commissioner of Revenue Services, stated, \"I do think this has been developed in a way that looks at who were the prevailing forces in the presidential election and who were not.\"\n\nIn states like New York, California, and New Jersey, middle-class households could potentially face higher taxes under the Republican plan. These states, along with Minnesota and Oregon, all voted for Trump's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 election.\n\nBy contrast, the seven states that levy no income tax, such as Alaska, Florida, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, were states that Trump only lost in Washington and Nevada.\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat and one of the most outspoken opponents of the bill, wrote in a letter to Trump this week, \"By eliminating or rolling back state and local tax deductibility, Washington is sending a death blow to New York's middle class families and our economy.\"\n\nThe legislation would also end a tax exemption for billions of dollars of private activity bonds issued by state and local governments annually to finance affordable housing, non-profit hospitals, colleges, airports, and port facilities. This measure would affect both Democrat and Republican states alike.\n\nConservative groups have defended the tax bill, arguing that it would simplify the tax code, reduce the overall burden on the economy, and spread the costs and burdens more fairly.\n\nHowever, officials in the affected states argue that millions of residents, not just high-earners, would suffer due to lost tax breaks and less funding available for public services. In New Jersey, for instance, 1.8 million households deduct a total of $17 billion in state income or sales taxes, and 1.6 million households deduct a cumulative $14.9 billion in local property taxes from their federal taxes.\n\nIn California, approximately one in three residents took a state or local deduction in 2015, totaling roughly $113 billion, according to H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for the state's finance department.\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures President and Republican South Dakota state senator Deb Peters, in a statement, called the legislation \"an attack on the sovereignty of states.\"",
    " Title: Trump Jr. Correspondence with WikiLeaks: A New Development in Ongoing Investigations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the U.S. President, has released thousands of documents to various congressional committees in response to their requests regarding Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Donald Trump Jr., stated, \"Over the last several months, we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents.\"\n\nThe correspondence, though a small portion of the documents turned over, has raised questions due to its connection with WikiLeaks, an organization known for publishing leaked or hacked information. The messages' content and their potential implications are yet to be determined by the investigators.\n\nThe correspondence has added a second instance to the first, where Trump Jr. appears eager to obtain damaging information about Hillary Clinton, despite its provenance. The messages exchanged with WikiLeaks, according to reports, show Trump Jr. mostly ignoring the frequent messages but at times acting on WikiLeaks' requests. For instance, when WikiLeaks first reached out to Trump Jr. about putintrump.org, he followed up on his promise to \"ask around.\"\n\nOn the same day that Trump Jr. received the first message from WikiLeaks, he reportedly emailed other senior officials with the Trump campaign, including Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Brad Parscale, and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, telling them WikiLeaks had made contact. Kushner then forwarded the email to campaign communications staffer Hope Hicks. At no point during the 10-month correspondence does Trump Jr. rebuff WikiLeaks, despite the organization's history of publishing stolen documents and releasing information that benefited Russian interests.\n\nThe stakes for the Trump family are high, as the correspondence adds to the ongoing investigations, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and the White House's response to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. The Trump family's meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and the subsequent White House statement defending Trump Jr. are already reportedly subjects of interest in Mueller's investigation.\n\nWikiLeaks did not respond to requests for comment. The full implications of the correspondence remain to be seen as the investigations continue.",
    " Title: Clinton's Post-Primary Challenges: Uniting the Democratic Party and Winning Over Sanders Supporters\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of her victory in the New York primary, Hillary Clinton faces a significant challenge: uniting the Democratic Party, particularly the Sanders wing. In her victory speech, Clinton acknowledged the need for unity, stating, \"To all the people who supported Senator Sanders, I believe there is much more that unites us than divides us.\"\n\nClinton has several options to address this issue. She could offer Sanders a prime-time speaking spot at the Democratic National Convention, a move that could help bridge the gap between the two candidates. Additionally, Clinton could select a vice president who shares the concerns that have animated Sanders' crowds, or even take a page from John F. Kennedy's playbook by choosing his primary rival, Lyndon Baines Johnson, as her running mate. However, given the age difference between Clinton and Sanders, the latter option seems unlikely.\n\nClinton could also incorporate planks in the Democratic Party platform that reflect Sanders' positions. If Sanders ends up with a campaign debt, Clinton could promise to help pay it off, as President Obama did for her in 2008.\n\nHowever, Clinton's shift back to the center in preparation for the general election could complicate her efforts to appeal to Sanders' voters. These voters are already wary of Clinton, and a perceived move back to the center could further alienate them.\n\nAn even more central question is whether Sanders, who has been critical of Clinton in the past, will wholeheartedly endorse her if she wins the nomination. The endorsement of the candidate by the party's nominee is often a formality, but the endorsement of the candidate's supporters can be a more challenging hurdle to overcome.\n\nFormer Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean, who lost the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004 to John Kerry, echoed this sentiment. \"It's much easier for the candidate to understand that he or she has to get with the program,\" said Dean, who supports Clinton. \"I had made up my mind that I was going to support John, but bringing supporters along was much tougher.\"\n\nAs the primary season winds down, the focus shifts to the general election, and the challenge for Clinton is clear: unite the Democratic Party and win over Sanders' supporters to secure a victory in November.",

The survey, conducted by \u2588\u2588\u2588, found that 94% of U.S. adults have heard about the current state of the relationship, with 83% deeming it unhealthy.\n\nThe survey, which polled 4,151 adults from March 13-27, 2017, also found that 73% of U.S. adults believe the ongoing tensions are impeding their access to important national political news and information. This concern is shared across party lines, with 88% of Democrats and 78% of Republicans viewing the relationship as unhealthy.\n\nThe survey further revealed that 7-in-10 members of both parties believe access to important political news is impacted. The findings are consistent across other demographic groups such as age, race, income, and education.\n\nAwareness of the current state of the relationship between the Trump administration and the news media is virtually ubiquitous in America, with 94% of U.S. adults saying they have heard about it. Younger Americans are less likely to have heard a lot about the relationship, with 55% of adults ages 18-29 saying they've heard a lot compared to 71% of those 30-49, 77% of those 50-64, and 86% of those 65 and older.\n\nThe survey does not address who Americans blame for these tensions or what actions they want taken.

    " Title: Impact of New York City's $15 Minimum Wage on Businesses: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York City businesses, which have been mandated to pay a minimum wage of $15 per hour for over a year, are reportedly experiencing negative repercussions, according to The Wall Street Journal. Businesses with 11 or more employees were required to pay this minimum wage from the beginning of 2019, and some of them are forced to raise prices, cut hours, or even lay off workers.\n\nThomas Green, president of the Queens Chamber of Commerce, has observed an increase in small businesses closing this year. \"They're cutting their staff,\" Green said. \"They're cutting their hours. It's not just the rent.\"\n\nThe minimum wage increase is particularly challenging for businesses located in boroughs with less disposable income, according to Lisa Sorin, President of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce. While Manhattan businesses might be able to handle it, places like the Bronx are forced to \"keep up or get out.\"\n\nEven for businesses that are not forced to shut down due to the minimum wage increase, it can stifle growth. Susannah Koteen, who owns a restaurant in Harlem, had to abandon plans to move her business to a larger location because she could not afford the risk of having to hire more staff in an unpredictable industry.\n\n\"You would just have no choice but to cut people at the bottom,\" Koteen said.\n\nThese anecdotes underscore the reality that while most people believe workers deserve higher wages in theory, the reality of a higher minimum wage can be extremely damaging to minimum wage employees who may lose job opportunities and small business owners who are already operating with tight margins.\n\nJohn Bonizio, who owns four Metro Optics Eyewear locations in the city, said, \"As a retailer, I was not opposed to the minimum-wage increase because it puts more money or more disposable income into the pockets of people who are my customers. But, what you have to stop doing, is picking the pockets of small businesses.\"",
    " Title: Nike's Controversial Decision to Pull Betsy Ross Flag Sneakers Sparks Debate Over Historical Symbolism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, Nike has pulled its sneakers depicting an early version of the American flag, following former NFL football player Colin Kaepernick's reported objection to the image, which he perceived as offensive and tied to slavery. The controversy surrounding the \"Betsy Ross\" flag has sparked a debate over historical symbolism and its modern interpretation.\n\nThe 13-star flag, America's first, is said to have been designed by Philadelphia seamstress Betsy Ross, though historians note that this lore was propagated by her grandson and never confirmed. While Ross lived during the era of slavery, her flag's relationship to white supremacy was not immediately clear to a number of historians contacted by \u2588\u2588\u2588. The political leanings of Ross are unknown, but Philadelphia, with its large Quaker population, had neutral leanings during the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe \"Betsy Ross\" flag is not part of the Anti-Defamation League's database of more than 150 so-called hate symbols, including the Confederate flag, a noose, Pepe the Frog, and Sadistic Souls. Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow at ADL's Center on Extremism, stated, \"The Betsy Ross flag is a common historical flag.\" He noted that while the flag has been used by white supremacists \"from time to time,\" he has \"never once thought about\" adding the Betsy Ross flag to the list.\n\nThe flag has caused controversy before, as in 2016, when students at a majority white high school in Michigan waved the 13-star flag during a football game, while several black students were playing on the opposing team. They were also holding \"Make America Great Again\" flags in support of President Donald Trump. The NAACP's local chapter at the time stated that Ross's flag had been \"co-opted by exclusionary movements.\"\n\nNike's decision to pull the sneakers was intended to avoid offense, but it also opened the company up to political rebuke, potentially jeopardizing financial incentives to add a manufacturing facility in Arizona. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, in a tweet, stated, \"Instead of celebrating American history the week of our nation's independence, Nike has apparently decided that Betsy Ross is unworthy, and has bowed to the current onslaught of political correctness and historical revisionism.\"\n\nThe Betsy Ross flag was formally commemorated on June 14, 1777, when the U.S. passed a law creating Flag Day. The legislation reads: \"Resolved. That the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new Constellation.\" The flag has evolved since its earliest iteration, adding more stars as more states joined the union.\n\nUniversity of Memphis's Professor Scott P. Marler stated, \"Since patriot groups, militias, etc., tend to be firmly linked to '100% (white) Americanism,' the rumor has now taken root that the Ross flag constitutes another such symbol (like the Confederate flag).\" Marler added, \"Well, if it wasn't before, it sure will be now, and it's a shame to concede it to them.\"\n\nThe controversy faced by Nike is the most recent example of the danger of relying on historical icons as modern interpretation changes along with political discord. The Betsy Ross flag, once a symbol of American history and patriotism, has become a point of contention in the ongoing debate about the role of historical symbols in modern society.",
    " Title: Law Professor's Remarks During Impeachment Hearing Spark Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing impeachment hearings, law professor Pamela Karlan's testimony has sparked controversy after she made a comment about President Donald Trump's son, Barron Trump. Critics argue that her remarks crossed a line and disqualified her as an expert witness.\n\nDuring her testimony, Karlan was asked to explain the difference between a president and a king. In response, she said, \"Contrary to what President Trump has said, Article 2 does not give him the power to do anything he wants, and I'll just give you one example that shows you the difference between him and a king, which is the Constitution says there can be no titles of nobility, so while the president can name his son Barron, he cannot make him a baron.\"\n\nSome have argued that Karlan's remarks were inappropriate and demonstrated a strong personal animus against the president. However, others have defended her, stating that her comments were not out of line with the tone of the proceedings.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Florida) questioned Karlan about her statement that \"liberals tend to cluster more; conservatives, especially very conservative people, tend to spread out more, perhaps because they do not even want to be around themselves.\" Gaetz asked if her statement reflected contempt for people who are conservative. Karlan denied that her statement revealed disdain for conservatives.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Karlan's remarks has sparked a larger discussion about the role of personal biases in the impeachment hearings and the broader political climate. Some argue that the proceedings are a ruse to formalize the Democrats' pre-ordained conclusion, while others maintain that the hearings are necessary to hold the president accountable for his actions.\n\nDavid Limbaugh, a writer, author, and attorney, has weighed in on the controversy in his latest book, \"Guilty by Reason of Insanity: Why the Democrats Must Not Win.\" Limbaugh argues that the left's elitist attitude underlies their raging animosity toward Trump and his supporters, and drives their pre-ordained decision to impeach President Trump. Limbaugh's book is available on his website at www.davidlimbaugh.com.",
    " Title: \"California Primary: \"Zombie Votes\" and Potential Impact on Delegate Allocation as Final Voting Hours Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nAs California prepares for the final hours of its primary election, a unique phenomenon known as \"zombie votes\" could potentially influence the outcome and delegate allocation. These are votes cast for candidates who have withdrawn from the race.\n\nAccording to Paul Mitchell, an expert from the electoral research firm Political Data Inc., an estimated 350,000 to 400,000 Californians have already voted for a candidate who has dropped out, with the possibility of this number reaching over half a million. This is due to the fact that more than 16 million Californians received a mail ballot, but less than a quarter of those ballots had been returned by the eve of the election.\n\nThe \"zombie votes\" could impact the delegate count for candidates still in the race. In California, a candidate must earn 15% of the statewide vote to receive any statewide delegates, and also 15% of the vote in any of the state's congressional districts to receive any delegates apportioned at the district level. This means that \"zombie votes\" could cause other candidates to miss the 15% threshold, potentially affecting the delegate count for the remaining candidates.\n\nFor instance, in a hypothetical scenario, if Michael Bloomberg received 13.8% of the vote, but candidates who have dropped out also receive a percentage of the vote, they could potentially keep Bloomberg under the 15% threshold due to the \"zombie votes\" counting in the calculations.\n\nIt's also possible that a candidate who has dropped out will nonetheless exceed the threshold enough to win some delegates in certain congressional districts. These delegates would be chosen by the ex-candidate and expected to vote for them on the first ballot at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nAs for the anticipated flood of same-day voting, either in person or by mail, it's difficult to say precisely which candidate stands to benefit most. Joe Biden, for instance, has been buoyed by a robust victory in the South Carolina primary and a stream of quitting candidates who endorsed him. Californians who didn't vote early may be swayed by all that good news for Biden.\n\nConversely, the former vice president lost that momentum propulsion among all the Californians who have already voted by mail at a time when he trailed other contenders.\n\nHeading into the final hours of the California primary, the latest available public polls still indicated Bernie Sanders with a significant lead. Polls close at 8 p.m. For more on the candidates, check out the \u2588\u2588\u2588 voter guide.",
    " Title: Green Party's Jill Stein: \"This is a Realignment Election\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the tumultuous 2016 presidential race, Green Party candidate Jill Stein has emerged as a significant contender, challenging the dominance of the two major parties. Stein, a 66-year-old Harvard-trained physician from Massachusetts, is running on the Green Party ticket and has expressed her disapproval of both major candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.\n\nDuring an interview last week, Stein stated, \"We have every reason to be terrified of Donald Trump in the White House, but I don't think we should fool ourselves into thinking that we should sleep well at night with Hillary Clinton in the White House either. They're both dangerous and unacceptable in different ways.\"\n\nStein is currently polling at approximately 2 percent, trailing the Libertarian Party's Gary Johnson, who is on track to take about 4 percent of the popular vote. Stein, in her interview, described this election year as a historic opportunity for third parties.\n\n\"This is a realignment election,\" says Stein. \"And you have this marriage of the Democratic and Republican parties now. And it's important, I think, for Greens and Libertarians to be working together right now to just break through this stranglehold and be challenging them right out of the gate.\"\n\nStein and Johnson share similar views on topics such as foreign policy, marijuana legalization, and same-sex marriage. However, their economic policies differ significantly. For instance, Stein advocates for a single-payer health care system, claiming it would cost taxpayers nothing. She also plans to pour federal money into the clean energy sector and end the use of fossil fuels by 2030.\n\nStein has faced criticism over her stance on vaccinations, with some claiming she is anti-vaccine. In response to small amounts of mercury once found in childhood vaccines, Stein told the Washington Post that \"there were real questions that needed to be addressed.\" Despite a scientific consensus that there's never been a link between vaccines and autism or any other serious health problems, Stein characterizes the media coverage of her statements as misleading and compares it to the \"birther\" issue of the election.\n\nWith the election just days away, both Johnson and Stein's poll numbers are slipping. Achieving 5 percent of the popular vote would be a meaningful benchmark for both parties, as it would lead to the Federal Election Commission conferring the classification of \"minor party,\" granting them easier ballot access and eligibility for matching public funds.\n\n\"It's outrageous that people should be struggling right now with this question of, 'Do I prefer a fascist or a warmonger?'\" says Stein.",
    " Title: The Impact of Iran-US Tensions on the 2020 U.S. Presidential Elections: An Analysis of Foreign Policy and Polling Data\n\nArticle:\n\nThe assassination of Iran's most powerful military leader, Qassem Soleimani, in a U.S. drone strike has sparked retaliation from Iran and heightened tensions in the Middle East, placing American troops in the region on high alert. The event has also catapulted foreign policy to the forefront of the news cycle, raising questions about its potential influence on the 2020 primary and general elections.\n\nWhile political science research generally indicates that foreign policy does not significantly impact voters' choices, this Iran episode could be an exception. Foreign policy can have a more substantial impact when it is a significant part of the national conversation and when the two major parties have contrasting positions on it, conditions that this Iran incident may meet.\n\nIn the ongoing Democratic primary, former Vice President Joe Biden is the most experienced candidate in foreign policy. Two recent polls suggest that Democratic primary voters trust Biden the most on foreign policy, with 48% of Democrats and Democratic leaners expressing confidence in his ability to handle foreign policy, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders with 14%. In a poll conducted immediately after the Soleimani strike, HuffPost/YouGov found that 62% of Democrats and Democratic leaners trust Biden on Iran, with Sen. Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren not far behind, with 47% trusting each of them (respondents were allowed to select multiple candidates they trusted).\n\nHowever, the candidates' positions on Iran could also be decisive in the primary. A candidate like Sanders, who has been critical of Biden's vote to go to war in Iraq, could gain an advantage if the primary becomes a question of who is the most anti-war. The upcoming debate will likely be a pivotal moment for many candidates, as foreign policy often serves as a litmus test that all serious candidates must pass.\n\nIn the 2016 Republican primaries, for example, Ben Carson may have failed such a test when, following the coordinated terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, he struggled to articulate his plan to combat terrorism. Although it is impossible to determine the exact impact of this on voters' perceptions, Carson was running even with now-President Trump in the polls at the time of the attacks, but he subsequently declined and ceased to be a serious contender for the nomination.\n\nIt is essential to note, however, that Iran's impact on the primary may be fleeting. News cycles move on, and events touted as \"game changers\" have failed to permanently alter the state of the race. The polling bump that any candidate (including Biden) may receive this week could dissipate quickly, especially if the conflict de-escalates.\n\nFor Iran to have a real impact on the general election, it would likely need to remain in the news for several months. Even then, it is unclear what that effect might be. In theory, the Republican Party might have an advantage in an election focused on national security, as the GOP has traditionally been seen as better at protecting the country from external threats, according to Gallup polling. However, the gap has narrowed during the Trump era, and other polls suggest that Trump himself is not well-trusted on foreign policy.\n\nIt is possible that Trump could become more popular in the wake of this month's attacks due to the \"rally-around-the-flag effect,\" or the idea that major international crises can unite the country around the commander-in-chief. However, this effect is not an ironclad rule; context plays a significant role in whether a rally-around-the-flag polling bump develops at all. Factors such as the seriousness of the event, the country's war-weariness, the president's approval rating before the event, and the level of media coverage of the event can all influence the size of the rally-around-the-flag effect, or even whether there is one at all.\n\nUltimately, in keeping with our highly polarized times, the most plausible theory is probably that opinion on Iran will break down along partisan lines\u2014and therefore, not do much to change the trajectory of the general election. One of political science's most consistent findings on this issue is that elite cues drive public opinion on foreign policy. In other words, if the president's critics support a conflict and bend the metaphorical knee to the commander-in-chief, the public takes note and does the same. But if elite opinion splits along partisan lines\u2014as it is doing so far on Iran\u2014then so will public opinion.",
    " Title: \"Obama's Syria Dilemma: Learning from the Past in the Face of Chemical Weapons Allegations\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the current Syrian crisis, President Obama finds himself in a familiar political predicament, one that echoes the aftermath of the Iraq War. The use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime has become a contentious issue, with the Obama administration weighing the potential consequences of intervention. This predicament, as Amy Davidson writes in the New Yorker, has been heavily influenced by the Iraq War, a conflict that has left a lasting impact on American foreign policy.\n\nIn a piece by Josh Gerstein for Politico, it is stated that the ghosts of the Iraq War loom large over the Obama administration's handling of the Syria crisis. Former officials and analysts close to the administration express concerns about repeating past mistakes, with a strong emphasis on avoiding a hasty and potentially costly military intervention.\n\nThe Obama administration's stance on Syria's use of chemical weapons has been marked by caution. In a letter to members of Congress this week, the White House stated that there is \"varying degrees of confidence\" that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on a \"small scale.\" This seemingly nuanced approach has been met with criticism from some lawmakers, who argue that the \"red line\" has been crossed.\n\nSenator John McCain (R-AZ) expressed his disappointment with Obama's statement, while Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) questioned what the next step should be. Meanwhile, the Obama administration continues to grapple with the implications of the Syrian crisis, with a focus on historical precedents and the potential consequences of intervention.\n\nRetired Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni, in an interview with Time magazine, cautioned against making hasty decisions based on intelligence assessments, a sentiment echoed by the current administration's careful approach to the Syrian crisis. As the situation unfolds, the Obama administration will continue to navigate the complexities of the Syrian conflict, learning from past experiences and striving to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.",
    " Title: Trump Signs Executive Order Encouraging Police Reform, Critics Call for More Substantial Change\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at addressing the ongoing national conversation on police reform, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday, focusing on improving police training and use-of-force standards. The order, however, has been met with criticism for not addressing systemic issues and racial bias within law enforcement.\n\nThe executive order, signed in a Rose Garden ceremony, includes provisions for creating a database to track police officers with multiple instances of misconduct, encouraging departments to meet higher certification standards on use of force, and involving social workers and mental health professionals in calls related to homelessness, mental illness, and addiction. The order also calls for a ban on chokeholds, except in cases where an officer feels their life is in danger.\n\nHowever, questions have been raised about the practical impact of the order, given Trump's limited powers over law enforcement, which is primarily a state and local responsibility, and the history of attempts to ban neck restraints.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jim Jordan praised the order, calling it a \"tremendous step forward in improving the system and beginning a new era in the relationship between communities and the police officers that keep them safe.\"\n\nCritics, on the other hand, have labeled the order an \"empty photo op\" that is unlikely to result in significant changes to policing across the country. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., stated, \"The President's weak Executive Order falls sadly and seriously short of what is required to combat the epidemic of racial injustice and police brutality that is murdering hundreds of Black Americans.\"\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton, who eulogized George Floyd, expressed concern that the order's exception to the chokehold ban would allow police officers to continue using the controversial tactic. The executive order does not address concerns about racial bias in policing, with the focus instead on building relationships between communities and the police.\n\nTrump, as in the past month, reiterated his support for law enforcement, stating that the number of bad officers is \"very tiny.\" He also denounced proposals to defund police departments, asserting that many departments are underfunded and under-supported.\n\nSome activists, in response to recent police killings, have advocated for the \"defund the police\" movement, which involves redirecting funds from police departments to areas such as mental health, social work, and other functions apart from patrol-style policing.\n\nBefore signing the order, Trump met with families who have lost loved ones in interactions with police. However, at least one family, that of Antwon Rose, a 17-year-old boy killed in 2018, declined to meet with Trump, citing a desire for action from Congress on law enforcement issues.\n\nThe White House is also embroiled in a political confrontation with Congress over the apparent expansion of bipartisan support to rename U.S. military facilities named for Confederate commanders. Meanwhile, the Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing on policing and community relations, and Senate Republicans are working on a policing bill expected to be unveiled this week. The Democratic-led House of Representatives has introduced a bill that includes a ban on chokeholds, among other measures.",
    " Title: The Influence of Money in Presidential Elections: A Historical Perspective and the Shift in Earned Media for 2020\n\nArticle:\n\nThe historical narrative of wealthy candidates failing to secure presidential victories despite substantial financial backing is a recurring theme in American politics. Candidates such as Meg Whitman, Carly Fiorina, Linda McMahon, and even Ross Perot in 1992, have all demonstrated that monetary resources alone do not guarantee electoral success. This trend is set to continue with Howard Schultz's entry into the 2020 cycle. David Koch, the Libertarian Party candidate for vice president in 1980, also falls into this category.\n\nThe crux of the matter lies not in the importance of money, but rather in its role as a determinant of a candidate's credibility in the eyes of the media. A minimal amount of funds is necessary to maintain a campaign, travel, and manage essential functions. However, beyond this baseline, funds are typically allocated towards consultants and television ads.\n\nCandidates continue to invest a significant portion of their funds in television ads, as this medium reaches the demographic most likely to vote - the baby boomers. However, the effectiveness of TV ads in terms of persuading the electorate has diminished due to the current level of political polarization.\n\nIn 2020, earned media, particularly social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, will likely take precedence over traditional television. While some individuals are swayed by television, many more are influenced by their friends and peers.\n\nAs the 2020 presidential election approaches, it is crucial to track each candidate's Q1 fundraising totals to gain insights into their financial strength and potential electoral viability. The landscape of earned media is evolving, and understanding this shift will be key to predicting the outcome of the election.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee Authorizes Subpoenas for Mueller Report and Trump Aides\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday authorized Chairman Jerry Nadler to issue subpoenas for special counsel Robert Mueller's full report and all underlying evidence, as well as for five former senior aides to President Donald Trump. The move is likely to escalate a legal confrontation between Congress and the Justice Department.\n\nThe party-line committee vote authorized Nadler to issue subpoenas to former chief of staff Reince Priebus, former adviser Steve Bannon, former White House counsel Don McGahn, McGahn's former deputy Ann Donaldson, and former communications director Hope Hicks. The authorization for subpoenas puts Congress on an aggressive footing while Attorney General William Barr reviews Mueller's report and redacts several categories of information.\n\nNadler indicated that he would not issue the subpoena immediately, but rather give Barr time to change his mind about redacting the report before submitting it to Congress. \"If that doesn\u2019t work out, in a very short order, we\u2019ll issue the subpoenas,\" Nadler said.\n\nDemocrats have argued that Congress should have access to all of the information, even if it is blacked out of the version of the report Barr makes public. They note that Republicans received material in all four categories when they demanded documents from the Justice Department over the past two years.\n\nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee criticized the subpoena effort as a partisan push to attack the president. Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the panel, said Democrats are asking Barr to violate laws and regulations to reveal redacted information.\n\nNadler repeatedly invoked the investigation of President Bill Clinton by former independent counsel Ken Starr as an example of why Mueller's report should be released. Though Nadler was a harsh critic of Starr at the time, he emphasized Wednesday that Starr provided Congress voluminous material that Barr now proposes to redact.\n\nSome Republicans urged Nadler to go to court and ask a judge to lift the restriction on sharing grand jury material. Nadler indicated he intends to do that but wants the committee to issue a subpoena first. The party-line vote was along party lines, with all Democrats voting in favor and all Republicans voting against.",
    " Title: Romney Boosts Campaign Confidence Following Debate Series, Criticizes Obama's Second-Term Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nIn Henderson, Nevada, Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, expressed a sense of renewed vigor and confidence on Tuesday, attributing the surge to his performances in the series of debates with President Barack Obama. Addressing an audience of approximately 6,000 people, Romney stated, \"There's no question about it, we're seeing more and more enthusiasm, more and more support.\"\n\nThe GOP candidate, who experienced a significant boost in the polls following his first debate performance in early October, continued his criticism of Obama's second-term agenda. He commented, \"He's been reduced to trying to defend characters on Sesame Street and word games of various kinds, and then misfired attacks after one and another.\" Romney emphasized, \"Attacks on me are not an agenda.\"\n\nRomney's third debate with the president, focused on foreign policy, concluded on Monday night. A CNN instant poll showed debate watchers giving Obama the edge in that meet-up. However, Romney's campaign felt he had scored points with his debate-night criticism of Obama's second-term agenda.\n\nRomney's running mate, Paul Ryan, echoed the campaign's confident demeanor at the first of two joint rallies on Tuesday. Ryan told the cheering audience, \"In two weeks from today, he (Obama) is going to become former President Barack Obama, and Mitt Romney is going to be the next President of the United States.\"\n\nBoth Romney and Ryan urged the Nevada audience to vote early. Polls show a tight race in Nevada, with Obama holding a slight edge. President Obama was scheduled to rally an audience in Las Vegas the following night.\n\nRomney's senior adviser, Kevin Madden, acknowledged areas of agreement between the candidates in the debates but highlighted Romney's stance on China and modernizing the Navy as points of distinction. Madden stated, \"Where there were differences in opinion and differences in policy, he (Romney) did point them out.\"\n\nThe Romney campaign appeared to capitalize on the perceived success of the debates, with Romney adviser Madden suggesting that the Obama campaign's release of a booklet of the president's policy proposals for the next four years on Tuesday morning was a response to Romney's debate criticisms.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Advocates for Complete Dismantling of Affordable Care Act, Alarming Democrats\n\nThe Trump administration has taken a significant shift in its stance on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, by advocating for the entire law to be struck down, rather than just select elements like protections for patients with pre-existing conditions. This move has alarmed Democrats who have vowed to oppose the change.\n\nIn a filing with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, three Justice Department lawyers stated that the department \"has determined that the district court's judgment should be affirmed\" and that \"the United States is not urging that any portion of the district court's judgment be reversed.\"\n\nThe potential consequences of this decision could be substantial, particularly for the more than 20 million Americans who are covered through the ACA's Medicaid expansion and insurance exchanges. The ACA, which has been the subject of numerous legal challenges since its 2010 passage, has significantly transformed the nation's health system, creating new patient protections and reshaping payments for doctors and hospitals.\n\nSome of the Trump administration's proposed drug price reforms depend on provisions contained in the ACA. However, senior Trump health officials have yet to detail how they would respond if all of Obamacare is struck down.\n\nThe GOP-led states that initially brought the lawsuit, Texas v. United States, had called for the entire law to be invalidated due to the elimination of the individual insurance mandate penalty. The U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor, a George W. Bush appointee, was swayed by this argument.\n\nPreviously, the Trump administration had argued that only elements of the ACA, such as its protections for patients with pre-existing conditions, should be struck down, while other parts of the law could stand.\n\nHouse Democrats, who had planned to introduce legislation on Tuesday aimed at fortifying Obamacare, denounced the Trump administration's new legal position as \"unconscionable.\" Representative Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, stated, \"Millions of Americans will lose their health care immediately if this decision is upheld.\"\n\nJustice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said the department \"has determined that the district court's comprehensive opinion came to the correct conclusion and will support it on appeal.\"\n\nThis development comes after Attorney General Bill Barr pledged to reconsider the Justice Department's stance on the lawsuit during his Senate confirmation hearing. However, legal experts had not expected Barr to take a more aggressive position than his predecessor Jeff Sessions, who told career Justice Department lawyers to drop their defense of the law, leading to the resignation of senior attorney Joel McElvain.\n\nNick Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor who has criticized O'Connor's ruling, stated, \"Barr inherited an indefensible legal position. But instead of backing down, he's embraced a downright crazy one.\" A group of Democratic-led states led by California is challenging the Texas ruling, arguing that the federal health care law can remain in place even without a tax penalty for Americans who forego health coverage.",
    " Title: Latino Groups Shift Strategy Away from Protest, Focus on Voter Registration and Engagement for Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of President Barack Obama's decision not to take executive action on immigration reform before the midterm elections, Latino leaders and advocacy groups have shifted their strategy from protests and political retribution to voter registration, engagement, and the promotion of ballot initiatives.\n\nThe decision by leading Washington advocacy groups not to urge their large voting bloc to stay at home in November confirms the political calculation of senior Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the White House: Latino voters will not abandon the party, even with a delay on executive action. Latino leaders believe that electing more Republicans to Congress weakens the chances of any immigration reform legislation passing and that picking a fight with Obama\u2014their most powerful ally\u2014could backfire.\n\nCrist\u00f3bal Alex, the Latino Victory Project's executive director, stated, \"We just can't sit back and dwell on this. We've got to get out and work and build our own political power.\" Alex predicted that more than 7 million Latino voters would turn out for the midterm elections.\n\nThe White House also played a role in quelling some anger by holding a series of meetings with stakeholders since the announcement that Obama would not move forward before the election. However, it remains unclear whether Hispanics will respond to the call to vote. Obama's decision to postpone an executive order until the end of the year has made the job of driving up interest among Latino voters\u2014already a challenge in midterm election years\u2014much more difficult, according to activists and political analysts.\n\nOne topic they aren't using widely to turn out the voters in the midterms: immigration reform. Instead, the drive is focused on motivating Latino voters over issues like education, health care, the economy, and the environment.\n\nSo far, there are 100 partners in the Hispanic Heritage Month get-out-the-vote movement, which has registered more than 38,000 people online. The effort has more voter registration events planned next week in Texas, Florida, and Utah and is also engaging through Twitter.\n\nIf Latino voters show up on Election Day, they could prove decisive in close Senate, House, and gubernatorial races, according to an analysis from the polling firm Latino Decisions. The clearest example is the Senate contest in Colorado, where 14 percent of eligible registered voters are Hispanic. But Latino Decisions has also identified the Michigan, North Carolina, and Georgia Senate races as campaigns where Latino voting rates could swing the election. Even in Kansas, where Latinos make up 5.5 percent of registered voters, Hispanic turnout could swing the election if candidates target them, Matt Barreto, co-founder of polling firm Latino Decisions, said.\n\nThe top-tier gubernatorial races for Latino influence include Illinois, Florida, Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Texas, according to the firm. If these elections come down to the margins, the growing Hispanic electorate in each state could decide the outcome, Barreto said at a briefing hosted by the National Council of La Raza on the midterm elections.\n\nHowever, some Latino leaders and activists have expressed concern that Obama's delay in taking executive action could dampen voter enthusiasm. Gary Segura, a Latino Decisions co-founder, stated, \"The advocacy organizations want people to vote, and I want people to vote, but if you're a Latino in North Carolina, and the president delayed his decision to help Kay Hagan in her election, why would you go vote for Kay Hagan?\"\n\nDespite these concerns, the National Council of La Raza's president and CEO, Janet Murgu\u00eda, clarified that the organization is not encouraging anyone to sit on the sidelines. \"The NCLR is not encouraging anyone to sit on the sidelines,\" she said.\n\nA June poll conducted by Latino Decisions with the Center for American Progress found that 57 percent of Latinos said Obama's failure to take executive action would leave them less enthusiastic about voting Democratic and 54 percent said they would be less excited to vote at all. Latino outside groups are aware of the need to try to energize their base, so they expect to push ahead.\n\nNext week, several groups, including the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, will be in Arizona to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the first statewide anti-immigration proposition in California, which spurred Latino and immigrant participation in the election process. The drive to raise cash has also continued, with the Latino Victory PAC and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD PAC hosting a fundraiser Wednesday evening at Rosa Mexicano.",
    " Title: U.S. Job Market Adds 222,000 Jobs in June, Exceeding Expectations\n\nThe U.S. job market experienced a significant growth in June, with the addition of 222,000 jobs, according to the Labor Department's report released on Friday. This figure surpassed the 152,000 jobs added in May and economists' expectations of 140,000 to 200,000 jobs.\n\nThe employment increase in June was driven by gains in the healthcare sector (37,000 jobs), social assistance sector (23,000 jobs), financial sector (17,000 jobs), and mining sector (8,000 jobs). The average hourly earnings increased by 4 cents in June, to $26.25, with a year-over-year increase of 2.5 percent.\n\nThe unemployment rate has decreased by 0.4 percent since the start of the year, and the number of people who are unemployed has fallen by 658,000, according to the Labor Department. The number of long-term unemployed people remained relatively stable, at 1.7 million people, in June.\n\nThe labor force participation rate in June was 62.8 percent, similar to the rate in May. The report's implications for future interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve remain uncertain, with economists expressing differing views.\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, President of the American Action Forum, suggested that the report allows the Fed to increase rates and begin tapering its portfolio. However, Curt Long, chief economist at the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions, expressed doubts about another rate increase this year due to stalled wage growth and potential concerns about low inflation.\n\nPresident Trump, who has emphasized economic gains since taking office in January, praised the jobs report on Twitter, while House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the report, stating that American workers are not receiving the higher wages they deserve.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley expressed optimism about the jobs report but called for further action to create good-paying jobs and raise wages. Jason Furman, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, described the job gains as \"impressive\" but expressed concern about the stagnant wage growth.",
    " Title: Trump's Executive Orders Aim to Overhaul Federal Employee Policies and Streamline Dismissal Process\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced a series of executive orders aimed at reforming the federal employee system, including freezing pay raises for civilian federal workers and implementing stricter performance and misconduct policies. The changes are intended to address concerns over the perceived job security and benefits enjoyed by federal employees, which are, on average, higher than those in the private sector.\n\nThe new measures, as outlined in Trump's 2018 State of the Union address, aim to \"reward good workers\" and \"remove federal employees who undermine the public trust.\" In May, Trump issued executive orders that shorten the performance improvement period for problem employees from 120 days to 30 days and streamline the appeals process, which can take up to eight months on average.\n\nAccording to data from the Office of Personnel Management, only a minuscule half of one percent of federal workers are terminated each year, one-fifth the firing rate in the private sector. The new rules are expected to save taxpayers an estimated $100 million annually, as they limit federal employees' time spent on union business to 25% of their hours.\n\nThe changes have been met with resistance from public-sector unions, who argue that the reforms infringe on collective bargaining rights. In August, a federal district court judge, Ketanji Brown Jackson, ruled that the changes must be decided through collective bargaining, not by the president. Trump's Justice Department is appealing the decision.\n\nIn addition to these changes, the Trump administration is also working to reform the Veterans Administration, where a scandal erupted in 2014 over employees doctoring patient waiting lists. The reforms include the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which aims to cut red tape in the firing and disciplining of wrongdoers. However, these improvements are being held up by union-driven litigation.\n\nThe ability of the Trump administration to protect veterans and ensure taxpayer value in every department of government depends on winning the battle to restore merit-based management in the federal bureaucracy. The creation of the civil service in 1883, through the Pendleton Act, was intended to replace the partisan spoils system with merit. However, the current system, often referred to as the TIMER system, rewards employees for their tenure rather than their work quality.",
    " Title: Federal Appeals Court Upholds Trump Administration's Right to Withhold Grant Money from Sanctuary Jurisdictions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant decision on Wednesday, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing it to withhold grant money from states and localities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. The ruling overturns a lower court decision that had blocked the administration's 2017 move to withhold funds from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program.\n\nThe Justice Department spokesman stated, \"Today's decision rightfully recognizes the lawful authority of the Attorney General to ensure that Department of Justice grant recipients are not at the same time thwarting federal law enforcement priorities.\" The grant conditions require states and cities that receive DOJ grants to share information about criminals in custody. The federal government uses this information to enforce national immigration laws, a practice supported by successive Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\nThe latest decision conflicts with rulings from other appeals courts concerning sanctuary policies, indicating a Supreme Court review is likely. New York City and several liberal states, including New York, Washington, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, had sued the government. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York had ordered the money to be released and stopped the government from putting immigration-related conditions on grants.\n\nHowever, the appeals court ruled that it \"cannot agree that the federal government must be enjoined from imposing the challenged conditions on the federal grants here at issue.\" The court stated that the conditions help the federal government enforce national immigration laws and policies supported by successive Democratic and Republican administrations. Moreover, they ensure that applicants satisfy particular statutory grant requirements imposed by Congress and subject to Attorney General oversight.\n\nThe ruling also disagreed with the district court's claim that the conditions intrude on powers reserved only to states. In immigration policy, the Supreme Court has found that the federal government maintains \"broad\" and \"preeminent\" power.\n\nThe ruling marks a key win for the administration in its efforts to crack down on the continued use of \"sanctuary\" policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities in order to shield illegal immigrants from deportation. The Justice Department has recently announced a series of measures, and President Trump has called on Congress to pass legislation that would allow victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants to sue sanctuary cities and states.",
    " Title: The Ninth Circuit's Ruling on Trump's Immigration Order: A Constitutional and Legal Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent ruling, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a temporary restraining order issued by a federal judge in Seattle against President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration. The order, which temporarily suspended entry by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries, has sparked controversy and debate, with some arguing that it infringes on constitutional rights and others contending that it is a necessary measure to protect national security.\n\nBefore delving into the specifics of the case, it is essential to establish three inarguable facts:\n\n1. The U.S. Constitution vests plenary power in the President of the United States regarding foreign policy and immigration, as defined by federal law. Section 212 (f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 grants the President the authority to suspend the entry of aliens or any class of aliens if they are deemed detrimental to the interests of the United States.\n\n2. There is no constitutional right of a foreign national to enter the United States. Constitutional rights of foreign nationals commence upon their arrival in America, which is commonly interpreted as clearing customs and immigration bottlenecks at ports of entry.\n\n3. The immigration order put forth by the Trump administration, regardless of one's judgment as to its wisdom or drafting, is not dissimilar to previous orders issued by Trump's predecessors.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit's ruling, based on the essential argument that Trump's order and rhetoric on immigration were not politically correct, has been criticized for ignoring federal law and imposing political views. This criticism is part of a broader debate about the role of the judiciary in interpreting and enforcing the law, and the balance between national security and individual rights.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit, which has a history of being overturned and is often referred to as the \"Ninth Circus,\" has been a subject of debate for its legal decision-making. In 2004, a bill was passed by the Republican-led House to break up the Ninth Circuit into three separate entities, but the plan was shot down by Democrats due to the court's vast geography.\n\nThe case for breaking up or reforming the Ninth Circuit has been advocated by political figures such as Newt Gingrich, who suggested subpoenaing judges making \"anti-American\" rulings and demanding they defend them under legal and constitutional justification. While Gingrich's ideas were met with criticism in the past, the recent ruling by the Ninth Circuit has reignited the debate about the court's effectiveness and legitimacy.\n\nLegal analysts believe that the Supreme Court, even in its current 4-4 ideological split, will likely overturn the Ninth Circuit's ruling. However, the case highlights the need for a broader discussion about the role of the judiciary, the balance of power between the branches of government, and the interpretation and enforcement of the law.\n\nAs the debate continues, it is crucial to maintain a neutral and factual approach to understanding the issues at hand. The immigration order, the role of the judiciary, and the balance of power between the branches of government are complex and multifaceted issues that require careful consideration and thoughtful discourse.",
    " Title: Donald Trump Jr. Accuses BBC of Anti-Israel Bias in Tweets Over Jerusalem Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets, Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of former U.S. President Donald Trump, has accused the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) of publishing misleading headlines regarding attacks against Israelis.\n\nLast week, Trump Jr. criticized a BBC headline that read, \"Three Palestinians killed after deadly stabbing in Jerusalem,\" for omitting the fact that the three individuals were killed only after they had stabbed a female Israeli police officer to death. Trump Jr. described the headline as \"as close to being misleading as possible.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu noticed Trump Jr.'s reaction and thanked him for his unwavering support for Israel.\n\nThis week, Trump Jr. once again took to Twitter to express his disapproval of the BBC's reporting, this time over an attack in Jerusalem that left two policemen dead. Trump Jr. tweeted, \"Um, @BBCWorld is it time for a reminder that we discussed your anti #Israel # bias a few weeks ago? 2 cops killed & this is your lead? WTF?\"\n\nOther social media users also noticed the BBC's reporting and expressed their disapproval. John Cardillo, a conservative commentator, tweeted, \"Two Israeli cops killed, third injured, in a Muslim terror attack. Disgraceful reportage @BBCWorld.\"\n\nWhile the BBC did provide more information on the victims, some users felt that the initial headline was misleading. The two policemen who died of their injuries in hospital were named as Advanced Staff Sergeant Major Kamil Shanan, aged 22, and Advanced Staff Sergeant Major Hail Sattawi, who was 30. They were Druze from Israel's northern Galilee region.\n\nThis is not the first time Trump Jr. has called out the BBC's anti-Israel bias. Last year, the BBC deleted a tweet that Trump Jr. had criticized.\n\nIn addition to taking on the BBC, Trump Jr. is currently trying to fight off a media firestorm after reports revealed he met with a Russian lawyer last year after learning she may have opposition research on Hillary Clinton. Some lawmakers are calling for him to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
    " Title: North Korea Vows to Restart Nuclear Reactor, Escalating Tensions on the Korean Peninsula\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, North Korea has announced its intention to restart a nuclear reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear plant, a move that further escalates tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The decision was made at a rare plenary meeting of the central committee of the ruling Workers' Party, according to NPR's Louisa Lim, who spoke to our Newscast Desk.\n\nThe reactivation of the plutonium reactor, which was shut down in 2007 as part of international nuclear disarmament talks, could produce enough plutonium for one nuclear bomb per year. This development will likely increase concerns in Washington and its allies about North Korea's timeline for developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States, a technology that is not currently believed to be in their possession.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that the plutonium reactor's restart, along with other facilities at the main Yongbyon nuclear complex, will heighten fears about North Korea's nuclear weapons program, which it views as essential for national security and non-negotiable. The reactor's cooling tower was destroyed in 2008 as part of disarmament efforts.\n\nMonday saw the deployment of two F-22 Raptor fighter jets to South Korea for U.S.-South Korean military drills, following last week's news of nuclear-capable B-2 stealth bombers conducting a training flight to the Korean Peninsula. The North, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, has been attributing the U.S.-South Korean military exercises, a practice that has been ongoing in recent decades, as the cause for their severing of hotlines with the South and the annulment of the 1953 armistice that ended open warfare on the peninsula.\n\nSouth Korea's new president, Park Geun-hye, described the security situation as \"grave,\" according to Yonhap News. Despite this, she believes that discouraging North Korea from provocations through strong diplomatic and military deterrence is just as important as punishing the communist nation after provocations.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland expressed doubts about whether Pyongyang would follow through on its vow. \"There's a long way to go between a stated intention and actually being able to pull it off,\" she said. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney stated that the U.S. is closely monitoring events on the Korean Peninsula. \"The entire national security team is focused on it,\" he said.",
    " Title: Clinton Campaign Urges FBI Director Comey to Provide More Details on Email Review Amid Election Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of interviews on Sunday, top Clinton campaign officials, including campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook, urged FBI Director James Comey to provide more details about the bureau's review of newly-discovered emails related to the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. The officials expressed concern that Comey's announcement of the review on Friday, just 11 days before the election, could fuel conspiracy theories and potentially harm Clinton's campaign.\n\nOn CNN's State of the Union, Podesta criticized Comey's letter as \"long on innuendo, short on facts,\" noting that the FBI director could not even say if the emails contained significant information. Podesta argued that Comey's decision to disclose information about an ongoing investigation before determining if the newly-discovered emails provided any new insights was unprecedented and inappropriate.\n\n\"If they're not significant, they're not significant,\" said Podesta, who added that Comey \"should have read them first\" before making a bombshell announcement about the emails just days before the election. Podesta also stated that the email review was \"something that has been tossed into the middle of the campaign,\" and that the Clinton campaign would have preferred that the information not be disclosed.\n\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch reportedly objected to Comey's decision to announce the probe, according to Justice Department sources, because she felt it violated department policy to take steps that may interfere with an election.\n\nClinton campaign manager Robby Mook said he did not believe Comey's action would cost Clinton the election. Mook urged Comey to put more information about the emails \"out there on the table\" to put rumors and hypotheticals to rest.\n\nDonald Trump tweeted Sunday that Democratic criticism of Comey was hypocritical. Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, praised the FBI's decision to review the emails but sent an ambiguous message about how it might affect the election.\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine called Comey's letter \"extremely puzzling\" and a \"distraction\" in an interview with ABC News' This Week. Kaine questioned why Comey would release incomplete information about the emails just days before the election.\n\nPodesta said Huma Abedin, a longtime Clinton aide and adviser, has been fully cooperating with the FBI and remains on the campaign staff.\n\nKellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, praised Comey's decision to announce the review of the newly found emails. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also weighed in on the matter, with Johnson stating that the investigation had been \"bungled from the start\" and Schiff calling it a \"terrible error in judgement\" for Comey to release an ambiguous letter about the emails.",
    " Title: Tulsi Gabbard Garners Unexpected Attention in Democratic Primary Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the first Democratic primary debate, several candidates aimed to make a significant impact and gain national recognition. With a crowded stage of ten candidates, it was a challenge for many to stand out. However, a few managed to do so, with Sen. Cory Booker and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard being two of them.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, who was the frontrunner onstage, was the most searched candidate during the debate, but by the end of the night, Gabbard emerged as a surprising contender, alongside New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nDe Blasio, who attempted to position himself to the left of Warren, disrupted the debate format and frequently interrupted fellow candidates. On the other hand, Gabbard made headlines for her exchange with Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan over foreign policy, where she corrected Ryan for attributing the 9/11 attacks to the Taliban instead of al-Qaeda.\n\nThe increased interest in Gabbard was unexpected for many election watchers. However, a closer look at the number of views on each candidate's Wikipedia page from the past week reveals that Gabbard generated the second-highest number of views, trailing only Warren.\n\nWhen examining the past month of page views on Wikipedia, Gabbard's numbers are comparable to the frontrunners, and she is keeping pace with them, except for massive spikes for the leaders. When compared to another candidate polling in single digits, like Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Gabbard's totals are more than double.\n\nGoogle Trends data provides some insight into why people are searching for Gabbard. The past month of search data shows that, aside from her home state of Hawaii, it's people from New Hampshire and Iowa \u2013 the early primary states \u2013 who are curious about her.\n\nIt's important to note that this heightened interest in Gabbard does not necessarily mean she is a serious contender. Gabbard has been critical of President Obama's foreign policy, stating that his administration \"refuses to recognize\" that \"radical Islam\" is responsible for terrorism. She has also been criticized for expressing support for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIn conclusion, while Gabbard's performance in the debate may have caught some by surprise, her increased visibility and interest from primary states suggest that she may have a more significant impact on the race than initially anticipated. However, her controversial stances on foreign policy and terrorism may pose challenges for her campaign moving forward.",
    " Title: Progressives Struggle to Articulate Economic Benefits of Immigration as Critics Highlight Potential Harm\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate surrounding immigration, a notable disparity has emerged. While critics of immigration often present clear, tangible arguments detailing the perceived negative impacts of immigration, such as increased crime, lower wages, and job displacement, progressives have been criticized for their lack of a similarly succinct and compelling case for the economic benefits of immigration.\n\nAndrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group, notes this discrepancy, stating, \"People on the left have a hard time arguing why immigration is important to the country.\" He further explains that while the United States is still one of the most pro-immigrant societies globally, a coherent, cogent, and succinct political case has yet to be made.\n\nThe current focus on the border crisis has led to the often-overlooked aspects of legal immigration and its benefits being sidelined. A significant portion of immigrants reside in the U.S. legally, with the foreign-born share of the population nearing record highs. As restrictionists call for reductions in legal admissions, progressives must move beyond their anti-anti-immigrant stance to present a clear argument for the continued importance of immigration.\n\nTo understand the progressive perspective, it is essential to recognize their two-decade-long pursuit of legalization and the lingering bitterness from this struggle. The right tends to view the undocumented as invaders, while the left sees them as victims of poverty and violence. Moreover, they view undocumented immigrants as family and friends, with the average undocumented individual having lived in the U.S. for 15 years and many having American children. Progressives argue that deportation campaigns destabilize entire communities, causing harm to both immigrants and native-born citizens.\n\nIn order to sustain the current, prolonged era of mass migration in American history, progressives must articulate the economic benefits of immigration, in addition to addressing the humanitarian aspects. By doing so, they can help shape a more balanced and informed national conversation on immigration.",
    " Title: Left-Leaning Economists Call for Continued Direct Cash Payments to Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of 153 economists, many of whom lean towards the left, have signed a letter urging U.S. policymakers to continue providing direct cash payments to Americans until the economy recovers. The economists argue that these payments can improve financial security, boost consumer spending, and speed up the economic recovery.\n\nThe letter, organized by the Economic Security Project and The Justice Collaborative, suggests that the initial economic impact payments served as a lifeline for many during the pandemic, and that even as businesses reopen and jobs return, there will still be significant economic fallout. The signatories argue that demand will continue to lag if people do not have money to spend.\n\nThe group includes economists who have previously held positions in the Obama Administration, the Federal Reserve, and various academic institutions. Notable signatories include Jason Furman, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama Administration, Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist, and Indivar Dutta-Gupta, co-executive director at the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality.\n\nThe timing of the letter is significant, as the $600 supplement added to weekly unemployment benefits, which has reportedly discouraged millions of Americans from seeking employment, is set to expire at the end of the month. With jobs still scarce, jobless Americans may face a \"cash cliff\" without the additional support.\n\nCongressional lawmakers are currently on a two-week recess and will face pressure to make decisions when they reconvene in late July. As the U.S. faces a record budget deficit, the continued provision of direct cash payments could contribute to an already parabolic debt chart.\n\nThe letter's call for continued direct cash payments has sparked debate, with some arguing that the payments could exacerbate the economic problems they aim to solve. The effectiveness of such policies will likely be a topic of discussion as Congress reconvenes and considers further economic stimulus measures.",
    " Title: New York and California Face Potential Loss of Congressional Seats Due to Population Decline\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the liberal states of New York and California are set to lose congressional seats due to a significant population decline, according to the latest US Census Bureau population estimates. The Empire State and the Golden State are among 27 states and the District of Columbia that have experienced a net loss of residents due to domestic migration over the past two years.\n\nNew York, with its robust economy, is one of only 10 states to suffer a total population decline in 2018-19, marking its fourth consecutive annual decrease after five years of growth. The census data indicates that New York has experienced the largest population drop of any state. E.J. McMahon, author of the report and the Empire Center's director, told The New York Post, \"You'd think with a strong economy, New York wouldn't be losing population.\"\n\nNew York's population has remained stagnant over the past decade, with a modest increase of 75,459 residents since 2010, a growth rate of just 0.4 percent. This stagnation is likely to result in the loss of one or two congressional seats in the coming years. Staten Island Republican Councilman Joe Borelli attributes this trend to the high cost of living in New York, including taxes, regulations, and housing costs, which he says are making it difficult for residents to afford the American dream.\n\nCalifornia, too, is experiencing a slowdown in population growth, a development that may result in the loss of a congressional seat for the first time in the state's history. The Los Angeles Times reported that the state's economic challenges are driving people away. William Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told the newspaper that California's population migration could result in the loss of a seat in the US House of Representatives, as the state currently holds 53 seats.\n\nFrey's analysis of census data suggests that Texas may gain three seats after the 2020 decennial count, while states such as Arizona, Colorado, and Oregon may gain one seat apiece. The apportionment population count for each of the 50 states includes the state's total resident population\u2014citizens and non-citizens\u2014as well as a count of the overseas federal employees and their dependents who have that state listed as their home state in their employers' administrative records, according to the US Census Bureau.",
    " Title: Trump to Announce Executive Action on 2020 Census Citizenship Question Amidst Ongoing Legal Challenges\n\nPresident Donald Trump is set to announce an executive action regarding the inclusion of a citizenship question in the 2020 census, despite ongoing court challenges, according to two administration officials who spoke to Reuters on Thursday. The announcement is expected to be made during a news conference following a planned social media meeting this afternoon, with the event scheduled for approximately 5:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden or another location at the White House.\n\nThe administration's efforts to include the contentious question have faced legal obstacles due to challenges from several U.S. states and civil rights groups. Critics argue that inquiring about citizenship in the census discriminates against racial minorities and is intended to give Republicans an electoral advantage. Trump and his supporters, on the other hand, maintain that it is important to know the number of non-citizens residing in the country.\n\nThe specifics of the executive action are still being finalized, with the action likely to take the form of an executive order, one of the officials said. The administration's attempts to add the question to the nation's decennial population survey have been embroiled in a legal battle not only due to the opposition of the plaintiffs but also due to concerns over the Department of Justice's handling of the cases.\n\nThe case has already reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which last month ruled against Trump's initial attempt to add the question, finding the administration's rationale to be \"contrived\" but leaving open the possibility of its addition if officials could provide a new explanation. Since then, the Justice Department has sought to replace the legal team handling the case, with a second federal judge rejecting the department's efforts on Wednesday, requiring detailed reasoning for the change.\n\nAttorneys within the Trump administration have been studying the census issue and intend to keep the president's order within the parameters set by the Supreme Court decision. However, they are aware that any action taken is likely to face further legal challenges. The U.S. Constitution assigns the responsibility of overseeing the census to Congress, which could complicate any effort to add the question via presidential decree.\n\nTrump remains determined to have the question included in the census, despite the legal challenges. The census is used to determine the number of seats each state receives in the U.S. House of Representatives and also affects the distribution of billions of dollars in federal funds across the country.",
    " Title: Congressional Republicans Push for Medicare and Medicaid Cuts in Fiscal Cliff Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing negotiations to address the fiscal cliff and deficit reduction, Congressional Republicans are advocating for significant cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. This stance, which targets two programs that have been instrumental in public welfare for the past half-century, is largely a political move.\n\nPostelection polls indicate that large majorities of voters for both President Obama and Mitt Romney opposed large Medicare cuts as a means to reduce the budget deficit. The Obama administration has already committed to extracting over $1 trillion in savings from these programs over the next decade. With limited room for further cuts without adversely affecting the most vulnerable Americans, the focus shifts towards finding alternative methods for deficit reduction.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act includes provisions that will reduce projected Medicare spending by $716 billion over 10 years. These savings are primarily achieved through reducing the annual increases in Medicare reimbursements for hospitals, nursing homes, and other healthcare providers, as well as by reducing unjustified subsidies paid to private Medicare Advantage plans. During the campaign, the Romney-Ryan ticket criticized the president for making such a significant cut and even promised to restore all of it.\n\nIn addition to these savings, President Obama, in his budget for fiscal year 2013, proposed cutting another $340 billion from Medicare spending over 10 years. This was achieved through tactics like requiring drugmakers to pay rebates to Medicare in some circumstances, reducing payments to some healthcare providers for treating patients just released from the hospital, reducing coverage of bad debts that hospitals and skilled nursing homes have failed to collect from patients, and charging higher premiums to high-income beneficiaries.\n\nThese cuts, as part of a larger budget deal to avert the fiscal cliff, are generally acceptable. There may be room to extract additional savings from healthcare providers as long as their fiscal health is not compromised. However, beyond that, there are very limited options for further reducing Medicare or Medicaid spending. The focus now shifts towards finding alternative methods for deficit reduction, ensuring the continued support and welfare of America's most vulnerable citizens.",
    " Title: Senate Impeachment Trial Resumes: Final Arguments, Vote on Trump's Conviction or Acquittal Scheduled\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump resumes on Monday at 11 a.m. EST, both the House impeachment managers and Trump's legal team will present their closing arguments. The trial will conclude with senators delivering speeches explaining their views on the charges before voting on Wednesday to acquit or convict Trump.\n\nThe two articles of impeachment, approved by the Democratic-controlled House on Dec. 18, accuse Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The allegations stem from claims that Trump held up military aid to pressure Ukraine into announcing investigations for his political benefit, including one involving former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic rival in the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has maintained his innocence, arguing that he was acting to combat corruption. His defense team has contended that the House failed to prove its case, that the abuse of power charge is too subjective, and that the obstruction of Congress charge infringes on the president's right to claim executive privilege in court. Attorney Alan Dershowitz, a member of Trump's defense team, has argued that even if the allegations were true, they were not impeachable because they did not constitute a crime.\n\nLast week, the Senate voted 51-49 against issuing subpoenas for additional witnesses and documents, which would have delayed the trial's conclusion.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the lead House impeachment manager, said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that Democrats had \"proved the corrupt scheme that they charged in the articles of impeachment.\" Schiff argued that the president's impeachment was important because it \"helped to slow the momentum away from our democratic values.\"\n\nSenators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said that while Trump's actions were not impeachable, he should have gone through the Department of Justice if he had concerns about Biden and his son's former position on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has pledged to investigate Joe Biden's actions in Ukraine, stating that \"the day of reckoning is coming for congressional and Senate oversight of Joe Biden.\" Graham plans to bring in State Department officials to ask why they did not address the apparent conflict of interests Joe Biden had due to his son's position on Burisma's board.\n\nSenator Ernst has expressed concern that if Biden were to become president, there would be voices calling for his removal due to Hunter Biden's connection to Burisma.\n\nThe Senate will vote on Wednesday to acquit or convict Trump, with a 53-47 Republican majority and a two-thirds vote needed for conviction, it is almost certain the president will be acquitted. The trial will continue to unfold over the coming days, with senators delivering their final arguments and speeches on Monday.",
    " Title: \"Dennis Prager Questions Democratic Opposition to Border Wall: Are They Deluded or Lying?\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent opinion piece, conservative commentator Dennis Prager questions the motivations behind the Democratic opposition to building a wall on America's southern border. Prager suggests that the three main reasons Democrats and others on the left have given for their opposition are false, amounting to lies.\n\nPrager, a nationally syndicated radio host and columnist, argues that these falsehoods raise the question of whether Democrats and leftists genuinely believe these lies or if they are knowingly spreading them for political gain.\n\nThe article highlights several instances where Prager questions the beliefs of his left-wing professors at Columbia University, suggesting they may have been misinformed or deliberately misleading in their teachings. He questions their views on the Cold War, gender, campus rape culture, and the concept of race.\n\nPrager also questions the Democrats' claims that a border wall would be ineffective and too expensive. He points out that the cost of the proposed wall is a small fraction of the U.S. federal spending and that many Democrats, including current senators, have supported border fencing in the past.\n\nThe article further questions the moral argument against the wall, suggesting that if Democrats and leftists find physical barriers around homes or communities moral, they should also find a wall protecting America equally so. Prager argues that the left's opposition to the wall is not based on truth but rather on a desire to humiliate the President of the United States.\n\nThe article concludes with a reminder that the opinions expressed are Prager's own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com. Prager's latest book, \"The Rational Bible,\" was published by Regnery in April 2018. He can be contacted at dennisprager.com.",
    " Title: The Importance of Feeling Connected: A Key Element to a Fulfilling Life, According to Social Psychologist Jonathan Haidt\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the quest for a meaningful and fulfilling life, one piece of advice often overlooked is the need to feel connected to something larger than oneself. This concept, central to ancient religions and modern social-justice movements, is a non-negotiable aspect of human existence, according to research in behavioral science.\n\nIn his book, \"The Happiness Hypothesis,\" NYU social psychologist Jonathan Haidt identifies this connection as one of the three major themes of a fulfilling life. He compares humans to plants, requiring sun, water, and good soil to thrive, and people needing love, work, and a connection to something larger.\n\nHaidt further elaborates on his website that humans, in a sense, are like bees, needing to be part of a larger hive or a larger body to make sense of their lives. In modern living, individuals have broken free from the hive, living independently. This, Haidt suggests, may be the reason many people question the purpose or meaning of life.\n\nTo fulfill this need, Haidt recommends joining a cause or organization with a noble purpose. Volunteer work, particularly with a rich history, traditions, and rituals, can provide a sense of 'vital engagement.' This term, coined by Haidt, refers to the crucial relationship between a person and their surroundings.\n\nHaidt encourages striving for the right relationships between oneself and others, oneself and work, and oneself and something larger than oneself. According to him, if these relationships are right, a sense of purpose and meaning will emerge.\n\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of meaning seems to be a fitting theme for 2017, as suggested by Haidt. By joining a cause or organization with a noble purpose, individuals can find a sense of belonging and contribute to something larger than themselves, potentially leading to a more fulfilling and meaningful life.",
    " Title: Political Observers Predict Mitt Romney Tsunami in Upcoming Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2012 Presidential Election approaches, a wave of anti-debt and anti-big-government sentiment is building, according to some political observers. This wave, reminiscent of the 2010 midterm elections that saw a significant shift towards the Republican Party, is predicted to carry Mitt Romney into the Oval Office, according to veteran Republican campaign pollster John McLaughlin.\n\nMcLaughlin, predicting a Romney victory on Tuesday, stated, \"Romney has surged in all the target states. The undecided vote is not really undecided. They overwhelmingly disapprove of the job the president has done and will largely vote against the incumbent. It\u2019s a hidden vote that will vote against the president.\"\n\nThis prediction contradicts most polling, which shows a tight national race between Romney and President Obama, and state polls that show Obama leading in most battleground states. The only poll that shows Romney clearly winning is the respected Gallup national tracking poll of likely voters, which gives the Republican nominee a 5 percentage-point advantage.\n\nGallup, who correctly predicted the 2010 wave that propelled the GOP to capture more than five dozen House seats, stated in 2010, \"The 2010 elections could be historic from the standpoint of producing unusually large Republican gains in Congress. But the elections are already historic for a midterm election in the levels of enthusiasm Americans, and particularly, Republicans, have for voting this year.\"\n\nMr. McLaughlin, the GOP pollster, sees the same enthusiasm for Republicans this year, and so do some leaders of the tea party, which harnessed voters' resentment against spending and government expansion. Mark Meckler, co-founder and former national coordinator of the National Tea Party Patriots, predicts a Romney win by 6 percentage points.\n\nToby Marie Walker, a tea party coordinator in Waco, Texas, sees the same momentum, predicting Romney will receive 54% of the national vote. \"I\u2019m doing a lot of phone calls talking to independents in other states,\" said Ms. Walker. \"I\u2019ve seen a shift in the past 30 days, going from an even split to 60 [percent] to 70 percent saying they have no confidence in Obama. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m hearing from pollsters and pundits but from real people.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone shares this optimism. Alaska tea partyer David Eastman waves off the prospects of a Romney tsunami, stating, \"For my own part, anti-big-government voters do not seem overly enthused by a Romney campaign that is anti-big government only insofar as it is contrasted with the excesses of the present administration.\"\n\nRepublican pollster Whit Ayres sees little evidence of a congressional wave this time, stating, \"Nevertheless, in the presidential race, independents who had voted by an 8-point margin for Obama are now voting against Obama by double digits.\"\n\nNate Silver, who writes the FiveThirtyEight blog at The New York Times, said the election is moving in President Obama's direction. He stated, \"Just about every method for evaluating the election based on state polls seems to hint at a very slight lead in the popular vote, as well as an Electoral College victory, for President Obama.\"\n\nDespite this, McLaughlin believes the backlash against President Obama from Hurricane Sandy is overriding all that. \"Those without power who are cutting down trees in the Northeast and are very upset post-hurricane\u2014if they lack power through Election Day\u2014they will not be kind to the incumbent president or his party,\" he said.",
    " Title: \"Expanding the Scope of Benghazi Hearings: A Call for a Broader Inquiry into U.S. Policy in the Arab World\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Secretary Hillary Clinton testifies before Congress regarding the events in Benghazi, it is crucial to broaden the scope of the open hearings to discuss the administration's policy towards the Arab world. The Arab Spring, once hailed as a success, has led to political and economic chaos in many countries, and it is essential to understand the reasons behind this shift.\n\nTwo years ago, the Middle East and North Africa were relatively calm and stable, with pro-American dictators in power. Egypt, for instance, was experiencing an 8% economic growth rate before the ousting of President Mubarak. Today, the entire region is in upheaval, with the threat of another Arab-Israeli war looming, Al Qaeda expanding its reach, and anti-Americanism on the rise.\n\nIn light of this, the Senate and Congress should use this opportunity to question Secretary Clinton on ten critical issues:\n\n1. The Administration's relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and the rise of Al Qaeda in the Sinai Peninsula.\n2. The handling of Qaddafi's weapons caches in Libya.\n3. The potential risks of chemical weapons falling into the hands of terrorists in Syria.\n4. The lack of accountability for the attacks in Benghazi.\n5. The effectiveness of the 'light footprint' strategy in consolidating control and establishing security in Arab Spring countries.\n6. The safety of American civilians left behind in Iraq and Afghanistan after troop withdrawals.\n7. The Administration's relationship with Israel, America's long-time ally in the region.\n8. Potential responses to Iran's nuclear ambitions if sanctions prove insufficient.\n9. Contingency plans for rescuing Americans in North African and Middle Eastern countries.\n10. The expansion of the drone wars to North Africa, the Middle East, and the Saudi Peninsula.\n\nSecretary Clinton's testimony provides a unique opportunity to gain insight into the administration's policies and actions in the Arab world. If the Senate and Congress fail to get answers now, they may never have the chance again. The question remains: who will be held accountable for the current state of the Arab world in the coming years? It is crucial to hold Secretary Clinton accountable now.",
    " Title: Fox News Allegations on Sequester Misrepresent Historical Facts, Ignore Republican Support for Budget Control Act of 2011\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent series of reports on Fox News' Special Report with Bret Baier, the network has been accused of misrepresenting the historical facts surrounding the across-the-board automatic spending cuts known as the sequester. The reports have reinforced a right-wing narrative that places blame for these cuts on President Obama, while omitting the fact that a majority of Republicans in both the House and Senate voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011, which included the sequester.\n\nIndeed, Republican leaders at the time celebrated the law as a significant step forward in reducing the deficit. In a press release shortly after the Senate passed the Budget Control Act in August 2011, House Speaker John Boehner hailed the law as \"a positive step forward that begins to rein in federal spending.\" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor touted the law as a \"significant move\" and said it \"will finally begin to change the way Washington spends taxpayer dollars.\" House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan declared the law a \"victory for those committed to controlling government spending and growing our economy.\"\n\nIn total, 174 Republican representatives and 28 Republican senators\u2014a majority of Republicans in both chambers\u2014voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011. However, in recent weeks, Fox News and other right-wing media outlets have been aggressively pushing myths about the sequester, including the false narrative that President Obama is single-handedly responsible for the looming spending cuts.\n\nOn Wednesday's edition of Special Report, Fox News' chief White House correspondent Ed Henry framed a report on the sequester around the narrative that it was an Obama initiative and quoted Republican Congressman Randy Forbes blaming Obama for it. Though the report included Democratic Sen. Max Baucus saying that Congress shares the blame for the automatic cuts, Henry did not point out that Republicans not only actively supported the idea but overwhelmingly voted for the law.\n\nIn a later segment during the same show, Fox again covered up Republican support for the sequester. Discussing the consequences of the spending cuts, chief political correspondent Carl Cameron said, \"President Obama, who first proposed the sequester, and his party, are trying to blame the GOP for dire economic consequences, in particular to the military. But in 2009 he proposed spending $14 billion less than what the military is currently budgeted for should sequester happen.\" Cameron did not mention the Republican support.\n\nThe misrepresentation of historical facts by Fox News and other right-wing media outlets is a concerning development, as it distorts the public's understanding of the political landscape and the roles that different parties played in the passage of the Budget Control Act of 2011. It is essential for media outlets to accurately report on political events and to avoid promoting false narratives that serve to mislead the public.",
    " Title: Lessons from the Wisconsin Recall Election: Insights from the Democratic Grassroots\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Wisconsin recall election, where Republican Governor Scott Walker comfortably fended off Democratic attempts to unseat him, political analysts and activists have been dissecting the results to understand the reasons behind the Democratic loss. NPR's senior Washington editor, Ron Elving, provided insights on the election's outcome, while this article focuses on the perspectives of Democratic activists in Waukesha, Wisconsin, who shared their thoughts on the factors that contributed to their hard-fought effort's failure and the lessons they learned.\n\nThe mood among these activists, who were met prior to the election in March, was somber and reflective after the election results. They expressed feelings of exhaustion, disappointment, and a sense of combativeness, but also a willingness to learn from the experience.\n\nOne key takeaway from the conversation was the realization that assumptions about union households should be avoided. The exit poll data showed that 38% of voters with a labor union member in the family voted for Walker, a statistic that left the activists stunned. Kristin Hansen, a volunteer with Organizing for America, Obama's re-election organization, expressed her surprise, stating, \"You can't assume just because a person is a union member, they are also a Democrat.\"\n\nAnother issue that emerged was the impact of stricter voting registration laws enacted by the GOP-controlled Legislature since Walker's election in 2010. These changes limited opportunities for voter registration, expanded blackout days for voter registration efforts, and set earlier deadlines for absentee or early voting. The new rules meant that Democrats had just eight days after Tom Barrett's primary win in which to register new voters.\n\nThe activists also acknowledged the real sentiment among voters against recalls, with fewer than a third of voters thinking recalls were appropriate for any reason, and 60% saying they were only appropriate for \"official misconduct.\" They felt that the Democratic Party and the Obama campaign did not adequately address this sentiment or provide talking points to combat it.\n\nAnother area of concern was the outreach to Hispanic and first-time voters. The local Obama campaign only recently brought on its first bilingual field organizer in the Waukesha area, where Republicans have made strong inroads with the Latino community. The activists agreed that more focus should have been placed on the half a million fewer voters who did not vote in the 2012 election.\n\nIn conclusion, the activists expressed a sense of frustration and a desire to learn from their mistakes. They acknowledged the need to avoid assumptions about union households, address the sentiment against recalls, and prioritize outreach to Hispanic and first-time voters. Despite their disappointment, they remained hopeful, with Hansen stating, \"More than a million people voted against Scott Walker. I hope he remembers that.\"",
    " Title: West Africa's Ebola Battle: Training Healthcare Workers in Monrovia for Ebola Treatment\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Monrovia, efforts are underway to combat the ongoing Ebola outbreak, with a particular focus on training local healthcare workers to safely manage patients infected with the deadly virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has transformed a two-story concrete hotel into a mock Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU), where trainees are learning the intricacies of handling Ebola patients.\n\nOn a recent day, trainees dressed in white Tyvek suits, gloves, goggles, and face masks were simulating the care of an Ebola patient. The exercise, part of a one-week course, was designed to prepare new workers for the challenges they will face in an actual Ebola ward. Dr. Srinivas Murthy, an infectious disease specialist from the University of British Columbia, is one of the WHO staff guiding the trainees.\n\nThe course aims to teach trainees how to protect themselves around highly infectious patients. \"Who got sprayed with blood?\" Murthy asked, \"If you're actively doing something else, you can continue to do those things. And then when the hygienist is available and you have a moment, you can have it sprayed down.\"\n\nThis group of trainees is on their last day of the course. They will spend the following week shadowing the staff inside a real Ebola ward before they are certified to work in the new treatment units. Murthy emphasizes that teaching this group how to protect themselves around highly infectious patients is the most important lesson of the course.\n\nThe WHO hopes to train several thousand new workers in the coming months. This second group of trainees consists of 72 individuals, 40 of whom are health care workers of some sort: doctors, nurses, physician's assistants, and even medical students. The remaining 32 are hygienists who will be in charge of cleaning and disinfecting the Ebola wards.\n\nAs the trainees move through the mock ETU, many of them struggle with their protective gear. Goggles fog up, gloves tear, and surgical masks slip. Sweat drips around the edges of their masks. The team spends two hours tending to \"patients\" in this staged ward, culminating in the disposal of a corpse\u2014a leggy female mannequin.\n\nAfter the team disposes of the body, they head to the exit, where they are sprayed off with a chlorine solution. Taking off the protective gear also must be done carefully to ensure no exposure to the virus.\n\nDr. Patrick Lahai Kamara, one of the trainees, is soaked in sweat as he steps out of the mock treatment unit. \"It's not easy; it's very hot,\" he says. \"Little by little, we'll get used to it.\"\n\nKamara, a recent medical school graduate, has been working at Redemption Hospital in Monrovia but has not treated Ebola cases. Despite the high number of healthcare workers who have died during this outbreak, Kamara feels an obligation to treat Ebola patients. \"Nobody is happy for what happened to the doctors that have died,\" he says. \"But it's just like the soldiers; whenever there's war in the country, the first people you think that will go and fight for the nation are the soldiers. In time of health crisis, I think we physicians, we should be the ones on the front line.\"\n\nAs more Ebola treatment units are built, Liberia needs to find thousands of other workers who are also willing to take that risk.",
    " Title: Dalits in India Call for Acknowledgement of Centuries of Oppression, Citing Parallels with U.S. Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the anti-racism protests in the United States, India's Dalit community, historically referred to as \"untouchables,\" has called for recognition of the centuries of oppression they have endured. Dalits, who are situated outside the Hindu caste hierarchy, have faced violence, segregation, and exclusion from various aspects of society, including being barred from having their shadows touch those of people from more privileged castes.\n\nDalit campaigners have expressed solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, sparked by the death of George Floyd, and hope that it will ignite a similar conversation in India. Omprakash Mahato, president of the Birsa Ambedkar Phule Students Association, a Dalit organization at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, stated, \"We extend our solidarity because we feel their pain and have faced discrimination ourselves.\"\n\nIndia outlawed discrimination based on caste in 1955, but ancient biases against Dalits and members of less privileged Hindu caste groups persist, making it difficult for them to access education, jobs, and housing. Mahato emphasized, \"In India, people need to admit their role in everyday discrimination faced by Dalits and only then can a dialogue for change be initiated. We hope what they are seeing unfolding globally will lead to soul searching.\"\n\nDalits and scheduled tribes, Indigenous peoples who are often isolated or disadvantaged, make up about a quarter of India's population of 1.3 billion. Ruth Manorama, who works for the rights of Dalit women, told Reuters, \"Indian Dalits have historically learned a lot from the struggle of the African Americans.\" She added, \"This is a good moment to challenge the narrative in India also and talk about the age-old repression of Dalits, which is visible even during the COVID-19 pandemic with discrimination denying people aid.\"\n\nDalits were among the worst-hit by India's strict lockdown, often having to wait longer for their turn to receive food or financial aid at local distribution points, and even being turned away. About 300 people have signed a Change.org petition emphasizing that \"the lives of Dalits and minorities matter too\" and urging Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to \"admit... that caste discrimination is included in racial discrimination.\" Henri Tiphagne of People's Watch, a charity backing the petition, stated, \"It is a good time for people in India to understand and to point out to the government that racial discrimination is not only what you see in America, but it is the same as how so-called 'untouchables' are treated in India.\"",
    " Title: Trump and McMaster Disagree on Russian Interference in 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump and his National Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster, appear to have differing views on the issue of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump took to Twitter to criticize McMaster, stating that he \"forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians.\" McMaster's comments were made on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference, where he declared that it is now \"incontrovertible\" that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nMcMaster's remarks came a day after a federal grand jury indicted more than a dozen Russians in connection with the interference. In his address, McMaster emphasized the need for the West to come together to defend itself against such cyber threats, citing the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats as an example of this effort.\n\nIn contrast, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the indictment, calling it \"just blabber.\" Lavrov attempted to bolster his case that Russia has done nothing wrong by citing Vice President Mike Pence's earlier assessment of the FBI investigation. However, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has stated that the intelligence community did not make a judgment as to whether there was or was not an impact on the election.\n\nPresident Trump, in a separate tweet on Sunday, seemed to deny ever denying Russia's involvement in the election, stating, \"I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said 'it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.' The Russian 'hoax' was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!\"\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the investigation, has stated that there is \"no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity\" and \"no allegation that this activity actually altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\"\n\nIn his tweet, President Trump also implied that the investigation itself plays into Russia's plans, stating, \"If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U.S., then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!\"",
    " Title: Parkland Student Activists Launch Nationwide Bus Tour for Gun Control Advocacy and Voter Registration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe student gun control activists from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, who gained prominence following the mass shooting at their school in February, will embark on a 70-stop bus tour across 20 states starting Monday. The tour, titled \"March for Our Lives: Road to Change,\" will be led by David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez, who have emerged as the de facto spokespeople for the youth gun control movement.\n\nIn an interview with Axios, Hogg, who graduated on Sunday along with Gonzalez and their fellow Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School seniors, expressed his sentiments, stating, \"I'm glad I'm getting my diploma and not my death certificate.\" Gonzalez, who plans to attend the New College of Florida in the fall, believes the tour will help increase support for the youth gun control movement among lawmakers who are concerned about the political implications of opposing a coalition of young people.\n\nGonzalez stated, \"If you don't support this, it'll look like you're going against kids.\" The nationwide tour will be accompanied by a separate Florida-specific tour featuring stops in all of the state's congressional districts. As the Parkland students' home state, Florida has been a significant focus of their voter registration and gun control awareness campaigns in recent months. However, the results have not been encouraging: in six of Florida's seven largest counties, including Broward county where the shooting occurred, youth voter registration is down relative to 2014.\n\nThe student activists experienced a surge of enthusiasm in the wake of the shooting, but public support for gun control as the nation's top political priority has decreased significantly since then. According to an April Gallup poll, only six percent of respondents listed gun control as the most important problem facing the U.S., down from 13 percent in March. The tour aims to reignite the conversation and mobilize support for stricter gun control legislation.",
    " Title: House Republicans Initiate Contempt Proceedings Against Attorney General Eric Holder Over Fast and Furious\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that escalates the ongoing separation-of-powers battle between the House of Representatives and the Obama administration, House Republicans have announced their intention to hold Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt of Congress over the Fast and Furious gun-walking operation.\n\nWith the backing of Republican leaders, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell E. Issa will hold a vote next week to recommend contempt proceedings, and a House floor vote could follow shortly thereafter as the GOP seeks to maintain pressure on President Obama ahead of the November elections.\n\nThe Justice Department, in response, dismissed the move as political, stating that it had been close to reaching an agreement to share some of the information that the Oversight Committee is seeking. However, House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, argued that Attorney General Holder has had ample opportunities to comply.\n\n\"The Justice Department is out of excuses,\" Mr. Boehner said in a statement. \"Either the Justice Department turns over the information requested, or Congress will have no choice but to move forward with holding the attorney general in contemn for obstructing an ongoing investigation.\"\n\nTrust between both parties has eroded, with Democrats claiming that the GOP is pursuing a political agenda to discredit President Obama, while Republicans point to repeated denials and inaccurate information provided by the administration.\n\nFast and Furious, an operation that allowed guns to be sold to straw purchasers in the U.S., knowing they were being sent across the border to Mexican cartels, has been acknowledged by both Holder and President Obama as having fundamental flaws. However, they maintain that the operation was primarily handled by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives employees, with minimal oversight from the Justice Department.\n\nThe department initially denied many details of the operation, including the fact that guns were knowingly \"walked\" without being tracked. In December, the department withdrew an inaccurate letter sent to Congress, acknowledging these details.\n\nChairman Issa is seeking to obtain documents that he believes would shed light on how the Justice Department changed its stance on these details and the level of accountability that should be assigned for the ill-conceived program. The committee issued a subpoena for these documents in October, and Issa stated on Monday that the Justice Department is still withholding the information.\n\n\"Specifically, the Justice Department has refused to turn over critical documents on the grounds that they show internal department deliberations and were created after February 4, 2011\u2014the date Justice issued a false denial to Congress,\" said Issa, California Republican. \"Contempt will focus on the failure to provide these post February 4th documents.\"\n\nIssa asserted that the Justice Department has not provided any valid reasons for withholding the information. Spokeswoman for Attorney General Holder described the contempt proceedings as \"political games\" that interrupted what she claimed had been productive talks on turning over information.\n\nDeputy Attorney General James M. Cole stated that he has offered to meet with Issa to negotiate a compromise on documents, but that Issa has not responded to this request.\n\n\"The conversations between our staffs have been productive, and we believe that an amicable resolution of these matters is achievable,\" said Cole in a letter on Monday afternoon. \"Because of this, the committee's decision to set a hearing on its draft contempt resolution is premature.\"\n\nDuring the operation, nearly 2,000 guns were sold to straw purchasers with the expectation that they would be trafficked across the border to the Sinaloa Cartel. ATF agents lost track of the guns\u2014something that all sides now agree was a significant planning failure\u2014and the guns began to turn up at crime scenes, including at least two weapons found at the scene of a shootout that killed U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December 2010.\n\nAttorney General Holder took steps in 2011 to shut down the program and requested an internal audit to hold employees accountable. Last week, Holder told another House panel that he would be willing to sit down with Speaker Boehner to try to work out a solution that would allow the documents to be reviewed but would not impede the executive branch's deliberative process.\n\nThis is the eighth time that Holder has appeared before Congress to discuss Fast and Furious, and the administration claims it has already turned over more than 7,000 pages of documents. However, Issa's staff asserts that Holder and the department have consistently resisted providing information. Issa has accused top officials of a pattern of misleading, culminating in the letter that the department had to withdraw in December after the committee's investigation revealed its claims to be untrue.\n\nThe House is currently on recess, and contempt proceedings will resume next week. This will mark the first time the Obama administration has faced contempt of Congress proceedings. In 2008, the House approved a contempt resolution against former White House lawyer Harriet Miers, seeking an on-the-record sworn interview with her regarding her role in the firings of U.S. attorneys. Miers refused an on-the-record sworn interview with congressional investigators. The House voted 223-32 to hold her in contempt, with most Republicans abstaining from the vote. At the same time, former White House political adviser Karl Rove was refusing to be interviewed by the House Judiciary Committee. That matter never reached the House floor. In 2009, after President George W. Bush left office, Democrats and former Bush officials reached an agreement to produce documents and on-the-record testimony.",
    " Title: Philanthropist Patty Quillin Donates $1.5 Million to Support Criminal Justice Reform in Los Angeles County\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move towards criminal justice reform, philanthropist Patty Quillin, the wife of Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, has donated at least $1.5 million to support efforts aimed at transforming the Los Angeles County's criminal justice system. Quillin, a resident of Santa Cruz, has contributed $1 million to a group campaigning for the replacement of incumbent Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey with a more progressive prosecutor. She has also donated $500,000 to a voter referendum (Measure R) that seeks to implement sweeping changes for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and reduce the jail population.\n\nQuillin's $1 million donation was directed towards an independent expenditure (IE) committee backing former San Francisco District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n, a reform-minded prosecutor known for his progressive policies during his tenure in San Francisco. Gasc\u00f3n, who has stepped down and is running to become L.A. County's top law enforcement official, is supported by a committee that includes Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors.\n\nThe race for Los Angeles County District Attorney is heating up, with George Gasc\u00f3n, former public defender Rachel Rossi, and incumbent Jackie Lacey vying for the position. If no candidate secures more than 50% of the votes in the primary election on March 3, the top two vote-getters will compete in a runoff in November.\n\nThe pro-Gasc\u00f3n IE's top individual donors, apart from Quillin, include philanthropic women from the Bay Area, such as Liz Simons, the daughter of a retired hedge fund billionaire, who donated $500,000 last month. Quillin is the director of a fund at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a group that has awarded over $6 billion in grants since its inception in 2007.\n\nThe Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University has identified Quillin as a financial supporter of \"The Appeal,\" a nonprofit publication focusing on local prosecutors and criminal justice policies. The outlet has published several articles critical of D.A. Lacey, with Gasc\u00f3n and his campaign publicizing some of the stories on social media.\n\nMeanwhile, the Los Angeles Police Protective League, representing rank-and-file LAPD officers, has directed $1 million into its political action committee opposing Gasc\u00f3n. The group recently released a 30-second television ad that began airing on Friday, focusing on Gasc\u00f3n's performance as San Francisco's District Attorney. The cop union has been criticized for labeling the ad as \"racist\" by the Gasc\u00f3n campaign.\n\nAs the race for Los Angeles County District Attorney heats up, the focus remains on the candidates' policies and their ability to implement meaningful change in the criminal justice system. The primary election on March 3 will be a significant step towards determining the future of the county's law enforcement and prosecutorial system.",
    " Title: Forensic Pathologist Suggests Jeffrey Epstein's Death Was Homicide, Raises Questions About Autopsy Findings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on Fox News, former New York City Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Baden, who observed Jeffrey Epstein's autopsy at the request of Epstein's brother, Mark Epstein, asserted that the evidence points towards homicide rather than suicide.\n\nBaden, a forensic pathologist, stated that the wounds found during the autopsy were \"more consistent with ligature homicidal strangulation\" than suicide. He pointed to two fractures on either side of Epstein's larynx and one on the hyoid bone, above the pedophile's Adam's apple, as evidence.\n\n\"Hanging does not cause these broken bones, and homicide does,\" Baden insisted. \"A huge amount of pressure was applied.\"\n\nBaden also called for federal prosecutors to release the findings from DNA samples taken during the autopsy, including information about whose DNA was found on the torn strips of orange sheets used as a makeshift noose. He noted that the DNA from fingernail clippings taken from Epstein has not been released either.\n\nThe pathologist also questioned the \"total breakdown in security\" surrounding Epstein's death, citing the \"extremely unlikely\" coincidence of two guards falling asleep while video cameras in Epstein's cell and hallway were also not working.\n\n\"Occasionally a guard falls asleep\u2014never two guards at the same time,\" Baden said. \"The issue would be, did somebody come in and cause his death?\"\n\nBaden admitted that there would be no shortage of people who might want to kill Epstein, given the numerous sex crime allegations against him and the opportunity to \"make a name for themselves.\" However, he stressed that \"a number of people had to be involved if this was a homicide.\"\n\nEpstein's death has been ruled a suicide by the medical examiner's office, but Baden's comments have raised questions about the official ruling and called for further investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death.",
    " Title: Colin Kaepernick Files Grievance Against NFL Team Owners Over Alleged Conspiracy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has filed a grievance against NFL team owners, alleging a conspiracy not to hire him due to his protests against racial injustice. Kaepernick, who turned 29 this year, has been without a team since he opted out of his contract with the 49ers in March.\n\nThe protests, which began in August 2016 with Kaepernick sitting during the national anthem, gained momentum when he switched to kneeling instead. This move was followed by other players, and the protests spread further in September, following criticism from President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, Kaepernick's lawyers wrote, \"We can confirm that this morning we filed a grievance under the CBA on behalf of Colin Kaepernick. This was done only after pursuing every possible avenue with all NFL teams and their executives.\"\n\nThe statement continued, \"If the NFL (as well as all professional sports leagues) is to remain a meritocracy, then principled and peaceful political protest - which the owners themselves made great theatre imitating weeks ago - should not be punished and athletes should not be denied employment.\"\n\nThe statement further emphasized, \"Such a precedent threatens all patriotic Americans and harkens back to our darkest days as a nation. Protecting all athletes from such collusive conduct is what compelled Mr. Kaepernick to file his grievance.\"\n\nKaepernick's goal, according to the statement, is to \"be treated fairly by the league he performed at the highest level for and to return to the football playing field.\"\n\nRobert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, told BBC Sport last week that he had \"never heard anyone talking about excluding\" Kaepernick. However, some players from the 49ers knelt during the anthem before their match on Sunday, the first time they played since US Vice-President Mike Pence walked out of their game in Indianapolis, after several members of the team did not stand.\n\nKaepernick started the NFL's \"take a knee\" protest movement in 2016, but many feel he has paid a high price for his political stance. After opting out of the final year of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers (the team said he would have been dropped regardless), he hasn't been picked up by another organization. This is despite injuries to quarterbacks such as Marcus Mariota at the Tennessee Titans. Kaepernick had to watch on as others were given a trial. It seems he's grown tired of this situation and is now taking direct action.",
    " Title: U.S.-China Trade War to Impact Apple Inc. as Tariffs Take Effect\n\nThe ongoing trade war between the United States and China will impact Apple Inc., the largest U.S. technology company, as tariffs on hundreds of products are set to take effect this weekend. The tariffs, which were officially entered into the Federal Register on Friday, will affect popular consumer gadgets and potentially disrupt a global supply chain.\n\nThe 15% tariffs, as per the order, will be implemented at 12:01 a.m. local time on Sunday in Washington. This will affect products entering the U.S. or being withdrawn from warehouses for consumption in the U.S.\n\nOne analyst expressed hope for a last-minute reprieve, stating that the U.S. adding tariffs to any Apple product without some form of offset could have significant negative effects. However, this reprieve seemed unlikely as President Donald Trump showed little sign of backing down.\n\nThe following is a list of Apple products that will be hit by the 15% tariffs starting this weekend:\n\n1. Nand flash, a key storage component for iPhones\n2. Apple wearable gadgets\n\nThe iPhone, which contributes more than half of Apple's revenue, will not face the 15% tariff until December 15. However, other hardware products, which made up at least 10% of sales in the company's 2018 fiscal year, will have to absorb the 15% import levy that kicks in on Sunday.\n\nIt remains unclear if Apple will raise product prices or assume the cost of the tariffs. The company, one of the world's most profitable, maintains higher margins than most other consumer hardware makers.\n\nA 15% tariff on Apple wearable gadgets sold in the U.S. could potentially reduce earnings by 5 cents to 10 cents a share per year, according to Gene Munster of Loup Ventures. Analysts, on average, estimate Apple's adjusted profit will be $11.63 a share in the 2019 fiscal year.\n\nApple has been lobbying Trump for more than a year to avoid tariffs. During a recent dinner with the president at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook voiced concerns that Apple's main rival Samsung Electronics Co. would gain an edge because its products won't be subject to the levies.\n\nJust days after that dinner, Trump announced that tariffs on $300 billion of goods from China would be 15%, up from 10%. These tariffs will be implemented in two tranches, with the first batch taking effect on September 1.\n\nApple spent decades building one of the largest supply chains in the world.

This new strategy, spearheaded by several states, aims to leverage technology to match potential residents with communities that offer the best quality of life.\n\nThe concept, inspired by the success of dating websites, uses algorithms to find and rank connections between people and communities. These algorithms consider user preferences about the qualities they are most keen to find in a community - affordable housing, healthcare, schools, transportation, proximity to recreation, and low taxes, among others.\n\nFor instance, a user might indicate a preference for an airport within a certain distance, say 5 miles or less. A well-designed algorithm would then sort the cities, providing users a \"top 10\" list of locations best suited to their individual needs. States eager for new talent, such as South Dakota, Wyoming, and Idaho, would dedicate resources towards recruiting these prospective citizens.\n\nCritics might dismiss this effort, but they are ignoring a significant shift in the labor market. Data shows that young professionals and middle-class families are increasingly leaving expensive cities like New York, Washington D.C., Miami, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, in favor of regional hubs in the Pacific Northwest, the Carolinas, Vermont, and South Dakota.\n\nThis trend is clear: America's workers are seeking better options, especially in the face of stagnant wages, student debt, and unfulfilled dreams of homeownership. They are looking for tools to help them find these hidden communities.\n\nThe future of rural America lies in the hands of these hidden communities and the private industry. By working together, they can attract the millions needed to rebuild rural economies, offering a better quality of life to those seeking it. This partnership could be the key to repopulating rural America and making it truly great again.",
    " Title: Warren Apologizes to Cherokee Nation for DNA Test Amidst 2020 Presidential Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a move to quell controversy surrounding her Native American ancestry, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has reportedly apologized to the Cherokee Nation leadership for a DNA test she took in October 2018. The apology comes as Warren prepares to announce her presidential bid, set to begin in earnest just days from now.\n\nWarren, who formed an exploratory committee for the 2020 presidential race on New Year's Eve, has been touring the nation in anticipation of her expected announcement to join the growing pool of Democrats vying for the White House. However, the issue of her ancestry has resurfaced, a matter that is likely to persist throughout her campaign.\n\nBefore declaring her presidential aspirations, Warren released the results of a DNA test, hoping to silence questions about her ancestry. The test indicated Native American heritage but sparked criticism from tribal leaders and backlash that has marred her early campaigning.\n\nAccording to The Intercept and the New York Times, Warren reached out privately to Cherokee Nation leadership and expressed her apologies for the test and any harm it may have caused. Cherokee Nation spokeswoman Julie Hubbard told The Intercept, \"Senator Warren has reached out to us and has apologized to the tribe.\" She continued, \"We are encouraged by this dialogue and understanding that being a Cherokee Nation tribal citizen is rooted in centuries of culture and laws, not through DNA tests. We are encouraged by her action and hope that the slurs and mockery of tribal citizens and Indian history and heritage will now come to an end.\"\n\nWarren's DNA test results, which showed \"strong evidence\" of Native American ancestry, were released in October, in part as a response to criticism from Republicans, including President Donald Trump, who nicknamed her \"Pocahontas.\" Conservatives have accused Warren of claiming Cherokee heritage to gain an advantage in her career, a claim her former employers have denied.\n\nLast month, Warren addressed the test during a question-and-answer session with supporters at a rally in Iowa. \"Why did you undergo the DNA testing and give Donald Trump more fodder to be a bully?\" an audience member asked the Democrat. Warren responded, \"I am not a person of color. I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry.\"\n\nWarren explained that when she ran for public office for the first time in 2012, Republicans \"honed in on this part of my history\" and made \"racial slurs.\" She added, \"So my decision was, I'm just going to put it all out there.\"\n\n\"I can't stop Donald Trump from what he's going to do. I can't stop him from hurling racial insults,\" Warren said. \"But what I can do is I can be in this fight for all of our families.\"",
    " Title: Syrian President Assad Criticizes Trump's ISIS Strategy, Labels U.S. Troops as \"Invaders\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview published Saturday, Syrian President Bashar Assad criticized President Donald Trump's approach to defeating the Islamic State (ISIS) group, stating that he has yet to see any concrete actions from the U.S. administration. Assad expressed hope that the current administration would follow through on their rhetoric, but noted that so far, the U.S.-backed military effort against ISIS in Syria has amounted to \"only a few raids.\"\n\nTrump, who won the presidency in part on his promise to defeat ISIS, ordered his top military leaders to present a new plan to dismantle the terror group within 30 days of taking office. However, it remains unclear whether they have delivered a report to Trump.\n\nAssad also expressed optimism about potential cooperation between his regime and the Trump administration, but cautioned that the U.S. presence in Syria without his government's invitation or permission is considered an invasion. He stated, \"Any foreign troops coming to Syria without our invitation or consultation or permission, they are invaders, whether they are American, Turkish, or any other one. And we don\u2019t think this is going to help.\"\n\nThe Syrian president's comments come as U.S. military leaders prepare to send approximately 400 additional support troops to Syria, in addition to the roughly 500 already in the country, for a multi-national effort to defeat ISIS in their stronghold of Raqqa. Assad considered winning in Raqqa a priority for his regime.\n\nCritics of former President Obama's handling of ISIS and his dealings with Assad have pointed out that Obama and his administration did not acknowledge \"radical Islamic terrorism\" and failed to follow through on a 2012 statement that Assad would cross a \"red line\" in using chemical weapons on civilians after evidence of such attacks became apparent.\n\nISIS has flourished in largely the northern and remote regions of Syria amid the six-year civil war. U.S. military leaders have limited their public comments about the war on ISIS to efforts in Iraq, particularly in west Mosul. However, they did mention earlier this week that the U.S. is preparing to send additional troops to Syria for the Raqqa operation.",
    " Title: Gun Control Ads Cause Concern Among Democratic Leadership Over Vulnerable Senators' Fate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe political future of Senator Mark Pryor (D-AR) has become a source of concern for the Democratic leadership, as the party braces for potential backlash from gun control advocates. According to several sources, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's aides recently met with staffers of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to discuss the potential impact of gun control-focused ads on vulnerable Democrats, such as Pryor.\n\nAdvertisements from the Bloomberg-funded Mayors Against Illegal Guns are set to air soon in Alaska, Arkansas, and North Dakota \u2013 states with Democratic senators who opposed the White House on the recent background checks vote. The group is also planning to deploy up to 60 field organizers in about a dozen states where senators, both Democrats and Republicans, voted against the bill. Their goal is to build infrastructure and counter the influence of gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association (NRA).\n\nThe increased focus on gun control has Democrats worried about maintaining their hold on the Senate, as they face opposition not only from Republicans but also from pro-gun control forces. The renewed interest in gun control legislation, sparked by the December shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT, left 20 children and six adults dead, has gained national momentum. However, advocates acknowledge that they cannot overcome the power of the NRA on Capitol Hill unless those who oppose them pay an electoral price for doing so, and they have shown no signs of backing down.\n\nBloomberg's group has chosen to target Arkansas' African-American community in their radio spots, with Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, stating, \"Without which Mark Pryor doesn't have a prayer of getting reelected.\" Four Senate Democrats \u2013 Pryor, Max Baucus of Montana, Mark Begich of Alaska, and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota \u2013 joined with Republicans to derail the bill, drawing criticism from the gun control movement and complaints from the White House.\n\nHowever, it is Pryor's fate that has Democratic leadership most worried. Senate Democrats point to the example of former Arkansas Democratic Senator Blanche Lincoln as a warning. In 2010, labor unions, angered by Lincoln's vote against legislation they supported, helped fund a primary challenger. Lincoln narrowly won that primary, but was then defeated by Republican John Boozman in the general election.\n\nDemocratic senators and aides also note that Pryor has supported President Barack Obama and the leadership on other significant issues such as Obamacare, banking reform, and taxes. Reid will need Pryor's support on upcoming immigration votes. The concern is that Pryor's stance on gun control could alienate key constituencies and jeopardize his re-election bid.",
    " Title: Major Advertisers Pull Out from Laura Ingraham's Fox News Show Following Controversial Tweets\n\nIn a significant development, at least seven companies have announced they are dropping advertisements from Laura Ingraham's Fox News show, \"The Ingraham Angle,\" following the conservative pundit's controversial tweets about a teenage survivor of the Florida school massacre.\n\nThe move comes after Parkland student David Hogg, 17, tweeted a list of a dozen companies that advertise on \"The Ingraham Angle\" and urged his supporters to demand that they cancel their ads. Hogg, a survivor of the Feb. 14 mass shooting that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Parkland suburb of Fort Lauderdale, has become a prominent figure in the youth-led movement calling for tighter restrictions on firearms.\n\nThe controversy began when Ingraham mocked Hogg on Twitter on Wednesday, accusing him of whining about being rejected by four colleges to which he had applied. In response, Hogg called for a boycott of Ingraham's advertisers.\n\nOn Thursday, Ingraham tweeted an apology \"in the spirit of Holy Week,\" saying she was sorry for any hurt or upset she had caused Hogg or any of the \"brave victims\" of Parkland. Ingraham also noted that her show was the first to feature David Hogg immediately after the horrific shooting and even commented on his poise given the tragedy.\n\nNutrish, the pet food line created by celebrity chef Rachael Ray, travel website TripAdvisor Inc (TRIP.O), online home furnishings seller Wayfair Inc (W.N), the world's largest packaged food company, Nestle SA (NESN.S), online streaming service Hulu, travel website Expedia Group Inc (EXPE.O), and online personal shopping service Stitch Fix (SFIX.O) all confirmed they were canceling their advertisements.\n\nWayfair said in a statement it supports dialogue and debate, but the decision of an adult to personally criticize a high school student who has lost his classmates in an unspeakable tragedy is not consistent with their values. Nutrish tweeted that they are in the process of removing their ads from Laura Ingraham's program. Nestle wrote on Twitter that they had \"no plans to buy ads on the show in future.\" Hulu confirmed they are no longer advertising on Laura Ingraham's show and are monitoring all of their ad placements carefully.\n\nTripAdvisor, which was not on Hogg's list or another list of sponsors that Hogg retweeted, \"no longer advertises on this show,\" Expedia spokeswoman Maureen Thon said in an email.\n\nHogg wrote on Twitter that an apology just to mollify advertisers was insufficient. He said he would accept it only if Ingraham denounced the way Fox News treated him and his friends. \"It's time to love thy neighbor, not mudsling at children,\" Hogg tweeted.\n\nIngraham's show runs on Fox News, part of Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O).",
    " Title: Trump Promises to Repeal Johnson Amendment, Wins Over Social Conservatives at Values Voters Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to win over social conservatives, Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump has pledged to repeal the Johnson Amendment, a provision that prohibits churches and other tax-exempt organizations from endorsing political candidates. Speaking at the 11th Annual Values Voters Summit on Friday, Trump jokingly suggested that the repeal of the 1950s-era amendment, named after then-Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson, could be his ticket to heaven.\n\nSince securing the GOP nomination and focusing on the general election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump has been courting social conservatives, a significant segment of the Republican coalition. The summit, hosted by the Family Research Council, provided Trump with an opportunity to address thousands of social conservatives.\n\n\"The first thing we have to do is to give our churches their voice back,\" Trump said. \"I will repeal the Johnson Amendment if I am elected your president.\"\n\nTrump's comments were met with applause from the audience, many of whom have been concerned about his stance on social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage. To assuage these concerns, Trump has highlighted his children's conservative values, showcased his policy positions, and tapped Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a well-respected social conservative, as his running mate.\n\nOn the policy front, Trump has promised to nominate Supreme Court justices who will uphold the Constitution, defend \"religious liberty,\" repeal and replace Obamacare, and expand school choice for students trapped in failing schools.\n\n\"Let me state this upfront: in a Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be protected, defended like you have never seen before,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump has also surrounded himself with high-profile figures on his Evangelical Advisory Board, including Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Council, and former Rep. Michele Bachmann. Bachmann praised Trump's stances on immigration, foreign policy, and taxes.\n\n\"On every single level, if you look at the agenda that Donald Trump has put forward, it has been one that I, as a Constitutional conservative, as a believer in Jesus Christ, can not only easily embrace, but readily embrace,\" Bachmann said.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus urged attendees to support Trump, stating, \"Let's lock arms and do what we can to elect Donald Trump president of the United States.\"\n\nPriebus warned that the left is launching an assault on the nation's culture and religious heritage, and that a Trump presidency would protect religious convictions and prevent the nation from bowing to secularism.\n\nWhile some attendees expressed reservations about Trump, many were won over by his willingness to buck political correctness and his opposition to Clinton.\n\n\"If you don't vote for Trump, it is essentially a vote for Hillary,\" said Jim Chamberlin of Ohio. Sandra Seaver of Maine, who initially planned to vote for Trump reluctantly, now supports him wholeheartedly. \"I used to hold my nose and vote for Trump, but since he has become more presidential, I have been very impressed with him,\" Seaver said.",
    " Title: Obama Defends Susan Rice Amidst Benghazi Criticism, Vows to Stand Firm Against Political Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated press conference on Wednesday, President Barack Obama defended his handling of the September 11 terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya's second-largest city and criticized Republican senators who have accused U.N. Ambassador Susan E. Rice of providing an inaccurate account of the Benghazi incident.\n\nThe President, in his first formal news conference in eight months, stated that he would not allow unfounded attacks on his administration regarding the Benghazi situation. He asserted, \"If Sen. McCain and Sen. Graham and others want to go after somebody, they should go after me. I'm happy to have that discussion with them. But for them to go after the U.N. ambassador, who had nothing to do with Benghazi and was simply making a presentation based on intelligence that she had received and to besmirch her reputation is outrageous.\"\n\nTwo hours before the press conference, Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina announced their intention to block Rice should the President nominate her to succeed Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is expected to step down. McCain criticized Rice's performance on five Sunday political talk shows after the Benghazi attack, stating that she incorrectly attributed the incident to a mob protest against an anti-Islamic video. Graham also expressed dissatisfaction with Rice's handling of China and Russia during United Nations negotiations.\n\nIn response to Obama's criticism, Graham retorted that he does indeed blame the President, and he and McCain formally introduced a resolution calling for a special select committee to investigate Benghazi, stating that there are still too many unresolved questions.\n\nThe heated exchange between the President and the senators highlights potential challenges in the second term for some of Obama's potential nominees, as many departments and agencies that played a role in the Benghazi incident could face vacancies in their top posts. Secretary of State Clinton has stated she will be leaving the State Department, although congressional inquiries into the Benghazi attack have delayed her immediate exit. With Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta refusing to indicate whether he will leave or stay put, the President may also have to fill the Pentagon's top civilian job.\n\nAdditionally, CIA Director David H. Petraeus's resignation and admission of an extramarital affair has left the key national security post open. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who has faced scrutiny due to the Justice Department's ill-fated Fast and Furious gunwalking scandal, is also expected to move to the private sector early in Obama's second term.\n\nThe Justice Department's supervisory role in the unusual FBI investigation into Petraeus's personal life and the FBI's failure to inform the President of its probe until months after it had begun will complicate the confirmation process of any Holder successor.\n\nBristling over Republican attempts to influence his nominations process, Obama defended Rice, stating that she had done \"exemplary work\" as U.N. ambassador and that the senators now have \"a problem with me\" for taking Rice to task. However, Obama also made clear he wasn't going to announce any more nominations at this point, and he said he hasn't decided whether to nominate Rice.\n\nMcCain and Graham earlier Wednesday stated they would do \"whatever is necessary\" \u2013 including a filibuster \u2013 to stop Rice from becoming the next secretary of state if Obama does pick her. Sen. John F. Kerry, Massachusetts Democrat, is also reportedly under consideration for Clinton's job.\n\nGraham told The Times that he doesn't have any concerns about Kerry \u2013 \"If the President thought that John Kerry could serve his administration and country, I'd be very inclined to support him.\" He added that Rice is a single nomination, not an indication of broad opposition to other nominees.\n\nHowever, his idea for a select committee to investigate Benghazi is meeting with resistance from top Democrats, who said there are multiple committees already looking into the run-up to the attack and the slow U.S. military response.\n\nAmbassador J. Christopher Stevens, who was one of four Americans killed in the attack, had asked for more security, but his request was denied. There were several warnings of increased terrorist activity, including an attack on the consulate in June, which Graham said Obama must answer whether he knew about. A Defense Department timeline released last week showed the military took hours to get a security team to the site of the attack.\n\nIn his news conference, Obama defended his own handling of the attack, stating, \"I can tell you that immediately upon finding out that our folks were in danger, that my orders to my national security team were do whatever we need to do to make sure they're safe.\"\n\nWhen pressed during Wednesday's news conference to provide more answers to the families of the victims of the Benghazi attacks, Obama said he would address the families directly, not through the press. However, he also referred to an ongoing investigation, stating he and the administration would \"provide all the information that is available about what happened that day.\"\n\nRegarding the ongoing Syrian civil war, Obama expressed encouragement over the formation of a new, more representative leadership council by the Syria opposition but stated that the U.S. is not ready to recognize the group as a \"government in exile\" or to arm it. The President also pledged to engage Iran in negotiations over its disputed nuclear program, stating he wouldn't be \"constrained by diplomatic niceties and protocols\" even though he believes there is \"still a window of time for us to resolve this diplomatically.\"",
    " Title: Political Tensions Escalate Over Mitt Romney's Tax Returns as Democrats and Republicans Trade Accusations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate over Mitt Romney's tax history intensified this weekend, as both parties engaged in a war of words regarding the presumptive Republican presidential candidate's tax payments.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, during an appearance on ABC's \"This Week,\" labeled Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid a \"dirty liar who hasn't filed a single page of tax returns himself.\" When asked by show moderator George Stephanopoulos if he stood by his comment, Priebus responded, \"I just said it.\"\n\n\"This is just a made-up issue, and the fact that we're going to spend any time talking about it is just ridiculous,\" Mr. Priebus said.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) also criticized the majority leader on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" stating, \"What he did on the Senate floor is so out of bounds. I think he's lying about his statement of knowing something about Romney.\"\n\nVirginia Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) called Mr. Reid's comments \"reckless and slanderous.\" On CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" he said, \"We know about [Romney's] tax returns? He's paid his taxes.\"\n\nThe governor added that \"people don't care about Mitt Romney's tax returns\" and accused Democrats of making an issue of Mr. Romney's tax returns to divert attention from President Obama's handling of the economy.\n\nDemocrats have persisted in their claim and have raised further questions about Mr. Romney's personal fortune, estimated to be as much as $250 million. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), who heads the Democratic National Committee, said on ABC's \"This Week,\" \"There are massive questions about why he has a Swiss bank account, why he has investments in the Cayman Islands in a Bermuda corporation that he's transferred to his wife's name one day before he became governor of Massachusetts.\"\n\nMr. Romney has refused to release more than one year of personal tax returns, citing the potential for the information to be distorted and used against him. There is no legal requirement for presidential candidates to release their taxes, although it has become customary in recent decades.\n\nSen. Reid last week claimed he learned that Mr. Romney hadn't paid his taxes from an investor in the Republican's former firm, Bain Capital. The senator hasn't provided proof and has said he isn't sure whether the claim is true. He repeated the accusation on the Senate floor, a move Republicans characterized as politically motivated and inappropriate.\n\nSince his initial charge, Mr. Reid has doubled down on his insinuation and said he doesn't need to prove it. \"I don't think the burden should be on me,\" he said in a telephone call with Nevada reporters last week. \"The burden should be on him. He's the one I've alleged has not paid any taxes. Why didn't he release his tax returns?\"\n\nMr. Romney himself has emphatically stated he will not release the returns and dared Mr. Reid \"to put up or shut up.\"\n\nNo Democrat appearing on Sunday's news talk shows disavowed Mr. Reid's comments, which Republicans said last week smacked of McCarthyism in their use of anonymous sources to make insinuations that the accused must then disprove.\n\nRather than disavowing Mr. Reid's claims, most Democrats instead tried to steer the conversation away from him and instead onto Mr. Romney. David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior campaign adviser, told \"Fox News Sunday\" that he didn't know the identity of Mr. Reid's source but that \"Gov. Romney can resolve this in 10 seconds. They can release the tax returns.\"\n\nRobert Gibbs, an adviser to Mr. Obama and his former press secretary, was asked on CNN's \"State of the Union\" whether Mr. Reid should tamp down his accusations against Mr. Romney. \"I don't think anybody controls Harry Reid,\" was his reply.\n\nWhen pressed again by show moderator Candy Crowley whether Mr. Reid should drop the issue, Mr. Gibbs said instead that \"Harry Reid isn't the one who's made this debate. Mitt Romney has brought this to the fore.\"",
    " Title: \"President Trump's Controversial Actions: A Constitutional and International Law Perspective\"\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump ordered the U.S. military to invade Iraq, a previously friendly country, and assassinate a high-ranking Iranian military and intelligence official. The targeted individual was Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran's Quds Force, and his companions. The killing occurred through the use of an unmanned drone, and the victims were not engaged in any act of violence at the time.\n\nThe legality of the president's actions has sparked debate, with critics arguing that the president does not have the authority to kill a person not engaged in an act of violence based on potential future actions. The Constitution provides only two means for the federal government to kill a human being: through a declaration of war by Congress or due process, which includes a lawful arrest, fair trial, and conviction for a capital crime.\n\nMoreover, the laws of war permit the president to kill foreign military personnel if they are physically engaged in killing Americans or are about to do so. However, the imminence and certainty of such actions must be present for self-defense to apply. Without these conditions, the president's actions could be seen as unlawful and a violation of international law, as they may constitute an unlawful invasion and killing, which is prohibited by the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe assassination has also raised concerns about the long-term implications for U.S. foreign policy and international relations. Critics argue that such actions could set a dangerous precedent, potentially justifying similar actions by other world leaders, such as the Chinese president killing a Mexican government official in Texas or an American intelligence agent in Venezuela.\n\nThe assassination has also been compared to the actions of Sir Thomas More, a historical figure from Robert Bolt's play \"A Man for All Seasons.\" More, a 16th-century statesman, argued that even universally recognized evil individuals should be afforded the benefits of the law for the sake of personal safety and the rule of law.\n\nThe assassination has been met with widespread criticism, with many arguing that it undermines the rule of law and sets a dangerous precedent for future U.S. foreign policy. Critics also point out that the assassination has united the Iranian people behind their government and led to the Iraqi government's decision to expel all U.S. troops, who were in Iraq without a lawful or moral basis for being there in the first place.\n\nJudge Andrew P. Napolitano, Fox News' senior judicial analyst, has been critical of the president's actions, stating that they violate the Constitution and international law. Napolitano has written extensively on the dangers of executive overreach and the importance of adhering to the rule of law.",
    " Title: Investigation Ongoing as Orlando Shooting Sparks Political Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in American history, the FBI has identified the perpetrator as 29-year-old Omar Mateen, a U.S.-born citizen of Afghan descent. The FBI Director, James Comey, has stated that there is no evidence suggesting the attack was directed from the Middle East, labeling Mateen as a \"homegrown extremist.\"\n\nThe question remains as to why Mateen, who had previously been under FBI surveillance for nearly a year, was able to purchase firearms from a gun store. Witnesses have reported that Mateen was a regular at the Pulse nightclub, the site of the attack, and had also dated men. Officials have also revealed that Mateen scouted Disney World for a potential attack.\n\nThe shooting has significantly impacted the ongoing presidential campaign, with both major candidates offering their perspectives on the matter. Presidential hopeful Donald Trump has proposed expanding his previously suggested Muslim ban, stating that immigration from regions with a history of Islamic terrorism should be halted until the cause of these threats can be addressed.\n\nTrump has accused President Barack Obama of willful ignorance regarding Islamic terrorism, stating, \"There's something going on.\" In response, Obama has refrained from using the terms 'Muslim' or 'Islamic terrorism' in his statement on the Orlando massacre.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, initially following the president's politically correct line, stated, \"Inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror.\" However, her opponent, Trump, has criticized Clinton for her reluctance to name the enemy, stating that her continued refusal to use the term \"radical Islamism\" demonstrates weakness.\n\nClinton has since acknowledged the existence of \"radical Islamism\" in an interview with CNN, but has emphasized that she will not \"demonize an entire religion.\" The Democratic response during a heated session of Congress focused on gun control legislation, but the proposal was blocked by Republicans.\n\nAs the investigation into Mateen's background continues, politicians and the public grapple with understanding the motivations behind the attack, and the appropriate response to the ongoing threat of terrorism.",
    " Title: New Study Reveals Higher Welfare Use Among Immigrant-Headed Households in the U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report from the Center for Immigration Studies has found that immigrant-headed households in the U.S. use welfare programs at a significantly higher rate than their native-born counterparts. The study, released on Wednesday, analyzed data from the Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) for the year 2012.\n\nAccording to the report, 51 percent of immigrant-headed households, both legal and illegal, reported using at least one welfare program during the year, compared to 30 percent of native-headed households. The welfare programs included in the center's definition are Medicaid, cash, food, and housing programs.\n\nSteven Camarota, the CIS's Director of Research and the report's author, stated, \"If immigration is supposed to benefit the country, then immigrant welfare use should be much lower than native use. However, two decades after welfare reform tried to curtail immigrant welfare use, immigrant households are using most programs at higher rates than natives.\"\n\nCamarota attributed the high welfare use among immigrants to their lower skill and education levels. \"The low-skill level of many immigrants means that although most work, many also access welfare programs. If we continue to allow large numbers of less-educated immigrants to settle in the country, then immigrant welfare use will remain high,\" he added.\n\nThe report also found that while welfare use among both new and long-time immigrants is high, the rates vary based on the region of origin. In 2012, 73 percent of immigrant-headed households from Central America and Mexico reported using one or more welfare programs, while households from the Caribbean used welfare at a rate of 51 percent. African immigrants were at 48 percent, South American at 41 percent, East Asia 32 percent, Europe 26 percent, and South Asia 17 percent.\n\nThe report further highlighted that while immigrant-headed households use welfare at a higher rate than natives, they also pay taxes at a lower rate. \"On average, immigrant-headed households had tax liability in income and payroll taxes in 2012 that was about 11 percent less than native households, or about 89 cents for every dollar native households pay, based on Census Bureau data. Immigrant households have lower average incomes (from all sources) than native households and are a good deal larger, giving them more tax deductions. As a result, their average income tax liability is less than native households,\" the report reads.",
    " Title: Florida Voters Approve Amendment 4, Restoring Voting Rights to 1.4 Million Felons\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant victory for civil rights and criminal justice reform, Florida voters approved Amendment 4 on Tuesday, restoring voting rights to an estimated 1.4 million people with felony convictions in the state. The amendment, which passed by 64 percent, will grant voting rights to all felons in Florida, except those convicted of murder or sex offenses.\n\nThe amendment was supported by a diverse coalition of progressive groups, civil liberty organizations, conservative groups, and celebrities. It also received a groundswell of grassroots support from ex-offenders and their families, who argue that those who have served their time should be reinstated as full citizens.\n\nDesmond Meade, president of Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, addressed a room of jubilant supporters at an election night watch party in Orlando, saying, \"This was a campaign about inclusion. Those numbers represented what happens when we come together along the lines of humanity and reach each other where we're at. That's what happens when we're able to transcend partisan politics and bickering, when we're able to transcend racial anxieties and discourse, when we're able to come together as God's children.\"\n\nFlorida is one of four states that impose lifetime bans on voting for people with felony records. The two remaining states are Iowa and Kentucky. Virginia has a similar provision, but the last two governors have used their executive powers to restore voting rights to those affected.\n\nThirty-three states have various laws disenfranchising felony offenders and those under law enforcement supervision, impacting an estimated 6.1 million potential voters, according to a 2016 Sentencing Project report.\n\nFormer offenders in Florida could previously petition the governor for clemency to have their voting rights restored, but in 2011, then-governor Rick Scott, who is running for the U.S. Senate this year, tightened the rules, making Florida the toughest state in the U.S. for felons to regain their voting rights.\n\nBryan Russi, a 42-year-old ex-felon and current real estate agent from Orlando, expressed his excitement about the amendment, saying, \"It's not Republican or Democrat, it's a human thing. Everyone has people who have been affected.\"\n\nKim Lawrance, an activist whose 18-year-old daughter is currently incarcerated, hopes her child will one day be able to vote. \"They should be able to come home and get reintegrated into society,\" Lawrance said. \"When your time is done, it's done.\"\n\nOne estimate suggests that 10 percent of all Floridians who are otherwise eligible to vote have been disenfranchised by the law. Felon disenfranchisement also disproportionately affects black residents. One out of every 13 African-Americans in the U.S. has lost their voting rights due to felony disenfranchisement laws, compared to one in every 56 non-black voters, according to the Sentencing Project report.\n\nFlorida's felony disenfranchisement laws were, like those in many other states, a vestige of the state's racist 19th-century \"Black Codes,\" which attempted to systematically criminalize freed slaves following the Civil War and then bar them from voting.\n\nIn a statement, ACLU of Florida Executive Director Howard Simon celebrated what he called \"one of the largest expansions of the franchise in our nation's history\" but warned that the fight was not over. \"In the days and weeks ahead, we will seek to work with the newly elected governor to ensure that Amendment 4 is implemented as intended by the Floridians who placed it on the ballot and voted to approve it\u2014without delay and without imposing more burdens on the process to register to vote,\" Simon said.\n\nShortly after Amendment 4 passed, Trump-aligned Republican Ron DeSantis narrowly defeated progressive Democrat Andrew Gillum in the race for Florida governor.",
    " Title: Obama and Trump Meet for First Time at White House, Pledge to Work Together for Smooth Transition\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic meeting at the White House, President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump held an \"excellent conversation\" on Thursday, discussing the transition of power from the Obama administration to the Trump administration.\n\nJust days after a highly contentious election, the two leaders spoke cordially and shook hands for the cameras. Trump, who had previously challenged Obama's birthplace, praised his predecessor as a \"very good man\" following their Oval Office meeting.\n\nObama stated that his top priority in the next two months is to facilitate a smooth transition to the Trump administration. The two discussed organizational issues, as well as domestic and foreign policies. Obama emphasized the importance of unity, stating, \"I believe that it is important for all of us, regardless of party and regardless of political preferences, to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face.\"\n\nTrump, noting that the meeting ran long, expressed his gratitude to Obama, stating, \"Mr. President, it was a great honor being with you, and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future.\" The New York businessman also said, \"We had never met each other. I have great respect.\"\n\nThe two leaders did not take questions from reporters, but White House press secretary Josh Earnest stated that the two did not resolve all of their differences, but did not try to either; their focus was a smooth transition.\n\nTrump later met with Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Trump stated that they discussed immigration, healthcare, and jobs.\n\nIn preparation for his inauguration on January 20, Trump has also been speaking with leaders from across the globe, including British Prime Minister Theresa May and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nAs part of the transition process, Michelle Obama gave a tour of the White House residence to Melania Trump. During the campaign, Mrs. Obama criticized Trump over his lewd comments about women, while Mrs. Trump used lines cribbed from a speech given by the first lady during the Republican national convention.\n\nIn his campaign speeches, Obama cast Trump as an erratic and perhaps unstable political novice who should not be allowed near the nuclear codes. Trump, in turn, pledged to reverse and tear down Obama's legacy, including repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, voiding the Iran nuclear deal, and ripping up new business and environmental regulations.\n\nDespite their differences, Obama stated that he will work to ensure a smooth transition, citing the example set by President Bush's team eight years ago. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich described the meeting between the president and his successor as \"an amazing tribute to the power of the people.\"",
    " Title: Poll Shows Republicans Leading in 2014 Midterm Elections, Amid Low Approval of Obamacare and Obama Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll by Politico reveals a significant lead for the Republican party in the most competitive House and Senate races for the 2014 midterm elections. The poll, conducted May 2-13 among 867 likely voters, shows 41 percent of respondents favoring a Republican candidate, compared to 34 percent who prefer a Democratic candidate. Approximately 25 percent of respondents are undecided.\n\nThe poll's findings reflect the current political climate, with President Barack Obama's job approval rating and the public's disapproval of Obamacare playing a significant role in the midterm campaign. According to Politico, both the President's job approval and the partisan ballot matchup are more negative for Democrats in this poll than in other national surveys.\n\nDespite the challenging political landscape for Democrats, the poll also indicates that voters in a number of conservative states and races lean liberal on several key issues, such as immigration reform, pay equity, and background checks for gun sales. However, healthcare emerges as a top priority for voters, with nearly 9 out of 10 people stating that their view on healthcare would be an important determinant of their vote.\n\nAmong those surveyed who had an opinion of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the electorate was almost evenly split, with 48 percent wanting to repeal the law entirely, 16 percent favoring no changes, and 35 percent supporting modifications. The poll suggests that while the ACA is a political liability for Democrats, fully repealing the law may not be a straightforward proposition for the GOP, potentially complicating matters for a Republican presidential ticket in 2016.\n\nThe survey also reveals that majorities of white voters (54 percent) and men (51 percent) support repealing Obamacare, but a majority of most subgroups do not, including independents, moderates, African-Americans, and Hispanics. Given that the midterm electorate is expected to be whiter and more conservative than the general population, and many of the year's highest-stakes Senate races are in Southern states, the poll's findings are ominous for Democrats, with repeal being the preferred position of a plurality of likely voters.",
    " Title: President Trump Visits Puerto Rico Amidst Ongoing Hurricane Maria Recovery Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Maria's devastating impact on Puerto Rico, President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the U.S. territory's capital, San Juan, amidst criticism from local politicians over the perceived weak response to the disaster.\n\n\"There's nothing left. It's been wiped out,\" Trump stated last week, referring to Puerto Rico following the hurricane that left most residents without power and fresh drinking water. \"Nobody has ever seen anything like it.\"\n\nDuring his visit, which is expected to last at least five hours, the president will meet with first responders, local politicians, and some residents. He is also expected to meet with Governor Ricardo Rossell, visit a local church, and attend briefings. Accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, they will also meet with Marine Corps and Navy personnel.\n\nThis will be Trump's fourth trip to a region affected by natural disasters, including Texas, Florida, Louisiana, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nWhile most Puerto Rican politicians have collaborated closely with the Trump administration in coordinating the recovery efforts, some local politicians have criticized the administration's response to the disaster. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, during a press conference last Friday, stated, \"We are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency. A genocide is looming if the crisis is not handled.\"\n\nTrump has responded to the criticism, tweeting, \"Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.\"\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reportedly has more than 10,000 federal personnel on the island providing recovery support. Nearly 50 percent of people now have access to drinking water, the agency added.\n\nHurricane Maria has exacerbated the already dire situation in Puerto Rico, a territory that has been in economic recession for about a decade and undergoing a debt crisis. The economic woes left the country's infrastructure in a sorry state, making the recovery harder.\n\nMore than two weeks after the hurricane, over 90 percent of residents are still without power. Some hospitals reportedly have no power as well. Rural areas still struggle to access essential needs such as food, fresh water, or medicine.\n\nTrump's visit is thought to be about addressing the perception that the administration has neglected the response to the crisis. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders stated on Monday that the trip will be about the recovery, to which the administration is \"fully committed.\"\n\n\"The top priority for the federal government is certainly to protect the lives and the safety of those in affected areas and provide life-sustaining services as we work together to rebuild their lives,\" she said.",
    " Title: Protesters Demand Town Hall Meetings with Sen. Dianne Feinstein as She Faces Criticism for Lack of Public Engagement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a demonstration organized by the San Francisco chapter of Indivisible, a liberal activist group, protesters gathered outside the Public Policy Institute of California on Friday to express their discontent with U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) for her decision not to hold town hall meetings during the current congressional recess.\n\nThe demonstration, which took place during a ticketed event where Feinstein was set to speak, saw protesters holding signs reading \"Hold a real town hall\" and using green and red cards to indicate agreement or disagreement with various topics discussed during the event.\n\nAccording to the San Francisco Chronicle, Feinstein, who has not held town hall meetings during her last two U.S. Senate campaigns, has no plans for any town halls during the current recess. People attending the event were reportedly invited to send questions via email to the event moderator in advance, with tickets being free and only 240 chairs available in the room, although many more stood.\n\nDuring the event, Feinstein reportedly expressed some enjoyment of the outbursts from the protesters, stating, \"I kind of enjoy it.\" The moderator reportedly asked the audience to settle down so that he could continue asking questions when Feinstein admitted, \"I kind of enjoy it.\"\n\nThe protesters' actions were in response to Feinstein's stance on several political issues, including her support for some of President Trump's cabinet picks and her perceived inaction regarding the removal of Stephen K. Bannon from his position as President Trump's chief White House strategist.\n\nThis is not the first time Feinstein's constituents have confronted her. In January, approximately 200 protesters picketed outside her Pacific Heights mansion in San Francisco to oppose her \"pro-Trump voting record.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on Friday night, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) held a town hall in Glendale, California, where he discussed President Donald Trump's temporary travel ban and the refugee crisis. The turnout for Schiff's town hall was reportedly significant, with attendees filling both the main room and an overflow room.\n\nIn a twist of events, several hundred anti-Trump activists plan to hold an \"empty chair\" town hall on Sunday at 10 a.m., despite Feinstein's declining their invitation to attend in person. However, a spokeswoman for Indivisible East Bay told the Chronicle that Sunday's event is not a protest of the senator but rather a demonstration of their request for a meeting with her.",
    " Title: ISIS Infiltration Attempt Near U.S. Airbase in Iraq Highlights Ongoing Threat\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent attempt by ISIS forces to infiltrate an airbase in Iraq, where 320 U.S. Marines are training Iraqi forces, has highlighted the ongoing threat posed by the extremist group. The infiltration attempt, using Iraqi military uniforms, was thwarted by Iraqi Security Forces, resulting in the death of the ISIS fighters.\n\nThe incident occurred a day after militants took control of most of the town of Baghdadi, a location less than five miles from the airbase. The U.S. forces were not directly threatened during the attack, according to a statement, but the targeting of a base hosting U.S. troops underscores the potential for American military personnel to become directly engaged with the militants on the battlefield.\n\nRear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in an interview with CNN that the airbase, which is roughly the size of Boulder, Colorado, has \"mini-bases inside the big base.\" He emphasized that the incident occurred nowhere near where U.S. or coalition forces were operating.\n\nKirby acknowledged the danger faced by U.S. trainers and advisers, stating, \"there's no question that they're close to danger.\" However, he clarified that they do not have a ground combat mission, but have the right to defend themselves if threatened.\n\nThe capture of Baghdadi, which remains under militant control, demonstrates the Islamic State's continued ability to launch offensive operations despite coalition airstrikes and discussions of a counteroffensive on major cities held by the group. U.S. officials maintain that the militants are largely on the defensive.",
    " Title: Senate Confirms Eugene Scalia as U.S. Labor Secretary Along Party Lines\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate confirmed Eugene Scalia, son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, as the next Labor Secretary on Thursday afternoon by a vote of 53-44. The confirmation came after a brief stint as acting secretary by Patrick Pizzella, following the resignation of former Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta in July due to the backlash over his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case.\n\nScalia, who has a background in corporate law, was nominated by President Trump to fill the position. His professional history, which includes representing Wall Street banks, Walmart, UPS, and SeaWorld, among others, has put him at odds with Senate Democrats due to his long track record of fighting labor and financial regulations.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) criticized Scalia's nomination, calling it \"a slap in the face of the Labor Department.\" Schumer argued that President Trump \"could have chosen a union member\" instead.\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the top Democrat on the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, expressed her disappointment with the vote and vowed to \"fight every day to hold him and the Trump administration accountable for the harm they're doing to workers.\"\n\nHealth Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), however, praised the confirmation. GOP Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.) called Scalia \"an expert in labor, employment, and regulatory law\" with an \"unmatched resume of experience in both the private and public sector.\"\n\nAlexander said in a statement, \"Eugene Scalia is well-qualified to lead the Department of Labor with a steady hand at a time when workers' wages are up and unemployment is near record lows.\" He added, \"Now that Mr. Scalia has been confirmed, I look forward to his getting to work to help continue to grow our economy and help workers gain the skills they need to succeed in today's workplace.\"",
    " Title: Trump and Cuomo Engage in Verbal Spat Over Lockdown Authority Amidst Ongoing Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nA heated exchange between President Donald Trump and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has erupted over the authority to lift coronavirus lockdowns, as the US grapples with the ongoing pandemic.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump claimed on Twitter that deciding when to reopen states was \"the decision of the president,\" not state governors, although he added that he would make his decision \"in conjunction with governors.\" The US Constitution, however, states that states maintain public order and safety, with individual state governors issuing lockdown or shelter-in-place orders so far.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo refuted Mr. Trump's claim, stating that the president does not have total authority to decide when to reopen businesses. \"We don't have a king, we have a president,\" Mr. Cuomo told CBS.\n\nThe US is the epicenter of the pandemic, with 592,743 cases and 25,239 deaths. New York state, which has the most cases, with almost 190,000 cases and over 10,000 deaths, has seen signs of improvement, with the number of people hospitalized due to coronavirus falling for the first time on Tuesday.\n\nThe row continued on Tuesday, as Mr. Trump took to Twitter to criticize Mr. Cuomo and issue an oblique snipe at other governors. \"Tell the Democrat Governors that 'Mutiny On The Bounty' was one of my all-time favorite movies,\" Mr. Trump wrote, appearing to compare himself to the captain of the ship in the tale.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Trump struck a less combative tone later on Tuesday, saying he would make a decision on the economy \"in conjunction with governors\" soon. The Trump administration had previously signaled 1 May as a potential date for easing restrictions, but US infectious diseases adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci told AP on Tuesday that the 1 May date might be \"a bit overly optimistic.\"\n\nDifferent approaches to loosening lockdown restrictions have been adopted globally, with Wuhan, China, partially reopening after more than two months of isolation, Spain allowing around 300,000 nonessential workers to return to their jobs, and Italy allowing a narrow range of businesses to resume operations this week. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has announced the country's near-lockdown will extend until 11 May, while the UK government has said no one should expect any changes to its lockdown restrictions this week.\n\nThe ongoing dispute between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cuomo comes as the US continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, with the number of cases and deaths continuing to rise. The two leaders have been at odds over the federal government's response to the crisis, with Mr. Cuomo criticizing the administration's testing and ventilator distribution efforts. Mr. Trump, for his part, has criticized Mr. Cuomo for his handling of the outbreak in New York.\n\nThe row between the two leaders has sparked a broader debate over the balance of power between the federal government and the states during a national emergency. Legal experts and governors from both parties have weighed in on the issue, with some arguing that the Constitution grants the federal government broad powers during a national emergency, while others argue that states maintain significant autonomy in managing their own affairs.\n\nAs the pandemic continues to spread, it remains to be seen how the dispute between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cuomo will be resolved, and whether the federal government will play a more active role in managing the response to the crisis in individual states.",
    " Title: Romney's Debate Performance Boosts Confidence Among GOP Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the past few weeks, it was evident that many Republicans were displeased with their presidential nominee, Mitt Romney. During campaign rallies and door-to-door conversations, GOP voters often displayed a reluctance towards Romney, with some offering lukewarm endorsements. However, the tide seems to have turned in Romney's favor following his strong performance in the recent debates.\n\nGary Bauer, a prominent social conservative, notes that Romney is now attracting larger crowds, such as the 12,000 in Cleveland and 8,000 in suburban Virginia, which would have been unimaginable a few weeks ago. This surge in enthusiasm is attributed to Romney's debates with President Obama, where he demonstrated his ability to hold his own against the incumbent.\n\nRomney's debate performances might have initially raised concerns among conservatives, as he shifted his stance on several issues and emphasized his bipartisan accomplishments during his time as Massachusetts governor. However, the selection of Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate has reassured die-hard Republicans that Romney will assemble a conservative team in his Cabinet and the Supreme Court.\n\nHenry Olsen, vice president of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, suggests that the change in sentiment among Republicans is due to a newfound belief that Romney can win the election. This shift in perception has led to a willingness to overlook some inconsistencies in Romney's platform.\n\nThe question of who would be most likely to take Obama to task during the fall debates was a hot topic during the GOP primary season. Candidates like Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Michele Bachmann, and others were considered more reliably conservative, and some grassroots Republicans felt that if one of them were the nominee, they would not have to worry about watching the debates.\n\nHowever, Romney's debate performances have proven to be a pleasant surprise for many Republicans, demonstrating his ability to hold his own against Obama and instilling confidence within the GOP fold. This newfound enthusiasm could play a significant role in the upcoming election.",
    " Title: U.S. Government Faces Unprecedented Debt Levels, CBO Reports\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released its latest long-term budget projections, revealing a disconcerting trajectory for the federal government's fiscal health. The report projects a total debt of $100 trillion, a figure that, if realized, would mark a significant milestone in the nation's financial history.\n\nThe CBO's projections, which span a 30-year window, paint a grim picture of escalating spending and only marginally increasing taxes, leading to deep annual deficits that could culminate in a potentially catastrophic debt burden. The CBO analysts predict that debt held by the public, currently 78 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), will reach 152 percent in 2048. Given that GDP is projected to be $65 trillion that year, this equates to a debt total of $98.8 trillion.\n\nSocial Security is projected to become insolvent early in the 2030s, according to the report. The government is expected to pay out a staggering $4 trillion annually in Social Security payments and nearly $4.5 trillion in Medicare benefits in 2048, accounting for about half of the deficit that year. Interest on the debt is also projected to rise significantly, from about $300 billion this year to $4 trillion in three decades.\n\nThe CBO's report underscores the large projected growth in spending on entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare as major drivers of debt. Government spending is projected to consume nearly one-third of GDP in 2018, approaching the level of some European governments. Tax revenue, on the other hand, is projected to rise slowly and will still be below 20 percent of GDP in 2048.\n\nThe CBO's projections are based on current law, anticipating the GOP tax cuts to expire within a decade. Should Congress choose to extend the tax cuts and continue heightened spending as envisioned in the latest spending law, the situation could become even more dire, with debt potentially reaching about 200 percent of GDP, or approximately $130 trillion, in 2048.\n\nPoliticians from both sides of the aisle have weighed in on the report. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) criticized the tax cuts, stating, \"Today's report is another reminder about the true costs of handing out massive tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations.\" Republicans, however, countered that taxes, while historically low now, will be above average by the end of the three-decade window, indicating that the problem isn't a lack of government revenue, but excessive government payouts.\n\nAs the nation grapples with these projections, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has called for lawmakers to address the situation promptly, stating, \"Lawmakers need to come to the table and address this situation before it gets further out of hand.\" The CBO's report serves as a stark reminder of the challenges that lie ahead and the need for careful fiscal management to ensure a sustainable future for the United States.",
    " Title: Justice Department Warns of Potential Federal Intervention in State Lockdown Orders Amidst Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General William Barr has issued a memo stating that the Justice Department will intervene if state and local stay-at-home orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic become too restrictive, potentially violating constitutional rights. In the memo, Barr directed federal prosecutors to be on the lookout for such orders.\n\n\"These kinds of restrictions have been necessary in order to stop the spread of a deadly disease \u2014 but there is no denying that they have imposed tremendous burdens on the daily lives of all Americans,\" Barr said in a memo issued Monday. \"If a state or local ordinance crosses the line from an appropriate exercise of authority to stop the spread of COVID-19 into an overbearing infringement of constitutional and statutory protections, the Department of Justice may have an obligation to address that overreach in federal court.\"\n\nThe memo comes as states begin to reopen their economies, despite warnings from health experts that easing restrictions could cause a resurgence of coronavirus outbreaks. In Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp has set in motion an aggressive plan to lift restrictions, businesses such as hair salons and gyms are allowed to reopen.\n\nThousands have also protested stay-at-home orders in multiple states, including Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. President Donald Trump has endorsed the protests, calling on supporters to \"liberate\" states that have seen large gatherings of protesters.\n\nIn his memo, Barr said restrictions on religious liberty, discriminating against \"disfavored speech\" and \"undue interference\" with the economy violate federal laws.\n\n\"We do not want to unduly interfere with the important efforts of state and local officials to protect the public,\" Barr said. \"But the Constitution is not suspended in times of crisis.\"\n\nBarr tapped Eric Dreiband, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, and Matthew Schneider, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Michigan, which covers Detroit.\n\nGovernors across the nation are under pressure as anti-quarantine protests and Trump's endorsement of such protests put them on a political tightrope over coronavirus response. Michigan, which has been hard-hit by the pandemic \u2014 with about 38,000 COVID-19 cases and 3,400 deaths as of Monday \u2014 has imposed some of the most stringent restrictions. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered residents to stay inside except for essential purposes and nonessential businesses to not require employees to work. The Democratic governor has drawn criticism from the president, who encouraged protesters calling for reopening the state.\n\nBarr warned last week of Justice Department intervention, telling conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt that officials are reviewing stay-at-home restrictions.\n\n\"And if we think one goes too far, we initially try to jawbone the governors into rolling them back or adjusting them. And if they \u2019re not and people bring lawsuits, we file statement of interest and side with the plaintiffs,\" Barr said.",
    " Title: White House Explores Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Amid Economic Concerns, Amidst Ongoing Debate on Recession Probabilities\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at stimulating the economy and potentially avoiding a slowdown or recession, the Trump administration is reportedly considering a temporary payroll tax cut. This revelation comes as the 2020 election approaches, despite President Trump's consistent praise of the US economy, according to a report by The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nHowever, a White House spokesperson has denied that a payroll tax cut is currently under consideration. The discussions, which are said to be in their early stages, have not yet resulted in a decision to seek Congress' approval for the cut.\n\nMost working Americans pay a payroll tax on their earnings, with a 6.2% levy funding Social Security programs. The payroll tax was reduced to 4.2% during the Obama administration to encourage consumer spending during the Great Recession but was raised back to 6.2% in 2013. A payroll tax cut would provide relief to many middle-class families that did not benefit from Trump's tax cuts.\n\nPayroll tax cuts can add to the deficit and potentially take billions from Social Security. The administration's discussions about a new payroll tax cut have only begun in the past few days, according to the report, and specific details about the design have not been finalized.\n\nThe talks follow a weekend blitz in which the president and his top economic advisers touted the economy and blamed Democrats for talking it down. \"Our Economy is very strong, despite the horrendous lack of vision by Jay Powell and the Fed, but the Democrats are trying to \u2018will\u2019 the Economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 Election. Very Selfish!\" Trump tweeted on Monday.\n\nA survey by the National Association for Business Economics, to be released on Monday, shows that 34% of economists believe a slowing economy will tip into recession in 2021, up from 25% in a survey taken in February. Only 2% of those polled expect a recession to begin this year, while 38% predict that it will occur in 2020.\n\nTrump, however, has dismissed concerns about a recession, offering an optimistic outlook for the economy after last week's steep drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. A strong economy is crucial to the Republican president's 2020 reelection prospects.\n\nThe economists have previously expressed concern that Trump's tariffs and higher budget deficits could eventually dampen the economy. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on goods from many key US trading partners, including China, Europe, Mexico, and Canada. Officials maintain that the tariffs, which are taxes on imports, will help the administration gain more favorable terms of trade. However, US trading partners have retaliated with tariffs of their own.",

The image provided by the McConnell Center at the University of Louisville shows McConnell sitting with his parents, Julia \"Dean\" and A.M. McConnell in Five Points, Alabama in the mid 1940's.\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic unfolds, McConnell recalls the fear and uncertainty that gripped the nation during the polio crisis. He was just a toddler when he came down with flu-like symptoms, and his left leg was paralyzed. Two years later, after shuttling young McConnell to and from the Warm Springs, Georgia treatment center, his mother was told that he would be able to walk without a leg brace.\n\nSeventy years later, McConnell walked into the U.S. Senate to pass a sweeping coronavirus rescue package and shutter the chamber for the foreseeable future. He reflected on the similarities between the two crises, stating, \"It's a scary virus. You didn't understand how you got it.\"\n\nMcConnell was taught to stay off his feet during his recovery, and his mother instilled in him a sense of tenacity, hard work, and determination. He remembers the arrival of the polio vaccine and the relief it brought to a weary populace. As Congress considers the next aid package, McConnell expressed a desire for more funding for healthcare.\n\nMcConnell returned to Warm Springs last year, reviewing files about his condition and his visits. He was unsure how his mother afforded his medical care, stating, \"Honestly, I don't know the answer to that.\"\n\nAs the nation grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, McConnell's personal experience with polio offers a unique perspective on the current crisis. He closed the interview by stating, \"Let's continue to pray for one another and for our country.\"",
    " Title: EPA Chief Pruitt Under Fire for Alleged Pay Raise Scandal and Rent Arrangement with Energy Lobbyist\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a week marked by controversy, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief Scott Pruitt came under fresh scrutiny on Tuesday following a report by The Atlantic that he had gone to great lengths to secure pay raises for two of his favorite aides, including one who helped him find a low-cost accommodation in Washington D.C.\n\nAccording to the report, Pruitt requested that the salary of Sarah Greenwalt, his deputy chief of staff, be increased from $107,435 to $164,200, and that of Millan Hupp, his press secretary, from $86,460 to $114,590. As political appointees, the White House needed to approve their new pay.\n\nHowever, after the White House rejected their request, Pruitt's team reportedly studied the particulars of the Safe Drinking Water provision, learning that Pruitt could exercise total control over their contracts and grant the raises on his own. Pruitt ordered it done. Hupp and Greenwalt's duties did not change, but the agency began processing them for raises of $28,130 and $56,765, respectively, compared with their 2017 salaries.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pruitt appeared on Fox News, where he was praised for his efforts to \"implement Trump's agenda\" but was questioned about the pay raise controversy. In an interview with host Ed Henry, Pruitt initially claimed he was unaware of the pay raises, but later admitted that they should not have been given.\n\nIn a subsequent interview with CNN, Pruitt stated that he was \"unaware\" of the donations made by Steven and Vicki Hart, a powerful energy lobbyist couple who rented Pruitt a room in their Capitol Hill home for $50 per night. The Hart's began donating to Pruitt's campaigns for Oklahoma attorney general in 2010, with Steven Hart even hosting a fundraiser for Pruitt's reelection effort.\n\nPruitt's actions have raised questions about his integrity and his adherence to ethical standards. The EPA Inspector General's office is reportedly investigating the pay raise issue, and the White House has expressed concern over the matter.\n\nAs the investigation continues, Pruitt's future at the EPA remains uncertain. Many are calling for his resignation, while others are demanding a thorough investigation into his actions. The public is urged to contact their members of Congress to express their concerns.",
    " Title: White House Announces National Garden of American Heroes to Counter Confederate Statue Removals\n\nThe White House has unveiled an executive order on Friday to establish a \"National Garden of American Heroes,\" featuring statues of prominent Americans. The move comes amidst ongoing calls to remove Confederate statues and other racist iconography across the country.\n\nThe executive order, announced during a Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore, creates the Task Force for Building and Rebuilding Monuments to American Heroes. This task force will be empowered to use funding from the Interior Department to establish the site, with a 60-day deadline to submit a report to the White House detailing options for the creation of the National Garden.\n\nThe garden will include statues of historical figures such as John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton, Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther King Jr., Abraham Lincoln, Ronald Reagan, Jackie Robinson, and Harriet Tubman, among others. The garden will also maintain a collection of statues for temporary display at various public sites across the United States.\n\nThe garden is expected to be open prior to July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence. The executive order also addresses the ongoing calls to remove Confederate statues, stating that such actions are a desecration of shared heritage and that these statues belong to generations past and future.\n\nPresident Trump, in an impassioned speech at Mount Rushmore, criticized those who are tearing down statues of Confederate leaders, accusing them of wanting to \"overthrow the American Revolution\" and fundamentally change the country. He argued that the left-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American Revolution and destroy the nation's heritage.",
    " Title: Congressman Jeff Van Drew Switches Parties, Cites Far-Left Policies and Threats as Reasons\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Congressman Jeff Van Drew made his official exit from the Democrat Party on Thursday during a meeting in the Oval Office, surrounded by reporters. The New Jersey representative explained that the party's continued push toward far-left policies, as well as personal threats, led him to become a Republican.\n\nVan Drew began his remarks by tracing the origins of his political shift. He recounted a meeting with a local county chairman about two weeks ago, who, according to Van Drew, threatened him with political retaliation if he did not vote to impeach President Trump. This incident, he said, prompted him to reconsider his political allegiance.\n\nVan Drew, who has been a Democrat for many years, expressed that he had previously considered switching parties during his tenure in the New Jersey state Senate. He voted for two bills that he described as promoting faith and patriotism, which, according to him, were met with criticism from far-left Democrats.\n\nThe first bill would have allowed the phrase \"In God We Trust\" to be displayed on the walls of all public and private buildings. The second bill would have allowed the American flag to be flown anywhere, as long as it was displayed respectfully.\n\nVan Drew stated that he was criticized for these bills, with far-left Democrats expressing their disapproval. \"This is a very Republican thing,\" Trump interjected, as the room erupted in laughter.\n\nVan Drew emphasized his belief in American exceptionalism, stating, \"I don't want anyone to ever tell me that there isn't American exceptionalism.\" He recounted his journey from a humble background to becoming a dentist and sitting next to the President of the United States, attributing his success to the opportunities America provided.\n\nVan Drew also criticized socialist policies, stating that socialism has no place in the United States and that he believes in capitalism. He added that he supports lowering taxes, balancing the budget, and honoring first responders and veterans.\n\nVan Drew took aim at the \"extreme\" members of the Democrat party, suggesting that they view being bipartisan as a negative, and that this attitude would make one \"like a Republican.\" He seemed to take indirect aim at Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), but directly criticized the Green New Deal, stating that he believes it should never be considered.\n\nVan Drew also cited the Democrats' intolerance of diverse thought as a reason for his switch. He added that former Republican President Ronald Reagan was one of his favorite presidents, and that Reagan's comment about the Democrat party leaving him also resonated with him.",
    " Title: Hispanic Republican Leaders Unite Against Donald Trump's Presidential Bid, Warn of Loss of White House and Hispanic Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a united front, Hispanic Republican leaders have issued a stern warning to the party, stating that the nomination of Donald Trump could lead to the loss of the Hispanic vote and the White House. The warning came after a closed-door meeting in Colorado on Tuesday, where about two dozen Hispanic leaders gathered to discuss the growing threat posed by Trump's presidential bid.\n\nAlfonso Aguilar, director of American Principles Project's Latino Partnership and a former official in the administration of President George W. Bush, stated, \"Our message to Trump is, 'You're done.' We think if you are the candidate, Republicans will lose the White House.\"\n\nThe group plans to monitor the rest of the GOP field in the coming weeks and months, and could potentially write off other candidates based on their immigration views. The Trump campaign declined to comment on the meeting.\n\nThe third GOP debate is set to take place on Wednesday at the Coors Events Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder, with Trump expected to take center stage. The debate will be hosted by CNBC and will feature 10 participants, based on national polls, following a 6 p.m. undercard event with four lower-tier candidates.\n\nTrump has downplayed the idea that he has fallen out of favor with Hispanics, but an AP-GFK poll this week showed 72 percent of Latinos view him unfavorably, compared to 11 percent who see him in a positive light. Given Colorado's deep pool of Hispanic voters, the debate could focus more on immigration, which polls show is a threshold issue for many Hispanics who won't even consider a candidate that comes out against robust legalization.\n\nRosario Marin, former treasurer of the United States under President George W. Bush, who attended the meeting, said, \"Foolishly, some candidates think they don't need the Hispanic vote in the primary, so they pander to the voters with extreme views instead of just showing us who they are. Heed our warning: 'Don't expect us to come to your side during the general election. If you are not with us now, we will not be with you then.'\"\n\nThe Hispanic \"summit\" on Tuesday was billed as the first of its kind, and attendees have scheduled another meeting a day before the Dec. 15 debate in Nevada, which is also home to many Latino voters. The group also vowed to highlight how President Obama broke his promise to push an immigration fight during his first year in office and how Hillary Rodham Clinton, the likely 2016 Democratic nominee, said last year that illegal immigrant children surging across the U.S.-Mexico border should be sent home.\n\nRepublicans have wrestled over the issue of immigration since Mitt Romney lost Latino voters by a 71 percent-to-27 percent margin in the 2012 election after he pledged to rely on \"self-deportation\" to reduce the number of illegal immigrants living in the United States. The pledge contrasted with the executive amnesty that President Obama granted to young illegal immigrants, known as Dreamers, roughly six months out from the general election.\n\nObama won the Latino vote by an even wider margin\u201475 percent to 23 percent\u2014in Colorado, which has produced Republicans with diverse opinions on the issue, including former Rep. Tom Tancredo, a staunch \"amnesty\" opponent, and Sen. Cory Gardner, who supports a pathway to legal status for illegal immigrants and expanding guest worker programs.\n\nThis year, the issue has divided the GOP field, with former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio, both Florida Republicans, Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich being among the candidates that have backed some sort of a path to legal status for illegal immigrants. Others, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, have vowed to oppose \"amnesty\" and have supported expanding legal immigration.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has focused on the enforcement side of the debate and signaled he is open to reducing legal immigration. In August, he rolled out a six-page plan that called for more border fencing, deporting all illegal immigrants, and ending the policy granting automatic citizenship to almost everyone born in the U.S., including to illegal immigrant mothers.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions, Alabama Republican, applauded the Trump plan, saying at the time that it \"re-establishes the principle that America's immigration laws should serve the interest of its own citizens.\" For the Hispanic leaders that gathered in Boulder Tuesday, the proposal was yet another troubling sign for Trump, who had caught their attention over the summer when he said that Mexico officials were sending drug smugglers, \"rapists and some, I assume good people\" into the United States.\n\nTrump has pledged to support whoever wins the GOP nomination. However, Hispanic leaders have stated they won't support Trump. Massey Villarreal, former head of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said before the meeting, \"We are not going to shy away from the fact that if Mr. Trump is the nominee, we will encourage Latinos to write their own candidate in.\"\n\nAguilar stated he would \"leave the ballot blank,\" and also said that it would be \"naive\" to suggest that Trump is the only GOP candidate who could jeopardize the party's chances of winning over more Hispanics. \"Trump is in a league of his own, but there is a concern about the way Cruz has been handling the issue,\" he said. Aguilar added that Cruz, the son of a Cuban immigrant father, has sent the wrong message by cozying up to Trump, while also coming out against birthright citizenship and refusing to spell out his plans for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the country.\n\nThe Cruz camp did not respond to an email seeking comment.",
    " Title: High School Students' Views on Free Speech: A Mixed Bag of Results\n\nArticle:\n\nA new survey conducted by the Knight Foundation has raised concerns about the future of free speech in America, as it reveals a significant number of high school students are not fully appreciating the importance of free speech and the First Amendment's protections.\n\nOne of the most troubling findings is that only 64% of students believe that free speech is more important than protecting someone from being offended. This result is particularly concerning as it suggests a growing acceptance of the idea that speech can be restricted or criminalized if it offends someone.\n\nThe survey also found that a majority of students (91%) believe that unpopular speech is a protected right. However, the definition of what constitutes unpopular speech is open to interpretation, with some students equating it with offensive or bullying speech. This overlap between the terms is a cause for concern, as it may indicate a lack of understanding of the principles of free speech.\n\nAnother alarming finding is that students of color, particularly black students, are less likely to believe that the value of upholding free speech outweighs the value of insulating someone from taking offense. This suggests that cultural pressures may be influencing students' views on free speech, and that the anti-discussion mob's tactic of conflating offensive speech with physical violence may be having an impact on younger generations.\n\nOne of the positive data points in the survey is the increase in the percentage of students who believe that unpopular speech is a protected right. This has risen by eight points since the survey's 2004 installment, which is a real and heartening progress.\n\nThe survey also found that students are less disposed than ever to believe that the First Amendment's safeguards of fundamental rights are too excessive. This is a reassuring finding, but it is only a partial victory, as the survey also reveals some red flags.\n\nThe survey results are a reminder that the principle of free speech is potentially at stake, and that it is the nasty, offensive, and bullying speech that is most in need of protection. It is relatively easy to protect anodyne, civilly-expressed speech, but the nasty stuff is much harder to shield from the bipartisan authoritarian impulse to ban and silence.\n\nThe survey results also highlight the importance of education in conveying the truth about free speech and the value of open expression. It is crucial that high school teachers pass on the American torch to the next generation, and that they do so in a way that nurtures a deep understanding of the principles of free speech and the importance of upholding them. The survey results are a call to action for educators and policymakers to ensure that free speech is protected and that the exceptions to the rule are kept as narrow as possible.",
    " Title: House Republicans Propose Spending Bill to Avert Government Shutdown, Ease Impact of Budget Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to prevent a potential government shutdown later this month, House Republicans have introduced a spending bill that would fund federal operations through September. The bill aims to provide more funds for military readiness while easing the impact of the across-the-board spending cuts that are currently in effect.\n\nThe bill, if passed, would maintain the 2013 budgets for the Defense and Veterans Affairs departments, while other agencies would be frozen at 2012 levels and subjected to the 5 percent domestic agency and 7.8 percent Pentagon cuts ordered by President Barack Obama last week.\n\nThe impact of the new cuts has been slow to reach the broader public, with the Pentagon announcing plans to furlough thousands of military school teachers worldwide and close stores with consumer goods an extra day each week. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has also reported delays in customs lines at airports such as Los Angeles International and O'Hare International in Chicago.\n\nPresident Obama has expressed his intention to continue seeking Republican partners to reach a deal to ease or head off the cuts, but no breakthrough appears imminent. \"We are going to manage it the best we can to minimize the impact on American families,\" Obama said at the start of the first Cabinet meeting of his second term. \"It is not the right way to go about deficit reduction.\"\n\nThe new Republican funding measure is set to advance through the House on Wednesday. It would provide an increase for military operations and maintenance efforts, as well as veterans' health programs, while putting most of the rest of the government on budget autopilot. After accounting for the across-the-board cuts, domestic agencies would face reductions exceeding 5 percent compared to last year.\n\nThe bill would also provide about $2 billion more than the current level to increase security at U.S. embassies and diplomatic missions worldwide, following the terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, last September, which resulted in the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.\n\nThe across-the-board cuts would carve $85 billion from the government's $3.6 trillion budget for this year, focusing the cuts on the approximately $1 trillion allocated to the day-to-day agency operating budgets set by Congress each year. These so-called discretionary accounts received big boosts in the first two years of Obama's presidency when Democrats controlled Congress, but have borne the brunt of the cuts approved as Obama and Republicans have grappled over the budget. The FBI and the Border Patrol would be able to maintain current staffing levels and would not have to furlough employees. The bill would also carve out a host of exemptions to protect certain functions and provide new funding for embassy security and modernizing the U.S. nuclear arsenal.",
    " Title: White House Celebrates Strong January Job Growth, Acknowledges More Work Ahead\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a positive start to the new administration, the White House announced on Friday that the U.S. economy added 227,000 jobs in January, as reported in the first jobs report of the Trump presidency. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer attributed the job growth to the consumer confidence inspired by the Trump presidency.\n\nDuring a press briefing, Spicer acknowledged that the job gains were a combination of the new administration's efforts and the previous administration's, as the report covered the transition month. He emphasized, however, that President Trump's influence on the economy began before he took office.\n\n\"President Trump campaigned on making America work again,\" Spicer said. \"Even before he took office, the markets knew he would deliver on that promise.\"\n\nIn contrast to Trump's campaign rhetoric, Spicer distanced the new administration from the former President's criticism of the Labor Department's jobless rate calculations. The strong hiring surpassed expectations, but the jobless rate rose from 4.7 percent to 4.8 percent, as 76,000 more workers entered the workforce to seek employment.\n\nThe Labor Department reported that employers in the retail, construction, and financial sectors hired the most workers. The government also revised its estimate down for job creation in November and December, lowering the total number of jobs created in that period by 39,000.\n\nWage growth remains a concern, with average hourly earnings up 3 cents to $26 in January, compared with December's 6-cent increase. For the year ended Jan. 31, wages increased 2.5 percent.\n\n\"The president's already taken significant steps to turn our economy around, and he is looking forward to ensuring that every American who wants a job has the opportunity to find one,\" Spicer said. \"While the president's definitely pleased that the job growth has far surpassed expectations and that the labor force participation is rising, he also recognizes that there is a lot more work to be done.\"\n\nSpicer described the president's jobs agenda as \"big and bold.\"",
    " Title: The Paradox of a Prosperous Economy and a Divided GOP: Understanding the 2018 Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States economy has reached a 17-year low in unemployment, a significant achievement attributed primarily to the deregulation efforts and tax cuts implemented by the Trump Administration. This economic boom has been a boon for many Americans, marking a prosperous period not seen in over a decade. However, the Republican Party, despite holding all the reins of power, is struggling to win the wave of special elections in 2018, and the upcoming midterms in November may prove to be a tougher race than expected.\n\nThe Republican Party, in its current form, is a tentpole party, encompassing various ideological factions, from Libertarians to conservative internationalists and nationalists. This internal division, exacerbated by Donald Trump's presidency, has created a significant rift within the party. While Trump is a polarizing figure, his absence from the ballot has left many voters unsure of their reason to vote for the GOP.\n\nThe traditional Republican voter, often referred to as \"Reagan Democrats,\" is disinclined to support typical Republican candidates due to their perceived support for free trade, open borders, and entrenched wealth. Furthermore, the moral divide between the two parties is a significant factor. While conventional Republicans advocate for a more moderate stance on social issues to appeal to the base, the Democrats are surging forward with their own take on the culture war.\n\nThe generational divide is crucial in understanding the Republicans' difficulties in winning elections without Trump. The largest cohort of Baby Boomers is set to retire and begin drawing on Welfare programs en masse, creating economic distortions. Meanwhile, the radicalism exhibited by the Left will intensify and gain traction, while the Right will continue to lose influence and legitimacy, bickering among its various factions and ignoring the blue-collar voters that propelled Trump to victory.\n\nTo regain ground, the GOP needs to more fully embrace Trumpism, taking a firm stance on trade and immigration issues. The party also needs to unflinchingly wage the culture war, forging a coalition of blue-collar workers and social conservatives. As Reagan said, the Republicans need to \"raise a banner of bold colors, no pale pastels.\" The GOP, without Trump, is currently all pastel.",
    " Title: FBI Re-Opens Hillary Clinton Email Investigation, Raising Questions and Stirring Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has reopened its investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's personal email server just weeks before the election. The announcement, made in a letter to Congress on Friday, was based on the discovery of emails during an \"unrelated investigation\" that are deemed to be pertinent to Clinton's case. The FBI is currently assessing whether these emails contain classified information.\n\nStripped of legal jargon, this development signifies that Hillary Clinton is once again in legal jeopardy. The FBI does not typically investigate and recommend enforcement actions against computer servers; rather, it holds individuals accountable, and Clinton is the primary individual associated with her email server.\n\nThree initial thoughts arise from this development:\n\n1. The newly discovered emails must be problematic, as the FBI would not publicly re-open an investigation on the eve of a presidential election if the emails contained information about yoga routines or wedding plans. The fact that the FBI is trying to determine whether the emails contain classified information indicates that their content is causing concern within the Bureau. In other words, this is a serious matter.\n\n2. The emails could potentially impact the decision regarding whether to charge Clinton or her aides under the Espionage Act or for obstructing the initial investigation, perhaps by lying to the FBI. Recall that FBI Director James Comey previously exonerated Clinton under a unique legal standard, but if there are more emails\u2014and if Clinton or her aides worked to conceal their existence from the FBI\u2014then their conduct may even meet the FBI's arbitrary, higher threshold of lawlessness. At the very least, it calls into question the FBI's previous decision not to prosecute even more.\n\n3. Unless the FBI announces the investigation and clears her within a work week (an action that would be problematic in itself), Clinton's closing argument to the American people will be that her opponent, Donald Trump, is so dangerous that it's worth gambling one's vote on a candidate under current criminal investigation.\n\nThe question remains whether any Democrats will urge Clinton to step aside. Three weeks ago, the Washington Post released tapes showing Donald Trump bragging about committing actions that meet the legal test for sexual battery. In the aftermath, a number of Republicans asked him to step aside for the good of the country. Now, it's the Democrats' turn. Their candidate is back under criminal investigation. Millions of people have already cast their votes for her, believing she'd been \"cleared.\" Is her personal ambition worth this national pain?\n\n*Update: It has been revealed that the \"unrelated investigation\" that triggered the FBI's decision was its investigation into Anthony Weiner's serial sexting.",
    " Title: FBI Whistleblower Sibel Edmonds Accuses Robert Mueller of Deep State Involvement and Conflicts of Interest\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on The Alex Jones Show, FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds accused Special Counsel Robert Mueller of being a deep state operative, alleging that he has a history of covering up Islamic terror networks and engaging in corruption. Edmonds, who has a history with Mueller, claimed that he suppressed evidence in her case and issued gag orders to silence the truth.\n\nEdmonds stated, \"Imagine my shock when I saw that Robert Mueller was appointed as the special counsel in this case, the same Robert Mueller, who in my case, put gag orders together with Attorney General Ashcroft.\" She went on to say, \"There were FBI agents, not only in the Washington field office, but also in the Chicago and Patterson field offices, who were blowing the whistle on Mueller internally, saying he was squashing our investigations [into terror networks].\"\n\nEdmonds also expressed her shock that Mueller would be brought on as an \"impartial\" prosecutor in the Trump-Russia probe, given his history of corruption. She noted, \"I was the one who stepped outside of the FBI, went to Congress, went to IG, it was a game. This same Mueller, who invoked the state secrets privilege, placed gag orders to protect, to protect, this terrorist network.\"\n\nEdmonds further alleged that Mueller's investigation into President Trump and Russia is a \"sham\" and that he could not find any evidence linking former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn to nefarious activities with the Russians. She also criticized lawyers for those under investigation for not going on the offensive.\n\nIn another segment of the show, Edmonds stated that it is a slam dunk case that Robert Mueller cannot preside as the special counsel in the Russia probe. She also noted that there are FBI agents who would testify that Mueller is not an impartial special counselor. This, she argued, would give President Trump all he needs to fire Mueller before he can ruin any more lives in his \"new McCarthyism\"-like witch hunt.\n\nIn a separate video on her own website, Edmonds discussed Mueller's conflicts of interest in going after General Flynn. She stated, \"FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds exposes Special Counsel Robert Mueller's conflict of interest in pursuing General Michael Flynn's case due to his direct involvement as former FBI Director and his role in covering up and protecting Gulen Networks' criminal operations within the United States, and demands that he steps down.\"\n\nEdmonds' allegations raise serious questions about the impartiality of the ongoing Russia investigation and the role of Robert Mueller in it. It is crucial for the American public to remain informed and vigilant in the face of these allegations, as the outcome of the investigation could have significant implications for American democracy.",
    " Title: Carly Fiorina: A Look at the Republican Presidential Candidate's Life and Career\n\nArticle:\n\nCarly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard and the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 company, has officially declared her candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination. Fiorina made the announcement on Good Morning America and in a tweet on Monday.\n\nBefore her foray into politics, Fiorina had a diverse career in the corporate world. She is perhaps best known for her tenure as the CEO of Hewlett-Packard, a position she held from 1999 to 2005. Despite her success, she was ousted after a boardroom struggle.\n\nHere are five lesser-known facts about Fiorina:\n\n1. Fiorina studied medieval history and philosophy at Stanford University, but her father, a federal appeals court judge, encouraged her to pursue a legal career. She attended law school but found the studies to be challenging, as she experienced \"blinding headaches every day.\" She eventually dropped out after a semester. However, she holds graduate business degrees from the University of Maryland and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n2. Fiorina's early career included temporary work with the agency Kelly Services, where she was part of the team of women known as \"Kelly girls.\" She also held secretarial positions while in college, including working for Hewlett-Packard, the tech company she would later lead.\n\n3. In 2009, Fiorina was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy. At campaign appearances, women often approach her to share their own stories of cancer survival. \"It's a sisterhood,\" she says.\n\n4. Fiorina's husband, Frank Fiorina, started his career driving a tow truck for a family-owned body shop. He later became an executive at AT&T.\n\n5. Fiorina is known for one of the most famous campaign ads in history. In 2010, while running for the U.S. Senate, she ran an ad that depicted a flock of sheep grazing peacefully, only to reveal one sheep with red, scary eyes. The narrator said Fiorina's opponent, Tom Campbell, was not a true conservative\u2014a \"wolf in sheep's clothing.\" This ad, known as the \"demon sheep\" ad, became notorious.\n\nAs Fiorina embarks on her presidential campaign, these facts offer a glimpse into her life and career before politics.",
    " Title: Senate's Healthcare Reform Bill Faces Criticism and Fails to Gain Support\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Senate's Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, aimed at repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, has failed to garner enough support from Republican senators. The bill, which was not aggressively promoted by President Trump or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, faced criticism for its lack of substantial reform and its similarities to the Affordable Care Act in certain aspects.\n\nThe bill, which runs for 172 pages, has been criticized for its failure to address the health-care mess exacerbated by the Affordable Care Act but not caused by it. The bill tweaks the system without ambition of a turnaround. One of the bill's positive aspects is that it allows all Americans the option to purchase simple, low-deductible, high-premium catastrophic plans. However, it continues to force plans to cover medical options deemed essential by politicians but neither wanted nor needed by consumers.\n\nThe bill also replaces Obama's subsidies with tax credits and provides much wiggle room to allow reforms to not occur. The Senate health bill spends money equal to or exceeding the budgets of some state governments to reverse the exodus of insurers from certain markets. The bill's section on health insurance issuers appears more concerned with covering up the intrinsic problems with the Affordable Care Act than with overhauling the health-care system.\n\nThe failure of the bill to pass has been met with disappointment, as the health-care system remains a significant concern for the American public. A majority of Americans want the government to guarantee health care for all, and the Affordable Care Act, however imperfect, already offers something approximating this. The challenge facing Congressional Republicans is to reform health care in such a way that provides universal access but relies on market principles rather than a handout mindset.\n\nThe failure of the bill to pass has led to a shift in focus to other policy areas, such as comprehensive tax reform and infrastructure. However, health care, as the largest drain on the federal budget and personal pocketbooks, remains a top domestic policy concern. In the coming weeks, this page will offer some ideas on how to achieve universal access and cost control in the health-care system.",
    " Title: New Jersey Joins 15 States in Allowing Unauthorized Immigrants to Obtain Driver's Licenses\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could significantly impact the lives of nearly half of the estimated 10.6 million unauthorized immigrants currently residing in the United States, New Jersey has passed a law allowing these individuals to obtain driver's licenses. The bill, which is expected to be signed by Governor Phil Murphy, a Democrat, would make New Jersey the 15th state, along with Puerto Rico and Washington D.C., to offer driver's licenses to unauthorized immigrants.\n\nThe legislation, passed by the New Jersey Legislature on Monday night, creates two types of driver's licenses: a federally compliant Real ID license for air travel and a \"standard\" driver's license for driving and identification purposes. Unauthorized immigrants can apply for the standard license using foreign passports or driver's licenses, rather than a Social Security number. If signed, the bill will take effect in January 2021.\n\nCurrently, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Washington, Illinois, Vermont, Maryland, Delaware, Hawaii, Oregon, and New York, as well as Puerto Rico and Washington D.C., already offer driver's licenses to unauthorized immigrants. This means that approximately 5.3 million unauthorized immigrants nationwide would be eligible to get a driver's license, according to 2017 estimates.\n\nAdvocates for immigrants continue to lobby other states to pass similar laws, including Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Texas, and Massachusetts, which first proposed such legislation 15 years ago.\n\nResearch suggests that making driver's licenses available to unauthorized immigrants improves safety. Obtaining a license requires testing and training on road safety, as well as proof that an applicant can obtain auto insurance. Drivers with licenses are also more willing to cooperate with law enforcement, reducing burdens on police forces.\n\nA 2016 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal found that after California implemented its driver's license law in 2015, hit-and-runs dropped between 7 percent and 10 percent on average\u2014amounting to roughly 4,000 fewer such accidents annually.\n\nSuch policies also have financial benefits, both for local governments and for drivers. The Fiscal Policy Institute found in 2017 that state and county governments could collect about $57 million in annual revenue, as well as $26 million in one-time revenues, by issuing 150,000 driver's licenses to unauthorized immigrants in New York City. The researchers also determined that it would likely lower auto insurance premiums overall.\n\nAn analysis conducted by New York City also found that having a driver's license provides additional financial stability for families and increases employment opportunities for unauthorized immigrants. Having a car allows them to look for jobs and housing that are not located near public transportation.\n\nHowever, even unauthorized immigrants with driver's licenses may still be at risk for deportation. A lawsuit filed in January claimed that the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles had unlawfully targeted unauthorized immigrants by sending their names, photos, car registrations, and other personal information to ICE.\n\nThe Trump administration has pushed back against efforts to prevent ICE from accessing DMV data. As New York's driver's license law went into effect on Monday, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that those records allow it to investigate crimes such as human trafficking by \"building criminal cases, identifying criminal suspects, and enhancing officer safety.\"",
    " Title: Investigations into Giuliani's Activities Intensify as Federal Probe Expands\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the past, Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal attorney, was a familiar face on cable news channels and Sunday talk shows. However, his absence from the public eye in recent weeks may be due to mounting legal concerns as federal investigators scrutinize his dealings.\n\nThe former New York City mayor's sudden silence could be a response to potential legal jeopardy, according to legal experts. The activities Giuliani has engaged in over the years, including his connections to two recently indicted associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, may be of interest to investigators.\n\nParnas and Fruman face charges of conspiracy, false statements, and other offenses linked to alleged campaign finance violations. The indictment details an alleged scheme to remove the then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, from her post. The pair is also said to have been pursuing this goal at the behest of a Ukrainian official.\n\nWhile the indictment does not implicate Giuliani, he was also pushing for Yovanovitch's dismissal. House investigators have reviewed material filed by an anonymous State Department whistleblower that alleges \"propaganda\" about Yovanovitch that was sent to the State Department by Giuliani. However, it remains unclear whether Giuliani's efforts were linked to those of Parnas and Fruman or whether he was aware of them.\n\nFormer Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, who was approached by Parnas and Fruman as part of their alleged scheme, is complying with a grand jury subpoena for documents about his knowledge of the matter. This suggests that prosecutors working for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York believe there could be more to learn, according to attorney Joshua Ian Rosenstein.\n\nGiuliani enlisted Parnas and Fruman's help to dig up dirt in Ukraine on the family of former Vice President Joe Biden and conspiracy theories tied to the 2016 election. Parnas has told NPR that he helped translate and arrange interviews for Giuliani with former Ukrainian officials.\n\nParnas' company, Fraud Guarantee, paid Giuliani $500,000 for consulting on technology and providing legal advice, according to Giuliani. All of these connections are of potential interest to investigators.\n\nWith an indictment hanging over Parnas and Fruman, former prosecutors say the two are under pressure to cooperate and reveal whatever they may know about Giuliani, including their conversations with him and any directions he may have given them.\n\nBeyond Ukraine, questions have also been raised about other Giuliani activities that appear to resemble foreign lobbying, experts say. Foreign lobbying is regulated by the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). It requires individuals who are doing political or public relations work on behalf of a foreign entity to disclose that fact to the Justice Department.\n\nGiuliani's advocacy on issues related to Turkey, which aligns with Ankara's interests, has raised questions. Giuliani reportedly pushed Trump to extradite a Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in exile in Pennsylvania. The Turkish government has been pressuring the U.S. to hand over Gulen, whom Ankara blames for the failed 2016 coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nGiuliani also reportedly used an Oval Office meeting with Trump to argue for a prisoner swap with Turkey. The swap would have involved sending back to Turkey a Turkish-Iranian gold trader named Reza Zarrab, who was indicted in New York.\n\nZarrab, who had ties to Erdogan, ultimately pleaded guilty, cooperated with prosecutors, and provided testimony implicating the Turkish president in a massive corruption scheme.\n\nGiuliani's ties to an Iranian dissident group known as the MEK have also raised eyebrows. The group was listed by the State Department as a foreign terrorist organization before being removed from the list in 2012.\n\nPolitics The Evolution Of Rudy Giuliani\n\nFor years, Giuliani has made speeches on the group's behalf and has been paid for his efforts. Giuliani told NPR that the Justice Department has never contacted him about his activities and whether they fall under the rubric of foreign lobbying.\n\nHowever, attorney Joshua Ian Rosenstein, who specializes in advocacy law, said that this is a misunderstanding of what FARA requires. \"Making speeches on behalf of a foreign political party within the United States where those speeches are aimed at influencing the views of the U.S. public or the U.S. media, with reference to the national or political interests of that party, falls squarely within the ambit of regulated conduct under FARA,\" Rosenstein said.\n\nThe Justice Department has put a recent emphasis on FARA enforcement, particularly in the wake of the Russia investigation. One high-profile setback came in September when former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig was found not guilty of making false statements to the Justice Department about work he did for the Ukrainian government.",
    " Title: Protests Erupt Over Police Shooting of Jerame Reid in Bridgeton, New Jersey\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a controversial police shooting in Bridgeton, New Jersey, protesters have taken to the streets to voice their concerns over racial disparities in police use of force. The incident in question involves the shooting of 36-year-old Jerame Reid, who was killed by two police officers during a traffic stop.\n\nThe incident was captured on a dashboard camera, showing the officers pulling over a car in which Reid was a passenger. One of the officers, Braheme Days, is black, while the other, Roger Worley, is white. The officers stopped the car due to a stop sign violation, but the situation escalated when Days warned his partner that he saw a gun in the glove compartment. The officers then drew their weapons.\n\nDays shouted, \"Don't you fucking move,\" \"I'm going to shoot you,\" \"You're going to be fucking dead,\" and \"Show me your fucking hands!\" Days also appeared to remove a silver handgun from the car. Reid, despite the officers' orders not to move, exited the vehicle with his hands at shoulder level. Both officers then fired, killing Reid.\n\nBoth officers have been placed on administrative leave while the shooting is investigated. It is worth noting that Reid had a criminal history, having spent about 13 years in prison for shooting at three state troopers when he was a teenager. Days, the black officer involved in the traffic stop, was also among the arresting officers when Reid was charged with drug possession and other crimes in 2014.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2014, Worley was involved in 23 uses of force, and Days was involved in 11, according to records obtained by the Associated Press. Other officers in the Bridgeton Police Department were involved in more incidents of use of force.\n\nThe Associated Press also found that Days and Worley were the subjects of multiple complaints alleging abuses of power over the past two years, but all the complaints were dismissed.\n\nReid's death comes amidst ongoing nationwide protests over racial disparities in the criminal justice system and police use of force. According to limited FBI data, police are disproportionately likely to kill black Americans. These racial disparities persist even in situations where the shooting victim was not attacking anyone else, with some victims being killed while fleeing, committing a felony, or resisting arrest.\n\nIn 2014, there were several high-profile police shootings involving black men and boys. In Ferguson, Missouri, Darren Wilson killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in a shooting that sparked nationwide protests. In Ohio, 22-year-old John Crawford and 12-year-old Tamir Rice were both killed after police mistook toy guns they were carrying for actual weapons. In Utah, police killed 22-year-old Darrien Hunt as he fled after an encounter in which police said Hunt attacked them with a decorative sword.\n\nPolice officers in these cases appeared to overestimate the threats posed by their victims, which may be a result of subconscious racial biases. Research conducted by Josh Correll, a University of Colorado at Boulder psychology professor, suggests that this bias could lead to more skewed outcomes in the field. \"In the very situation in which [officers] most need their training,\" Correll said, \"we have some reason to believe that their training will be most likely to fail them.\"",
    " Title: Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki Stands Firm Amidst Political Crisis, Deploys Security Forces\n\nArticle:\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is holding onto power amidst mounting pressure from domestic and international sources, following a series of controversial moves that have raised concerns about the stability of the Iraqi government. On Monday, Maliki lashed out at critics and deployed security forces loyal to him around Baghdad, according to multiple press reports.\n\nThe embattled prime minister accused Iraq's ethnic Kurdish president of violating the constitution by not appointing a new prime minister, despite Maliki's party narrowly winning parliamentary elections in April. The formation of a new government has stalled, with Maliki's speech Sunday coming after President Fouad Masoum missed a deadline to appoint a new prime minister, prompting angry accusations from Maliki and concern from US officials.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters on Monday that the government formation process is critical for sustaining stability in Iraq. \"Our hope is that Mr. Maliki will not stir those waters,\" Kerry said, according to Reuters.\n\nMaliki's speech Sunday followed President Masoum's failure to appoint a new prime minister, which prompted accusations from Maliki and concern from US officials. The Wall Street Journal reports that U.S. officials were alarmed by Maliki's fiery speech Sunday and his call for the Iraqi army to protect the country's constitution.\n\nAccording to a senior Iraqi official, Maliki has placed tanks and loyal special forces units in the Green Zone of government buildings. A Kurdish news agency reported that presidential guards were on high alert to protect the presidential palace, and the capital swirled with rumors about what might happen next. In Washington, a senior administration official said that the United States had not confirmed reports of abrupt military movements in Baghdad, including rumors that tanks had surrounded the presidential palace, but that it would monitor the situation closely.\n\nAn official at Iraq's Ministry of the Interior told the Wall Street Journal that the extra security was in anticipation of a terrorist attack and was not related to politics. Finding a replacement candidate for Maliki, who has been criticized for promoting his ethnicity above the country's Sunnis and Kurds, has proved difficult.\n\nComplicating efforts to propose a replacement from among fellow Shiites, who appear to have some support from both the country's leading cleric and from the Shiite establishment of neighboring Iran, the country's highest court ruled that Maliki's State of Law bloc is the biggest in the new parliament. That, a senior Iraqi official said, was \"very problematic\" for attempts to have President Masoud offer the premiership to an alternative candidate to Maliki.\n\nOn Sunday, the deputy speaker of Iraq's parliament Haider al-Abadi, a member of Maliki's party, said in a tweet that a bloc of Shiite parties was close to choosing a new prime minister. Mr. Abadi's name has been floated as a possible candidate, but critics accuse him, too, of sectarianism.\n\nAccording to a report by The \u2588\u2588\u2588's Baghdad correspondent, Maliki and his advisers fear they could be arrested or assassinated if they lose their grip on power. Despite losing the backing of many of his former allies and facing pressure to step down from both the US and Iran, Maliki has refused to consider stepping aside or endorsing another candidate. \"Anyone who tells you there is another name besides al-Maliki is wrong,\" says Hisham al-Suhail, a member of parliament from Maliki's State of Law coalition.",
    " Title: A Call for Reason and Compassion in the Immigration Crisis: Addressing the Caravan of Migrants and the Dilemma of Enforcing Immigration Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heartland of Ohio, a federal raid on Corso's Flower and Garden Center in June highlighted the complexities and moral dilemmas surrounding immigration enforcement. The operation, involving approximately 200 agents, resulted in the detention of 114 undocumented immigrants who had been working in the area for decades. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by those enforcing immigration policy, as it involved the apprehension of individuals who were working hard to provide for their families.\n\nAs the caravan of migrants from Guatemala and Honduras makes its way towards the United States, it is essential to approach the situation with reason and compassion. The caravan, primarily composed of families and civilians, should not be met with draconian measures or fear-based rhetoric. The majority of the migrants are not gang members or terrorists, and the national security argument for stopping the caravan is tenuous at best.\n\nThe current immigration debate is often driven by fear of a perceived threat to the nation's identity, as many critics express concern over the potential for an influx of poor, hungry, and brown-skinned individuals changing the national character. However, it is crucial to remember that the U.S. military would not engage against a caravan of civilians, many of whom are women and children.\n\nPresident Trump has suggested the possibility of deploying the U.S. military to stop the caravan, which would violate the Posse Comitatus Act, a law that prevents the military from enforcing civilian laws. The current immigration crisis calls for a thoughtful, patient, and compassionate response, rather than a militarized one.\n\nThe Republicans view the caravan as a potent issue to mobilize their base and secure a strong voter turnout for the upcoming midterm elections. Meanwhile, the Democrats attempt to portray the caravan as a humanitarian issue, downplaying the potential security concerns.\n\nA balanced approach is necessary to address this crisis. Pro-immigration advocates should support President Trump's border wall, as it would help restore order along the southern border and alleviate the hysteria surrounding the immigration debate. In exchange, advocates should announce their support for a path to citizenship for long-time undocumented residents who were brought to the U.S. as children by their parents.\n\nHowever, neither the border wall nor compassion for the DREAMERS will fully resolve the immigration issue. As the world's richest country, the U.S. is situated adjacent to some of the poorest and most violent countries. As long as this imbalance exists, people will continue to seek opportunities in the U.S.\n\nUltimately, a parlay among the affected nations in Central America, Mexico, and the United States is necessary to find a lasting solution to the immigration crisis. By working together, we can address the root causes of migration, provide a path to citizenship for those already in the U.S., and restore order along the southern border.",
    " Title: Reddit Cracks Down on Hate Speech: Over 2,000 Communities Banned for Violating Content Policy\n\nIn a significant move to combat hate speech, the popular online platform Reddit has decided to shut down approximately 2,000 communities that have a history of promoting hate speech. The decision comes amidst a growing movement led by civil rights groups, with several brands also pledging to ban advertisements on Facebook due to similar issues.\n\nThe affected communities include subreddits such as \"Gender Critical,\" a forum known as a Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist (TERF) space, \"The Donald,\" a pro-Trump forum, and \"CapoTrapHouse,\" a radical left forum. Other subreddits on the list include \"The_Donald,\" \"ChapoTrapHouse,\" \"Dark Humor And Memes,\" \"Consume Product,\" \"Cum Town,\" \"ImGoingtoHellforThis2,\" \"Wojak,\" and \"Soy Boys.\"\n\nSubreddits are user-run communities, with over 100,000 active subreddits. Typically, rules for these forums and the enforcement of such policies are controlled by its moderator or creator. However, Reddit administrators have the power to intervene when users break the site's rules.\n\nIn a statement, Reddit stated, \"All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods [moderators] have refused to meet our most basic expectations.\"\n\nSimilar reasons were given for the ban of \"ChapoTrapHouse.\"\n\n\"The_Donald,\" specifically, has a history of promoting hate speech, even before the 2016 election. After its creation in June 2015, it quickly became a hub for extreme political ideas. Despite other communities complaining to Reddit, \"The_Donald\" posts were still visible due to the \"upvote\" and \"downvote\" system, allowing users with the most influence to drive the most popular posts to the site's front page.\n\nLast year, Reddit attempted to address the problem by isolating \"The_Donald\" users from the rest of the site, but the measure was short-lived.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center published a report on \"The_Donald\" in April 2018, highlighting users' paranoia about \"white genocide\" and their support for ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Myanmar.\n\nAnother affected subreddit, \"Gender Critical,\" is one of the site's most active feminist communities, known for its anti-trans rhetoric. With over 64,000 members, \"Gender Critical\" users have regularly denied that trans women are women and have vocally supported JK Rowling's TERF tirade.\n\nThe \"Gender Critical\" community has also been noted for blasting gender-neutral or trans-inclusive language written by trans allies and engaging in hateful discussions about denying trans women access to bathrooms.\n\nIn a concluding statement, Reddit said, \"Ultimately, it's our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.\"\n\nThe company also emphasized that the purge of 2,000 communities is just the beginning of its mission to establish more stringent rules around hate speech.",
    " Title: Conservative Media's Use of \"Fake News\" Label: A Controversial Tactic to Undermine Mainstream Media Credibility\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that echoes Fox News' well-known slogan, the conservative media's appropriation of the \"fake news\" label is a strategy aimed at further eroding the mainstream media's claim to be a reliable and accurate source of information.\n\nAccording to Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters, a liberal group that monitors the news media for bias, this tactic is unsettling because it capitalizes on the conservative audience's pre-existing skepticism towards journalism. \"What I think is so unsettling about the 'fake news' cries now is that their audience has already sort of bought into this idea that journalism has no credibility or legitimacy,\" Carusone said. \"Therefore, by applying that term to credible outlets, it becomes much more believable.\"\n\nRecent examples of this trend can be seen in the conservative media's coverage of President Trump's appointees. When coverage of Andrew F. Puzder's nomination for labor secretary highlighted his opposition to minimum wage increases, writer and radio host Erick Erickson wrote that Puzder should have been given more credit for pointing out that such increases lead to higher unemployment. \"To say otherwise is to push fake news,\" he wrote. (However, the effects of minimum wage increases have been found to vary from city to city.)\n\nInfowars, the website run by conservative provocateur and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, labeled as \"fake news\" a CNN report that Ivanka Trump would move into the office in the White House normally reserved for the first lady.\n\nPresident Trump himself has used the term to deny news reports, as he did on Twitter recently after various outlets said he would stay on as the executive producer of \"The New Celebrity Apprentice\" after taking office in January. \"Ridiculous & untrue \u2014 FAKE NEWS!\" he wrote. (Although he will be credited as executive producer, a spokesman for the show's creator, Mark Burnett, has said it is unclear what work, if any, he will do on the show.)\n\nMany conservatives are pushing back against the outrage over fake news, believing that liberals, unwilling to accept President Trump's victory, are attributing his triumph to nefarious external factors. \"The left refuses to admit that the fundamental problem isn't the Russians or Jim Comey or 'fake news' or the Electoral College,\" said Laura Ingraham, author and radio host. \" 'Fake news' is just another fake excuse for their failed agenda.\"\n\nThis ongoing debate highlights the growing divide between the conservative and liberal media, with each side accusing the other of spreading misinformation and undermining the credibility of the other. As the line between fact and fiction becomes increasingly blurred, it remains to be seen how this trend will evolve in the future.",
    " Title: House Intelligence Committee Subpoenas Rudy Giuliani in Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development in the ongoing impeachment inquiry, the Democrat-led House Intelligence Committee has issued a subpoena to President Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. The subpoena is part of the Democrats' investigation into allegations that President Trump attempted to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, during the 2020 election.\n\nIn a letter signed by House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-CA), House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel (D-NY), and House Oversight Committee Chair Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Giuliani is ordered to produce documents related to the Ukraine investigation by Oct. 15. The letter, posted on the House Oversight Committee's official website, states that the subpoenaed documents will be collected as part of the House's impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe letter begins, \"Pursuant to the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry, we are hereby transmitting a subpoena that compels you to produce the documents set forth in the accompanying schedule by October 15, 2019.\" It continues, \"This subpoena is being issued by the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence under the Rules of the House of Representatives in exercise of its oversight and legislative jurisdiction and after consultation with the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Oversight and Reform.\"\n\nThe letter further states that the Committees are investigating the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with the 2020 election and by withholding security assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression. The letter also mentions the investigation of allegations that Giuliani acted as an agent of the President in a scheme to advance his personal political interests by abusing the power of the Office of the President.\n\nThe letter accuses Giuliani of personally asking the Ukrainian government to target Vice President Biden and of being in possession of evidence indicating that other Trump Administration officials may have been involved in this scheme. The subpoena requires Giuliani to produce all of those communications and other related documents to determine the full extent of this effort by the President and his Administration to press Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe letter concludes by ordering Giuliani to contact staff for the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to arrange for the production of documents.\n\nWhile Democrats are accusing Trump of trying to \"cover up\" his July 25 call to his Ukrainian counterpart, which Trump has repeatedly defended as a \"perfect\" call, Trump authorized the release of the transcript of the call last week. In the call, Trump asked Zelensky to \"look into\" the alleged corruption scandal involving the Ukraine-based company Burisma Holdings that hired Hunter Biden just weeks after his father was appointed by then-President Barack Obama to oversee Ukraine-U.S. relations.\n\nThe letter's language becomes increasingly loaded, with the Democrats accusing Trump of pressuring Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election and of withholding aid to Ukraine. The letter also mentions the allegation that Biden used the threat of withholding $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to force the removal of the country's top prosecutor, who had been investigating Burisma for alleged corruption.\n\nThe letter's conclusion states, \"Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\" The letter does not provide any evidence to support this allegation.\n\nThis development in the impeachment inquiry is a significant step forward in the Democrats' investigation into President Trump's actions regarding Ukraine. The subpoena of Giuliani is a clear indication that the Democrats are taking the investigation seriously and are determined to get to the bottom of the allegations against the President. The outcome of this investigation will have far-reaching implications for the President and the country as a whole.",

Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, has expressed her discontent with CNN after the network failed to include her in a Democratic town hall event just days before the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 11.\n\nLast week, CNN announced its lineups for a two-night town hall event set in New Hampshire on Wednesday and Thursday. The event is set to feature eight Democrat candidates: former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; businessman Andrew Yang and billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer on the first night, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and former Gov. Deval Patrick, D-Mass., on the second night.\n\nGabbard, who is outpolling Patrick in national polls and outpolling Patrick, Steyer, and Yang in New Hampshire, was noticeably absent from CNN's roster. In response, her campaign is planning a demonstration outside the New Hampshire venue where the CNN town halls will take place.\n\n\"This attempt to silence Tulsi is bigger than one person -- it\u2019s our right as voters to hear from ALL the candidates, and to have our voices represented. No institution should be allowed to get away with censoring democracy: That\u2019s why we\u2019re standing up to CNN on Wednesday, February 5th, demanding that our voices be heard,\" the Gabbard campaign said.\n\nCNN did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\n\"We have reached out, I think, more than once, and we received no explanation. I don't even think we've gotten a response to date about why they're excluding the first female combat veteran ever to run for president, the only woman of color in the race,\" Gabbard told Fox News last week.\n\nThe two other candidates who are not scheduled to partake in the CNN town halls are Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. It is unclear if they received an invitation to participate.",
    " Title: Senate's Gang of Eight Launches Aggressive Lobbying Campaign for Immigration Overhaul\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate's bipartisan 'Gang of Eight' is taking an assertive approach in marketing their comprehensive immigration reform bill, aiming to counter conservative criticism and secure broader support within the Republican party. The group, which unveiled the bill after midnight on Wednesday, is actively engaging in conservative talk radio and urging their colleagues to withhold criticism until they have thoroughly analyzed the bill.\n\nThe strategy is part of a broader effort to ensure the bill's passage in the Senate, with the goal of attracting more than a handful of Republican senators. Proponents believe that a widely supported bill in the Senate would put House Republicans in a difficult position to reject it.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a member of the gang, expressed optimism about the strategy, stating, \"Defining the bill quickly is good. We're going to be aggressive in marketing the bill. We're going to be open-minded about making it better. But this is an all-hands-on-deck approach.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Graham and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) made multiple appearances on conservative talk radio, with Rubio planning for more appearances on Thursday. The initial response from the right was less intense than anticipated, according to proponents. Rubio's offices in Washington and Florida received fewer than 500 calls on immigration-related issues on Wednesday, with more than 150 of those calls expressing support for the bill, according to a source in his office.\n\nSome Republican senators, such as Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), have expressed a wait-and-see approach, stating they will review the bill before making a decision. Sen. Cochran, who voted to block the 2007 bill, said, \"I'll take another look at it. I don't want to say yet. But it was a lot better than I thought it was.\"\n\nOn the Democratic side, senators are working to maintain their own support. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), another leading supporter, and Democratic senators privately met with immigration activists to encourage them to support the bill for the \"greater good\" of passing the legislation. The White House is also engaging with House Democrats, with a senior White House official, Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, meeting with House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) to offer broad support for the bill and address concerns about the bill's treatment of undocumented immigrants. The White House also seeks revisions to the bill.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Decision on Travel Ban: A Narrowed but Controversial Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments on the controversial travel ban, partially endorsing the administration's view that the president holds extensive authority over border control. The justices stated that the president's immigration powers are at their peak when there is no connection between the foreign national and the United States.\n\nHowever, the opinion suggests that some justices might find the president's actions exceeding this broad authority, particularly in the case of the travel ban imposed on certain predominantly Muslim countries. The limits imposed on Monday by the court will make the travel ban significantly narrower than the one proposed in the first week of President Trump's term and a later, revised version.\n\nFor President Trump, this legal victory comes after months of criticism from lower courts, which repeatedly reprimanded him for implementing a de facto ban on Muslims entering the country. In May, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Va., described the president's revised order as \"dripping with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.\"\n\nIn response, officials at the Department of Homeland Security stated that the court's decision would allow the department \"to largely implement the President's executive order.\" President Trump echoed this sentiment in his statement, asserting that his travel ban would now \"become largely effective.\"\n\nCritics of the ban, however, dispute these assessments. Cecillia Wang, the deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union, stated that the opinion means the ban will not apply to many people while the court case proceeds.\n\n\"Clearly, the White House press statement today is based on alternative facts,\" Ms. Wang said.\n\nThe court's decision could lead to months of administrative and legal wrangling as consular officials attempt to determine which individuals are allowed to seek entry into the United States and which are barred by the opinion.",

The State Department has confirmed reports of rockets landing in the International Zone, but did not mention the embassy or the extent of any injuries.\n\nThe State Department spokesperson stated that the security situation remains tense, with Iranian-backed armed groups posing a threat. They urged the Iraqi government to take action to protect diplomatic facilities. Recent months have seen multiple attacks in Baghdad's Green Zone, where the U.S. Embassy and other Western countries' embassies are located.\n\nThe spokesperson also noted that there have been 14 attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq conducted by Iran and Iranian-backed militias. Iraq has been caught in the middle of rising tensions between Iran and the U.S. in recent months. Protests erupted at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad after the U.S. struck an Iranian-backed militia, which it says killed a U.S. contractor in an attack.\n\nThe U.S. also killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a strike at the Baghdad airport, prompting Iran to promise retaliation and strike multiple Iraqi bases that housed U.S. troops. That attack resulted in the brain injuries of 34 service members, the Pentagon announced Friday.\n\nThe State Department spokesperson did not directly blame Sunday's strike on Iran, and Iran has not taken responsibility for the attack. Rep. Michael McCaul (Texas), the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, expressed concern over the reports of the rocket attacks on the embassy.\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi denounced the strike and vowed that Iraqi forces would investigate to stop future attacks and punish the perpetrators.",

Board members in the UK and southern Africa, among others, have called for the elimination of \"decades of power and paternalism\" within the organization.\n\nThe letter's authors denounced a perceived \"white savior\" mentality among MSF members. The controversy arose in response to a statement released by the Italian branch of MSF, which suggested that members should discuss the phrase \"all lives matter,\" a statement that some perceived as conflicting with the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nFollowing the backlash, Italy's MSF president, Claudia Lodesani, issued an apology, stating that the Italian branch \"fully supports and stands with the BLM movement and that, like the whole of MSF, we condemn racism and all discrimination.\"\n\nDr. Christos Christou, the international president of MSF, welcomed the letter and expressed the organization's commitment to shifting decision-making power closer to the locations where the needs are and involving patients and communities in the design of intervention strategies.\n\nIn April, MSF halted its partnership with the French migrant transport NGO SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. However, SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e and its ship, the Ocean Viking, have resumed operations in recent weeks. Earlier this month, the Ocean Viking picked up around 180 migrants but was initially denied access to ports in Italy and Malta. The ship was later granted access to a port in Italy after unrest among the migrants on board was reported, including several threats to the crew and suicide attempts by migrants.",
    " Title: Trump-Democrat Tensions Threaten White House Priorities, Including USMCA and Government Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The unexpected walkout of President Donald Trump from an infrastructure meeting with Democrats has left lawmakers questioning the impact on other White House priorities, such as the pending trade deal with Canada and Mexico, known as the USMCA, which the president hopes will replace NAFTA.\n\nIn a heated exchange on Wednesday, Trump, frustrated about Democratic investigations into his presidency, refused to shake hands with Democrats and left the meeting. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., accused the president of throwing \"a temper tantrum for us all to see.\"\n\nIn response, Trump tweeted Thursday morning, \"I was extremely calm yesterday with my meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, knowing that they would say I was raging, which they always do, along with their partner, the Fake News Media.\"\n\nThe president continued, \"Well, so many stories about the meeting use the Rage narrative anyway \u2013 Fake & Corrupt Press!\"\n\nTrump's decision to walk out of the meeting has cast doubt on the status of several White House priorities, including the USMCA. The deal faces a high hurdle in the Democratic-controlled House, and the latest squabble makes its prospects even more uncertain, according to Daniel Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade attorney.\n\n\"The only way for USMCA to get done is for everything to fall just right between the White House and Congress,\" Ujczo said. \"And I\u2019ve seen no objective evidence that could happen. And this is yet another example. At the very least, this is adding delay to a process where we were already up against a tight timing window.\"\n\nAnother potential issue is the funding for the government after September and the raising of the nation's debt ceiling. The White House and lawmakers were making progress this week on a two-year agreement to avoid another government shutdown and the potential for a financial crisis if the government is forced to default on its debt.\n\nWhite House officials did not respond to questions about the trade agreement. An administration official said negotiations on the budget and the debt ceiling continued between the White House and Congress.\n\nIn a series of late-night tweets last month, the president said Republicans would not vote on a plan to deal with health care until after the election. \"Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win \u2026 back the House,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nAs the president rolled out the broad outlines of a proposal last week to deal with legal immigration, he conceded that Democrats might not embrace his ideas. He used nearly identical language to justify holding off on moving forward until next year.\n\n\"We will get it approved immediately after the election, when we take back the House, keep the Senate and, of course, hold the presidency,\" Trump said about the immigration plan. \"One of the reasons we will win is because of our strong, fair, and pro-America immigration policy.\"\n\nSpeaking to an audience in Louisiana last week, Trump suggested the federal government would replace a dilapidated highway bridge \u2013 after he wins a second term.\n\n\"If we win this election, which is just 16 months away, we're giving you a brand new I-10 bridge,\" Trump said to robust applause.\n\nThe ongoing tensions between the president and Democrats could potentially impact other legislative priorities, including infrastructure and drug prices, as both parties struggle to find common ground.",
    " Title: Attorney General Holder Clarifies Domestic Drone Strike Policy, Leaves Door Open for Exceptional Circumstances\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Eric Holder clarified the U.S. government's stance on the potential use of drone strikes against American terror suspects on U.S. soil. While Holder stated that such a scenario is highly unlikely and has never been executed, he did not entirely rule out the possibility under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe issue of drone strikes was first raised during the consideration of John Brennan's nomination to lead the CIA. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) questioned Holder about the constitutionality of targeting an American terror suspect \"sitting at a cafe\" if the suspect did not pose an imminent threat.\n\nIn response, Holder stated that the government has no intention of carrying out drone strikes inside the United States. He reiterated his stance, as expressed in a letter to U.S. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), that the possibility of domestic drone strikes is \"entirely hypothetical.\"\n\nIn the letter, Holder outlined a potential scenario where a president might authorize such action to protect the homeland in cases similar to the 2001 al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington or the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. However, he emphasized that the administration prefers to use law enforcement authorities when dealing with terrorist threats.\n\nSen. Rand Paul was not satisfied with Holder's response, stating, \"The U.S. attorney general's refusal to rule out the possibility of drone strikes on American citizens and on American soil is more than frightening. It is an affront to the constitutional due process rights of all Americans.\"\n\nCNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin noted that Holder made it clear that he would have to examine the facts of each situation separately and advise the president on his legal authority. Toobin added, \"Again, he made a point of saying Sen. Rand Paul's question is hypothetical at this time. But at some point down the road, this may not be hypothetical.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding the use of drones domestically was brought into focus in 2011 when Anwar al-Awlaki, a New Mexico-born individual, was killed in a drone strike in Yemen. Officials stated he played an operational role in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The Obama administration has maintained that targeting Americans overseas with drones is only permissible when the U.S. government determines a suspect to be an imminent threat to the United States and when capture would not be feasible, with all applicable laws being observed.\n\nThe Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel released new documents on its legal rationale to the Senate intelligence panel earlier in the day. Key members who had been pressing for the information expressed satisfaction with the White House's cooperation, stating that the access provided sets an important precedent for the application of the American system of checks and balances to 21st-century warfare. They credited Sen. Rand Paul with raising the use of drones domestically as a question of \"fundamental importance.\"",
    " Title: President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama Report Lower Income, Higher Charitable Donations in 2012 Tax Returns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a disclosure of their 2012 tax returns, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama reported a lower income compared to any other year since the president took office. The couple's nearly $609,000 income was primarily sourced from book sales, accounting for about 40% of their income.\n\nThe Obamas paid $112,214 in federal taxes last year, resulting in an effective federal tax rate of 18.4%. The White House also reported that the Obamas donated almost a quarter of their income to charity, with $150,034 going to 33 charities.\n\nThe majority of the $608,611 in adjusted gross income came from the president's salary, with $394,840 in wages. Book royalties, including the president's 1995 memoir \"Dreams From My Father,\" his 2006 political book \"The Audacity of Hope,\" and a 2010 children's book \"Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters,\" accounted for an additional $258,772.\n\nIncome from Obama's books has decreased since 2009, when the Obamas made $5.5 million, primarily due to a surge in book sales following his inauguration. In 2011, the Obamas reported about $790,000 in income.\n\nThe Obamas signed their tax returns on Monday, a week before the April 15 deadline for Americans to file their 2012 returns. Itemized deductions of $258,385 brought their taxable income down to $335,026. The first family deducted $45,056 in interest on their Chicago home's mortgage, $36,554 in state and local taxes, and $26,751 in real estate taxes.\n\nThrough withholding and estimated tax payments during the year, the Obamas paid $129,029 to the Internal Revenue Service, resulting in an overpayment of $16,815. The Obamas directed that the overpayment be applied to their taxes for the next year.\n\nThe Obamas also claimed $39,875 in income from outside the United States. A White House official stated that all of this income came from book royalties, but did not disclose details about which countries the income came from.\n\nThe president and first lady also paid $29,450 in income taxes to Illinois, according to their state tax returns. The White House also released tax returns for Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden. The Bidens paid $87,851 in federal income taxes on $385,072 in adjusted gross income, for an effective federal tax rate of 22.8%. The vice president and his wife paid state income taxes in two states - $13,531 in Delaware and $3,593 in Virginia. They reported donating $7,190 to charity.",
    " Title: Republican Response to Obama's Deportation Suspension Remains Ambiguous Amidst Election Year\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, President Obama's decision to suspend deportations for some illegal immigrants has elicited a relatively passive response from the Republican party, a phenomenon that stands out in an election year marked by hyper-partisanship. While some Republicans, such as Rick Santorum and Alberto Gonzales, have criticized the move, others have adopted a more equivocal stance.\n\nNotable Republicans, like William Kristol, have openly praised Obama's decision, while figures like Marco Rubio have challenged the circumstances rather than the decision's substance. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, has yet to express a clear stance on the issue, despite his conservative immigration stance during the primaries.\n\nThis ambiguous response from the Republican party could be a strategic move, as candidates often adjust their positions to avoid perceived costs. If Romney were to soften his stance on immigration, he might face accusations of flip-flopping. However, in the face of demographic shifts, particularly among Hispanic voters, such a move could potentially appeal to a larger voter base.\n\nThe theory of an \"emerging Democratic majority,\" proposed by scholars in the lead-up to the 2008 presidential election, suggests that demographic changes can shift public opinion and force political parties to adapt. Hispanic voters, who represented about 9% of voters in the 2008 election, have been a key focus of this theory. Their representation has steadily increased since the 1992 election, from 2% to their current share.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that Hispanic and Asian-American voters are not monolithic in their concerns. A survey by the Pew Hispanic Center found that only about one-third of Hispanic registered voters listed immigration as an extremely important issue, while close to 50% prioritized jobs, education, and health care.\n\nDespite this, many Latinos have disapproved of Obama's handling of deportation policy, and most were aware of the increase in deportations during his tenure. The potential impact of Obama's decision on Hispanic voter turnout remains to be seen, but it could potentially sway a close election.\n\nIn the years between 2009 and 2011, about 2 million people became naturalized citizens of the United States. A significant portion of these new citizens, approximately 40% from Asia and 35% from Latin America, do not traditionally align with the \"white\" demographic. This demographic shift could influence the political landscape, potentially pushing parties towards a 50-50 split of the electorate.\n\nIf Romney chooses to tread softly on the immigration issue, it may be a strategic move to refocus the campaign on economic issues, which are of significant concern to many Hispanics. The percentage of Hispanics voting for Democrats has varied in recent elections, from as low as 53% in 2004 to as high as 73% in 1996. A more moderate stance on immigration policy could help Romney maximize his competitiveness among these voters.",
    " Title: Shift in Political Focus: GOP Criticism of Hillary Clinton Intensifies After Benghazi Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing Wednesday's Benghazi hearing, the focus of criticism from the right has reportedly shifted towards former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The incident in Benghazi, Libya, has become a significant point of contention in Clinton's record as America's top diplomat.\n\nIn the aftermath of the hearing by the GOP-led House Oversight Committee investigating the events surrounding the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans, a pro-Republican opposition research group, America Rising PAC, released an email with the headline \"Benghazi Hearing Raises Serious Questions About Clinton.\" The group followed up with a web video on Thursday, outlining \"the serious questions raised about Hillary Clinton's leadership during the House Oversight Committee hearing.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee, American Crossroads, the Karl Rove-backed pro-GOP super PAC, also issued critical emails regarding Clinton, who was America's top diplomat at the time of the attack last September 11. The group released a web video on Friday morning that questions whether Clinton \"was part of a coverup.\" Additionally, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a potential 2016 GOP White House contender, criticized Clinton in an interview on Thursday on Fox News Channel.\n\nMany Republicans view the deadly attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi and the initial response by the State Department and the White House as a significant scandal, one that they believe Democrats attempted to cover up with the president's re-election less than two months away at the time. The GOP accuses the administration of not bolstering security prior to the attack, of botching the response to it, and of misleading the public in its slow-to-evolve explanation of events.\n\nThey point to five TV appearances by Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who called the armed assault a \"spontaneous protest\" rather than an act of terrorism. Many Democrats disagree and label the GOP's drumbeat a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nWhile President Barack Obama remains in the crosshairs of Republicans and conservatives since 2008, 2016 politics are also at play in this story. Obama cannot run for a third term, and Clinton, who is considering a White House run, would be the instant front-runner for the Democratic nomination if she launches a bid for president.\n\nClinton stepped down as secretary of state with sky-high poll numbers, but the incident in Benghazi is a blemish on her record at the State Department. An independent review of the Benghazi incident, led by Adm. Mike Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and former ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, discovered no wrongdoing by Clinton. However, critics noted at the time that neither Mullen nor Pickering interviewed Clinton.\n\nBefore she stepped down in late January, Clinton testified for hours on Capitol Hill on the Benghazi attack. She was forceful in her defense, and the conventional wisdom at the time was that she was not politically wounded. However, the story was given new legs thanks to the House hearing, which showcased the testimony of State Department whistleblowers who had not previously testified, including the riveting details from an official who was on the ground in Tripoli at the time of the attack in Benghazi.\n\n\"I think the dam is about to break on Benghazi,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham wrote on his Facebook page. \"We're going to find a system failure before, during, and after the attacks. We're going to find political manipulation seven weeks before an election. We're going to find people asleep at the switch when it comes to the State Department, including Hillary Clinton,\" added the South Carolina Republican, a longtime critic of the administration's role in Benghazi.\n\nClinton's specific role did not dominate the hearing, with only one GOP congressman on the panel trying to drill down for specifics. The question now is whether any smoking gun emerged from Wednesday's hearing regarding what Clinton knew and when she knew it. Republicans and Democrats obviously disagree on this question.\n\n\"I rather doubt the current right-wing demagoguery is going to hurt Hillary if she chooses to run,\" said Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala, who was a top political adviser in Bill Clinton's White House. \"It is increasingly looking like the only president named Clinton may be Bill,\" said Castellanos, who is spearheading a new super PAC called NewRepublican.org to refocus the party's messaging and policy goals.\n\nOne thing's for sure: Wednesday's hearing won't be the end of this story. Thursday morning, House Speaker John Boehner called on the president to release emails that he says show how the White House wanted to change the Benghazi attack \"talking points.\"",
    " Title: Cruz's Plan to Defund Obamacare Faces Opposition, but Texas Senator Vows for Grassroots Support\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley on the political talk show \"State of the Union,\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) expressed his determination to defund President Barack Obama's health care plan, but admitted that he currently lacks the necessary support from fellow Republicans to make his proposal a reality.\n\nCruz's plan, which would provide a year of funding for the federal government, minus Obamacare, requires 41 senators or 218 representatives to back his legislation. However, the Texas Republican anticipates a \"grass-roots tsunami\" in the coming month that will rally more conservatives to his cause.\n\nOpponents of Cruz's effort argue that he is risking a government shutdown in an attempt to repeal Obama's health law. They contend that the president would never sign a measure defunding the signature legislation of his five-year tenure.\n\nCruz, however, maintains that Democrats would be the ones causing a government shutdown if they refuse to support a measure that funds all federal programs except Obamacare. He stated, \"President Obama, Harry Reid, will scream and holler that the mean, nasty Republicans are threatening to shut down the government. And at that point, Republicans have to do something we have not done in a long time - stand up and win the argument.\"\n\nCruz has garnered support from a few Republicans in Congress, including Sens. Marco Rubio (FL) and Mike Lee (UT), but many others in his party have expressed concerns that the plan risks alienating Americans tired of partisan bickering over the federal government's finances.\n\nEstablishment figures like Sen. John McCain and last year's GOP presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, have voiced opposition to the plan, as has Sen. Rand Paul, a tea party-backed Kentucky senator who has previously aligned with Cruz.\n\nDemocrats also vehemently oppose the tactic, with former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean calling Cruz's ideas \"crazy\" and referring to him as a \"slick spokesman.\" Dean added, \"God help us if he gets to be anything more than the senator from Texas.\"\n\nCruz was speaking in Houston, where he appeared at a town hall meeting sponsored by the conservative Heritage Foundation to build support for the effort to defund Obamacare. Jim DeMint, the foundation's president and a former senator, stated, \"Obamacare was passed under false pretenses. The American people were lied to, and they have every right to demand that their representatives stop this unfair and un-American law.\"\n\nWatch State of the Union with Candy Crowley Sundays at 9am ET.

    " Title: Texas Senate Race: Cruz and O'Rourke Engage in Heated Debate on Domestic Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly anticipated event on Friday, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger Rep. Beto O'Rourke engaged in a heated debate in Dallas, marking the first of three debates in the closely contested Texas Senate race. The focus of the debate was primarily on domestic policy, with the candidates sparring on issues such as immigration, healthcare, gun control, and the national anthem protests in professional football.\n\nSen. Cruz attempted to portray O'Rourke as a radical leftist, aligning him with figures like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, and other progressive politicians. He accused O'Rourke of advocating for policies such as abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confiscating guns from Texans, and impeaching President Trump.\n\nIn response, O'Rourke accused Cruz of prioritizing tax cuts for corporations over the needs of his constituents. He criticized Cruz for his stance on immigration, claiming that he wanted to deport all Dreamers, and for his alleged absence from Senate duties. O'Rourke also pointed out that Cruz missed half of the Senate votes in 2016.\n\nThe competitive nature of the Senate race, once considered a safe seat for Cruz, has made it one of the most-watched and talked-about contests of the 2018 midterms. Recent polls show the candidates running within single digits of each other, and the Cook Political Report has reclassified the race as a toss-up. This is significant, as Texas has not elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994, and a potential O'Rourke victory could shift the balance of power in the Senate.\n\nThe candidates' stark differences on immigration and border security were particularly evident. Cruz advocated for increased border security measures, including building a wall, while O'Rourke proposed a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe debate also touched on gun control, police violence, and mass shootings, issues that have been particularly relevant in the Dallas area following recent incidents of police shootings and the conviction of a former police officer for the murder of a black teenager. Cruz criticized O'Rourke for his stance on police shootings, while O'Rourke called for universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons.\n\nThe next debates between Cruz and O'Rourke are scheduled for September 30 in Houston and October 16 in San Antonio. The outcome of this race could significantly impact the balance of power in the Senate and serve as a barometer for the political climate in Texas and the nation.",
    " Title: McConnell Secures 51 Votes for Impeachment Trial Rules, Despite Ongoing Disagreement on Witnesses\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that signals the impending start of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has reportedly secured the necessary 51 votes to establish the trial's rules, without a concrete agreement on witness participation.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, McConnell informed his colleagues during a closed-door lunch on Tuesday that he had secured the required backing to initiate President Trump's impeachment trial. The Washington Post first reported the development, while Politico reported that Republicans were growing increasingly confident in their ability to set the trial parameters without input from Democrats.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) expressed his disapproval, stating, \"Republicans may run, but they can't hide\" from the question of whether witnesses and documents will be called in the trial. Schumer declared, \"There will be votes at the beginning on whether to call the four witnesses we've proposed and subpoena the documents we've identified.\"\n\nDemocrats have consistently argued that White House officials with first-hand knowledge of President Trump's dealings with Ukraine, such as former adviser John Bolton, should testify during the trial. Bolton himself stated on Monday that he would testify if subpoenaed.\n\nMcConnell is reportedly planning the trial in a format similar to that of former President Bill Clinton's, with opening arguments being held before a vote to determine which witnesses, if any, would be called to testify.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Thune (R-SD) stated before the lunch that Republican leadership was \"trying to get consensus among Republicans about how to go forward.\" Thune expressed hope that Republican members would be prepared to move forward in accordance with the Clinton trial rules.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has yet to send the articles of impeachment over to the Senate, but Republicans have been increasing pressure on her to do so. Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced a resolution on Monday that would preemptively dismiss the articles if they aren't sent over in a timely manner.",
    " Title: Obama Reflects on a Challenging Year, Emphasizes Focus on Economic Growth and Action in 2014\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press conference marking the end of his first year in his second term, President Barack Obama emphasized the signs of economic growth and expressed his intention to focus on building upon these positive indicators in the year ahead. However, the president did not provide specific details about his policy agenda for 2014, suggesting a possible lack of new initiatives due to the Republican-controlled Congress's resistance and the approaching midterm elections.\n\nThe press conference, which followed a year that began with high hopes and political unity after Obama's decisive re-election, was marked by a somber review of the challenges faced by the administration. The president acknowledged the setbacks on immigration, budget policy, gun violence, and health care that were part of his second-term agenda.\n\nWhen asked if 2014 had been the worst year of his presidency, Obama responded with a laugh, referencing the numerous obstacles he has faced during his tenure. He maintained a resilient demeanor, albeit a weary one, as he addressed the frustrations and failures of the past eleven months.\n\nObama's second-term agenda, while ambitious, was not as comprehensive as his first. The president's approval ratings have reached a record low, and many Democrats have expressed disillusionment due to controversies surrounding the health insurance law and revelations about widespread intelligence surveillance of phone records.\n\nAs the year 2014 approaches, Obama has emphasized the need for action, echoing his words from his second Inaugural Address: \"For now decisions are upon us, and we can not afford delay.\" The president's focus on economic growth and action in the coming year suggests a shift towards more pragmatic, manageable goals in the face of political challenges.",
    " Title: Biden Declares Equality Act as Top Legislative Priority, Vows to Enshrine LGBTQ Protections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a keynote address at the Human Rights Campaign's annual Ohio gala, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden declared that the Equality Act would be his top legislative priority if elected. The former vice president, who was visiting Ohio for the first time since the start of his campaign, expressed his commitment to enshrining LGBTQ protections into the nation's labor and civil rights laws.\n\nDuring his half-hour speech, Biden paid tribute to the activists in attendance and criticized the Trump administration's policies affecting the LGBTQ community. He cited attempts to bar transgender troops in the U.S. military, allow medical professionals to refuse treatment to LGBTQ individuals, and allow homeless shelters to refuse transgender occupants.\n\n\"It's wrong and it is immoral what they're doing,\" Biden said of the Trump administration. \"Just like with racial justice and women's rights, we are seeing pushback against all the progress we've made toward equality.\"\n\nThe Equality Act, which recently passed the Democratic-run House, aims to address such discriminatory practices. However, it will not become law under Trump and the Republican Senate, leaving LGBTQ residents in dozens of states vulnerable to various forms of discrimination that are either specifically allowed or not barred by state law.\n\n\"It will be the first thing I ask to be done,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden's visit to Ohio coincided with more than a dozen of his Democratic rivals speaking at the California Democratic Convention and a massive MoveOn.org conference. By the end of the weekend, 14 candidates will have addressed thousands of activists in California, which has more than 400 delegates to the 2020 convention, about a fifth of what it will take to win the nomination.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who were among Biden's rivals in San Francisco, subtly criticized Biden's absence with jabs. Warren, for instance, suggested that some Democrats believe the only changes they can achieve are \"tweaks and nudges.\"\n\nBiden made no mention of his rivals, focusing instead on his message and his burgeoning confidence in his position atop the Democratic field. Campaigning in a Midwest battleground is no surprise for Biden, who is often touted for his moderate, deal-making, \"Middle Class Joe\" brand, which some argue offers Democrats their best shot to win back the industrial belt that Trump won in 2016.\n\nHowever, the HRC event offered both Biden and his audience a chance to go beyond the simplified framing of the 2020 landscape. Shawn Copeland, HRC's Ohio director, noted that the organization has identified about 1.8 million \"equality voters\" in Ohio, including 400,000 LGBTQ citizens, plus their family members, friends, and other allies. Trump received 2.84 million Ohio votes to Hillary Clinton's 2.4 million in 2016.\n\nBiden used the forum to underscore his long alliance with HRC and LGBTQ activists, a key aspect of Biden's contention that he's more progressive than the party's left flank acknowledges. The former vice president recalled his 2012 presidential campaign when he announced his support for same-sex marriage before his boss, President Barack Obama, had done so.\n\nBiden's remarks were not all light-hearted, as he lamented the widespread discrimination that still exists in the U.S. and abroad. Noting recent killings of black transgender women, he called for an end to such violence.\n\n\"It's outrageous. It must, it must, it must end. The fastest way to end it is to end the Trump administration,\" Biden said.\n\nHe also addressed the high rates of suicide attempts among LGBTQ children and teens, empathizing with the audience, many of whom were once in similar situations.\n\n\"I don't have to tell you how hard it is for these kids, because many of you were these kids. The terror in your heart as you spoke your truth,\" Biden said.\n\nSeveral Democratic hopefuls have addressed HRC state dinners this year. National officials with the organization have worked with the campaigns and state organizations to schedule these occasions. A Biden campaign statement issued before the speech said the choice to go to Ohio proves Biden wants to have conversations about LGBTQ rights \"not just on the coasts of this country, but in the heartland and with any and all Americans.\"\n\nThe venue also allowed him to push back, at least indirectly, at some of the jabs from California. He reminded the audience that he campaigned for many of the freshman House Democrats who helped the party to a net gain of 41 seats\u2014mostly by winning swing or GOP-leaning districts.\n\n\"We didn't have to be radical about anything,\" he said. \"They talked about basic, fundamental rights.\"",
    " Title: Prominent Gay Rights Advocate Apologizes for Hosting Republican Senator Ted Cruz\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a turn of events, one of the two openly gay hoteliers who hosted Republican Senator Ted Cruz at a Manhattan event last week has issued an apology, following a wave of backlash from the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nIan Reisner, in a post on his Facebook page over the weekend, expressed remorse for his actions, stating, \"I am shaken to my bones by the emails, texts, postings, and phone calls of the past few days. I made a terrible mistake.\"\n\nReisner, in his apology, claimed that he was unaware of Cruz's opposition to same-sex marriage. However, many find this claim questionable, given Cruz's public stance on the issue.\n\nReisner and his business partner, Mati Weiderpass, are well-known New York real estate developers and advocates for gay rights. Their hotel, OUT NYC, is renowned for its inclusivity and support of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nThe decision to host Cruz, initially intended to discuss common ground on the issue of Israel, sparked controversy when news leaked. The LGBTQ+ community, through various social media platforms, organized boycotts and launched hate campaigns against the hoteliers.\n\nCritics argue that Reisner's claim of unawareness of Cruz's stance on same-sex marriage is implausible, given the senator's well-documented opposition to same-sex marriage and support for states' rights to define marriage.\n\nThe apology, according to some, is a response to the pressure exerted by the LGBTQ+ community, aimed at demonstrating fealty and ending the backlash. By submitting to the community's demands, Reisner, like many before him, has avoided the potential destruction of his life and career, akin to the Khristallnacht treatment.\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder of the power of public opinion and the importance of awareness and understanding in maintaining unity within the LGBTQ+ community.",

The notes, which include comments such as \"unclear, unfunny, delete,\" were made public after Yiannopoulos sued publisher Simon & Schuster, following the cancellation of his book in February due to footage showing him seemingly condoning pedophilia.\n\nYiannopoulos has since accused Ivers of flirting with him and being biased against his work. The alt-right provocateur's critics have mocked him for the highly critical editorial feedback, with comments such as \"The way you casually bring up the KKK makes no sense\" and \"This entire paragraph is just repeating Fake News. There was NO blood, NO semen and there was NO Satanism. Delete.\"\n\nIvers also attempted to make Yiannopoulos aware of his perceived image, advising, \"You MUST ACKNOWLEDGE that this is EXACTLY what people accuse you and Breitbart of being: a new age of partisan propaganda masquerading as journalism.\" \"This is definitely not the place for more of your narcissism,\" he added.\n\nWhen Yiannopoulos accused feminists of being \"more desperate to be noticed than Kanye West at an awards show,\" Ivers responded with, \"This is what people say about you.\"\n\nThe scathing remarks from Ivers were made public when lawyers for Simon & Schuster filed them in court in response to Yiannopoulos's July lawsuit, where he alleges breach of contract after the deal was cancelled in February.\n\nIn a statement on social media, Yiannopoulos claimed, \"Mitchell Ivers, the liberal gay editor Simon & Schuster put in charge of neutering its edgier conservative authors, hates Republicans and thinks they are all virulent homophobes. He told me so himself.\"\n\nYiannopoulos further stated, \"Ivers said one thing in manuscript edits, but quite another when he was giggling and flirting with me... I look forward to prevailing in court.\"\n\nIn July 2016, Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter for \"inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others.\" This action followed his taking aim at Leslie Jones, a black actress in an all-female Ghostbusters reboot, who received a barrage of abuse from other Twitter users.\n\nYiannopoulos has also been widely criticized for comments he has made about transgender people, Muslims, Black Lives Matter activism, feminists, and gay people, despite being openly gay himself.",
    " Title: The Persistent \"Secret Earpiece\" Conspiracy in U.S. Presidential Debates\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing speculation surrounding the use of \"secret earpieces\" by presidential candidates during debates has resurfaced in the 2016 election, with the latest focus on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The claim, initially sparked by a tweet from actor James Woods and further propagated by the Drudge Report and Infowars.com, suggests that Clinton may have been wearing an earpiece during the recent presidential forum.\n\nHowever, the veracity of this claim remains unverified, with no concrete evidence presented to support the allegation. The debate over Clinton's potential use of an earpiece is reminiscent of similar speculation surrounding George W. Bush and Barack Obama in previous elections.\n\nIn 2004, during the presidential debate between George W. Bush and John Kerry, blogger Joseph Cannon noticed an odd bulge in Bush's suit jacket and speculated that the former president may have been wearing an earpiece. The story gained traction, with \u2588\u2588\u2588.com publishing half-skeptical write-ups and contacting NASA scientists for image analysis. The allegation, however, was never substantiated, and the issue receded after Bush's re-election.\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential debate, blogger Ann Althouse noticed a potential earpiece in Barack Obama's ear and posted a photo, only to later retract her claim. The 2012 election saw minimal earpiece speculation, with most \"cheating\" allegations directed at Republican contender Mitt Romney, who was accused of consulting crib notes during the first debate with Obama.\n\nThe persistence of the \"secret earpiece\" conspiracy in U.S. presidential debates raises questions about the factors driving this phenomenon. Joseph Uscinski, a professor of political science at the University of Miami, attributes this to a combination of a predisposition towards conspiracy theories and partisanship.\n\n\"These sorts of beliefs are dependent on if you have a conspiracy worldview, and then on your partisanship,\" Uscinski said. \"People point fingers at the other side.\"\n\nThe \"secret earpiece\" allegation tends to persist because it is the most plausible method for a candidate to cheat during a nationally televised debate, according to Uscinski. \"It's just like when Hillary Clinton goes on [Jimmy Kimmel Live] and opens the pickle jar,\" Uscinski explained, referring to a humorous feat of strength that Clinton performed to mock questions about her health. \"The only way she could have cheated in that test... was to have a preopened pickle jar. It's sort of obvious that if people are going to be predisposed to thinking that cheating was taking place, that would be the method in which it would be done.\"\n\nWhether or not Matt Drudge and Donald Trump Jr. genuinely believe in the Clinton earpiece conspiracy, their endorsement of the idea legitimizes it in the minds of those predisposed to believe it. As the election approaches, it remains to be seen whether this conspiracy will persist or if it will, like its predecessors, recede back into the shaded corners of the internet.",
    " Title: New Massachusetts Representative Seth Moulton's Military Service and Political Career\n\nArticle:\n\nSeth Moulton, the newly elected Democrat Representative for Massachusetts' Sixth Congressional District, has had an unconventional journey to politics. Unlike many politicians, Moulton did not grow up aspiring to hold political office. Instead, he joined the Marines shortly after graduating from Harvard University, just before the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. He served four combat tours in Iraq, a war he has stated he, and many in his unit, did not believe in.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Gloucester Times, Moulton spoke about his experiences in Iraq, stating, \"It was over there that I saw the consequences of failed leadership. Washington didn\u2019t know what they were doing when they got us into Iraq \u2013 and didn\u2019t have our backs when we were there.\"\n\nMoulton's military service played a significant role in his successful campaign, which saw him unseat nine-term Democratic incumbent John Tierney and defeat state Sen. Richard Tisei. His military service and his focus on reforming the Department of Veteran Affairs were key aspects of his platform. He received endorsements from high-ranking military officials like Generals Stanley McChrystal and David Petraeus.\n\nInterestingly, Moulton has been cautious about publicizing his military career. In an era where politicians often celebrate and exaggerate their military connections, Moulton was praised for downplaying his. He told The Boston Globe, \"There is a healthy disrespect among veterans who served on the front lines for people who walk around telling war stories.\"\n\nMoulton's military bravery has remained relatively private. He was twice decorated for heroism for his actions in Iraq, including receiving a Bronze Star in 2004. His parents only recently learned about this award, according to a campaign spokesman.\n\nBeyond campaigning for VA reform and criticizing the Iraq war, Moulton has also focused on other issues, such as fishing regulation in his district and his business experience. After leaving the Marines, he earned an MBA from Harvard Business School and spent several years working at a startup.\n\nAs a representative elected to a House of Representatives that is now Republican-majority, Moulton's background and his secure position in a deep blue state could make him a bright light from an otherwise dark Election Night for Democrats.",
    " Title: Russia and Ukraine Agree on Ceasefire Plan, Negotiations to Commence in Minsk\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko have agreed on a ceasefire plan following extensive discussions via telephone on Wednesday. The details of the peace deal, though complex and entangled in diplomatic intricacies and domestic politics, are gradually emerging.\n\nInitially, Mr. Poroshenko's office announced a \"lasting ceasefire\" agreement between the two leaders. However, this statement was later amended to indicate that both leaders had endorsed the need for a ceasefire, with Mr. Poroshenko expressing hope for earnest negotiations to begin on Friday. Mr. Putin, in turn, claimed his notes reflected the outcome of the conversation.\n\nIn outlining the plan, Mr. Putin expects Ukraine and the separatists to finalize an agreement after a new round of negotiations in Minsk, Belarus, scheduled for Friday. The talks, which also involve Russia and Europe, include separatist representatives. Notably, the two-day NATO summit meeting is also set to conclude on the same day.\n\nBeyond the ceasefire, the plan, as proposed by Mr. Putin, includes Ukrainian artillery withdrawing and relocating out of range of separatist strongholds, an end to airstrikes, an exchange of all detainees, opening humanitarian corridors for residents of separatist areas, repairing damaged infrastructure, and deploying international observers to monitor the ceasefire.\n\nThe plan does not mention autonomy for the separatist eastern regions, a central political demand that Russia has emphasized since March. This omission is widely perceived as crucial to Russia's long-term objective of maintaining influence over Ukraine's domestic affairs and thwarting any future attempts to join NATO. The evolving situation will continue to be closely monitored as negotiations progress.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Criticism Mounts Over Migrant Family Separation Policy as Trump Digs In\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a contentious political climate, the issue of family separation at the U.S.-Mexico border has become a focal point of controversy, with President Donald Trump maintaining his stance while facing criticism from both sides of the aisle.\n\nThe administration's policy, which resulted in nearly 2,000 children being separated from their families over a six-week period in April and May, has sparked outrage from Democrats and some Republicans. Former first lady Laura Bush called the policy \"cruel\" and \"immoral,\" while GOP Sen. Susan Collins expressed deep concerns about it.\n\nPresident Trump, in a departure from planned remarks on U.S. space policy, defended his administration's policies on Monday, blaming the Democrats for the situation. \"I say it's very strongly the Democrats' fault,\" he stated at the White House. \"The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility. Not on my watch.\"\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have defended the policy, with Sessions calling on Congress to act. \"We do not want to separate parents from their children,\" Sessions said. \"If we build the wall, if we pass legislation to end the lawlessness, we won't face these terrible choices.\"\n\nThe emotional tension surrounding the issue was underscored by first lady Melania Trump, who, in a rare statement on a contentious policy matter, expressed her hope that both sides of the aisle can come together to achieve successful immigration reform.\n\nThe Rev. Franklin Graham, a longtime Trump ally, called the policy \"disgraceful,\" and several religious groups, including some conservative ones, have pushed to stop the practice of separating immigrant children from their parents.\n\nFormer Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci criticized the administration for using the issue to pressure Democrats into negotiating on a Republican immigration bill. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine expressed deep concerns about the child separation policy, stating that it is \"contrary to our values in this country.\"\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi described the policy as \"an utter atrocity that debases America's values and our legacy as a beacon of hope.\" The issue is expected to be a key point of discussion in Trump's meeting with House Republicans on Tuesday, as the House is expected to vote on immigration legislation this week. However, the closely divided Senate seems unlikely to go along with any bill that passes.\n\nThe political landscape remains divided, with both sides urging for a solution that upholds the law while minimizing family separations. The future of immigration policy and the fate of the separated families remain uncertain as the debate continues.",
    " Title: Nine Pivotal States in the 2012 Presidential Race: A Neutral Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2012 presidential race has narrowed down to a core of nine states, a collection of margin-of-error battlegrounds spread across various regions. These states, from New Hampshire in the Northeast to Nevada in the Rocky Mountain West, are generally agreed upon as the key battlegrounds by both the Obama and Romney campaigns.\n\nAside from New Hampshire and Nevada, the seven other states are Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Some of these states are familiar presidential battlegrounds, accustomed to playing a pivotal role every four years. Others are relative newcomers to the swing state roster. Each of these states was carried by President Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the state of play and the forces at work in the nine states:\n\n1. Colorado: With nine electoral votes, Colorado is the biggest prize in the Mountain West. The two campaigns have been heavily investing in this state, with Denver and Colorado Springs being among the top five media markets in terms of ad buys. The Romney campaign aims to turn out the GOP base, especially in the energy-oriented Western Slope and in El Paso County's Colorado Springs, home to a politically active evangelical Christian community and a heavy military influence. The Obama strategy closely resembles the one successfully employed by Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet in 2010. Bennet ran well among Hispanics and benefited from an enormous gender gap.\n\n2. Florida: Florida, with 29 electoral votes, is a familiar battleground state. Both campaigns are focusing on the state's large retiree population, as well as the Hispanic and African-American communities.\n\n3. Iowa: Iowa, with six electoral votes, is another familiar battleground state. The state's agricultural economy and large rural population are key factors in the race.\n\n4. North Carolina: North Carolina, with 15 electoral votes, is another state that has been a battleground in recent elections. The state's large military presence and its growing Hispanic population are key factors.\n\n5. Ohio: Ohio, with 18 electoral votes, is a traditional battleground state. The state's economy, particularly its manufacturing sector, is a key issue.\n\n6. Virginia: Virginia, with 13 electoral votes, is another state that has been a battleground in recent elections. The state's growing population and its large number of suburban and urban voters are key factors.\n\n7. Wisconsin: Wisconsin, with 10 electoral votes, is a state that has not voted Republican at the presidential level since 1984. The state's labor unions and its large urban population are key factors.\n\nCORRECTION: The story has been updated to reflect that the last year Wisconsin voted Republican at the presidential level was 1984.",
    " Title: \"The Debate on Cashless Payments: A New Era Amid the Pandemic\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the debate on cashless payments has taken center stage. As more Americans opt for cashless transactions to avoid potential virus contamination, businesses are adopting cashless protocols. A recent YouGov poll indicates that nearly half of Americans are turning to cashless payments for in-person transactions during the crisis.\n\nProponents of cashless payments argue that they are more hygienic, faster, and more convenient. Cash can carry germs, they contend, and cashless transactions are quicker, as seen in the millions of Americans still waiting for their coronavirus stimulus checks, who could have received the funds directly into their bank accounts. Businesses would also save time and money by eliminating the need to handle cash, and there would be a decrease in thefts due to the absence of money in cash registers and improved payment tracking.\n\nHowever, opponents of cashless payments argue that it is discriminatory, excluding those without bank accounts, such as the young, low-income, homeless, and undocumented individuals. A cashless world would also be challenging for the less tech-savvy, such as the elderly, who may struggle to navigate digital systems. Critics also worry about the potential for increased hacking and privacy concerns, as well as logistical difficulties in a global digital banking system.\n\nThe concept of a digital national currency is being piloted in China, and other countries are considering following suit. In the United States, there have been discussions about providing Americans with \"digital dollars\" for future stimulus relief and banking for the unbanked, but no legislation has been passed yet.\n\nAs the pandemic continues to reshape the world, the debate on cashless payments is a significant issue that touches on hygiene, convenience, equity, and privacy. The future of payments remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the pandemic has highlighted the need for modern, efficient financial systems.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Cites Multiple Factors for 2016 Election Loss, Including FBI Letter, Russian Interference, and Voter Suppression\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, days before the release of her 500-page campaign post-mortem, attributed her 2016 presidential election loss to a variety of factors, primarily the FBI Director James Comey's October letter announcing the reopening of the investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state.\n\nClinton, whose book \"What Happened\" is set for release on September 12, stated, \"I watched how analysts who I have a great deal of respect for, like Nate Silver, burrowed into all the data and said that 'but for that Comey letter, she would have won.' \"\n\nClinton and her team have consistently pointed to the so-called \"Comey letter\" and alleged Russian interference as the two central reasons for her defeat. However, Clinton has given numerous speeches in which she has cited a wide range of other reasons for her loss.\n\nIn a speech in New York City on Thursday, Clinton seemed to blame angry voters, stating, \"I think the kind of leadership I was offering was not satisfying enough for certain people, and it wasn't enough for me to say, 'Look, I understand, and here's what I want to do to help' if I didn't display more anger so that they could feel I got their anger.\"\n\nIn the CBS News interview, Clinton named a host of other reasons, citing Russian \"weaponizing information, negative stories about me,\" and pointing to the leak by WikiLeaks of John Podesta's emails. She also alleged \"voter suppression that we now know had been in the works and really put into effect in a lot of states like Wisconsin and North Carolina.\"\n\nFinally, Clinton blamed \"sexism and misogyny, which are endemic to our society\" and promised that there is a chapter about it in her upcoming book. More reasons for her election defeat are likely to emerge with the release of \"What Happened.\"\n\nAdam Shaw, a politics reporter based in New York, reported this story.

    " Title: \"Greta Thunberg and the Progressive Dilemma: A Reflection on Individuality and Conformity\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the words of Mark 2:27, \"The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath,\" a quote often used by pro-lifers, the debate surrounding the value of an individual's life, from conception to natural end, is a complex and contentious one. This article aims to explore this complex issue through the lens of Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old climate activist who was named Time Person of the Year in 2019.\n\nThe argument often levied against pro-lifers is that they are selective in their concern for life, focusing on the unborn but neglecting the needs of those already born. However, a closer examination of Thunberg's life and the progressive movement she represents reveals a paradox that challenges this narrative.\n\nThunberg, a symbol of the climate crisis, has dedicated her life to a cause not of her own choosing. Her life, from a progressive perspective, mirrors the argument that pro-lifers are criticized for: a life entirely devoted to a cause, with individuality and personal choices subsumed by the cause.\n\nThe degree to which Thunberg's life has been shaped by Asperger's Syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder, is a point of contention. Some argue that her condition has allowed her to be groomed into a zealot for the cause at a young age. This, however, raises questions about the manipulation of individuals, particularly children, for political purposes.\n\nThe progressive movement, often touted as a champion of individuality and diversity, seems to promote a form of rigid conformity that stifles individuality in favor of group think. Thunberg, in many ways, embodies this conformity, having been programmed by her parents to fear a climate Armageddon.\n\nThe question then arises: is this a form of spiritual or ideological abortion, where the individual's unique gifts and talents are discarded in favor of a cause? Is the value of a life, from conception to natural end, determined by its transactional worth to the cause, rather than its inherent value as a human being?\n\nThis is a question that society must grapple with, as we strive to balance the need for collective action with the preservation of individual dignity and human value. It is a delicate balance, one that requires careful consideration and respect for the complexities of human life.\n\nIn the end, it is essential to remember that every life, from conception to natural end, is valuable and deserving of respect. Whether we are born or become activists, our lives are not meant to be sacrificed for a cause, but to be lived with purpose, dignity, and the freedom to make our own choices.",
    " Title: U.S. Government Alters Student Visa Program in Response to Ongoing Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the ongoing impact of the Wuhan coronavirus, the U.S. government has announced changes to its Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) visa program. The changes, effective for the fall semester, will affect foreign students planning to study in the United States.\n\nUnder the new guidelines, nonimmigrant F-1 and M-1 students attending schools operating entirely online will not be allowed to remain in the United States if they are taking a full online course load. The U.S. Department of State will not issue visas to students enrolled in schools and/or programs that are fully online for the fall semester, nor will U.S. Customs and Border Protection permit these students to enter the United States. Active students currently in the United States enrolled in such programs must depart the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status. Failure to comply may result in immigration consequences, including but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings.\n\nNonimmigrant F-1 students attending schools operating under normal in-person classes are bound by existing federal regulations. Eligible F students may take a maximum of one class or three credit hours online. Nonimmigrant F-1 students attending schools adopting a hybrid model\u2014a mixture of online and in-person classes\u2014will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online. These schools must certify to SEVP, through the Form I-20, \u201cCertificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,\u201d certifying that the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load this semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program.\n\nThe rule change requires colleges to update their information in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) within 10 days of the start of the fall semester if instruction starts in-person and is then switched to online-only. Students will be responsible for falling into compliance, either by adjusting their courseload or returning home.\n\nAccording to the Institute of International Education, international students make up 5.5 percent of the United States' higher education population. These students are said to have contributed $44.7 billion to the U.S. economy in 2018. The new visa program changes aim to ensure the continued influx of international students while maintaining the safety and health of the American population during the ongoing pandemic.",
    " Title: Potential Economic Impact of President Trump's Aluminum Tariff on U.S. Beverage Industry\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's proposed 10% tariff on aluminum imports could have a significant impact on the U.S. beverage industry, according to industry experts and trade groups. The tariff, if implemented, could result in increased production costs for beverage companies, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers.\n\nBeverage makers, including Heineken, Molson Coors Brewing Co., and Coca-Cola, have warned Mr. Trump of the potential cost increases. Some of these costs are likely to be passed on to consumers, according to analysts. The Beer Institute, a trade group, estimates that the tariff would amount to a $347.7 million tax on brewers and result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.\n\nMore than half of the beer produced annually in the U.S. is sold in aluminum containers, traditionally marketed to cost-conscious consumers. Brands like Natural Ice and Bud Light, symbols of working-class America, could see price increases due to the tariff. Cans are cheaper and easier to ship than bottles, and they offer good surfaces for colorful, effective branding, which is particularly important for craft beer.\n\nThe tariffs could also lead to a shift in consumer preferences away from beer towards spirits and wine, which are mainly sold in bottles. Soda companies, such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, use more aluminum cans than makers of alcoholic beverages, though only about 29% of soda and other soft drinks are sold in cans, according to the American Beverage Association. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo declined to comment.\n\nBeer makers are not taking the tariff lightly. MillerCoors, the U.S. division of Molson Coors, has stated that the tariff could lead to job losses and increased costs for consumers. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, has also expressed concerns about the tariff's impact on its operations.\n\nFood manufacturers that rely on steel and aluminum for packaging have also asked the administration to exempt packaging containers from the tariffs. The Grocery Manufacturers Association, a trade group representing big food companies, argues that such tariffs would act as a regressive tax on low-income consumers.\n\nThe Can Manufacturers Institute, which represents can makers, has warned that the tariffs could lead to closures of U.S.-based plants and higher food costs for consumers. The industry employs 22,000 workers across 34 states in the U.S. The group also argues that domestic metal supplies can't meet its needs, and it plans to file a petition with the U.S. Commerce Department for relief from tariffs on imports of raw materials that go into cans, including aluminum sheets and steel tin-plate, if the tariffs go through.\n\nPresident Trump has cited trade imbalances and national security concerns as reasons for the tariffs. However, The Beer Institute argues that imported aluminum used to make beer cans is not a threat to national security. Jim McGreevy, the group's president, stated, \"Imported aluminum used to make beer cans is not a threat to national security.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Government Temporarily Halts Prosecution of Parents Crossing Border Illegally with Children Due to Space Constraints\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government has temporarily halted prosecution of parents crossing the border illegally with their children due to a lack of space to house them, officials said on Monday. The move comes after President Donald Trump's administration faced international criticism for its policy of separating immigrant children from their parents.\n\nThe administration has vowed to prosecute all adults who cross the border illegally, but its policy of separating immigrant children from parents has been met with fierce criticism. To address this, the government is now trying to keep detained families together while parents await trial.\n\nThis has created logistical challenges in terms of housing the families, and the Customs and Border Protection agency is no longer referring new cases for prosecution, CBP officials said.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the administration was not dropping its \"zero-tolerance\" policy on illegal immigration but needed a \"temporary solution\" until it can house migrant families.\n\n\"This will only last a short amount of time, because we're going to run out of space, we're going to run out of resources in order to keep people together. And we're asking Congress to provide those resources and do their job,\" Sanders told reporters.\n\nA source at the CBP said it expects to soon resume the referrals for prosecution and is still sending for prosecution those adults who are caught crossing illegally and do not have children with them.\n\nTrump faced a global outcry this month, including sharp criticism from some within his own Republican Party, over migrant children being separated from their parents. He formally ended the policy of separating families last Wednesday, but the administration has yet to reunite more than 2,000 children with their parents, and it is not clear how it will house thousands of families while parents are prosecuted.\n\nThe U.S. military has been asked to prepare to house up to 20,000 unaccompanied child migrants on its bases.\n\nWith Republicans controlling both chambers in Congress, disagreements between moderates and conservatives in the party over immigration matters have hit prospects for a speedy legislative fix to the border crisis.\n\nMark Meadows, leader of a conservative faction among Republicans in the House of Representatives, said on Monday he expected that an immigration bill being worked on by Republicans would fail.\n\nA group of Republican and Democratic senators huddled late on Monday to see whether they might be able to come together on legislation establishing a protocol for treating immigrant families as their pleas for asylum or other protections from deportation are considered.\n\nHowever, after the meeting, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said \"Nothing's going to happen this week\" on legislation in the Senate.\n\nWith Congress out of session next week for the July 4 public holiday, that would mean the Senate could not debate a bill until at least the following week.\n\nTrump has expressed frustration at U.S. immigration laws and reiterated on Monday that people should be turned away at the border. Democrats have accused him of wanting to circumvent the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of due process for those accused of crimes.\n\n\"We want a system where, when people come in illegally, they have to go out. And a nice simple system that works,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nThe immigration crisis has triggered new political tension, and Trump lashed out at a Democratic congresswoman who had urged Americans to confront members of his inner circle in public places.\n\nThe lawmaker, Maxine Waters, told a crowd in her home state of California on Sunday that a Virginia restaurant's refusal to serve White House press secretary Sarah Sanders should be a model for resisting Trump.\n\n\"If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd,\" Waters said.\n\n\"And you push back on them. And you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere. We've got to get the children connected to their parents.\"\n\nTrump fired back on Monday, calling Waters \"an extraordinarily low IQ person.\"\n\nLast week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was confronted at a Mexican restaurant in Washington by protesters yelling: \"Shame! Shame!\"\n\nHouse of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called for cooler heads on both sides.\n\n\"Trump's daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable,\" she said. \"As we go forward, we must conduct elections in a way that achieves unity from sea to shining sea.\"",
    " Title: Terrorist Attack in Tel Aviv Complicates Ceasefire Efforts in Gaza Strip\n\nA bomb explosion on a bus in central Tel Aviv on Wednesday has left at least 10 people injured, in what Israeli officials are describing as a terrorist attack. The incident occurred just one day after the terrorist group Hamas discussed a possible ceasefire.\n\nThe blast, which occurred on a tree-lined street next to Israel's huge defense ministry complex, shattered windows on the bus. Israel's ambulance service reported that three of the wounded were in a severe condition.\n\nOfir Gendelman, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, confirmed that this was a terrorist attack. He stated that police were currently combing the area for the person who planted the device, confirming reports that it was not a suicide attack. Israeli media reported that a man had been arrested.\n\nThe bombing took place on the eighth day of an Israeli offensive against the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. Celebratory gunfire rang out across the Palestinian enclave when local radio stations reported news of the explosion.\n\nYesterday, Israel remained skeptical about a truce deal with Hamas, even with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the country and with the administration putting pressure on Egypt to broker a deal.\n\nHamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri praised the bombing, but stopped short of claiming responsibility. He stated, \"Hamas blesses the attack in Tel Aviv and sees it as a natural response to the Israeli massacres... in Gaza.\" He added, \"Palestinian factions will resort to all means in order to protect our Palestinian civilians in the absence of a world effort to stop the Israeli aggression.\"\n\nWith this latest attack, Israel is much more likely to proceed with a ground invasion of Gaza, something Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu postponed in hopes of reaching a diplomatic solution first.",
    " Title: Polling Results Reveal Concerns Over Free Speech in the United States\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll by YouGov has revealed a growing concern among Americans about the protection of free speech, particularly when it comes to unpopular or extreme views. The survey, which asked the public about their opinions on censorship and banning certain worldviews, has shown a significant number of respondents in favor of suppressing speech from groups such as neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan (KKK).\n\nAccording to Allahpundit's analysis, the impulse towards censorship appears to be bipartisan, with only small pluralities of Trump supporters making an exception for the KKK. Pluralities of Democrats and Republicans agree that neo-Nazis and Klansmen should be subject to bans from speaking in their community, from having their literature carried by the local public library, and from teaching at the local college.\n\nThe survey also found that Americans are roughly evenly split on whether people should be barred by law from joining the Klan (35% in favor, 39% against) or the American Nazi Party (38% in favor, 37% against). However, there is one demographic that stands out in the case of the KKK: \"Narrow pluralities of Trump voters would allow the speech (49% in favor, 39% against) and keep the book on the shelves (46% would not remove the book, 39% would),\" according to the poll.\n\nThe survey also asked about ISIS, and the results showed a stronger inclination towards censorship, with Republicans leading Democrats in wanting to remove ISIS books from the library by 14 points. The interpretation of these results depends on one's perspective, with some seeing it as a sign of conservatives viewing the issue more starkly when Muslim radicals are the problem group, while others see it as a response to the lethal threat posed by ISIS.\n\nThe poll did not include any explicitly left-wing organizations or movements, such as Antifa. The response to Antifa would likely be the opposite of the KKK, with self-described Democrats outflanking Trump voters on censoring KKK speeches or writings.\n\nFor those in the hardcore pro-First Amendment camp, the survey also raises concerns about the ACLU's stance on free speech. The ACLU, a long-standing bastion of First Amendment absolutism, has been criticized for appearing to waver in its commitment to free speech in the face of political tribalism. However, the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on the First Amendment has been consistently and lastingly strong, with unanimous rulings on both fronts in recent years.\n\nThe survey also highlights the issue of private coercion, with outrage mobs using social media and corporate actors to suppress controversial opinions and ruin lives, often with little recourse for the target. This issue was explored in a recent essay by Megan McArdle, titled \"Private Coercion.\"",
    " Title: Military Sexual Assault Reform: Senate Bill Aims to Strengthen Legislation and Combat Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move towards addressing the issue of military sexual assault, a series of measures are being proposed in the Senate. These reforms aim to strengthen the military's response to sexual assault cases and curb the occurrence of such incidents.\n\nThe proposed changes include a mandatory review of decisions by commanders not to prosecute sexual assault, making retaliation a crime, and subjecting sex offenders to automatic dishonorable discharges. Commanders would also no longer be able to overturn jury convictions unilaterally.\n\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand, a co-sponsor of the bill, stated, \"What\u2019s been lost in all this is that for the first time ever we are going to have strong legislative changes that are going to make a real difference in curbing sexual assault.\"\n\nThe push for these changes has gained momentum in recent months, with a series of high-profile cases and startling sexual assault data released by the Defense Department. Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, who is also a co-sponsor of Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s bill, described the recent events as \"a legitimate policy dispute that resulted in significant, meaningful reforms.\"\n\nEugene R. Fidell, who teaches military justice at Yale Law School, commented on the issue, stating, \"Statements by high officials have always been problematic. On the one hand, people do look to them to take a stand on things; on the other hand, we are administering justice here.\"\n\nThe debate over commanders' power in military prosecutions has been a topic of contention. A Navy judge recently ruled that two defendants in military sexual assault cases could not be punitively discharged due to President Obama's public remarks that offenders should be \"prosecuted, stripped of their positions, court-martialed, fired, dishonorably discharged. Period.\" This decision was first reported by Stars and Stripes.\n\nThe measures proposed in the Senate are part of a broader effort by lawmakers from both parties to combat the problem of sexual assault in the military, an issue that has been a concern for many years. However, recent events have put a stronger spotlight on the issue, leading to a renewed push for reform.",

As of 5 a.m. ET Thursday, the hurricane was approximately 150 miles north-northwest of Puerto Rico, moving at a speed of 13 mph towards the northwest.\n\nThe storm's maximum sustained winds were 85 mph, surpassing the threshold for a Category 1 hurricane, with higher gusts. Earlier, Dorian had caused limited damage in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with only minor power outages reported in some areas.\n\nThe NHC predicts that Dorian will strengthen into a dangerous Category 3 hurricane, defined as sustained winds of at least 111 mph. Heavy rains are expected to affect parts of the Bahamas, Florida, and other regions in the Southeastern United States later this week and into early next week.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency for 26 counties potentially in the hurricane's path. The NHC has discontinued the Hurricane Warning for Vieques, Culebra, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Hurricane Watch and Tropical Storm Warning for Puerto Rico.\n\nCurrent predictions suggest that Dorian's center will make landfall on Florida's coast late Sunday or early Monday. The exact location of the eye's landfall is still uncertain, and everyone in the affected area is advised to make emergency preparations.\n\nThe NHC anticipates that the northern Bahamas and coastal sections of the Southeast United States could experience 4 to 8 inches of rain, with up to 10 inches in isolated areas. This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods.\n\nIn addition to Hurricane Dorian, Tropical Storm Erin formed late Tuesday, with winds reaching 40 mph. Erin, located several hundred miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, was downgraded to a tropical depression on Wednesday. Erin is expected to maintain a north-northeastern track, potentially reaching Canada's coast later this week.\n\nPresident Trump has declared an emergency in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide necessary equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. Puerto Rico's Governor Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced expressed gratitude for the declaration, stating that it would expedite federal aid after the storm passes.\n\nFEMA reported that its supplies on Puerto Rico, compared to 2017 levels, include three times as many generators, nine times as many meals, five times as many liters of water, and 16 times as many blue tarps.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Dorian and Tropical Storm Erin, it is crucial for individuals in the affected areas to stay informed, heed warnings, and make necessary preparations to ensure their safety and the safety of their communities.",
    " Title: The Obsessive Political Climate: A Critique on the Intrusion of Politics into Everyday Life\n\nArticle:\n\nIn today's society, it seems that politics has become an inescapable part of our daily lives, a trend that is not only exhausting but also detrimental to the essence of enjoyment and leisure. This encroachment of politics into every aspect of our lives, often referred to as the 'All Politics, All The Time' phenomenon, is increasingly becoming the norm, and it is causing a significant shift in our culture.\n\nOne notable example of this trend can be seen in the transformation of Teen Vogue, a once-popular magazine known for its focus on fashion and beauty, into a politically charged platform. Articles published by the magazine often convey a message of constant anger and political awakening, with pieces such as a recent essay that declared, \"Women should be angry all the time.\"\n\nAnother instance of this political intrusion can be seen in the collective outrage over Melania Trump's choice of footwear during a Hurricane Harvey publicity visit. The first lady's decision to wear high heels sparked a flurry of think pieces in major media outlets, with critics bemoaning the 'optics' of her footwear choice, despite the fact that she had brought tennis shoes for her time in Corpus Christi.\n\nEven pop culture icons, such as Taylor Swift, are not immune to this political creep. A recent New York magazine article asserted that Taylor Swift embodies the Trump culture, suggesting that the president's presence is omnipresent in certain circles and that his administration has given a home to a grim and cynical strain of pop culture.\n\nIt is important to remember that, at times, Taylor Swift is simply Taylor Swift, a pop star known for her music and relationships, rather than a political figure. The constant political hand-wringing and hectoring that characterizes our culture today is not unique to the Trump era, as evidenced by the backlash Michelle Obama faced in 2009 for wearing expensive shoes to a food bank.\n\nIn conclusion, it is crucial for us to recognize and address the alarming political intrusion into our everyday lives. By extending politics into every sector of our lives, we are complicit in the war on fun. It is essential for us to strive for a more balanced approach to our culture, one that allows for enjoyment, leisure, and political engagement without the constant, exhausting, and cringe-worthy intrusion of politics into every aspect of our lives.",
    " Title: Partisan Bias in Climate Policy: A Study on Washington State and its Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nIn two separate studies, we surveyed Democrats, Republicans, and independents in Washington State regarding a carbon tax initiative that was on the ballot in 2016. The study found that participants tended to support climate policies that were perceived as endorsed by their own party, and remained neutral towards policies backed by the opposing party.\n\nThe research suggests that people's support for climate policies is significantly influenced by partisanship. Democrats were more likely to support policies they believed were backed by their party, while Republicans supported policies they understood to be Republican-backed. This phenomenon occurs because individuals estimate their fellow citizens' responses to policies more adversely than they actually are, and their own support for a policy is strongly correlated with these exaggerated estimates.\n\nThis finding aligns with the fundamental lessons of social psychology, which underscores the profound impact that other people's opinions have on individuals. In an effort to be accepted members of their political tribe, people are drawn towards embracing the stances of their peers and are reluctant to publicly disagree with them.\n\nThe studies revealed that the actual level of political polarization on climate change belief and support for climate policy is significantly less than people perceive it to be. This suggests that climate policy gridlock may be largely due to overestimating disagreement rather than genuine ideological differences.\n\nHowever, there is a glimmer of hope. The studies showed a consistent pattern: Political disagreement was substantially smaller when it came to Republican-backed policies. In particular, there was very little distance between Republicans and Democrats when evaluating a Republican-proposed carbon tax. This suggests that a carbon tax, such as the one proposed by prominent Republicans like James Baker III and George Shultz, may hold more promise for bipartisan agreement than we have seen with Democratic policies in the past.",
    " Title: Croatia Deploys Army to Manage Increased Refugee and Migrant Influx at Border\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to an influx of over 10,000 refugees and migrants in the past two days, Croatia has mobilized its military to manage the situation at its border with Serbia. As Hungary closed its borders, Croatia has become an alternative entry point into European Union countries.\n\nJournalist Lauren Frayer, reporting from the Croatia-Serbia border, spoke to Jamal al-Shahoud, a refugee from Syria, who said, \"Here, there's no food, no water. No buses, no trains. Nothing here. Just tired.\"\n\nThe influx of migrants and refugees continues, with people breaking through police lines and running into the countryside. Croatia is under significant pressure, according to al-Shahoud, who is on the front line of the situation.\n\nCroatia has closed highways leading in from Serbia, and Hungary has started building a fence on its border with Croatia, in addition to two other fences along its borders with Serbia and Romania.\n\nCroatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic stated that his country will not and cannot seal its border entirely. Instead, the country plans to guide people along to neighboring countries. Milanovic said, \"You are welcome in Croatia and you can pass through Croatia. But, go on. Not because we don't like you but because this is not your final destination.\"\n\nEU member nations are expected to meet next week to discuss their response to a crisis in which more than 440,000 refugees and other migrants have reached Europe this year. More than half of them have come from Syria, fleeing that country's civil war.\n\nOn Wednesday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees urged Europe to make changes, such as establishing reception centers in Greece (where more than 300,000 people have made their first landfall). The centers could register and screen those arriving, the U.N. agency said. Similar centers could be set up in Serbia to register and relocate the new arrivals.\n\nThe U.N. agency also called for each EU member nation to accept 40,000 refugees, in addition to the voluntary amounts to which they've already committed.",
    " Title: Unprecedented Nuclear Diplomacy: US, European Ministers Convene in Geneva for Iran Nuclear Talks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, high-level diplomats from the United States, Iran, and several European countries have gathered in Geneva for a series of talks aimed at reaching a first-step agreement on Iran's nuclear program. The unexpected development follows nearly two years of stalled negotiations, with Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stating that a joint text is being prepared, but a \"very difficult task\" lies ahead.\n\nThe sudden convening of the talks has sparked criticism from various opponents, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has denounced a potential deal as a \"historic mistake.\" Hard-line Iranian clerics have also voiced their opposition to any accommodation with the West.\n\nUS officials are pushing for an initial deal that would halt the advancement of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for limited sanctions relief, while Iran is seeking a clear endgame that allows for a robust peaceful nuclear program, including uranium enrichment on Iranian soil, and the lifting of all sanctions.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Zarif emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating, \"A day is a tall ambition [to finalize a text]; we will all try.\" He expressed his readiness to work as long as necessary to reach an agreement, before opponents can create obstacles.\n\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry, who was initially in the region working on Israel-Palestinian peace, has joined the talks, along with the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Germany. The European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton, who leads negotiations on behalf of the P5+1 (the US, Russia, China, Britain, France, and Germany), invited Kerry to participate in a trilateral meeting with Zarif.\n\nAs hopes for a nuclear deal with Iran grow, so does the rhetoric of its opponents. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has denounced the proposed agreement, while hard-line Iranian clerics have warned that any deal in Geneva would be harmful to Iran. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has given unprecedented support to Iran's negotiating team, praising them as \"sons of the revolution\" to quell hard-line opposition.\n\nThe new chances of a deal are causing concern among Iran hawks in Congress, who are now moving to speed up fresh sanctions measures. Zarif warned that any new US sanctions would spark a fierce reaction in Tehran and deepen mutual mistrust that has long plagued these talks.\n\nDespite the challenges, Zarif expressed optimism, stating, \"This is an opportunity that one year down the road, if not seized, will be wished for \u2013 and can not be regained again.\" The outcome of these talks could have significant implications for regional and global security.",
    " Title: Unusual Moments and Key Exchanges in Saturday's GOP Debate Before New Hampshire Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nSaturday's GOP debate, the final one before Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, was marked by several key moments and heated exchanges among the Republican candidates. Here are five notable instances:\n\n1. Ben Carson's Unusual Stage Entrance:\nThe debate started off unconventionally when Ben Carson refused to walk out to his podium, causing a delay. Ted Cruz eventually took the stage, followed by Donald Trump, who stood beside Carson instead of walking out himself. Jeb Bush walked past them as he took the stage. The moderators had to call Carson's name twice, and even \"lastly\" called out Donald Trump, seemingly realizing they still had to call out John Kasich.\n\n2. Christie vs. Rubio:\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wasted no time in taking shots at Sen. Marco Rubio. In a heated exchange, Christie criticized Rubio's pattern of missing votes in the Senate, a criticism that has followed Rubio throughout the nomination contest. Rubio, in response, repeatedly used a line about President Obama \"knowing exactly what he's doing.\"\n\n3. Rubio's Repeated Phrase:\nMarco Rubio's repeated use of the phrase \"Obama knows exactly what he's doing\" became a recurring theme during the debate, drawing criticism from Christie. Rubio used the line multiple times, even after Christie had busted him for it.\n\n4. Trump's Performance:\nDonald Trump, who leads in recent New Hampshire polls, had an \"unremarkable\" performance, according to typical Trump standards. He stuck to his usual talking points and had few major tangles with his opponents. However, Trump's argument with Jeb Bush over eminent domain and his command for Bush to \"be quiet\" while he answered was met with boos from the crowd.\n\n5. Torture and ISIS:\nIn a line of questioning about ISIS and foreign policy, moderator David Muir asked the candidates about waterboarding, a controversial interrogation technique. Ted Cruz stated that waterboarding is not torture under the definition of torture, but he would not bring it back in widespread use. Donald Trump was more forceful, stating he would bring back waterboarding and \"a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.\" Jeb Bush seemed to rule out waterboarding, instead suggesting expanding intelligence capabilities. Marco Rubio did not directly answer the question about waterboarding being torture, instead emphasizing the need to keep tactics secret to avoid tipping off the enemy.\n\nIn addition, Cruz found himself on the defensive over his campaign's actions during the Iowa caucuses, as he was asked to explain his campaign's reporting of Ben Carson suspending his campaign, which was based on a CNN report. Cruz apologized to Carson on stage, with Carson later stating the incident was indicative of Cruz's \"DC values.\"",
    " Title: Pentagon Holds Course on Transgender Troops as Trump's Directive Remains Unclear\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that signifies a potential standoff between the White House and the Pentagon, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford has announced that the Department of Defense will not implement any changes to the current policy regarding transgender troops until formal implementation guidance is received from the Secretary of Defense.\n\nCurrently, approximately 15,000 transgender troops serve openly in the U.S. military. In June of 2016, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced that transgender troops could come out without fear of discharge and established a plan for open transgender enlistment within a year. However, on Wednesday, President Trump declared via Twitter that transgender individuals would not be allowed to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\n\nTrump's sudden announcement raised concerns about the potential dismissal of thousands of transgender troops in active service. The President's decision was made without consultation with the Pentagon, and it appears he did not discuss the issue with his Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, who has previously supported open transgender service.\n\nThe Pentagon's decision to maintain the status quo, as indicated by General Dunford's letter, suggests a discomfort with Trump's declaration. In his letter, Dunford emphasized the importance of treating all personnel with respect and maintaining focus on assigned missions. This stance implies that Trump's policy could potentially entail disrespectful treatment of service members and a distraction from the military's primary objectives.\n\nThe Navy has clarified that, for now, transgender troops may continue to serve and receive transition-related medical care. However, the lack of clear guidance from the White House has left military leaders in a precarious position, balancing Trump's tweets with formal policy.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, the Pentagon's adherence to established policy and General Dunford's careful wording suggest a potential resistance to Trump's directive. Secretary Mattis will soon have to decide whether to escalate this resistance into concrete pushback against the President's announcement.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Unity in Washington: A Focus on Foreign Conflicts Over Domestic Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, politicians from both parties in Washington have found common ground, not in addressing domestic issues, but in their response to foreign conflicts. From the \"Dreamers\" to the Haitian boat people, Olde Europeans, Sudanese, and now the Kurds, it seems that the unity of American politicians is not sparked by support for American citizens, but rather by foreign affairs.\n\nThe recent focus on the Kurds, who are currently embroiled in a civil war in Syria, has led to a rare display of bipartisan cooperation, with Democrats and Republicans drafting legislation together. This level of unity, which has not been seen for regular Americans in years, if not more than a decade, is striking, especially considering the ongoing stalemate on crucial domestic issues such as the USMCA trade agreement.\n\nThe bipartisan support for the Kurds is so strong that some claim the resulting legislation will be \"veto-proof.\" This level of support for a foreign issue is a stark contrast to the lack of unity on issues that directly impact American citizens, such as the USMCA trade agreement, which has the support of thousands of family farmers across the United States.\n\nThe focus on foreign conflicts has led to a divide within the Republican party, with some, like President Trump, advocating for a withdrawal from foreign wars, while others, such as military veterans, are criticized for offending half the politicians in Washington. The debate over the Syrian conflict has even led to the headline \"Trump unites the GOP \u2014 against him\" on the Politico website.\n\nThe bipartisan support for foreign conflicts raises questions about the priorities of American politicians. While the Kurds are undoubtedly brave and hardworking, it is concerning that politicians seem to prioritize foreign issues over the needs of American citizens. The lack of unity on domestic issues, such as the USMCA trade agreement, highlights the need for politicians to focus on the needs of their own constituents.\n\nIn conclusion, it is unusual to see such a strong bipartisan response to foreign conflicts, while domestic issues remain unaddressed. It is crucial for American politicians to prioritize the needs of their own citizens and work together to address the issues that directly impact their lives.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Gains Access to Ready for Hillary Email List, Bolstering Fundraising and Organizing Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move for the Democratic front-runner's presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton's team has obtained access to the full Ready for Hillary email list, a valuable data resource that is expected to boost the campaign's fundraising and organizing efforts. The campaign secured entry to the independent super PAC's list through a swap with another independent group, according to a Democratic source who spoke to \u2588\u2588\u2588. The identity of the other group remains undisclosed.\n\nThe acquisition of the list, which contains nearly 4 million names, comes as a relief for the Clinton campaign, which had been relying on an outdated supporter list from 2008. For the initial six weeks of Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, the data trove, primarily created by Ready for Hillary to gather a plug-and-play list of supporter names with contact information, was unavailable due to legal reviews. The campaign had the option to either trade the old list for the new one or rent select pieces of the list, such as names of volunteers in Iowa. However, the campaign opted for access to the entire list.\n\nTracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist who served as a senior adviser to the independent super PAC before its shutdown, emphasized the importance of the Ready for Hillary list. \"I could offer about 4 million reasons why the Ready for Hillary list is an important resource,\" Sefl said.\n\nTo illustrate the significance of the list, the article highlights the experience of Lynette Hull, a 17-year-old high school student from Las Vegas who was one of the first interns to sign up with the campaign after Clinton announced her presidential bid. Hull, a national honors society student at Liberty High School, was tasked with phone-banking, reaching out to Clinton supporters from an old database. However, Hull found the process time-consuming and unproductive, with many potential volunteers either unreachable or too old to volunteer.\n\nThere is some overlap between the Ready for Hillary list and the campaign's own list of supporters. When Clinton officially announced her presidential bid six weeks ago, Ready For Hillary emailed its list six times, encouraging them to sign up with the official campaign. Clinton staffers have also been signing up new supporters in the early states on their own. A spokesperson for the Clinton campaign declined to comment for this report.",
    " Title: San Francisco's Odd Dual Approach to Regulation: Banning Straws and Subsidizing Cafeterias\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the bustling city of San Francisco, the progressive landscape is marked by a peculiar duality in its regulatory approach, with two recent ordinances that seem to contradict each other. On one hand, the city has taken a hard stance against plastic straws, joining a growing list of progressive enclaves in banning the use of these items. On the other hand, the city has proposed a ban on free food and drink cafeterias in tech companies, a move aimed at supporting local businesses.\n\nLast week, two San Francisco supervisors proposed a ban on company cafeterias, citing the negative impact they have on local restaurants. The proposed legislation is designed to help local eateries by encouraging employees to dine out instead of relying on in-house cafeterias. This move, while seemingly counterintuitive, is part of a larger effort to support local businesses.\n\nIn a surprising twist, the city has also taken a firm stance against plastic straws. On July 19, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to ban the distribution and sale of straws in restaurants, bars, and convenience stores. The city joins a list of progressive cities, including Seattle, Malibu, Santa Cruz, and Santa Barbara, in enacting such a ban. However, the impact of this ban on plastic waste is questionable, as straws account for a minuscule percentage of the plastic waste entering the ocean.\n\nMeanwhile, a third regulatory move has gone relatively unnoticed amidst the discussion about plastic straws and cafeterias. Last month, San Francisco supervisors voted unanimously in favor of a resolution urging the city to screen insurers for their investments in coal and tar sands. This move, if implemented, would make San Francisco the first U.S. municipal body to force insurance companies to stop insuring and investing in fossil fuels.\n\nThis regulatory approach, characterized by a mix of bans and subsidies, presents a complex and perplexing picture for observers. The city's actions seem to be driven more by social causes than by a clear understanding of the environmental impact of the targeted items. As the city navigates this regulatory landscape, it remains to be seen what the next cause will be and how it will be addressed.",
    " Title: White House Argues Lack of Formal Vote for Impeachment Inquiry Weakens Democrats' Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Fox News senior judicial analyst and Fox Nation host Judge Andrew Napolitano has backed the legal argument behind a White House letter expected to be sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arguing that the White House does not have to comply with the Democrats' impeachment inquiry. The letter, which may be sent as early as Friday, reportedly dares Pelosi to put the question of a formal impeachment inquiry before the House of Representatives for a vote.\n\nOn Sept. 24, Pelosi announced that House Democrats would undertake the probe without asking for the support of the members of the House. Wall Street Journal Editorial Page Editorial Board member Bill McGurn explored the issue on Fox Nation's \"Deep Dive,\" stating, \"If we're hearing how serious impeachment is\u2014what does it say for Mrs. Pelosi to do this in a way that's without precedent? It's just a decree on her part.\"\n\nJudge Napolitano, host of Fox Nation's \"Liberty File with Judge Napolitano,\" explained that the White House's argument has merit, as the White House is not required to comply with the Democrats' investigation because Pelosi has not codified the probe with a formal vote on the House floor. He noted that Speaker Pelosi is not required to put the question of an impeachment inquiry up for a vote, but if she did, and if it was approved by a majority of House members, her inquiry would be strengthened.\n\nThe judge further stated, \"Mrs. Pelosi is correct that the Constitution does not require a full House vote, before the House begins an impeachment inquiry, but when it does so\u2026 without the full House vote it does so based on federal law\u2026 that authority comes from statutes, not the Constitution. That's very significant. When an authority comes from a statute, there are other statutes that can contradict it.\"\n\nThe judge also discussed the potential implications of a formal vote, stating, \"If\u2026 the House of Representatives voted by majority vote to proceed with an impeachment inquiry, that changes the rules all together. There are no privileges because the House's right to impeach comes from the Constitution and the Constitution trumps\u2026 any statute that would interfere with it.\"\n\nIn the latest episode of \"Liberty File with Judge Napolitano,\" the judge spoke with two Republicans mounting presidential primary challenges against President Trump in 2020. The judge asked them about Democrats' allegations that the president violated his oath of office by asking the president of Ukraine to investigate his political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nFormer Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld agreed with the president's critics, stating, \"The conduct that the president has engaged in is precisely the sort of conduct that the Framers were worried about and why they put the impeachment and removal power in the hands of Congress. They were worried about, number one, foreign interference... In the Oval Office, the president said that he doesn't care as much about the interference in the 2016 election, that 'everybody does it.' There couldn't be a more clear instance of inviting foreign interference. And of course, the Ukraine call goes right into the same thing.\"\n\nFor those interested in Judge Napolitano's analysis and the full episode of the latest edition of \"Liberty File with Judge Napolitano,\" it can be found on Fox Nation.

    " Title: Jussie Smollett Files Countersuit Against City of Chicago, Alleging Malicious Prosecution\n\nActor Jussie Smollett, known for his role on the television series \"Empire,\" has filed a counterclaim against the city of Chicago and several individuals, including police officers and two brothers, in connection with a purported hate crime that occurred in late January.\n\nSmollett initially claimed he was a victim of a racist and homophobic attack, but the city later determined that the alleged attack was a hoax. Smollett faced 16 counts related to making false statements to police, but he agreed to community service and a $10,000 fine in exchange for the charges to be dropped.\n\nAccording to the Chicago Sun-Times, Smollett's counterclaim alleges that a \"malicious prosecution\" caused him a variety of issues such as \"humiliation, mental anguish, and extreme emotional distress.\"\n\nSmollett's counterclaim was in response to a lawsuit filed by the city of Chicago against the actor to recover $130,106 from an investigation into the incident. In August, Smollett requested that the city's lawsuit be thrown out, stating that he could not have known what the police investigation would cost. He also insisted that the attack was legitimate, but U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall said the case would continue onto the discovery phase.\n\nAs of August, Smollett's team still insisted that it had evidence that the hate crime hoax was real.\n\nSmollett's counterclaim names the city, the Chicago Police Department, Detectives Michael Theis and Edward Wodnicki, Supt. Eddie Johnson, and the two brothers involved in the alleged attack, Abimiola and Olabinjo Osundairo.\n\nThe counterclaim states that proceedings against Smollett were terminated in his favor and \"in a manner which indicates his innocence because all 16 counts of the criminal indictment were dismissed two and a half weeks after the indictment was filed.\" The claim also insists that the city of Chicago cannot recover investigation costs from Smollett because it already accepted the $10,000 fine from him \"as payment in full in connection with the dismissal of the charges against him.\"",
    " Title: Silicon Valley Faces Allegations of Discrimination and Censorship: A Class Action Lawsuit Against Google\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, a class action lawsuit has been filed against tech giant Google, alleging a culture of censorship and discrimination within the company. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of former Google engineer James Damore and other right-of-center employees, claims that Google illegally discriminates against white male employees as part of the company's diversity efforts.\n\nThe lawsuit, which describes a culture of censorship and discrimination, states that managers openly discuss blacklists intended to discourage promotions, performance reviews, and employment opportunities for those with conservative viewpoints. Employees are reportedly pressured to undergo one-sided \"Bias Busting\" re-education sessions focusing on white male privilege. Employees risk their careers by speaking out against progressive orthodoxy, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nInternal messages included in the lawsuit reveal employees openly conspiring against Damore after he shared a memo criticizing the company's diversity policies and calling for more tolerance of conservative viewpoints. One high-ranking Google employee wrote on a company message chain, \"You know, there are just certain \u2018 alternative views, including different political views \u2019 which I do not want people to feel safe to share here.\"\n\nAnother employee added, \"If Google management cares enough about diversity and inclusion, they should, and I urge them to, send a clear message by not only terminating Mr. Damore, but also severely disciplining or terminating those who have expressed support.\" Damore was fired shortly afterward.\n\nGoogle's new fact-checkers, as revealed by The Daily Caller on Tuesday, are reportedly almost exclusively devoted to policing right-of-center media outlets, with false statements wrongfully attributed to TheDC. Left-of-center outlets received no such policing from Google, which has previously censored content that doesn't align with its political goals.\n\nThe allegations against Google are not isolated. Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube (which is owned by Google) have all exhibited similar patterns of discrimination and censorship against conservatives. Facebook regularly buried conservative viewpoints from its trending topics section, several former employees told Gizmodo. YouTube and Google have targeted conservative and independent video channels for censorship and demonetization. Both Facebook and Google empowered left-wing fact-checkers to discredit conservative voices on behalf of the companies, with little oversight. Twitter buried tweets damaging to the Clinton campaign and censors conservatives but allowed racist death threats against Trump FCC chairman Ajit Pai.\n\nThe lawsuit against Google, if successful, could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry and the protection of free speech in the digital age. The allegations highlight the need for increased transparency and accountability in the tech industry, particularly in the realm of political bias and discrimination.",
    " Title: TSA Faces Criticism as Undercover Tests Reveal Security Failures at Major Airports\n\nArticle:\n\nAn internal investigation by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has uncovered security lapses at numerous major airports across the United States, with undercover investigators successfully smuggling mock explosives or prohibited items through security checkpoints in 95 percent of trials, according to a report by \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nThe tests, conducted by Homeland Security Red Teams who pose as passengers, revealed that TSA agents failed 67 out of 70 tests, allowing Red Team members to bypass security measures and carry potential weapons through checkpoints. In one instance, an undercover agent triggered a metal detector alarm but was not detected with a concealed fake explosive device during a follow-up pat-down.\n\nThe exact timeframe for the testing has not been disclosed, but Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson reportedly sought a detailed briefing on the findings last week at TSA headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. U.S. officials have stated that changes have already been implemented at airports to address the identified vulnerabilities.\n\n\"Upon learning the initial findings of the Office of Inspector General's report, Secretary Johnson immediately directed TSA to implement a series of actions, several of which are now in place, to address the issues raised in the report,\" the Department of Homeland Security said in a written statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nDespite assertions that security at U.S. airports remains strong, with multiple layers of security including bomb-sniffing dogs and other unspecified technologies, officials acknowledge the recent test results as disappointing. This is not the first time the TSA has struggled to detect Red Team agents; a similar incident occurred in 2013, when an undercover investigator with a fake bomb concealed on their person passed through a metal detector, underwent a pat-down, and was not detected at New Jersey's Newark Liberty Airport.\n\nIn 2013, then-TSA Administrator John Pistole described the Red Team as \"super terrorists\" who are well-versed in exploiting TSA weaknesses. \"Testers know exactly what our protocols are. They can create and devise and conceal items that... not even the best terrorists would be able to do,\" Pistole told lawmakers at a House hearing.\n\nMore recently, the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General's office completed a series of undercover tests targeting checked baggage screening at airports nationwide. This review identified \"vulnerabilities\" throughout the system, attributing them to human error and technological failures. Additionally, the TSA failed to demonstrate any significant improvements in checked baggage screening since a previous review in 2009, despite spending $540 million on equipment and an additional $11 million on training.",
    " Title: Twitter Agrees to Remove Racist Tweets in France After Threat of Legal Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, Twitter has agreed to remove racist and hateful content from its platform following pressure from a French organization. The decision comes after the company had previously resisted efforts to police its content, citing free speech concerns.\n\nThe controversy began on October 10, when a hashtag #unbonjuif, or \"a good Jew,\" prompted a wave of anti-Semitic tweets. The influx of hate speech continued for several days.\n\nElie Petit, Vice President of the French Union of Jewish Students, explains the situation from the Paris office. He demonstrates how the ordeal started, showing that the tweets were not considered \"abuse content\" by Twitter, but rather \"the call for murder of Jews,\" a criminal offense in France.\n\nMany European countries have stringent laws against hate speech targeted at specific groups. These laws were established in the aftermath of the Holocaust, a result of years of Nazi hate propaganda.\n\nOn a conference call with Twitter executives in California, Petit and his colleagues attempted to explain the French perspective, but were met with resistance. Twitter refused to delete the tweets, insisting that such demands must come from national authorities or the police.\n\nIn response, the Jewish students prepared to file a lawsuit. However, on Friday, Twitter reversed its decision, agreeing to erase the offensive tweets.\n\nManuel Diaz, whose company, Emakina, advises corporations on adapting to the digital era, comments on the situation. While he is against controls on free speech, he argues that Twitter, as a global media player, must take responsibility for its content due to its international reach.\n\n\"The content spread through Twitter has to respect the different local laws of the different countries where they are accessible,\" Diaz says.\n\nThe decision in France came a day after Twitter complied with German law by blocking an account of a neo-Nazi group. However, Diaz emphasizes that Twitter must act faster if it wants to succeed in the international media market.\n\n\"Waiting for the French state or the French police department to do something, well the buzz is already out and it's too late,\" he says. \"If they are not able to monitor a buzz and take some decisions very quickly, I would be very disappointed.\"\n\nDiaz expresses his disappointment in what he considers the best real-time media tool in the world. He suggests that Twitter should not censor, but should build global monitoring teams to make quick decisions in cases like the French one. If Twitter can detect and quickly suspend fake accounts, as it has done in the past, then it can easily suspend tweets that do not respect local laws.",
    " Title: \"Edgar Welch Admits Regret Over Comet Ping Pong Incident, as Pizzagate Conspiracy Spreads to Austin's East Side Pies\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a video chat with The New York Times on Wednesday, Edgar Welch, the man arrested for discharging a military-style rifle inside the Washington, D.C. pizzeria Comet Ping Pong, admitted that he had no intention of firing a shot. Welch, a 28-year-old father of two, stated, \"I regret how I handled the situation. I just wanted to do some good and went about it the wrong way.\"\n\nWelch's actions were a result of the \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory, which falsely implicates Comet Ping Pong in a child sex ring run by associates of Hillary Clinton. Welch claimed that the information leading him to the pizzeria was not 100% accurate, and despite finding no children \"inside that dwelling,\" he still believes in the existence of a Pizzagate pedophile ring.\n\nWelch admitted to listening to Alex Jones, a radio host known for spreading conspiracy theories, but distanced himself from Jones' more extreme beliefs, stating, \"He touches on some issues that are viable but goes off the deep end on some things.\"\n\nThe Pizzagate myth, fueled by creative interpretations of emails hacked from John Podesta and released by WikiLeaks, has gained traction beyond Washington, D.C., reaching as far as Austin, Texas, and the pizzeria East Side Pies. The owners of East Side Pies have been subjected to baseless accusations through social media, with posts linking their pizzeria to the fake story.\n\nAccording to the Austin American-Statesman, the online posts have made wild and baseless accusations about East Side Pies. They interpreted the restaurant's logo as a symbol of the \"Illuminati,\" questioned the meaning of photos of pizza-eating children on East Side Pies' Facebook account, inferred that a picture of staffers with former Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell was proof of nefarious political ties, and claimed co-owner Michael Freid, an alumnus of the Culinary Institute of America, had \"connections to the CIA.\"\n\nOwen Shroyer, who makes videos for Alex Jones' Infowars and hosts his own podcast, posted a 2.5-hour video detailing his own investigation of East Side Pies on Saturday. Austin police and the FBI are currently investigating the threats and vandalism of a pizza delivery truck.",
    " Title: Trump's Base Remains Steadfast Despite Criticism and Setbacks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of widespread criticism from the national media, neighboring countries, and repeated public relations challenges from the White House, President Trump's supporters remain steadfast in their loyalty to him, according to pollsters and analysts. These voters reject the notion that they should regret their vote, stating that their frustration is not with Mr. Trump but with the resistance mounted by Democrats aiming to obstruct Mr. Trump at every turn.\n\nHowever, they also blame much of the stalled Trump agenda on congressional Republicans, including party leaders, hard-line conservatives, and moderates whose squabbling caused significant problems in the Obamacare repeal effort.\n\nKevin Madden, a Republican Party strategist, stated, \"They still want to see their support validated and still believe it can pay off. They have less trust in the people and the institutions that are trying to convince them they made the wrong choice, like the media and political elites, than they do the president himself.\"\n\nPolls, including those released around the 100-day mark of his presidency, have consistently found that tales of Trump voters abandoning ship are few and far between. Instead, most of Mr. Trump's supporters see him as a powerful leader and celebrate his crusade against political correctness and his combative approach to the news media.\n\nThey have forgiven him for backing off some of the promises he made on the campaign trail, attributing it to the fact that he is still learning the ropes and has never been a politician. A Fox News survey showed 97 percent of Trump backers remained satisfied with their vote, while 2 percent wished they voted differently. A Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 96 percent of Trump voters said that supporting Mr. Trump was the right thing to do, and 2 percent said they regret their decision.\n\nA University of Virginia Center for Politics and Public Opinion Strategies poll showed 93 percent of Mr. Trump's backers approved of the job he was doing, compared with 52 percent for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and 28 percent for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2014the Republican leaders responsible for pushing the Trump agenda through Congress.\n\n\"They are more loyal [to Mr. Trump] than they are to the GOP, but they are still anti-Democrat and much more inclined to support the GOP,\" said Glen Bolger, of Public Opinion Strategies. \"There are not a whole lot of Trump voters who say, 'I am ready to defect.' That is not to say that a year from now things might be different.\"\n\nCable news networks are making a cottage industry of finding Trump voters who may have fallen off the bandwagon. They have run a torrent of stories seeking out Trump voters who could end up suffering under the work-in-progress health care bill or from his proposed budget cuts.\n\nCNNMoney last week ran a story about one Trump voter who lives on Social Security disability checks. Mr. Trump's budget calls for encouraging those on disability to try to get back to work. CNNMoney said it reached out to a dozen Trump voters \"who either rely on government aid to live or who work closely with the poor. Most were surprised\" by the network's claims about the Trump budget.\n\nThat kind of relentless negative focus is met with derision by Trump loyalists who loathe the press.\n\nThe University of Virginia survey found 88 percent of respondents \"said that media criticism of Trump reinforces that the president is on the right track, and the same percentage agreed with Trump's assertion that the press is 'the enemy of the American people.'\"\n\nThe Washington Post/ABC News poll showed that 8 in 10 Trump supporters believed news organizations regularly publish false stories.\n\nOverall, Mr. Trump's approval rating is underwater, according to polls, as the White House struggles with accusations that campaign operatives had ties to Russian officials. The recent firing of FBI Director James B. Comey also ignited calls by Democratic activists, and even a few members of Congress, for Mr. Trump's impeachment.\n\nDemocrats hope that the anti-Trump wave, coupled with Trump defections, could help them make serious gains in congressional elections next year. So far, however, anti-Trump sentiment has failed them at the polls. Republicans have won two special congressional elections to maintain Republican-held districts. Still, the Republican candidates in each race won by considerably less than the double-digit margins of victory Mr. Trump himself rolled up in those districts.\n\n\"I haven't seen any evidence that his core support has faded,\" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. \"What may be more important is whether the opposition is hardening. In other words, are folks who have been saying that Trump is not really doing a great job shifting to the view that he is actually being harmful?\"",
    " Title: Iowa Caucus Results Reveal Split Among Democratic Party, Raising Questions for Biden and Uncertainty for the Nomination Race\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Iowa caucus results have revealed a continuing rift within the Democratic Party, with the moderate and progressive wings showing a fairly even split. The preliminary tally shows Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang with 51,821 votes between them, while former Vice President Joe Biden, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Senator Amy Klobuchar have 54,894 votes combined.\n\nThe results have caused a stir in the Democratic Party, with Senator Bernie Sanders leading the popular vote in Iowa, despite lacking the traditional electoral success markers such as institutional support from policy-minting think tanks, big donors, or major political pundits. Sanders' lead, however, is not because of entrenched powers within the Democratic Party but rather in defiance of a vigorous tide of establishment attacks.\n\nThe results have been a disappointment for Vice President Biden, who had told reporters before the caucuses that \"there's a big difference between second and fourth.\" Popular vote numbers indicating Biden fell behind the 15% viability threshold to win delegates in some precincts were a clear indictment of his campaign's weak organizing effort in the state. The former vice president must now answer new doubts about his core argument: if a candidate who has framed his campaign around the notion that he's more electable than his rivals loses the first election of the nominating process, where does that leave him?\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg, the millennial, gay mayor of a relatively small Midwestern city, has apparently got a real shot at finishing first, which would be a huge bonus. However, until he can expand his support across the country, particularly among minority voters, it will be difficult to consider him as a real threat to win the nomination.\n\nIn these polarized times, Buttigieg is something of a Presidential throwback: a young, hyper-articulate, center-left Democrat who hails from the middle of the country. Will he be able to surge in New Hampshire, where he has been in fourth place in the polls? And can he broaden his appeal to minority voters, who will play a key role in Nevada and South Carolina, and also on Super Tuesday?\n\nThe partial results from Iowa have shown a protracted and competitive primary, which could end in a contested convention. There is a long, long way to go before the outcome is decided. Hopefully, the rest of the contest will go more smoothly.\n\nSome argue that the Iowa caucus process should be reformed, with the minimum requirement being for Iowa to switch from a caucus to a primary. Others go further, suggesting that Iowa's first-in-the-nation status should be ended. The argument is that no one state deserves the status Iowa took for itself, and it has shown it can't manage it. The country needs to take control of the election out of Iowa's hands.\n\nHowever, a former Democratic congressman from Iowa argues that the mishaps in the caucus process do not diminish the value of the Iowa process. He contends that Iowa retains the features that have made it valuable to the country at large: a small enough population base that real voters get to see, hear, and measure the fiber of those who would be our next president; terrain that is affordable to travel even for the long-shot candidate, who otherwise would be lost in a New York or California; politics that are open, honest, and not governed by a kingmaker. Although not a diverse state, Iowa has voted with diversity, rewarding a black American, a woman, and now an openly gay former mayor with significant support. In Iowa, we feel that those who would destroy us would end up with a contest matching our billionaire vs. the Republicans' richest candidate. That is not what a democracy is supposed to be, and so we say, Iowa, fight on.",
    " Title: Obama and Romney Clash Over Medicare Costs as Unemployment Rate Drops\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a renewed attack on the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan, President Barack Obama accused the plan of leading to skyrocketing costs for future recipients and distanced himself from the recent dismal unemployment report. This marks the second consecutive day of criticism from the president, following the release of the August unemployment report on Friday, which showed a drop in the U.S. unemployment rate but due to more Americans ceasing their job search.\n\nSpeaking at a rally at the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Florida, Obama criticized the plan, stating, \"Your costs would rise by the thousands and the insurance companies' profits would rise by the billions.\" He also accused the plan of increasing insurance profits by $16 billion to $20 billion and of turning Medicare into a voucher system, a claim he attributed to a study by Harvard professor David Cutler.\n\nThe president did not specify the source of the numbers, but senior campaign officials stated that the figures come from a study by Cutler. Cutler, a Harvard professor and health policy expert who served in the Clinton administration and was Obama's top health care adviser during the 2008 presidential campaign, conducted the study for the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund.\n\nThe Romney campaign responded by labeling Cutler an \"Obamacare drafter\" and stating that the president's attacks this weekend are \"a sign of desperation.\" Campaign spokesman Ryan Williams said, \"Only one candidate in this race has robbed today's Medicare of $716 billion to pay for Obamacare \u2013 Barack Obama. He has done nothing to reform Medicare for the long haul and prevent it from going bankrupt.\"\n\nThe Romney-Ryan plan aims to contain Medicare costs by providing retirees with voucher-like government payments that they can use to either buy traditional Medicare or private health insurance. However, Cutler argues that older Americans would have to pay more out-of-pocket to cover the rising costs of healthcare.\n\nObama's aides believe they have forced Romney to shift his focus from the sluggish economy following Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate. The Romney-Ryan campaign has countered by arguing that Obama planned to cut hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare spending over 10 years to pay for his health care plan.\n\nThe impact of this debate on the political landscape remains unclear. However, Republican analysts suggest that Romney's focus was diverted from the economy, a crucial aspect of his campaign, following the bleak jobs report that showed limited job growth and an increase in the number of unemployed people not seeking work.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, campaigning in Ohio on Saturday, referred to the GOP plan as \"Vouchercare.\" Biden argued that the Romney-Ryan plan would force retirees to shop for the best insurance deals in the market, potentially leaving them in debt if the plan's costs exceed the voucher amount.\n\nMuch of Cutler's data is based on studies by the independent Congressional Budget Office, which has projected higher costs for future retirees under a 2011 budget plan written by Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee. The budget agency stated that future retirees would pay more under Ryan's plan than if they entered traditional Medicare. By 2030, a typical 65-year-old would be paying two-thirds of their health costs, the agency said.\n\nRomney and Ryan are currently off the campaign trail, but both taped appearances for Sunday talk shows.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Engage in Comedic Banter at New York Charity Event\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Barack Obama and his Republican counterpart, Mitt Romney, shared a light-hearted moment at a charity dinner in New York on Thursday, a tradition for presidential hopefuls. The Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, organized by the Catholic Archdiocese of New York to benefit needy children, provided a platform for the two candidates to showcase a different side of themselves, just two days after their contentious debate at Hofstra University.\n\nThe evening, filled with jabs and jests, addressed topics ranging from the deficit, media bias, Romney's wealth, and the beloved children's character, Big Bird. Romney, who earlier in the day learned that the latest Gallup poll showed him leading with a 52-45 advantage, quipped, \"I've already seen early reports from tonight's dinner. Headline: Obama embraced by Catholics, Romney dines with rich people.\"\n\nRomney, a teetotaling Mormon, also made light of his stance on public broadcasting funding, stating, \"People seem to be very curious about how to prepare \u2013 first refrain from alcohol for 65 years, then get the biggest straw man and mercilessly attack it. Big Bird didn't even see it coming.\"\n\nPresident Obama poked fun at himself and the media, referring to his first debate performance, which took place on his and First Lady Michelle Obama's 20th anniversary. \"I particularly want to apologize to Chris Matthews,\" Obama said. \"Four years ago, he gave me a thrill up his leg; this time, I gave him a stroke.\"\n\nThe candidates will resume their debates on Monday night in South Florida for their third and final debate, but for one evening, they seemed to enjoy a respite from the bruising campaign. The event is expected to raise $5 million for Catholic charities, and was overseen by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nRomney also took a swipe at Obama's handling of the swelling national deficit, saying, \"The president's remarks are brought to you by the letter O and the number 16 trillion.\" Obama, in turn, took a jab at Romney's wealth, estimated at $250 million, saying, \"Earlier today I went shopping at some stores in Midtown. I understand Governor Romney went shopping for some stores in Midtown.\"\n\nAs the two men milked the room for laughs, Romney made light of Vice President Joe Biden's performance in his own debate against Paul Ryan, in which Biden was criticized for grinning and laughing inappropriately. \"I was hoping Biden would be along, because he'll laugh at anything,\" Romney said, drawing guffaws.\n\nGarbed in a tuxedo, Romney told the audience, \"It's nice to finally relax and wear what Ann and I wear around the house.\" Of Obama, Romney said, \"You have to wonder what he's thinking. So little time, so much to redistribute.\"\n\nObama, in his closing remarks, addressed the upcoming foreign policy debate, stating, \"I've been preparing for the final debate with Romney on Monday.\" The candidates will focus on foreign policy during their third debate.",
    " Title: Americans' Skepticism Towards Government Intervention Amidst Crisis: A Focus on the Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn times of national crisis, the role of the government becomes paramount, as it is expected to fill the gaps that individuals and private industry cannot. However, Americans, in general, are skeptical of excessive government intervention, a trend that has persisted over the past three decades, according to Gallup.\n\nThe current coronavirus pandemic is one such time when government intervention is crucial. The latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll reveals that most Americans do not trust President Trump's statements about the coronavirus, while they do trust their local officials and government health experts.\n\nPresident Trump's handling of the coronavirus has been marked by mixed messages and unproven treatments, which has led to a lack of trust in his statements. In an effort to mitigate potential panic, Trump initially downplayed the severity of the virus.\n\nThe White House press briefings, a platform for updates and information, have been sparse in recent days. Trump tweeted that they are not worth the time and effort, and a planned briefing for Monday evening was later removed from the White House schedule.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Trump's efforts to withhold funding from the World Health Organization and other steps his administration is reportedly taking to sideline the global health agency.\n\nMeanwhile, two leading former federal health officials are spearheading a call for a $46 billion public health investment in the next coronavirus aid package to safely reopen the economy.\n\nResearchers suggest that one standard for safely easing social distancing measures is 1 new infection per million people in a given state. However, they stress that states would still need to limit large gatherings.\n\nThe World Health Organization stated that there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.\n\nIn New York City, there has been an uptick in calls to the poison control center after Trump's disinfectant comments, with 30 cases recorded in an 18-hour period, compared to 13 cases for the same time frame one year ago.\n\nAs the political conversation is dominated by the coronavirus pandemic, Americans' ambivalence about science and experts is likely to come to the forefront.",
    " Title: Jewish Congregations Divided: Bold Stance on Palestinian Statehood Sparks Controversy Among New York Synagogues\n\nArticle:\n\nA controversial email sent by a group of synagogues in White Plains, New York, expressing cautious optimism about Palestine's new status at the United Nations has sparked a heated debate within the Jewish community. The email, signed by rabbis and leaders of the synagogue, suggested that the vote could be a step toward a two-state solution and Middle East peace.\n\nWhile the gist of the email was not surprising to some congregants, its tone and timing were jarring. Eve Birnbaum, a member of the congregation for about 15 years, expressed her dismay, stating, \"I am very dismayed, as a longstanding member of the synagogue, that the rabbis and the board would take a position that is contrary to what many members believe, contrary to the peace process.\"\n\nHowever, other congregants, such as Scott A. Weiner, 63, defended the email, stating, \"There is an unwavering commitment of support for the State of Israel, but just as Israeli society is multidimensional, so too, is the congregation.\"\n\nThe email's authors did not respond to requests for comment, but it is not the first time that Jewish congregations have taken a public stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the past, American Jews have had a vigorous, sometimes vitriolic, debate about the positions of the Israeli government and the peace process with the Palestinians.\n\nGary Rosenblatt, the editor and publisher of The Jewish Week, the largest-circulation Jewish newspaper in the country, stated, \"I think the sense of a need for a unified front in the American Jewish community is breaking down.\"\n\nThe debate also extended to other synagogues, with Rabbi Sharon Brous of Los Angeles sending an email to her congregants during the Gaza conflict that stated, \"The Palestinian people are also children of God, whose suffering is real and undeniable.\" This statement was met with criticism from Rabbi Daniel Gordis, who attacked her sentiment in a column for The Times of Israel.\n\nThe controversy highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the ongoing debate within the Jewish community about how to support Israel while also advocating for peace and a two-state solution. The email from the White Plains synagogue serves as a reminder that even within the same congregation, opinions can vary widely, and the search for a peaceful resolution to the conflict continues.",
    " Title: Charleston Church Shooting Suspect Identified as Dylann Roof, Former Friend Reveals Racist Beliefs\n\nA former friend of the man accused of the shooting massacre at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, has revealed that Dylann Roof, 21, had become an avowed racist. Joey Meek, who reconnected with Roof a few weeks ago, said that while they got drunk together on vodka, Roof began complaining that \"blacks were taking over the world\" and that \"someone needed to do something about it for the white race.\"\n\nRoof is accused of fatally shooting nine people during a Bible study at The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston on Wednesday night, ripping out a piece of South Carolina's civic heart and adding to the ever-growing list of America's racial casualties. Police in Charleston charged Roof with nine counts of murder as well as possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.\n\nMeek called the FBI after recognizing Roof in the surveillance footage, down to the stained sweatshirt he wore while playing Xbox videogames in Meek's home the morning of the attack. \"I didn't think it was him. I knew it was him,\" Meek told The Associated Press after being interviewed by investigators.\n\nAccording to a classmate, Roof was reportedly a \"pill popper\" who \"told racist jokes.\" Those who knew Roof say they remember him talking about a scheme, fueled by his segregationist ideals. Meek said Roof told him he wanted \"to start a civil war.\"\n\nDuring their reunion a few weeks ago, Roof told Meek he had used birthday money from his parents to buy a.45-caliber Glock pistol and that he had \"a plan\" that was six months in the making. He did not say what the plan was, but Meek said it scared him enough that he took the gun out of Roof's car and hid it in his house until the next day.\n\nRoof made incriminating statements indicating he was involved in the shooting, according to reports. Police captured Roof in Shelby, North Carolina, after a motorist spotted him at a traffic light on her way to work. His apprehension ended an intense, hours-long manhunt.\n\nRoof waived extradition and was back in Charleston on Thursday night, authorities said, with a bond hearing pending. On Friday, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley told NBC's \"Today\" show the shooter should get the death penalty. \"We will absolutely want him to have the death penalty,\" Haley said.\n\nCharleston officials announced a prayer vigil for Friday evening. The city's mayor described the shooting at the church as an act of \"pure, pure concentrated evil.\" The victims included a state senator who doubled as the church's minister, three other pastors, a regional library manager, a high school coach and speech therapist, a government administrator, a college enrollment counselor, and a recent college graduate - six women and three men who felt called to open their church to all.\n\nPresident Barack Obama called the tragedy yet another example of damage wreaked in America by guns. NAACP President and CEO Cornell William Brooks said \"there is no greater coward than a criminal who enters a house of God and slaughters innocent people.\" Others bemoaned the loss to a church that has served as a bastion of black power for 200 years, despite efforts by white supremacists to wipe it out.\n\n\"Of all cities, in Charleston, to have a horrible, hateful person go into the church and kill people there to pray and worship with each other is something that is beyond any comprehension and is not explained,\" said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. \"We are going to put our arms around that church and that church family.\"\n\nGov. Haley: After S.C. church shooting suspect was in custody, community could start to heal\n\nSurveillance video showed the gunman entering the church Wednesday night, and a Snapchat video reportedly taken by one of the few survivors of the attack shows a small group of people gathered together inside the church. All of them are black except for one man.\n\nCharleston County Coroner Rae Wilson said he initially did not appear threatening. \"The suspect entered the group and was accepted by them, as they believed that he wanted to join them in this Bible study,\" she said. Then, \"he became very aggressive and violent.\"\n\nIt's not clear whether Roof had any connection to the 16 white supremacist organizations operating in South Carolina, but he appears to be a \"disaffected white supremacist,\" based on his Facebook page, said Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nOn his Facebook page, Roof displayed the flags of defeated white-ruled regimes, posing with a Confederate flags plate on his car and wearing a jacket with stitched-on flag patches from apartheid-era South Africa and Rhodesia, which is now black-led Zimbabwe.\n\nRoof was arrested in February at a mall in Columbia, South Carolina - charged with felony drug possession. He was wearing all black and suspicious employees called police. They found Roof with strips of the drug suboxone - often abused, but typically used to treat opiate addiction. The mall banned him from the premises but he was arrested for trespassing there in April.\n\nSpilling blood inside a black church - especially \"Mother Emanuel,\" founded in 1816 - evoked painful memories nationwide, a reminder that black churches so often have been the targets of racist violence. A church founder, Denmark Vesey, was hanged after trying to organize a slave revolt in 1822, and white landowners burned the church in revenge, leaving parishioners to worship underground until after the Civil War. The congregation rebuilt and grew stronger, eventually winning campaigns for voting rights and political representation.\n\nIts lead pastor, state Sen. Clementa Pinckney - among the dead - recalled his church's history in a 2013 sermon, saying \"we do not see ourselves as just a place where we come to worship, but as a beacon and as a bearer of the culture.\"\n\n\"What the church is all about,\" Pinckney said, \"is the 'freedom to be fully what God intends us to be and have equality in the sight of God. And sometimes you got to make noise to do that. Sometimes you may have to die like Denmark Vesey to do that.'\"\n\nPinckney, 41, was a married father of two and a Democrat who spent 19 years in the South Carolina legislature after he was first elected at 23, becoming the youngest member of the House. The other victims were Cynthia Hurd, 54; Tywanza Sanders, 26; Myra Thompson, 59; Ethel Lance, 70; Susie Jackson, 87; and the reverends DePayne Middleton Doctor, 49; Sharonda Singleton, 45; and Daniel Simmons Sr., 74.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the attack would be investigated as a hate crime.",
    " Title: FCC Proposes to Repeal Net Neutrality Rules, Shifting Digital Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could reshape the digital landscape, the head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) unveiled plans on Tuesday to repeal landmark 2015 rules that prohibited internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content. The FCC, led by Republican Ajit Pai, will vote on the plan at a Dec. 14 meeting.\n\nThe net neutrality rules, championed by former Democratic President Barack Obama, barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing down access to content or charging consumers more for certain content. They were intended to ensure a free and open internet, give consumers equal access to web content, and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content.\n\nThe proposed repeal is a victory for big internet service providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp, and Verizon Communications Inc, which opposed the rules. It represents a setback for Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc, which had urged Pai not to rescind the rules. Netflix expressed opposition to the measure on Tuesday, stating it aimed to \"roll back these core protections.\"\n\nWith three Republican and two Democratic commissioners, the move is all but certain to be approved. Trump, a Republican, expressed his opposition to net neutrality in 2014 before the regulations were even implemented, calling it a \"power grab\" by Obama. The White House did not immediately comment Tuesday.\n\nPai's proposal would prevent state and local governments from creating their own net neutrality rules because internet service is \"inherently an interstate service.\" This preemption is most likely to handcuff Democratic-governed states and localities that could have considered their own plans to protect consumers' equal access to internet content.\n\n\"The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and preemptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive,\" Pai said in an interview. He added that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised \"heavy-handed\" regulation of the internet.\n\n\"We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses,\" Pai added.\n\nTom Wheeler, who headed the FCC under Obama and advocated for the net neutrality rules, called the planned repeal \"a shameful sham and sellout.\" Even for this FCC and its leadership, this proposal raises hypocrisy to new heights.\"\n\nAT&T, Comcast, and Verizon have said that repealing the rules could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing.\n\nComcast said no matter what the FCC decided, it would \"not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content.\" Verizon said it believed the FCC \"will reinstate a framework that protects consumers' access to the open internet, without forcing them to bear the heavy costs from unnecessary regulation.\"\n\nThe Internet Association, representing major technology firms including Alphabet and Facebook, said Pai's proposal \"represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans.\"\n\n\"This proposal undoes nearly two decades of bipartisan agreement on baseline net neutrality principles that protect Americans' ability to access the entire internet,\" it said.\n\nThe FCC received more than 22 million comments. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman disclosed Tuesday he has been investigating for more than six months in a bid to learn who was behind the filing of false comments.\n\nA U.S. appeals court last year upheld the legality of the net neutrality regulations, which were challenged in a lawsuit led by telecommunications industry trade association US Telecom. The group praised Pai's decision to remove \"antiquated, restrictive regulations\" to \"pave the way for broadband network investment, expansion, and upgrades.\"\n\nThe FCC's repeal is certain to draw a legal challenge from advocates of net neutrality. Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. House of Representatives Democrat, said the FCC move would hurt consumers and chill competition, saying the agency \"has launched an all-out assault on the entrepreneurship, innovation, and competition at the heart of the internet.\"\n\nThe planned repeal represents the latest example of a legacy achievement of Obama being erased since Trump took office in January. Trump has abandoned international trade deals, the landmark Paris climate accord and environmental protections, taken aim at the Iran nuclear accord and closer relations with Cuba, and sought repeal Obama's signature healthcare law.\n\nPai, who has moved quickly to undo numerous regulatory actions since becoming FCC chairman, is pushing a broad deregulatory agenda. Pai said he had not shared his plans on the rollback with the White House in advance or been directed to undo net neutrality by White House officials.",
    " Title: U.S. Attorney John Durham's Investigation into Russia Probe Origins Gains Momentum, Sources Report\n\nArticle:\n\nThe investigation into the origins of the Russia probe, led by U.S. Attorney John Durham, has reportedly gained momentum as he delves deeper into the matter. According to multiple sources familiar with the situation, Durham, who was appointed by Attorney General Bill Barr last month, is \"very dialed in\" and \"asking all the right questions.\"\n\nSources within the Justice Department have confirmed to Fox News that Barr has met \"on multiple occasions in recent weeks\" with Durham, who was in Washington, D.C., this month. The sources reveal that Durham has been briefed on the \"four corners\" of the investigations into the FBI's use of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants, among other issues.\n\nDurham's high level of engagement in the probe comes days after Barr stated he had not received satisfactory answers from the intelligence community in the early stages of his review into the origins of the Russia investigation. Barr told CBS News in an interview that he has \"more questions\" and that some of the facts he has learned \"do not hang together with the official explanations of what happened.\"\n\nDurham is specifically reviewing the FISA warrant obtained by the FBI to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page, as well as general issues relating to surveillance during the 2016 campaign and matters flowing from the FISA process. Fox News is told Durham would handle the prosecution of any criminal action he might uncover.\n\nBefore the 2016 midterm elections, sources tell Fox News, Republicans who controlled key House committees sought to \"tee up\" potential targets for future investigation. They pointed in particular to the apparent conflict in testimony between the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, and DOJ official Bruce Ohr. Fusion GPS was retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which in turn hired British ex-spy Christopher Steele to write the infamous dossier that the FBI relied on in its FISA application to surveil Page.\n\nSimpson testified to the House Intelligence Committee that he contacted Ohr about the largely discredited dossier after Thanksgiving 2016, but Ohr\u2019s records point to contact months earlier, in August. Bruce Ohr became a backchannel for Steele to the FBI in the fall of 2016 after the bureau fired the ex-spy over contacts with the media.\n\nLast month, Republican Rep. Mark Meadows made a criminal referral for Ohr\u2019s wife, Nellie, who worked for Fusion GPS. Nellie did extensive opposition research on Trump family members and campaign aides while working for Fusion GPS, according to a transcript of her closed-door interview with Congress.\n\nIn his criminal referral, Meadows stated, \"During her transcribed interview, Ms. Ohr testified she 'would not have any knowledge of what [was] going on in an ongoing investigation' at DOJ and would not 'have any knowledge of the Department of Justice\u2019s investigations on Russia.' Ms. Ohr also denied she shared her research on Russian organized crime and Donald Trump with individuals outside of Fusion GPS (her employer), her husband, DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr, and Christopher Steele.\"\n\nHowever, documents reviewed by our committees raise concerns that Ms. Ohr not only had knowledge of an ongoing DOJ investigation, but that she shared information and research on Russian organized crime to assist DOJ, in direct contradiction with her testimony.",
    " Title: Congressman Calls for Investigation into Cape Wind Project Amid Allegations of Political Pressure\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a turn of events, a long-standing controversy surrounding the nation's first offshore wind farm, Cape Wind, has resurfaced, with Republican Representative Cliff Stearns of Florida calling for an investigation into the project's approval process. The renewed scrutiny comes as Stearns, who previously led the investigation into the failed solar panel firm Solyndra, claims that emails from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) indicate political pressure was applied to get the project approved.\n\nAudra Parker, president of the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, an organization opposed to the wind farm's development, claims to have obtained documents that she believes prove the FAA fast-tracked the project despite safety concerns for local aviation. Parker stated, \"We have at the federal level and at the state level a very, very strong green agenda, but this project is a perfect example of a green agenda at any cost.\"\n\nParker's documents, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request to the FAA, reveal an internal email from 2009 acknowledging \"The Cape Wind project in Nantucket Sound is highly political...\" A PowerPoint presentation from 2010 states, \"The Secretary of the Interior has approved this project. The Administration is under pressure to promote green energy production. It would be very difficult politically to refuse approval of this project.\"\n\nRep. Stearns commented, \"I think the Cape Wind project is something similar to Solyndra in the sense there's a lot of pressure from the White House.\" The White House, however, dismissed Stearns' latest accusations, while Cape Wind spokesman Mark Rodgers maintained that the project has been heavily vetted.\n\nDespite the concerns raised by opponents, Cape Wind hopes to begin construction next year. However, the project is facing multiple lawsuits and the possibility of further delays as both sides\u2014for and against the development\u2014continue to accuse politics of playing a role in the battle. The FAA is currently reviewing the project again after a federal appeals court overturned the agency's ruling that 130 proposed turbines posed \"no hazard\" to aviation.",
    " Title: Lana Marks, Luxury Handbag Designer, Tapped as U.S. Ambassador to South Africa Despite Controversial Past\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump has nominated Lana Marks, a luxury handbag designer with no diplomatic experience, to serve as the U.S. ambassador to South Africa. The nomination, announced late Wednesday, has raised eyebrows due to Marks' controversial past and her limited qualifications for the role.\n\nBorn and raised in South Africa, Marks is known for her high-end handbags made with exotic animal skins, such as alligator and ostrich. Her designs can retail for between $19,000 and $400,000. According to CNN, the concept for her luxury brand was born when she couldn't find a bag to match the suit she planned to wear to a birthday celebration for Queen Elizabeth.\n\nMarks' professional background is not the only aspect of her life that mirrors Trump's. She is known for her relentless self-promotion, a trait that has been noted by the Palm Beach Daily.\n\nHowever, Marks' nomination has been met with scrutiny due to more than a dozen past lawsuits against her in Aspen, New York, California, and South Florida. In these lawsuits, she has been repeatedly accused of stiffing attorneys, accountants, landlords, and employees.\n\nIn July 2015, Marks was evicted from her office on Worth Avenue for failing to pay $25,399 in rent and other expenses. In 2004, 2007, and 2009, the landlords for her store on Worth Avenue also filed complaints against her for failing to pay rent, although the cases were settled without eviction.\n\nTrump's relationship with South Africa has also been a point of contention. Last August, he tweeted that he had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to \"closely study\" the government's \"large scale\" land seizures and killing of white farmers, which are, of course, not actually happening anywhere but in the minds of the white supremacists from whom our president apparently gets his policy ideas. With Marks' nomination, it remains to be seen how she will navigate these complex issues.",
    " Title: Biden Calls for Impeachment of President Trump, Citing Obstruction of Justice and Constitutional Threat\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a campaign event in Rochester, New Hampshire on Wednesday, former Vice President Joe Biden expressed his support for the impeachment of President Donald Trump. Biden accused Trump of obstructing justice and violating his oath of office by withholding congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\n\"With his words and his actions, President Trump has indicted himself by obstructing justice and refusing to comply with the congressional inquiry,\" Biden said. \"He's already convicted himself.\"\n\nBiden argued that impeachment is not just about what the president has done, but about the threat he poses to the nation if allowed to remain in office. \"One thing about this president is absolutely clear. He has seen no limits to his power, regardless of what the Constitution says,\" Biden said. \"He believes the entire United States government can be corrupted into furthering his personal political needs.\"\n\nBiden had previously signaled his support for the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry, but had refrained from taking a position on how it should conclude. The investigation was triggered by a whistleblower's complaint against Trump over his pressure on the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, who served on the board of Burisma Holdings until earlier this year.\n\nSince the announcement of the impeachment inquiry, a flurry of developments have given added impetus to the probe. Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn last week, Trump called on China to investigate the Bidens, but has yet to provide evidence of any wrongdoing.\n\nIn 2016, then-Vice President Biden pressured Ukraine to remove its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who had investigated Burisma. However, Shokin's investigation had been closed by the time Biden made the demand on the Ukrainian government. The European Union and the International Monetary Fund, along with several congressional Republicans, shared the Obama administration's view of Shokin as corrupt.\n\nBiden's response to Trump's attacks over recent weeks has been criticized as slow and ineffective by some Democrats, raising unpleasant memories of the \"Swift Boat\" attacks by Republicans on Democratic nominee John Kerry in 2004.\n\n\"We're not going to play Donald Trump's game. We're not going to let him distract from the corruption in his own administration,\" Kate Bedingfield, Biden's campaign manager, said on CNN Tuesday.\n\nIn response to Biden's calls for impeachment, Trump tweeted, \"So pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment \u2014 and I did nothing wrong.\" Trump also tweeted, \"Joe's Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!\"\n\nBiden responded, \"Thanks for watching. Stop stonewalling the Congress. Honor your oath. Respect the Constitution. And speaking of taxpayers, I've released 21 years of my tax returns. You?\"",
    " Title: Romney Outlines Foreign Policy Differences with Obama, Emphasizes Two-State Solution, Egypt Aid Conditions, and Syria Arms Aid\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the Virginia Military Institute on Monday, Mitt Romney outlined his foreign policy differences with President Obama, emphasizing a recommitment to a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, the imposition of conditions on U.S. aid to Egypt, and the need to provide arms to Syrian opposition forces.\n\nRomney accused the Obama administration of passivity on the international stage, stating that the world is left wondering \"Where does America stand?\" if the U.S. does not have a clear and predictable foreign policy. He pledged that, if elected, the world would see a White House that adheres to \"bedrock principles\" toward the Middle East to provide stability.\n\nThe former Massachusetts governor emphasized the need for free trade as a critical element of U.S. strategy, both in the Middle East and across the world. He criticized the Obama administration for not signing any new free-trade agreements in the past four years and vowed to reverse that failure.\n\nOn Iran, Romney remained vague on whether he would support a pre-emptive military strike, instead stating that the U.S. must make clear to Iran that its nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated through actions, not just words. He also called for new conditions on U.S. aid to Egypt, which would push the new regime to respect democracy and live up to its peace treaty commitments with Israel.\n\nJust weeks after a video surfaced showing him sharing doubts with donors about the viability of a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, Romney pledged to \"recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Syria, where opposition forces are in a bloody stalemate with the regime of Bashar Assad, Romney said the U.S. must do more to get arms into the hands of the rebels, at least those whom the U.S. trusts. He added that Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them, and the U.S. should be working with its international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran.\n\nCritics said Romney tried to carve out differences but didn't articulate a dramatically different vision from the president's. Gordon Adams, an international relations professor at American University who served on President Clinton's national security staff during the mid-1990s, said, \"When it comes to defining exactly what Romney would do, whether it's toward Iran or Egypt, or Libya or Syria or Israel, it's pretty much the same thing when the rubber hits the road that Obama's already doing.\"\n\nFormer Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright also criticized Romney's speech, stating that she would like to ask him or his advisers exactly what he would do differently and how he truly understands what is going on in the Arab world and how to deal with it.",
    " Title: \"The Case for Impeachment: A Scholarly Perspective on the Constitutionality of Obamacare Changes\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) implementation, a growing debate has emerged regarding the constitutionality of changes made to the law by President Obama. Associate Professor of Economics at St. John's University, New York, M. Northrop Buechner, has recently made a case for President Obama's impeachment in Forbes, citing the unconstitutional nature of the changes made to the ACA.\n\nSince its enactment in 2010, the ACA has faced numerous challenges, with one of the most significant being the broken promise that Americans could keep their healthcare plans if they liked them. In early 2010, President Obama admitted during a healthcare summit that millions of Americans could lose their coverage due to the new law. This was further confirmed in September of the same year when every Senate Democrat voted against a resolution that would have allowed people to keep their healthcare plans.\n\nIn 2013, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius admitted under oath in front of Congress that end-to-end security testing was not done on Healthcare.gov before its launch, putting the personal information of Americans at risk and making them vulnerable to fraud and identity theft.\n\nProfessor Buechner argues that the Constitution authorizes the President to propose and veto legislation, but not to change existing laws. The changes made to the ACA by President Obama, therefore, are unconstitutional. This, according to Buechner, indicates that President Obama does not accept the limitations that the Constitution places on his actions, and it is unclear what other limitations, if any, he does accept.\n\nBuechner contends that by changing the law based solely on his wish, President Obama acted on the principle that the President can rewrite laws, not just this law, but any law. This, he suggests, could lead to a dangerous precedent where the President ignores or selectively enforces laws, or even issues decrees without congressional approval.\n\nThe most important point, according to Buechner, is that President Obama does not consider himself bound by the Constitution. He has drawn a line in the concrete, and we cannot ignore it. While impeachment may not be a viable option with a divided Congress, Buechner's case for impeachment provides food for thought regarding the constitutional limits of presidential power.",
    " Title: Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann's Retirement: A Look at Her Impact and Legacy\n\nArticle:\n\nMinnesota Representative Michele Bachmann's announcement of her decision not to seek a fifth term on Wednesday sparked a flurry of reactions on social media, with both supporters and critics reflecting on her political career. The news dominated the headlines, offering a glimpse into Bachmann's significant impact on Washington.\n\nDespite a series of missteps and fabrications throughout her political journey since her 2006 election, Bachmann carved out a unique place in political history by riding the Tea Party wave early and parlaying her unapologetic, cable-ready persona and House seat into national prominence. Even her detractors acknowledge that her audacity paved the way for conservative female candidates and for new Republican Tea Party favorites, such as Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, to some extent.\n\nBachmann also established herself as a fundraising powerhouse, raising nearly $15 million for her closely contested 2012 race against Democrat Jim Graves, who spent about $2.3 million in a race marked by her polarizing politics.\n\nConservative blogger Dan Riehl, who chose to \"ignore most of the calamity, the gaffes\" that have characterized Bachmann's political career, described her as a voice against the Republican establishment, a thorn in its side. \"She was a voice against the Republican establishment, a thorn in its side,\" he says. \"In certain ways, she was an iconic figure \u2014 effective just because she was there... She was kicking on the door early and was isolated. You have some people benefiting from the heat she took.\"\n\nBachmann's national profile was not built on her legislative achievements; she was rated as a backbencher during her time on Capitol Hill. However, she founded the House Tea Party Caucus, became a face of the emerging movement, and made \"repeal Obamacare\" her clarion call, thus ensuring a role on the national stage.\n\nKathryn Pearson, an American politics expert and associate professor at the University of Minnesota, notes that Bachmann skillfully used media, particularly cable media, to articulate a very conservative message and articulate opposition to the Obama administration in ways that went beyond mainstream Republicans. \"She did not do a lot legislatively; it was not her focus,\" Pearson says. \"But she gave voice to Tea Party members and made life difficult for her party's leadership.\"\n\nBachmann's penchant for hyperbole and sometimes tenuous grasp of facts made her a staple in the cable TV arena but tarnished her reputation as a serious political player and made many of her home state Republicans cringe. \"To the degree that she was a laughingstock\u2014that's not good when you're a Republican in Minnesota,\" says Sarah Janecek, a GOP activist and founder of Politics in Minnesota, a state public affairs news service.\n\nBachmann's polarizing figure also presented challenges for national Republicans as they sought to broaden their appeal. She proved to be a reliable foil for Democrats, who often used her over-the-top comments to fuel their own direct-mail fundraising efforts.\n\n\"She was a polarizing figure and has drawn a lot of fire, and made some missteps,\" says Riehl. \"The Tea Party movement, however, in some ways, has moved ahead of her now, grown beyond her, and is not as handcuffed to the social right.\"\n\nBachmann's improbable, audacious run for the presidential nomination in 2012 still resonates with Riehl and other Republicans. \"She wasn't the first conservative bomb-thrower from the House to run for president, but she proved a more viable candidate than any other before her campaign fizzled prior to the Iowa caucuses,\" Riehl says.\n\nLove her or hate her, Michele Bachmann did herself proud, according to Janecek. \"When Michele decided she wanted something, it was balls to the wall,\" she says. \"She was the only woman at the podium during those [presidential] debates, she looked like a million bucks, and she had something to say.\"\n\nWith her presidential campaign activity under investigation and facing another tough challenge by Graves, Bachmann decided another term is not something she wants. To her fans, she remains a singular and steadfast figure. \"Michele Bachmann was someone who ran on principles and lives those principles,\" says Jake Duesenberg, who heads the East Metro Tea Party organization that reaches into her district. \"She gave her detractors a lot of material, he says, but earlier this month 400 people turned out to see her at a local Tea Party gathering. \"She packed the house,\" Duesenberg says. \"You can say this or that about how she messages, but she stood up for free markets, fiscal responsibility, and respect for the Constitution.\"",
    " Title: Obama Campaign Faces Challenges in Proving Improved Economic Conditions\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2012 election cycle heats up, President Obama's past statement about his presidency being a \"one-term proposition\" if the nation wasn't better off after three years is resurfacing, causing some difficulty for the Obama campaign. The question of whether the country is better off now than it was four years ago has become a contentious issue, with some high-profile surrogates and aides offering evasive answers.\n\nThe debate began with Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley's flip-flop on the issue. On Face the Nation, he stated that we are not better off, but on the same day, he tweeted that we are creating jobs and, therefore, better off. The following day, he walked back his statement, claiming that we are indeed better off.\n\nDuring a campaign stop in Detroit, Vice President Joe Biden was also asked about the issue. He asserted that we are better off, but declined to provide specifics, stating that he would do so if it wasn't so hot.\n\nObama campaign senior adviser David Axelrod and Fox News Sunday's Chris Wallace had a back-and-forth about the issue. Wallace asked Axelrod if the average American is better off than four years ago, to which Axelrod responded that it took years to create the economic crisis that peaked in 2009 and that it would take time to work through it.\n\nOn CNN's \"Early Start,\" anchor John Berman asked Democratic National Committee spokesman Brad Woodhouse if we are better off than four years ago. Woodhouse responded that we are absolutely better off. On the Today Show, Obama campaign deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter was asked the same question and responded that we are better off.\n\nJournalist Jake Tapper noted that providing honest answers about our current economic condition may be a losing strategy, but the soundbites from the past 24 hours have left many questioning the Obama administration's claims of economic improvement. With unemployment still high and many businesses struggling, it remains to be seen whether the Obama campaign can provide a convincing argument for economic improvement.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Engage in Escalating Trade War, with No Clear Evidence of Economic Harm Yet\n\nThe world's two largest economies have entered a trade war, with the U.S. imposing tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods and China retaliating with duties on U.S. shipments. The first-ever U.S. tariffs aimed solely at China took effect on Friday, targeting products such as farming plows, airplane parts, and soybeans.\n\nThe trade conflict, which shows no signs of abating, could potentially undermine economic growth by complicating international supply chains and increasing prices for companies and consumers. The Federal Reserve has already noted that some firms are slowing investment, while Harley-Davidson Inc. and General Motors Co. have warned they may cut jobs.\n\nHowever, the June jobs data released by the U.S. after the tariffs showed no clear evidence of trade fears hurting the U.S. economy. U.S. hiring topped forecasts, while the unemployment rate rose from an 18-year low and wage gains unexpectedly slowed.\n\nThe extent of the economic damage will depend on how far both sides go. If the U.S. and China cool off after the initial round of tariffs, the fallout will be modest, according to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Economics. Under a full-blown trade war, the economists reckon U.S. growth would slow by 0.8 percentage point by 2020.\n\nThe U.S. runs a bilateral trade deficit of $336 billion with China, importing much more from it than the reverse. President Trump has declared trade wars as \"easy to win\" and bet that the skirmish will prompt American companies to return operations to the U.S.\n\nIn the first round, the additional Chinese duties on U.S. goods will have a significant impact on some items. For instance, the tariff on pure-electric vehicles, such as Tesla, will rise to 40 percent of the value from the current 15 percent. U.S. whiskey will be taxed 30 percent, compared with 5 percent for alcohol from other nations. U.S. soybeans, a key flashpoint in the worsening trade relations, will see their tariff jump to 28 percent of the value, while the soybean duty for some other nations has been lowered to zero recently.\n\nChina also has other ways to retaliate, such as going after U.S. companies like Apple Inc. and Walmart Inc., which operate in its market and are keen to expand. It could introduce penalties such as customs delays, tax audits, and increased regulatory scrutiny, while more drastic steps include devaluing the yuan or paring $1.2 trillion holdings of U.S. Treasuries.\n\nThe trade war's duration and intensity remain uncertain, with both economies being large and powerful enough to withstand prolonged pressure. As a candidate in 2016, Donald Trump won support with a promise to redress an unbalanced trade relationship with the rest of the world. In the White House in 2018, he has started to make good on that pledge. The risks of a full-blown trade war are increasing, but the base case remains more trade skirmish than trade war, according to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Economics.",
    " Title: The Divisive Impact of President Trump: A Personal Reflection and Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a poignant and thought-provoking piece, a journalist recounts the estrangement of a long-time friendship due to political differences, specifically the election of President Donald Trump. The writer, who had worked closely with a Hollywood agent for decades, describes the woman's fear and anger towards Trump, which has led to a chasm between them since the 2016 election.\n\nThe journalist, who voted for Trump, shares that the woman has not spoken to him since the election, citing grievances that were never previously mentioned. This situation, the writer notes, is not an isolated incident, as many people have experienced similar estrangements due to political differences.\n\nThe article delves into the question of why Trump seems to unleash such intense emotions and polarization. The writer suggests that it may be due to Trump's personality, which some find frightening or exciting, likening it to the concept of a \"weak but dominant father figure\" that children may hate or fear.\n\nThe piece also touches on the left's capacity for hate, comparing it to historical events such as the Two Minute Hates in George Orwell's 1984, Kristallnacht, and KKK lynchings. The writer questions why this hate and rage almost always come from the left, and why there are no mass marches or riots from other groups with similar grievances.\n\nThe article concludes with the writer's personal reflections on Trump's presidency, expressing confusion and sadness over the loss of a close friendship, and questioning the reasons behind the intense emotions Trump evokes in people. The piece ends with a nod to Bob Dylan's decision to not accept the Nobel Peace Prize and a call for understanding and unity in these divisive times.",
    " Title: Trump Accuses Mueller's Office of Coercing Witnesses, Amidst Ongoing Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a series of tweets on Wednesday, President Donald Trump accused the special counsel's office of attempting to coerce witnesses to testify against him. The president's accusations come after the special counsel's office accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of lying to the FBI about the Russia investigation and violating a plea agreement.\n\nTrump's reference to three \"major players\" appears to refer to Manafort, long-time political adviser Roger Stone, and conservative writer Jerome Corsi, an ally of Stone who said he rejected a plea deal from Mueller.\n\nLawmakers and legal analysts have suggested that the president's statements are an attempt to damage Mueller's reputation ahead of an expected report on Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election in Trump's favor. Prosecutors are examining whether Trump and his campaign worked with Russians who hacked Democratic emails and pushed fake news about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and whether the president has sought to obstruct that investigation.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied collusion and obstruction, and accused Mueller's office of political motivations. Trump's legal team has joint defense agreements with witnesses in the Mueller investigation, and they have shared information about the probe.\n\nManafort, Stone, Corsi, and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani have all accused Mueller's office of coercing testimony. Giuliani has accused prosecutors of treating Manafort \"like he\u2019s a terrorist, incarcerating him before trial, solitary incarceration and repeated questioning\" about Trump. In a text, Giuliani said they are \"willing to exert unusual pressure that could tempt someone to lie and get out of jail.\"\n\nAfter his conviction on financial fraud charges, Manafort struck a deal to cooperate with Mueller's team in September \u2013 yet maintained his joint defense agreement with Manafort, an unusual development. Former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti, a CNN legal analyst, tweeted that Manafort's decision to do so was \"highly deceptive and undermined Mueller's investigation.\"\n\nSome lawmakers have proposed legislation to protect the special counsel's job, citing the president's attacks on Mueller. They have also accused Manafort and other witnesses of seeking pardons from the president. The proposed legislation \"would protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller and future Special Counsels from inappropriate removal or political pressure,\" said a statement from the office of Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump has no plans to get rid of Mueller. \"The President has had Robert Mueller doing his job for the last two years, and he could've taken action at any point, and he hasn\u2019t,\" Sanders said. \"So we'll let that speak for itself.\" Sanders also said, \"I'm not aware of any conversations for anyone's pardon involving this process at all.\"\n\nReports have also emerged that Manafort has been giving Trump's legal team updates on what Mueller asks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to stop the bill to protect Mueller's job, even after the No. 2 GOP leader floated the possibility of it.",
    " Title: House Democrats Introduce For The People Act: A Comprehensive Overhaul of Political, Voting, and Ethics Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, House Democrats have introduced the For The People Act, also known as HR 1, on Friday. The 571-page bill, symbolizing their first legislative action, aims to address four key political issues: voting, political money, redistricting, and ethics.\n\nRep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) stated, \"We heard loud and clear from the American people. They feel left out and locked out from their own democracy.\" If passed, the bill is unlikely to become law this year due to Republican control of the Senate, a Republican president, and the GOP's vehement opposition to the bill's approach.\n\nThe bill proposes several contentious and non-controversial measures. One of the more controversial provisions involves redistricting, aiming to remove state legislatures' power to draw congressional districts and instead have independent commissions do so. This move is intended to prevent local politicians from gerrymandering districts to benefit their party and disadvantage the opposition.\n\nOther provisions, such as easing voter registration, are less contentious. The bill would allow for online voter registration, automatic registration via data from driver's licenses or other government sources, and would require states to offer same-day registration and at least 15 days of early voting for federal elections. Election Day would also be declared a federal holiday.\n\nThe bill also includes measures to combat voter suppression, such as restoring voting rights to felons after they complete their sentences and preventing efforts to remove voters from the rolls or prevent them from casting ballots.\n\nThe bill would require paper ballots to prevent computer tampering and prohibit state chief election officials from involvement in federal campaigns. It also aims to revive core anti-discrimination provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which were effectively shut down by the Supreme Court six years ago.\n\nThe bill includes provisions from the Disclose Act, a transparency measure, to expand the prohibition on foreign political money and mandate the disclosure of big donors behind politically active 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations. Digital companies, like Facebook and Google, would be required to set up public databases cataloging political ad purchase requests of $500 or more and create new measures to block ad buys by foreign nationals.\n\nPresidential inaugural committees would be required to disclose expenditures, in addition to the existing requirement for donor disclosure. This is a response to reports of unexplained spending by Trump's inaugural committee.\n\nThe bill also includes a new matching-fund program to support House candidates who agree to raise only small-dollar contributions. A similar provision for Senate candidates would have to come from the Senate. The public financing system for presidential candidates, largely irrelevant since 2012, would be updated.\n\nFinally, the bill aims to quash \"sidecar\" superPACs that support individual candidates. The For The People Act is a comprehensive overhaul of the political, voting, and ethics landscape, reflecting the concerns and priorities of House Democrats.",
    " Title: Decline in Military Equipment Transfers to Local Police Departments Despite Trump Executive Order\n\nArticle:\n\nA new analysis has found that the amount of surplus military equipment sent to local police departments across the nation has significantly decreased in recent months, despite an executive order signed by President Trump in August 2017 that aimed to increase such transfers.\n\nAccording to Department of Defense data, shipments of military gear in the first three months of 2018 fell by half compared to the same period in 2017. The value of armored vehicles, high-caliber rifles, and other equipment also decreased.\n\nTrump's executive order rescinded limits imposed by the Obama administration in response to the controversial police response to the Ferguson, Missouri, riots in 2014. Some police officials have approached the program cautiously, despite robust support from Trump.\n\nSgt. Stephen Wells, a spokesman for the Kern County Sheriff's Office in California, which ordered about 90 military items from the Pentagon in 2015 but only one last year, stated, \"We're not an occupying force.\"\n\nSince 1991, the program has recycled approximately $6.8 billion in military equipment purchased by federal taxpayers. The program came under scrutiny following the Ferguson riots, with images of officers wearing tactical gear and standing alongside armored vehicles flashing across network news and drawing bipartisan criticism in Congress.\n\nIn response, Obama placed limits on some kinds of equipment in 2015. Obama stated then that the show of force opened a rift between the police and the community at a time when both would have benefited from better relations.\n\nHowever, Trump administration officials argued that the restrictions went too far, limiting police from obtaining equipment that could help them meet modern challenges. Trump's order was touted by these officials as a way to increase the flow of \"lifesaving gear\" to police.\n\nAnnouncing the order last year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions criticized Obama for the limits and vowed that the Trump administration would not \"put superficial concerns above public safety.\"\n\nThe data show a bump in shipments in September, the month immediately following Trump's action, but this appears to have been an anomaly. The average monthly value of military gear shipped to local departments in 2016 was just over $17 million. So far this year, the average monthly value stands at $5.2 million.\n\nA White House spokeswoman referred questions to the Justice Department. A spokeswoman at Justice referred questions to the Defense Department. A spokeswoman for the Defense Logistics Agency, which oversees the program, stated that this year's decline is \"likely due to those\u2026 items not being available.\"\n\nThe spokeswoman, Michelle McCaskill, described the change ushered in by Trump's executive order as \"minimal.\" However, some police departments remain cautious due to public relations concerns associated with the equipment.\n\nThe most common item transferred to police last year were military rifles, followed by weapon sights and night-vision goggles. James Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, stated he believes Trump's order has put police across the nation in a stronger position.\n\nCritics pounced on the program again last year when the Government Accountability Office created a fictitious agency and obtained more than 100 military items worth $1.2 million, including night-vision goggles and simulated pipe bombs.\n\nThe analysis focused exclusively on equipment the Department of Defense altered, or \"demilitarized,\" before transferring it to a local government. This means rifles, armored trucks, night-vision sniper scopes, and other war-fighting equipment were included, but not radios, boots, and printers.\n\nThe Project on Government Oversight, a Washington-based watchdog group, predicted last fall that Trump's order would have little effect on the shipments. The more significant change, experts said, has been on how the government oversees the program.\n\n\"Trump did not make a huge difference in what is or is not allowed, despite statements from some in the administration,\" said Peter Tyler, a senior policy analyst with the group. \"Mostly what the Obama-era order did was put in some very helpful accountability steps.\"\n\nRick Myers, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, stated he was not surprised Trump's order did not result in a sustained increase in demand. Myers stated, \"The problem with the program is not the equipment, but how some departments used it.\"",
    " Title: The Power of Mothers: Shaping the Future of America\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the founding of Vasser Women's College, Matthew Vasser emphasized the significant role of mothers in shaping the destiny of a nation. This sentiment, echoed by many, underscores the importance of investing in the future by nurturing the mothers who are shaping America's future.\n\nThe strength of a nation lies not in its government, but in its families and the communities they form. America, a nation built by families, can only be saved by families. Homes are the centers of society, and mothers, as the center of the home, hold immense power.\n\nA friend of mine, a teacher at Schofield Army Barracks in Hawaii, shared her concern about the lack of patriotism among students. The school, like many across the country, no longer requires students to pledge the flag. This, in my opinion, is a reflection of the parents' dedication and the love they have for the flag and the country it represents.\n\nLiberty, the foundation of America, begins at home. If we fail to instill a love for liberty in our homes, our efforts in other areas will be in vain. No election, no law, no court can save us if we do not foster a love of liberty in our homes.\n\nMothers, as the primary educators, have the responsibility to teach their children about America's history and heritage. If our schools are not teaching our children about America, then we, as parents, must step up and fill that gap.\n\nIn his book, \"The Silent Majority Survival Handbook,\" Peter Wolf emphasizes the importance of parents in teaching their children about America. He suggests that parents should devote time and effort to teach their children about American heroes and history, and to instill in them a love for liberty and personal responsibility.\n\nThe future of our children and grandchildren is being decided in homes and families across America. If we want freedom to prevail and America to prosper, we need to nurture and foster the principles and ideals of freedom in our homes. Organizations such as HomeMakers for America and Libraries of Hope provide resources to support parents in this endeavor.\n\nIn the words of E.T. Sullivan, \"The greatest forces in the world are not the earthquakes and thunderbolts. The greatest forces in the world are babies.\" Mothers, never underestimate your influence. The future of our nation is in your hands. God has put the idea in your heart. Now, God waits.",
    " Title: Donald Trump Maintains Firm Stance Ahead of Republican National Convention Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a pre-recorded interview airing Thursday on ABC, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump expressed his confidence in his campaign's progress and outlined his plans for his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention.\n\nWhen asked if he thought he would get this far in the election, Trump replied, \"People have asked me that question, and I guess the answer has to be yes, or I don't think I would have done it.\" He further stated that his speech would focus on the nation's deep-seated problems and would include discussions on trade, law and order, and the nation's borders, among other topics.\n\nTrump emphasized that his message, which he described as a good message that got him this far, would remain consistent. He acknowledged that some of his key campaign promises, such as a temporary ban on Muslim immigration and a wall along the Mexican border, would still be part of his platform.\n\nDespite speculation that he may need to evolve his message as the general election nears, Trump asserted, \"I am who I am.\" He added, \"I'm a very honest person. I think that my message is a good message. It got me here. We had almost 14 million votes. That's more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party.\"\n\nTrump also addressed the controversy surrounding his wife, Melania's, speech at the convention, which was found to have similarities with Michelle Obama's 2008 Democratic National Convention speech. Meredith McIver, who assisted with Melania's speech, offered her resignation, but Trump declined, stating, \"She's been with me a long time, a good person. She came to see me, she hated to see the conflict and she made a mistake.\"\n\nTrump also touched on the polls showing that many Americans still consider him unqualified to run for the presidency. He responded, \"I think I'm very qualified, but don't forget Hillary is spending hundreds of millions on ads.\" He added, \"You know what I spent so far? Nothing, nothing.\"\n\nThe interview did not delve into the ongoing controversy surrounding Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's refusal to endorse Trump.",
    " Title: University of Pittsburgh Researchers Develop Biodegradable Tube for Peripheral Nerve Repair\n\nArticle:\n\nResearchers at the University of Pittsburgh have developed a biodegradable tube that can effectively bridge gaps in peripheral nerves, a discovery that could potentially revolutionize the treatment of nerve injuries. The study, published in Science Translational Medicine, shows that the tube, which releases a growth factor protein for several months, guides the nerve to grow along the correct path and induces faster growth.\n\nThe device, which has been in development for over a dozen years, is particularly hoped to aid soldiers injured in combat, as more than half of injured soldiers suffer nerve injuries. Combat gear offers protection to the chest and head, but arms and legs are often exposed, making them susceptible to nerve damage. Car crashes and accidents involving machinery such as snowblowers can also cause nerve injuries in the hands, arms, legs, and feet.\n\nIn the U.S., there are approximately 600,000 nerve injuries each year, though the number of severe injuries requiring the relocation of a second nerve is not yet tracked. The current treatment for severe nerve injuries is to take a nerve from another part of the body, but patients typically recover only about 50 to 60 percent of function in the damaged nerve.\n\nThe new device, which uses glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), restores nearly 80 percent of function, according to the study. GDNF is a protein that promotes nerve cell survival. The tube is made of the same polymer as dissolvable stitches, which has already been federally approved for surgical use.\n\nOther researchers are exploring the use of stem cells or other cells to help bridge the gap in the nerve, but the Pittsburgh team's approach is likely to have an easier time receiving federal approval because it does not involve cells. \"If they were to go adding stem cells or too many complexities, it would be harder to win a regulatory green light,\" says Christine Schmidt, a professor and chair of the department of biomedical engineering at the University of Florida, who was not involved with the research.\n\nThe nerve the Pittsburgh team tested is relatively small in macaques. \"It will still be a challenge to scale up to larger nerves,\" says Schmidt. \"It would be nice to see a little bit larger nerve, which would be more relevant to patients.\"\n\nIn the eight-year-long study, the researchers trained rhesus macaques to eat with their forefinger and thumb\u2014which they could only do if a repaired nerve was working properly. If they pinched the banana pellet, they got a second treat. \"We were able to see the recovery,\" says Marra. \"At that point, we knew we were ready to test in humans.\"\n\nMarra and her colleagues have several pending proposals for the first clinical trials in humans, which are likely to start in 2021 and take at least three years. A start-up she launched, AxoMax Technologies, licensed the technology from the University of Pittsburgh to begin the experiments. Marra believes her device can be competitively priced, compared with moving a nerve from elsewhere in the body\u2014and, potentially, even compared with existing repair approaches for small nerve gaps.\n\nThe researchers are also beginning to study whether their method will work for facial nerves, but Marra thinks it is unlikely to be effective for spinal cord injuries, which are far more complex and involve more nerves. The team is also looking at regenerating the muscles affected by injured nerves. \"I think [this approach] really could revolutionize thinking about nerve repair and the different options a patient will have,\" says Marra.",
    " Title: U.S. Navy Reduces Carrier Presence in Persian Gulf Due to Budget Constraints\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, the U.S. Navy will reduce its aircraft carrier presence in the Persian Gulf from two to one, as a result of looming budget constraints. This decision, confirmed by Pentagon officials on Wednesday, signals the real-world impact of automatic budget cuts that have yet to be averted.\n\nThe Navy will cease the deployment of the USS Harry S. Truman, which was scheduled to leave from Norfolk, Va. on Friday, due to budget uncertainty. The USS John C. Stennis, currently the only carrier in the Gulf, will remain in the region, while the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was previously in the Gulf but returned home in December for maintenance, will return later this month.\n\nThe Navy's decision to reduce its presence in the Gulf is a response to potential $500 billion in defense cuts over the next 10 years. If Congress fails to avert these cuts, the Navy cannot justify the cost of maintaining two carriers in the region. However, the Navy could be \"surge-ready\" and deploy more carriers in a crisis situation, according to a Navy official.\n\nThe move by the Pentagon comes as lawmakers argue over how, if at all, to avoid a March 1 deadline, after which automatic cuts to the Pentagon and other areas of the budget will begin to take effect. President Obama called for a short-term bill to avert the cuts, but Republicans criticized this approach as irresponsible.\n\nIn addition to the carrier reduction, the Pentagon has outlined a series of spending cuts that may take effect if Congress does not pass a budget. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned of a $46 billion spending reduction in this fiscal year and a $35 billion shortfall in operating expenses.\n\nThe Navy will also cease deployments to South America and the Caribbean and limit those to Europe. The Air Force will cut operations at various missile defense radar sites from 24 hours to eight hours, and the Army will cancel training center rotations for four brigades and cancel repairs for thousands of vehicles, radios, and weapons.\n\nFurthermore, U.S. troops are likely to see a smaller pay hike next year than initially planned, due to strains on the budget. The Pentagon will recommend a 1 percent pay increase in 2014, instead of a 1.7 percent raise.\n\nThis decision to reduce the U.S. Navy's carrier presence in the Persian Gulf is part of a broader effort by the Pentagon to address budget constraints, as lawmakers continue to debate the future of defense spending in the United States.",
    " Title: Trump and Putin Discuss Election Meddling and Foreign Policy in First Call Since Mueller Report\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held an hour-long conversation, marking their first official discussion since the release of the Mueller report. The call, initiated by the White House, covered a range of topics, including the ongoing issue of Russian interference in US elections.\n\nTrump took to Twitter to share details of the conversation, stating, \"Had a long and very good conversation with President Putin.\" The US president also rebuffed a question about whether he had warned Putin against meddling in the 2020 elections, responding to the reporter's inquiry by labeling her as \"very rude.\"\n\nThe Kremlin confirmed the conversation, stating that the call had been initiated by the White House. The leaders last spoke informally at the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires in December. In a tweet on Friday, Trump emphasized the importance of good relations with Russia, China, and other nations, reiterating his long-standing position.\n\nWhen asked about the issue of Russian meddling during a White House briefing on Friday, Trump declined to discuss specifics, instead focusing on the positive aspects of international relations. However, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed that the topic was briefly discussed during the call.\n\nSanders stated, \"Very, very briefly it was discussed, essentially in the context that it's over and there was no collusion, which I'm pretty sure both leaders were very well aware of long before this call took place.\" She also mentioned that the leaders discussed the investigation by US Special Counsel Robert Mueller into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe White House press secretary described the call as an \"overall positive conversation.\" The special counsel's report, released in a redacted form last month, concluded that Russia had interfered in the 2016 presidential election \"in sweeping and systematic fashion.\" The interference included an extensive social media campaign and hacking into Democratic Party servers by Russian military intelligence. The inquiry did not determine that the Trump campaign had conspired with Russia.\n\nIn addition to the election meddling issue, Trump and Putin also discussed various foreign policy matters during their conversation. The White House did not provide further details about these discussions.",
    " Title: Obama Administration's Carbon Emission Regulations: A Step Toward Green Energy Revolution\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration has proposed new regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions in the United States, marking a significant shift in the country's energy industry. The regulations call for power companies to generate 28 percent of the country's energy from renewable sources by 2030, up from the current 11 percent, and to cut carbon emissions to 32 percent of 2005 levels over the same period.\n\nThe new rules are intended to position the U.S. as a leader in the global fight against climate change ahead of a major climate conference in Paris later this year. However, the regulations face numerous challenges, including legal battles, potential changes under subsequent administrations, and opposition from energy companies.\n\nThe success of the president's vision hinges on public support. While global warming ranks low on the list of priorities for the president and Congress, according to a Pew Research Center survey, there has been a 10 percentage point increase in those considering it a top priority.\n\nThe regulations are modeled on the experiences of a few Western European nations, particularly Germany, which has seen significant energy price increases as a result of its green energy initiatives. However, public support has remained strong, despite energy company opposition.\n\nIn Germany, private individuals and farmers account for a significant portion of renewable energy production, not the major power companies. This grassroots approach to renewable energy has been a key factor in Germany's success in meeting its green energy targets.\n\nSweden, another European nation pioneering green energy, has been taxing carbon emissions since 1991 and currently derives 47 percent of its energy from renewable sources. The Obama administration has cited Sweden as offering valuable lessons in the transition to a green energy economy.\n\nThe new regulations will likely lead to upheaval in the U.S. energy industry, with potentially hundreds of coal-fired power plants being closed. Critics argue that the regulations will result in steep price increases. However, the Obama administration maintains that the rules will not increase energy prices.\n\nThe regulations allow states flexibility in implementing the new rules, with each state developing its own plan under the guidelines laid out by the Environmental Protection Agency. If states refuse to create their own plans, the Obama administration will impose a plan. The new rules are based on a cap-and-trade system, a concept that has been met with opposition from Republicans.\n\nThe new regulations mark a significant step in the U.S.'s transition to a green energy economy. The success of the regulations will depend on public support, the ability of the energy industry to adapt, and the political will to implement and enforce the new rules.",
    " Title: U.S. Cruise Ship Carrying Potential Coronavirus Cases Docked, Eight More States Report First Cases\n\nArticle:\n\n-NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A cruise ship carrying 3,500 passengers and crew, with 21 confirmed cases of coronavirus, has been barred from docking in San Francisco, U.S. officials said on Friday. The Grand Princess ship, which has been at sea since February 11, will be taken to a non-commercial port where everyone on board will be tested.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who is leading the White House's response to the outbreak, said at a news conference that 19 crew members and two passengers out of 46 people tested so far on the ship have the virus. U.S. President Donald Trump said he would rather have passengers remain on board, but that he would let others decide if they can disembark.\n\nEight states - Pennsylvania, Indiana, Minnesota, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Nebraska, South Carolina, and Hawaii - reported their first cases on Friday, meaning more than half of the 50 U.S. states now have the virus. The respiratory illness, which emerged in China and has spread to more than 90 nations, has killed 15 Americans and infected more than 100,000 worldwide.\n\nAs stocks plunge and U.S. companies grapple with the economic fallout, the Trump administration is weighing tax relief for the cruise, travel, and airline industries, according to a source familiar with the plan.\n\nIn the most high-profile cancellation, the South by Southwest music and technology festival in Austin, Texas, was called off on Friday. In Seattle, the epicenter of the nation's outbreak, there have been school closures and orders to work from home. In areas less affected by the outbreak, music festivals and sports events have been canceled or curtailed as a precaution.\n\nThe crisis has hit stocks hard. The benchmark S&P 500 closed down another 1.7% on Friday, after falling nearly 3% the day before. As new states report their first cases, others watched their tally grow. Cases in New York jumped to 44 from 22, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday, adding that some 4,000 people in the state were under precautionary quarantine and 44 under mandatory quarantine.\n\nAmid widespread criticism of not enough tests available for states in need, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged that \"some missteps\" had initially slowed the distribution of tests, but said the overall response was going well. \"In the next couple of weeks, we should be ratcheted up to get many more out,\" Fauci said on NBC's Today program.",
    " Title: CRNC Report: GOP Faces Challenges in Attracting Young Voters, Criticizes Party's Image and Messaging\n\nArticle:\n\nThe College Republican National Committee (CRNC) has released a detailed report, titled \"Grand Old Party for a Brand New Generation,\" which offers a critical analysis of the Republican Party's struggles in appealing to young voters. The report, based on extensive polling and focus groups, provides insights into the party's perceived shortcomings on social and economic issues, messaging, and outreach.\n\nThe 95-page study, which was obtained exclusively by \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Sunday, paints a grim picture of the GOP's current standing with young voters. The report, authored by young Republican activists, is particularly critical of the party's focus on downsizing government and cutting taxes, offensive and polarizing rhetoric, and ineffective messaging and outreach strategies.\n\nThe report highlights several areas of concern, including the party's stance on gay marriage, its perceived indifference towards Hispanic voters, and its economic policies. The report states, \"On the \u2018open-minded\u2019 issue [of gay marriage]... we will face serious difficulty so long as the issue of gay marriage remains on the table.\" Regarding Hispanic voters, the report notes, \"Latino voters... tend to think the GOP couldn\u2019t care less about them.\" The report also criticizes the party's economic stance, stating, \"We\u2019ve become the party that will pat you on your back when you make it, but won\u2019t offer you a hand to help you get there.\"\n\nThe report attributes the party's image problem to \"outrageous statements made by errant Republican voices.\" The words associated with the GOP by up-for-grabs voters include \"closed-minded,\" \"racist,\" \"rigid,\" and \"old-fashioned.\"\n\nDespite the critical assessment, the report maintains hope for the future, stating, \"The Republican Party has won the youth vote before and can absolutely win it again.\" The report points to presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, who were competitive with young voters, as examples of past success. However, the report emphasizes that significant work is needed to repair the damage done to the Republican brand among young voters over the last decade.\n\nThe report is based on two national surveys of 800 registered voters each, ages 18-29, and six focus groups of young people from diverse backgrounds who had voted for President Barack Obama but were considered \"winnable\" for the GOP. The surveys were conducted by the Winston Group, a Washington-based GOP polling firm. The cost of the study was a \"significant investment,\" according to Alex Schriver, who served as the chairman of the CRNC during the election and is a co-author of the report.\n\nThe CRNC, which bills itself as the oldest and largest political youth organization in America, is an independent entity with 250,000 members on 1,800 campuses across the country. The report will be publicly released on Monday, and the findings will be presented privately to Republican officials and outside groups. The current CRNC Chairwoman, Alex Smith, declined to specify who would be in attendance.",
    " Title: Assessing the Impact of Leaks on U.S. Intelligence Efforts: A Closer Look at the Fallout\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent wave of leaks, as claimed by the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, has caused \"huge, grave damage\" to U.S. intelligence gathering capabilities. However, the extent of this damage is a subject of debate among experts and former officials.\n\nWhile some, like Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian columnist who facilitated the leaks, argue that the disclosures have not jeopardized national security, others suggest that there will likely be some harm, though not in the ways many Americans might expect.\n\nThe potential negative impact of the leaks is more likely to affect the U.S. Internet industry, as some of its international customer base may seek out sites perceived as more secure from American government surveillance. The concern is not so much about the specifics of what was leaked, but rather the widespread publicity the leaks generated.\n\nEvery news story could serve as a revelation to some terrorists, and a reminder to others, of the nation's capabilities. This, in turn, could make it more difficult to catch less skilled or less experienced terrorists, who might be tipped off or decide to behave more furtively due to the recent spate of surveillance disclosures.\n\nIntelligence agencies, it seems, thrive on other people's mistakes. As former NSA general counsel Joel Brenner points out, \"You'd be surprised at how many people make mistakes.\"\n\nThe debate continues over whether the harm in the recent wave of leaks comes directly from the leaks themselves or from the media coverage that has treated them as earth-shattering revelations. Before the first leak last week about Verizon call data being gathered on a daily basis, there was ample reason for both privacy-sensitive Americans and well-informed terrorists to suspect that the government had been gathering a great deal of information on calling patterns.\n\nIn conclusion, while the exact impact of the leaks on U.S. intelligence efforts is still a matter of debate, it is clear that the leaks have generated widespread publicity, potentially tipping off less skilled terrorists and causing some damage to the U.S. Internet industry. The debate continues over the direct impact of the leaks versus the impact of the media coverage they have received.",
    " Title: President Trump's Independence Day Address: A Call to Courage and Preservation of American Values\n\nIn his Independence Day address at Mount Rushmore, President Donald Trump emphasized the need for courage in preserving the nation, born not out of peace but out of crisis and courage. The speech was a tribute to the American tradition of courage, reminding Americans of the sacrifices made by their forefathers to establish and protect the country.\n\nThe President highlighted the struggles of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt, four American heroes whose lives were dedicated to the betterment of the nation. He contrasted the hardships faced by these heroes with the current state of the country, which, despite the ongoing pandemic, civil disorder, and hatred, is still a beacon of hope and freedom.\n\nThe President's speech was a call to honor the legacy of these heroes, rather than attempting to erase them from history. He criticized those who break quarantine to tear down memorials to history, only to turn around and blame others for the spread of disease. The President also addressed the radical fringe that seeks to destroy the country's heritage, emphasizing that they cannot redefine America.\n\nThe President's speech was a call to action for Americans, urging them to stand united in defense of their values and heritage. He encouraged Americans to remember the optimistic message of the past, that the country has faced and overcome greater challenges in the past, and can do so again with the right leadership.\n\nFormer Governor of Arkansas and conservative commentator Mike Huckabee, who was in attendance at the event, praised the President's speech, stating that it was a reminder of the American spirit of courage and the need to preserve the country's values. Huckabee, an ordained Southern Baptist minister, is a well-known figure in conservative politics and culture. He is the host of the popular weekly talk show Huckabee, which airs on TBN.",
    " Title: Obama Administration's Deportation Record: A Look Back at the Controversial Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn October 2010, the Obama administration was under scrutiny for its record-breaking deportation of illegal immigrants. The then-head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) boasted about the high numbers, stating that the figures were not manipulated. However, a Washington Post report revealed a memo suggesting that ICE had set a goal of 400,000 deportations for that year. The document urged agents to focus on criminal alien removals but expressed concern about the low number of non-criminal removals.\n\nThe memo further stated that the agency aimed to achieve 400,000 removals and returns overall, and warned they were \"well under the agency's goal of 400,000\" at that time. Under pressure from immigration activists, the administration's focus on deportations has since softened, much like the Associated Press's decision to phase out the term \"illegal immigrant\" from its style guide.\n\nPresident Obama, during a recent immigration discussion, expressed his disapproval of immigration enforcement, stating, \"It's not smart... It doesn't make sense.\" Vice President Joe Biden, interrupted by a heckler shouting \"Stop the deportations,\" responded, \"We'll do that too, kid.\"\n\nWhile some activists argue for the abolition of deportations as a policy tool, the alternative to mass legalization programs is not mass deportations. The rhetoric from these activists often suggests that deportation is an illegitimate policy tool, with some arguing that no one should be deported merely for being in the country illegally.\n\nOne group's slogan reads, \"Not one more family destroyed, not one more day without equality, not one more indifferent reaction to suffering, not one more deportation.\" This stance, however, is met with criticism, as it is seen as an extreme position that ignores the need for border control and the enforcement of immigration laws.\n\nBarbara Jordan, a civil rights icon and the first black woman elected to Congress from the South, chaired Bill Clinton's commission to reform immigration in the 1990s. Jordan understood the importance of deportation in maintaining the credibility of immigration policy. She stated, \"Those who should get in, get in; those who should be kept out, are kept out; and those who should not be here will be required to leave.\"\n\nIn 2013, 59 percent of deportees were convicted of a crime, and a third were felons, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. Adding in repeat immigration violators, illegal border crossings, and immigration fugitives, 98 percent of the people deported last year fell into these categories.\n\nThe debate over the legitimacy of these deportations continues, with some arguing against borders and sovereignty, as well as law and order. The Obama administration's record-breaking deportation numbers have been a point of contention, with critics questioning the methods used to achieve these numbers, such as counting immigrants who had left the previous fiscal year.\n\nAs the political landscape changes, the Obama administration's focus on deportations may shift, with Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer stating that they can \"greatly curtail deportations\" if congressional Republicans do not pass an immigration bill. The future of immigration policy in the United States remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the issue of deportations will continue to be a contentious topic in the ongoing debate over immigration reform.",
    " Title: \"Extinction Rebellion Protests: A Preview of Potential Climate Change Protest Tactics in U.S. Cities\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent weeks, European cities have witnessed a series of disruptive protests led by the Extinction Rebellion (XR), a radical anti-climate change group. These protests, which have resulted in thousands of arrests, have seen commuter trains halted during rush hour, buildings vandalized, and breastfeeding mothers blocking entrances. The group's actions have sparked debate and concern, with many questioning whether similar protests could soon make their way to American cities.\n\nThe latest stunt by XR took place in London, where two activists climbed on top of commuter trains during rush hour and blocked their departure. The protesters unfurled a banner that read \"Business as Usual = Death.\" Angry commuters, many of whom would have faced pay deductions for late arrival at work, removed the protesters from the trains, and London Underground staff escorted them away.\n\nThe actions of XR have been met with mixed reactions. While some support the group's message, many Londoners have grown tired of the disruptions caused by the protests. A snap poll showed that over 60% of respondents were fed up with the protests. In response, XR leaders have promised that future protests will \"evolve,\" but the meaning of this remains unclear.\n\nClare Farrell, XR's co-founder, defended the train action, stating, \"This is what you do when you think that absolutely everything is at stake. What would you do if you knew your children were in a burning building? Well, you would break down the door, wouldn't you? It wouldn't be pretty. You wouldn't be able to do it in a way that everyone said, 'Oh, that was nice and calm.' But it's not. It's an emergency.\"\n\nHowever, the real enablers of XR's extremism are the donors and celebrities who provide the group with the funding and publicity that allow it to attract fanatical followers. Celebrities such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Jude Law, Bob Geldof, and Sienna Miller have backed XR, despite their high-flying lifestyles and the enormous carbon footprint they leave behind.\n\nAs the climate change debate continues, it is essential to consider the tactics being used by groups like XR and the potential impact they could have on cities in the United States. If officials in Washington, D.C., and other cities want to avoid a similar fate, they should take note of the disruptions caused by XR in Europe and work to neutralize any potential American versions of the group.",
    " Title: Speaker Paul Ryan's Delayed Endorsement of Donald Trump: A Historical Perspective and Implications for the Republican Party\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, House Speaker Paul Ryan, despite initially anticipating the primary race to continue for a few more weeks, has been spending the past day refining his stance on the Republican nominee, according to his aides. This move, while aligning him with other notable Republicans, has put him at odds with President Donald Trump, who has received unwavering support from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\nHistorically, a party nominee has never failed to secure the backing of a House speaker or majority leader from their party in modern times. In 1896, Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed ran against William McKinley and made it clear he would not serve as vice president, but ultimately endorsed the nominee. Similarly, in 1964, Senator Barry Goldwater had to wait for the endorsement of Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois, but eventually received it, quelling the \"stop-Goldwater\" movement.\n\nRyan's remarks have caught the Republican party off guard, effectively providing a sort of permission slip for party members to pursue their own stance on Trump's candidacy. Had Ryan issued a forceful endorsement, it would have pressured fellow House Republicans to follow suit, a step many have been reluctant to take.\n\nIn a statement, Ryan expressed, \"I'm not there right now. And I hope to, though, and I want to. But I think what is required is that we unify the party, and I think the bulk of the burden on unifying the party will have to come from our presumptive nominee.\"\n\nThe long-term effect of Ryan's decision remains uncertain, as Trump has defied convention throughout the campaign. The Republican Party now faces a critical period of unity and cohesion as the general election approaches.",

This dramatic fall occurred despite the Federal Reserve's intervention with nearly $1.5 trillion in emergency relief.\n\nThe Dow closed at 21,200.62, having dropped by 9.99% or 2,352.60 points. The Nasdaq also saw a significant decline, falling 9.43% or 750.25 points to close at 7,201.80. The S&P 500 followed suit, dropping 9.5% or 260.74 points to close at 2,480.64.\n\nThis marks the third consecutive day of massive declines, with Tuesday's gains now seeming distant. The uncertainty surrounding the novel coronavirus outbreak and its impact on the global economy may be the primary reason for the continued selling streak.\n\nEbrahim Rahbari, director of global economics at Citi Research, told CNBC, \"We continue to emphasize that this Fed will act aggressively and in particular that central banks are focused on safeguarding market functioning at this point, and will continue to provide liquidity in scale.\" However, he added, \"These measures will still not be sufficient to durably stabilize market sentiment yet in light of credit concerns and escalating health concerns.\"\n\nThe travel industry, particularly airlines, has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak. United Airlines, Delta, and American Airlines saw drops of 12.26%, 21%, and 17.28% respectively. Airlines started canceling flights following President Trump's decision to ban travel between the U.S. and Europe for the next 30 days.\n\nIn addition to the stock market turmoil, other American institutions are being disrupted by efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus. Broadway has been shut down, major sports events have been canceled, and entire seasons are being put on hold.\n\nIn the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies suffered their worst declines in years as investors also sold heavily. SaaS shares were down over 8%, and after-hours, Slack's earnings failed to excite investors, leading to further equity sell-offs.\n\nIn this challenging economic climate, it appears that there is no silver lining, unless one had shorted oil a month ago. The country is yet to ramp up its COVID-19 testing regime, adding to the uncertainty and volatility in the markets.",
    " Title: Sequester Blame Game: Obama, Republicans Point Fingers as Sequestration Looms\n\n Article:\n\n As the March 1 deadline for the looming sequester approaches, President Barack Obama returned to Washington on Monday after a three-day Florida golfing trip. The across-the-board cuts, which Obama himself devised, are set to kick in, and both parties are scrambling to find a solution to avoid the automatic budget cuts.\n\n House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, leading the Republican charge, is making sure the public understands where to place the blame if the package cannot be stopped. \"Don't forget it's the president who proposed the sequester and designed the sequester,\" Ryan said on ABC News' This Week. \"House Republicans twice passed legislation replacing the sequester with smarter cuts in other areas of government.\"\n\n Ryan stated that House Republicans are still working on plans to replace the sequester but believes it will occur with just two weeks remaining before it starts. The Senate has yet to pass a spending bill to replace the sequester, Ryan noted, adding that Obama \"gave a speech showing he'd like to replace it, but he has not put any details out there.\"\n\n In his State of the Union Address on Feb. 12, the president explained that in 2011, Congress passed a law that said if both parties could not agree on spending cuts, \"about a trillion dollars worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year.\" Obama described the \"sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts\" as jeopardizing military readiness, devastating priorities like education and energy, and medical research, and slowing the recovery and costing hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\n However, Ryan argued that the sequester is looming and will likely happen \"because the president, back in the last session of Congress, refused to cut spending in any place and therefore we wound up with the sequester.\"\n\n Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward, sitting on the discussion panel on Fox News Sunday, also placed the blame on the White House. \"It was the White House, it was Obama and Jack Lew and Rob Nabors who went to the Democratic leader in the Senate Harry Reid and said this is the solution,\" said Woodward. \"But everyone has their fingerprints on this,\" he added. \"What is important about it is, it is a governing travesty.\"\n\n House Speaker John Boehner also blames the White House for the sequester. \"It's taking a meat axe to government spending,\" he said following the State of the Union speech. \"That's why the president ought to be forthcoming about a plan to replace the sequester. His Number Two, Majority Leader Eric Cantor agreed with Boehner that the GOP will do what it can to avoid the cuts kicking in.\n\n The threat of the sequester starting has been made worse by Congress' decision to take a 10-day President's Day break. It won't return to session until Feb. 25, giving it just four working days to find a solution. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid claims Democrats will issue their answer at some point in that time. \"Democrats believe the right way to eliminate the deficit is to target waste and abuse with smart spending cuts with closing tax loopholes,\" Reid said.\n\n However, Reid's decision to hold off, just adds to the brinksmanship that Obama slammed during his address, when he said, \"The greatest nation on Earth can not keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next.\" The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another.",
    " Title: Trump Announces 'Most Dishonest and Corrupt Media Awards' Winners\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a controversial move, U.S. President Donald Trump announced the winners of his self-proclaimed \"Most Dishonest and Corrupt Media Awards\" on Wednesday, recognizing news organizations such as CNN and The New York Times for what he deemed as inaccurate reporting.\n\nThe president took to Twitter to announce the winners, stating, \"And the FAKE NEWS winners are...\". The tweet linked to a list of instances where the media, according to Trump, had reported untruths.\n\nThe list included several instances where the media was accused of misrepresenting facts, such as reporting that Republicans had won five special elections to the Democrats' nil in June 2017, which was not true. In reality, Republicans had won four, but Democrats won one.\n\nAnother instance involved a claim that the U.S. had a $17 billion trade deficit with Canada, a figure that the media was accused of inflating. In fact, the U.S. had a trade surplus with Canada of $8.1 billion in 2016.\n\nThe list also included claims that President Obama and other U.S. presidents did not make phone calls to the families of U.S. military personnel lost in action, which was also found to be false.\n\nThe announcement sparked backlash, with critics arguing that the president's use of the term \"fake news\" to discredit media outlets undermines the credibility of journalism and the free press.\n\nThe list of alleged inaccuracies in media reporting is not exhaustive and has been met with skepticism by some, who argue that the president's use of the term \"fake news\" is often used to discredit media outlets that report unfavorably on his administration.\n\nThe list of winners of the \"Most Dishonest and Corrupt Media Awards\" can be found on the president's Twitter account.",
    " Title: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Announces Agreement on USMCA Trade Deal, Calling it a \"Victory for American Workers\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced on Tuesday that House Democrats had reached an agreement with the White House over the USMCA trade deal, a landmark agreement initially proposed by the Trump administration.\n\n\"It is infinitely better than what was initially proposed by the administration,\" Pelosi said during a press conference on Capitol Hill. \"It's a victory for American workers, and it's one that we take great pride in advancing.\"\n\nThe House Speaker dismissed the announcement as a victory for the president, saying, \"We came a long way from what he originally proposed. There are some people who would say 'why make it look like he has a victory?' Well, we're declaring victory for the American worker.\"\n\nWays and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) detailed the final days of negotiations, saying, \"This got really hot on a number of occasions,\" but called the deal a \"transformative agreement\" and \"an opportunity we couldn't let get away from us.\"\n\n\"It's a triumph for workers everywhere across America,\" Neal said.\n\nPelosi's announcement comes after AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who represents the largest federation of unions in the country and a key party in negotiations, said Monday that a deal was in place. The AFL-CIO confirmed Tuesday it would back the trade agreement, something that would give more cover for Democrats to support it.\n\n\"Working people are responsible for a deal that is a vast improvement over both the original NAFTA and the flawed proposal brought forward in 2017,\" Trumka said. \"For the first time, there truly will be enforceable labor standards\u2014including a process that allows for the inspections of factories and facilities that are not living up to their obligations.\"\n\nDuring the press conference, Pelosi thanked Trumka for his \"brilliance and knowledge\" in negotiations.\n\nIn recent months, Democrats have advocated tighter labor enforcements in USMCA to avoid the criticisms of the former North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with Pelosi remaining optimistic of an eventual agreement, saying a deal was \"imminent\" last month while calling USMCA \"a good template.\"\n\nThe USMCA overhauls NAFTA, and is designed to raise wages and improve working conditions for both Mexican and American auto workers by tightening regulations. Republicans have long been accusing Democrats of inaction on the bill, which was signed at last year's G-20.\n\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said an amended version of USMCA will be signed on Tuesday by officials from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\n\nPrior to Pelosi's announcement, President Trump tweeted in anticipation of the deal.\n\n\"America's great USMCA Trade Bill is looking good. It will be the best and most important trade deal ever made by the USA. Good for everybody\u2014Farmers, Manufacturers, Energy, Unions\u2014tremendous support. Importantly, we will finally end our Country's worst Trade Deal, NAFTA!\" Trump tweeted on Tuesday.",
    " Title: EPA Proposes National Rules to Reduce Sulfur in Gasoline, Sparking Debate Over Health and Economic Implications\n\nIn a move aimed at reducing harmful pollution and improving the efficiency of vehicles, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed national rules to lower the sulfur content in gasoline. The new standards, if adopted, are expected to significantly reduce emissions that contribute to smog and improve the performance of catalytic converters.\n\nAccording to NPR's Richard Harris, the EPA believes that the use of lower-sulfur gasoline, already in use in regions like California, Europe, and Japan, will lead to a reduction in emissions that cause smog. The EPA estimates that by 2030, these rules could annually avoid up to 2,400 premature deaths, 23,000 cases of respiratory ailments in children, and provide total health-related benefits between $8 billion and $23 billion.\n\nHowever, the proposal has drawn criticism from some Republicans who argue that the rule could increase consumer costs. The EPA estimates a penny-per-gallon increase in gas prices, but the oil industry contends that the rule could add 6 to 9 cents to the cost of a gallon of gasoline. If adopted, the rule would take effect in 2017.\n\nThe Hill reports that House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., has expressed concern that increases in gas prices disproportionately affect the nation's most vulnerable individuals and families.\n\nIn contrast, automakers support the proposal, with the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers stating that cleaner cars will need cleaner fuels to effectively scrub smog-causing particles from vehicle emissions. Gloria Bergquist, a spokesperson for the Alliance, said, \"Our cleaner cars will need even cleaner fuels like those already sold across Europe and Asia, and we are pleased EPA is proposing cleaner fuels.\"\n\nThe debate over the EPA's proposed rules continues, with both sides presenting arguments based on health and economic implications. As the proposal moves forward, it remains to be seen how the final rules will impact consumers, the automotive industry, and the environment.",
    " Title: Americans Divided on Obamacare, Same-Sex Marriage, and Supreme Court's Role in Healthcare and Marriage Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nA new CNN/ORC poll has revealed a divided American public on the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), same-sex marriage, and the role of the Supreme Court in these issues. The poll, conducted at the end of May, surveyed 1,025 adults.\n\nOn Obamacare, 43 percent approve of the law overall, matching a previous high in 2013, with 55 percent opposed. Interestingly, 53 percent say it's too soon to make a judgment. The Supreme Court's upcoming decision on the King v. Burwell case could determine the future of Obamacare, with the plaintiffs arguing that the law only allows federal subsidies on state-run exchanges, not for those in states that use the federal exchange. If the court agrees, 7.5 million people in those states could lose their subsidies, potentially driving insurance costs out of reach.\n\nOn the issue of same-sex marriage, the court is currently divided, with the decision expected later this month. The poll revealed that 63 percent of those surveyed believe gay and lesbian couples have a constitutional right to marry, with this support reaching across most age demographics, including 73 percent of those under age 50 and 52 percent older than 50.\n\nThe Supreme Court's trust levels varied on these issues. On healthcare, only about half said they have at least a moderate amount of trust in the court as it considers the Obamacare case. On same-sex marriage, the trust levels were similar. However, on freedom of speech, voting rights, and the death penalty, the court's trust levels rose, with 69 percent, 65 percent, and 60 percent, respectively.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts' opinion among those polled remains positive, with 33 percent seeing him favorably and 24 percent unfavorably. This is a drop from 41 percent seeing him favorably after the court upheld the Obamacare individual mandate provision. The opinions revealed in the CNN/ORC poll on Obamacare and same-sex marriage mirror those of recent polls, with most Americans wanting subsidies to be left alone and a majority believing all Americans earning similar incomes should be eligible for the same subsidies, no matter where they live. If the court rules in favor of eliminating the subsidies, most voters want Congress to apply a fix so nobody loses their subsidies.",
    " Title: Diplomatic Efforts Intensify as World Powers Seek to End Violence in Eastern Ukraine\n\nArticle:\n\nDiplomatic efforts are underway to end the renewed fighting in eastern Ukraine, with French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel holding urgent talks in the capital Kiev. The leaders presented a new peace initiative, with US Secretary of State John Kerry also in Kiev, expressing a desire for a diplomatic solution, but not ignoring Russian aggression.\n\nThe conflict, which has claimed nearly 5,400 lives since April according to the UN, has been marked by fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels. Both Ukraine and the West have accused Russia of arming rebels in eastern Ukraine and sending troops across the border, while Russia denies direct involvement but acknowledges some Russian volunteers are fighting alongside the rebels.\n\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko expressed hope for a ceasefire following the talks with Ms Merkel and Mr Hollande. Earlier, he thanked the German and French leaders for their visit at \"a very urgent time.\"\n\nThe German and French leaders made no public comments after Thursday's meeting, which appeared to be a speedily arranged visit. Ahead of the talks, Mr Hollande said he and Mrs Merkel would present a new peace proposal based on Ukraine's \"territorial integrity,\" which could be \"acceptable to all.\"\n\nMr Hollande and Mrs Merkel will now meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Friday. Speaking earlier at a joint news conference with Mr Kerry, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk emphasized the need for peace, but also reiterated that Ukraine would never consider anything that undermines its territorial integrity.\n\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry accused Russia of violating Ukraine's sovereignty, stating that Russia had been acting with \"impunity,\" crossing the Ukrainian border \"at will with weapons [and] personnel.\" He added that the US was still \"reviewing all options,\" including the possibility of providing \"defensive weapons\" to Ukraine due to the dangerous escalation in violence.\n\nThe US currently provides only \"non-lethal\" assistance, such as night-vision goggles and body armor. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich warned that any decision by the US to supply weapons to Ukraine would \"inflict colossal damage to Russian-American relations.\"\n\nSeveral senior Western officials have also expressed concern about the prospect of US arms being sent to Ukraine. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier likened the option to \"throwing more weapons on the bonfire,\" while NATO commander Philip Breedlove stated that governments must take into account that the move \"could trigger a more strident reaction from Russia.\"\n\nThe consensus view up to now has been not to supply weapons, but to give non-lethal support like radars, medical gear, body-armor, and so on. Only Poland has explicitly stated that it might arm Ukraine if asked. Now, the balance of the debate is shifting in the US, but there is no clear will to provide weapons to the Kiev government. There is a growing sense of urgency and concern within NATO, and if diplomacy fails, arming Kiev may become a serious option.\n\nThe talks in Kiev come as NATO unveils details of a plan to bolster its military presence in Eastern Europe in response to the Ukraine crisis. A new rapid reaction \"spearhead\" force of up to 5,000 troops is expected to be announced, with its lead units able to deploy at two days' notice. NATO is also establishing a network of small command centers in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria.\n\nMeanwhile, officials said on Thursday that the European Union is adding 19 people, including five Russians, to its sanctions list over the Ukraine crisis. Nine \"entities\" will also be targeted by the sanctions, which were reportedly agreed at an emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers last week. Fighting has intensified in eastern Ukraine in recent weeks amid a rebel offensive. The fiercest fighting has been near the town of Debaltseve, where rebels are trying to surround Ukrainian troops. The town is a crucial rail hub linking the rebel-held cities of Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\nOver 1.2 million Ukrainians have fled their homes since last April, when the rebels seized a significant portion of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions following Russia's annexation of Crimea.",
    " Title: GOP Leaders Call for Unity as Trump and Ryan Meet Amidst Tax Return Controversy and Split within the Party\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to unify the Republican Party following a contentious primary election, Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, is meeting with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan on Thursday. The meeting is crucial, according to a top GOP leader, as the party seeks to present a united front ahead of the general election in November.\n\nHowever, House Republicans are urging Speaker Ryan to endorse their party's presumptive nominee. Ryan, who has been hesitant to support Trump, has expressed a desire to ensure a genuine unification, stating, \"To pretend we are unified as a party after coming through a very bruising primary, which just ended a week ago, to pretend to unify without actually unifying, then we go into the fall with half strength.\"\n\nThe meeting takes place amidst ongoing questions regarding Trump's refusal to release his tax returns. Trump has stated that he will not release them until an IRS audit is completed, a process that may extend beyond the election. This has been a point of attack for Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who, along with her husband, has released 33 years of tax returns.\n\nIn response to questions about his tax returns, Trump has enlisted the help of well-known conservative economists Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore to help rewrite his initial tax plan. The plan, according to some analysts, could potentially add $10 trillion to $12 trillion to America's already burgeoning national debt, while stimulating economic growth.\n\nTrump has emphasized his commitment to benefiting the middle class and businesses through tax reforms. \"The thing I'm going to do is to make sure the middle class gets good tax breaks because they have been absolutely shunned,\" Trump said. \"The other thing is that I'm going to fight very hard for business.\"\n\nFurthermore, Trump is considering former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to head a commission on radical Islam. The commission, if established, would study Trump's immigration policies, including his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.\n\nDespite Trump's official status as the presumptive nominee, there remains a significant split within the Republican Party over his conservative credentials. A recent Reuters poll places Trump and Clinton in a dead heat, with Clinton at 41 percent, Trump at 40 percent, and 19 percent undecided.\n\nThe article concludes with a reminder that, despite the ongoing internal party divisions and external controversies, the general election is fast approaching. The outcome of the meeting between Trump and Ryan, as well as the party's ability to unify, will likely play a significant role in the upcoming election.",
    " Title: Vice President Pence Rallies Conservatives at CPAC, Promises Repeal of Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rousing speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence called for the Republican Party to stand firm behind President Donald Trump's agenda, emphasizing the importance of keeping promises made to the American people.\n\n\"President Trump is a man of his word, and we're in the promise-keeping business these days,\" Pence told the CPAC audience. He criticized the Democratic Party for making promises they could not fulfill and called for a renewed commitment to the conservative ideals that have defined the Republican Party.\n\n\"A strong military, more jobs, less taxes, respect for the Constitution, and the values that have made America great in a deep and abiding faith in the goodness of the American people,\" Pence said, outlining the key elements of the Trump administration's agenda.\n\nDespite former House Speaker John Boehner's statement on Thursday that Republicans would not repeal Obamacare but rather fix it, Pence reaffirmed the GOP's commitment to repealing the healthcare law.\n\n\"President Donald Trump is leading the fight to repeal and replace Obamacare. And let me assure you, America's Obamacare nightmare is about to end,\" Pence declared. He emphasized that the American people understand the failures of Obamacare and called for its complete elimination.\n\nOther key members of the Trump White House, including top advisers Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus, also addressed the conservative crowd. Bannon spoke about the ongoing battles between the media and the administration, stating that the relationship would not improve and would likely worsen.\n\n\"It's not only not going to get better, it's going to get worse every day with the media. And here's why. By the way, the internal logic makes sense \u2013 they're corporatist, globalist media that are adamantly opposed, adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has,\" Bannon said.\n\nHe encouraged the audience to hold the president's team accountable for delivering on the promises it has made, emphasizing the administration's commitment to fighting for the American people.",
    " Title: Obama's State of the Union Address: A Blend of Past Campaign and New Proposals, Amidst Fiscal Challenges and Bipartisan Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama delivered a speech that, in some aspects, resembled a campaign speech from the previous year. The president emphasized the need for a balanced approach to deficit reduction, the importance of protecting the middle class, and the necessity of reigniting the \"true engine of America's economic growth.\"\n\nWhile the president did acknowledge the opposition party and offered praise for some Republican legislators, many of his proposals, such as increasing the minimum wage and guaranteeing preschool, are non-starters with the GOP. The president's agenda includes 15 manufacturing hubs to foster high-tech job growth, as well as tax credits for businesses to hire and invest, scientific research and development, and infrastructure investment.\n\nHowever, the president's proposals, which aim to make high-quality preschool available to every child and invest in various areas, are not accompanied by a clear plan for funding these initiatives. White House officials have promised to provide more details when the administration's budget proposal is released in a few weeks.\n\nThe president also emphasized his intention to use executive actions to push policy if Congress thwarts him. He announced action on climate change and cybersecurity, stating, \"If Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will.\" The president signed an executive order to increase information-sharing and help the private sector develop standards in response to cybersecurity concerns.\n\nThe president's address also touched on other liberal priorities, such as climate change, equal treatment and benefits for gay Americans, and a bipartisan commission to improve the voting system. The president also announced a hike in the minimum wage.\n\nThe speech was overshadowed by the manhunt for accused cop-killer Christopher Dorner, which led to a shift in media coverage. The president might have received an unintended benefit from the other story of the day, as interest in Dorner might have helped boost the audience for the address.\n\nThe speech's reception was mixed, with 53% of those surveyed in a CNN/ORC instant poll of speech-watchers saying they did not believe the address would lead to bipartisan cooperation, while 39% said they thought it would. The president's address highlighted the challenges he faces in working with a divided Congress and the need for bipartisan cooperation to address the nation's pressing issues.",

The United States, however, has decided not to participate in the initiative.\n\nAccording to the WHO, the collaboration aims to speed up the development of new tools to prevent, diagnose, and treat COVID-19. WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib announced the initiative during a United Nations briefing on Friday, stating that the collaboration is a political commitment to ensure that no one is left behind when these new tools become available.\n\nBritish Foreign Minister Dominic Raab and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres are also expected to take part in the announcement, according to diplomatic sources. Chaib emphasized the importance of equitable access to quality, efficient new tools for COVID-19, ensuring that those who can afford vaccines or therapeutics can make them available to the global population.\n\nThe US, however, will not participate in the initiative. A spokesperson for the US mission in Geneva confirmed that there will be no US official participation, expressing interest in learning more about the initiative.\n\nAs of now, more than 2.7 million people have been infected with the disease, with nearly 190,000 lives lost since the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, last year. Over 100 potential COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, including six already in clinical trials, according to Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of the GAVI vaccine alliance.\n\nBerkley emphasized the need for global leadership to identify and prioritize vaccine candidates, as well as the importance of ramping up global manufacturing capacity ahead of choosing a \"winner\" vaccine. He also highlighted concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines in older populations, who are most at risk from COVID-19.\n\nThe initiative comes as the WHO faces criticism from the US, with President Donald Trump announcing a suspension of funding and labeling the organization as slow to react to the outbreak and being \"China-centric.\" The WHO has refuted these claims, stating that the organization is working tirelessly to combat the pandemic and ensure equitable access to vaccines and treatments for all countries.",
    " Title: North Carolina Democratic Convention Faces Multiple Challenges Ahead of Presidential Nominating Event\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Democratic National Convention (DNC) approaches in Charlotte, North Carolina, the event is facing a series of challenges that threaten to overshadow President Barack Obama's coronation. The state Democratic Party is embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal, and several high-profile Democratic officials have announced they will not attend the convention.\n\nThe North Carolina Democratic Party's sex scandal began earlier this year when former party communications staffer Adriadn Ortega accused former executive director Jay Parmley of repeated sexual harassment and physical groping. Leaked documents revealed a financial settlement involving the two men, and Ortega was subsequently fired, while Parmley resigned. The party has been in a state of panic, with local candidate complaining that the scandal could \"doom\" the party, the Democratic candidates, and the party's credibility in the election.\n\nIn addition to the sex scandal, at least seven Democratic officials have announced they will not attend the convention. These officials include New York Democratic Reps. Bill Owens and Kathy Hochul, Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Mark Critz, three endangered Democratic politicians from West Virginia, and Utah Democratic Rep. Jim Matheson. The Democratic boycotters have criticized Obama on various issues, including his election-year illegal alien amnesty power grab, his failed jobs programs, and his destructive war on coal.\n\nThe DNC's left flank is also upset with the Obama campaign, as thousands of anarchists, socialists, and professional agitators plan to protest in Charlotte. The decision to deliver Obama's presidential nomination acceptance speech at Bank of America Stadium has also upset some progressives, as the bank received a taxpayer-funded bailout in 2008 and has been criticized for its role in the subprime mortgage crisis.\n\nThe DNC's fundraising has also been slow, and labor unions, which were expected to fill the financial gap, are angry that the convention will be in a city with no unionized hotels and in a state where compulsory union membership is prohibited as an employment condition.\n\nWith the sexual harassment scandal, the boycotts, and the protests, the DNC promises to be a public relations nightmare for Obama's optics geniuses. It remains to be seen how the party will handle these challenges and whether they will overshadow the presidential nominating event.",

However, his choice of location has sparked criticism from local representatives, who argue that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has had a detrimental impact on the state's residents.\n\nRep. Diane Black (R-TN), a former nurse, has expressed her disapproval of the president's visit, stating, \"Perhaps President Obama will explain why Obamacare customers in our state have been told to expect a 36 percent premium increase next year, despite the President\u2019s promise that his law would save families an average of $2,500 per year.\" She also pointed out the 28,000 Tennesseans who lost their insurance coverage in a single day, despite the president's pledge that \"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\"\n\nThe ACA's impact extends beyond premium increases and coverage losses. A nationwide CNN poll revealed that twice as many Americans were hurt by Obamacare than benefited from it. In Tennessee, state-sponsored insurance programs, which thousands of residents relied on, were effectively shut down due to the ACA.\n\nLetters are being sent out this week to explain the changes to people covered by AccessTN, a program for people with pre-existing medical conditions, and by CoverRX, a prescription benefits program. The 16,000 people enrolled in CoverTN, a limited benefits plan, have already been notified that it will end on December 31. Many families have also received notice that they will no longer be able to buy into CoverKids.\n\nRep. Black's office has emphasized that the president's speech cannot mend the hardships these families have endured. The ACA's trail of destruction continues, with the fight to fully repeal Obamacare ongoing among conservative representatives.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Budget Deal: A Compromise with Something for Everyone to Dislike\n\nThe bipartisan budget deal crafted by Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray has been met with mixed reactions, as reported by various news outlets. The Los Angeles Times describes the package as having \"something for everyone to dislike.\"\n\nThe deal, according to the Times, will not cut federal spending or reduce the national debt, which is a concern for conservative Republicans. On the other hand, it will not restore much funding for domestic programs or extend unemployment insurance, a point of contention for Democrats. The agreement, however, will prevent a government shutdown during the lawmakers' Christmas break.\n\nAs reported by NPR's Tamara Keith on Morning Edition, the deal denies both Republicans and Democrats their most desired outcomes. Republicans did not secure any changes to Medicare and Social Security, while Democrats did not secure any new taxes.\n\nTamara Keith summarized the agreement as follows: \"The deal...would set the federal budget at just about $1 trillion this year and next. It would replace a big chunk of the sequester cuts with other trims and increased fees. And that's pretty much it.\"\n\nIn other words, Murray and Ryan opted for a \"small\" deal instead of a \"grand bargain.\" If either side had emerged from the negotiations claiming victory, the plan's chances for passage by both the Republican-controlled House and Democratic-led Senate might have been jeopardized.\n\nAccording to The National Journal, Ryan may face the most immediate challenge in selling the deal to skeptical House conservatives. Ryan, who is known for his fiscal conservatism, seems to be up to the task of selling the deal, emphasizing its deficit reduction, lack of tax increases, and the beginning of addressing mandatory spending that has not been addressed by Congress for years.\n\nThe deal is reportedly on track to be voted on Thursday in the House.

    " Title: Former House Majority Leader Dick Armey Exits Conservative Group FreedomWorks Over Disagreements on Direction\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a move that signals growing discord within the conservative and Republican ranks, former Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey has left his position as chairman of the Washington-based Tea Party group, FreedomWorks, following a $8 million payout from a prominent GOP fundraiser, Richard J. Stephenson.\n\nAccording to a confidential contract obtained by The Associated Press, Armey agreed to resign from his role as chairman of FreedomWorks and its sister organization, the FreedomWorks Foundation, by the end of November. The contract, dated Sept. 24, stipulates that Armey's consulting fees will be paid in annual $400,000 installments by Stephenson, who is on the board of directors of FreedomWorks.\n\nArmey's departure comes amidst a new wave of acrimony in conservative and Republican circles as the party grapples with its November electoral losses and uncertainty over how to reposition its principles and issues to compete with a resurgent Democratic party.\n\nIn a statement to the AP, Armey confirmed his departure, stating, \"My differences with FreedomWorks are a matter of principle.\" Armey reportedly made the decision to quit FreedomWorks in August, but Stephenson and other board members urged him to stay until after the Nov. 6 election. Stephenson did not respond to AP's requests for comment.\n\nArmey declined to elaborate on his specific concerns, but he told the Mother Jones website that the Tea Party group was moving in an unproductive direction. He also expressed dissatisfaction with the November election results, in which several GOP candidates supported by FreedomWorks Super PAC donations were defeated by their Democratic counterparts.\n\nIn an internal resignation memo published by Mother Jones, Armey requested that FreedomWorks CEO Matt Kibbe remove his name, image, and signature from all group materials and web operations. Kibbe and other FreedomWorks officials were not immediately available for comment.\n\nArmey, who co-founded FreedomWorks in 2004, is a veteran Texas GOP political figure who was instrumental in the GOP's conservative \"Contract with America\" congressional movement in the 1990s. While Armey, 72, was the group's public face, FreedomWorks' most active official, Matt Kibbe, has been its most visible figure, appearing at FreedomWorks' public gatherings.\n\nFreedomWorks experienced a surge in influence after a wave of Tea Party candidates won House seats in 2010. However, despite spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to support favored GOP candidates in November, the group's influence seemed to wane at the polls. Among the GOP candidates supported by FreedomWorks in November and who lost were Senate candidates Josh Mandel in Ohio, Connie Mack in Florida, and Richard Mourdock in Indiana.\n\nWhile Tea Party-influenced House legislators fared better in the recent elections, their numbers dwindled. Of the 87 Republican House members who were allied with Tea Party anti-government spending causes, 83 ran for re-election in November, and all but eleven were re-elected. A twelfth, Rep. Jeff Landry (R-La.), faces an uphill runoff election this month against another GOP incumbent.\n\nFreedomWorks' internal secrecy and its role as a high-financed super political action committee became an issue in the weeks before the election when federal campaign finance documents revealed that a shadowy Tennessee-based corporation had funneled seven donations totaling $5.28 million to the Tea Party group. The amount was the largest political contribution to a super PAC in 2012 from a business group that refused to identify its donor.\n\nFreedomWorks refused to disclose the anonymous donor, and a Tennessee lawyer who helped set up the group also declined to reveal the head of the firm, Specialty Group Inc. The Tennessee firm later changed its name to Specialty Investments Group Inc. on Nov. 28.",
    " Title: \"FBI Deputy Director's Wife's Campaign Receives Funding from Clinton Ally's PAC, Stirring Controversy\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a political twist that has fueled fresh Republican complaints, a top Clinton ally's political organization donated nearly half a million dollars to the campaign of the wife of an FBI official who would later oversee the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices. The revelation, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, has added a new layer to the ongoing controversy surrounding the Clinton email probe.\n\nAt a Florida rally on Monday, Donald Trump seized the opportunity to criticize the situation, stating, \"We've never had a thing like this in the history of this country.\" Trump's comments come in the wake of the \"shocking\" findings reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAccording to the Journal, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's PAC donated $467,500 to Dr. Jill McCabe's 2015 state Senate campaign. The Virginia Democratic Party also contributed an additional $207,788 to the campaign. McCabe, who lost to Republican incumbent Dick Black, is married to Andrew McCabe, the FBI's deputy director.\n\nAt the time of the campaign and of McAuliffe's support, McCabe was an associate deputy director. He was later promoted to deputy after the campaign ended, assuming an oversight role in the Clinton email investigation.\n\nThe FBI's \"Ethics and Integrity Program\" manual makes clear that McCabe would have had to flag the connections to senior management, and the final decision would come in writing. The manual states that an exception would be made if the employee's participation would not create an appearance of a conflict of interest to affect the public perception of the integrity of the investigation or prosecution.\n\nThe FBI, in a statement, confirmed that McCabe sought internal guidance \"to prevent against any actual or potential conflict-of-interest\" and when his wife chose to run, \"McCabe and FBI lawyers implemented a system of recusal from all FBI investigative matters involving Virginia politics, a process followed for the remainder of her campaign.\" During the campaign, he played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind.\n\nHowever, a law enforcement official acknowledged an optics issue, given that while McCabe was barred from investigations into Virginia politics, the donation did come from the Virginia governor.\n\nMcAuliffe and other state figures reportedly recruited Dr. McCabe to run in the first place, but a spokesman pushed back on any suggestion of impropriety. McAuliffe \"supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors... Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous,\" the spokesman told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMcCabe continues to be involved in the email investigation aftermath. He was recently asked to brief House oversight committee members on allegations \u2013 contained in newly released FBI files \u2013 that a State Department official offered a \"quid pro quo\" with the bureau in a bid to un-classify a particular server email.\n\nThe revelations in The Wall Street Journal report could dovetail with Donald Trump's persistent claims that the Justice Department and FBI investigation into Clinton's email use was compromised. Trump has repeatedly complained about Attorney General Loretta Lynch meeting with Bill Clinton on a Phoenix tarmac days before the FBI announced no charges in its Clinton investigation.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that the funding looked like a \"down payment\" to influence the FBI probe. \"Given all we know about how the corrupt Clinton machine operates, it's hard not to see this as anything other than a down payment to influence the FBI's criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server,\" Priebus said.\n\nAccording to the same report, the PAC and Virginia Democratic Party money amounted to more than a third of Dr. McCabe's campaign funds. She also reportedly was the third-largest recipient of the governor's Common Good VA funds.",
    " Title: Congress Fails to Act on Sequestration as Finger-Pointing and Political Posturing Prevail\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the deadline for $85 billion in forced spending cuts looms, Congress returned from recess on Monday with little progress made to avoid the impending cuts. The GOP-controlled House and the Democratic-controlled Senate engaged in accusations and finger-pointing rather than taking action to change course.\n\nIn the House, a bill was introduced to rename a NASA flight research center at Southern California's Edwards Air Force Base after Neil Armstrong, the late astronaut who was the first man to step foot on the moon. Meanwhile, the Senate was scheduled to vote on the nomination of a new judge for the 10th Circuit.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) appeared on CNN's \"The Situation Room\" and stated that there was not enough time to work out a deal, and that the pressure from sequestration might be necessary to prompt Congress to address the country's debt.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner (R-OH) and other House GOP leaders met with reporters on Capitol Hill, blaming President Barack Obama for the unpopular cuts. Boehner argued that the president had proposed the cuts and was more interested in campaign rallies than in urging Senate Democrats to pass a plan.\n\nRep. Joe Wilson (R-SC) insisted on the House floor that the current forced spending cuts originated in the White House and stressed the potential impact on defense spending. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) warned that 70,000 children would be kicked out of the Head Start program if the planned governmentwide cuts were implemented.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) argued that many Republicans were praising the sequester as a viable path forward, while Democrats recognized it as a dangerous policy. Hoyer urged Republicans to either work with the Democrats or abandon the reckless policy.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, are expected to introduce their own bills for replacing the cuts early this week. It remains to be seen whether this will be more political posturing or the start of a bipartisan effort to give Obama more flexibility in implementing the cuts.",
    " Title: Hundreds Detained During Opposition Protest in Moscow Ahead of City Council Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, over 750 individuals were arrested during a demonstration in Moscow on Saturday, as per a Russian monitoring organization, OVD-Info. The protest, organized by opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, was held outside city hall, with protesters calling for fair elections following the exclusion of opposition candidates from the upcoming city council elections on Sept. 8.\n\nOVD-Info reported that 779 people were detained, a figure that surpassed the Moscow police's initial estimate of 295. The protest was led by Navalny, who was arrested on Wednesday and sentenced to 30 days in jail. Other opposition politicians, including Ilya Yashin, Dmitry Gudkov, and Ivan Zhdanov, were also detained during the demonstration.\n\nYashin, in a post on his Facebook page, stated that 10 masked officers had taken him from his apartment in Moscow the night before the demonstration. After his arrest, Navalny posted on Instagram, \"I have been detained and am now at a police station wearing shorts like a stupid man.\"\n\nMoscow police estimated the number of protesters at 3,500. The protest, which was reportedly unauthorized by the government, was initially set up near the mayor's office before being relocated by police towards the side streets. Protesters were seen clashing with police officers and shouting slogans such as \"Russia will be free!\" and \"Who are you beating?\"\n\nThe opposition politicians' names were not included on the ballot due to allegedly insufficient signatures, according to election officials. Supporters of the opposition party argue that the government is forcing them out, preventing their participation in the elections.\n\nIn a related development, helmeted police barged into Navalny's video studio during a YouTube broadcast of the protest and arrested program leader Vladimir Milonov. Police also searched Dozhd, an internet TV station covering the protest, and its editor in chief Alexandra Perepelova was ordered to undergo questioning at the Investigative Committee.\n\nThe exact charges the detainees may face remain unclear. The September vote for Moscow's city council, which has 45 seats, has become a significant political issue in Russia, with the Kremlin grappling with how to address opposing views in its capital of 12.6 million. The city council, responsible for a large municipal budget, is currently controlled by the pro-Kremlin United Russia party. All of its seats, which have a five-year term, are up for grabs in the Sept. 8 vote.\n\nOver 22,000 people gathered for a protest in downtown Moscow last Saturday, marking one of the largest demonstrations in recent years.",
    " Title: Senate Committee Endorses Hagel for Pentagon Post in Party-Line Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a closely contested vote, the Senate Armed Services Committee endorsed Chuck Hagel's nomination to lead the Pentagon on Tuesday, with a 14-11 vote that underscores the intense opposition from the Republican party. The vote, which was along party lines, advances Hagel to the floor for a final decision.\n\nAll Republicans present voted against Hagel, a former Nebraska senator and Vietnam War veteran. Supporters praised Hagel's military service and commended his openness throughout the confirmation process. However, critics pointed to Hagel's controversial votes and statements on issues such as Iran, Israel, terror groups, the Iraq war, and others.\n\nThe confirmation hearing was marked by a rocky performance by Hagel, which was widely criticized by Republican lawmakers. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., stated that Hagel's performance was the worst he had seen from any nominee for office. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., also expressed concerns about Hagel's views on various issues.\n\nRepublican lawmakers had various reasons for opposing Hagel or delaying his nomination. Some wanted more financial background information, while others were interested in holding up the nomination until the administration provides more information about the Benghazi terror attack.\n\nDemocratic Chairman Carl Levin, however, pushed for a vote just hours before President Obama was set to deliver his State of the Union address. \"The time has come for the committee to act on this nomination,\" Levin said.\n\nObama tapped Hagel, 66, to succeed Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who is stepping down after four years as CIA director and Pentagon chief. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is pressing for a full Senate vote later this week, most likely on Thursday.\n\nHagel now faces Republican delaying tactics in the full Senate, with the panel's top Republican, Sen. Jim Inhofe, insisting that any confirmation be based on 60 votes rather than a majority of the 100-member Senate. However, this effort has divided Republicans, with several longtime members opposed to the unprecedented step of stalling, or filibustering, a president's Cabinet nominee for Defense secretary.\n\nLate Monday, McCain met privately with several committee Republicans and urged them not to filibuster the Hagel nomination, pointing out that the roles could be reversed someday with a Republican president and Republican-controlled Senate. \"I'm encouraging my colleagues if they want to vote against Sen. Hagel that's one thing and that's a principled stand,\" McCain told a group of reporters. \"We do not want to filibuster. We have not filibustered a Cabinet appointee in the past and I believe that we should move forward with his nomination, bring it to the floor and vote up or down.\"\n\nAll 55 Democrats are expected to back Hagel, and two Republicans - Sens. Thad Cochran and Mike Johanns - have said they will vote for the nominee. At least five Republicans, including McCain, have said they oppose a filibuster despite their reservations or opposition toward the nominee. More than a dozen Republicans have said they will oppose their former colleague, and several others have indicated they are likely to vote no. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican member of the Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday she would vote against the nominee, citing his performance at his confirmation hearing.",
    " Title: Republican Party Elders Express Concern Over Conservative Lawmakers' Shutdown Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nA split among Republicans is becoming increasingly apparent as upstart conservative lawmakers push for a government shutdown to protest the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. This rift, playing out in town hall meetings across the country, has prompted concern from party elders, who view the strategy as a potential political liability.\n\nThe plan, primarily championed by lawmakers elected in recent years, is seen as a bargaining strategy rather than a serious proposal to shut down the federal government. However, it has exposed a divide within the GOP regarding the most effective way to address the controversial health care law, a year before the 2014 elections.\n\nSupporters of a government shutdown are not yet close to critical mass, despite 13 lawmakers signing a letter pledging opposition to any spending bill that does not defund the health law. To be successful, supporters would need almost every Republican in the Senate to join their effort.\n\nThe GOP establishment is firmly against a shutdown, with many becoming more vocal about their opposition. 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, for instance, recently stated at a New Hampshire fundraiser that a shutdown where Medicare benefits were skipped and troops did not get paid would not be well-received by the American public.\n\nSen. John McCain expressed similar sentiments on the conservative Michael Medved radio show last month, stating that most Americans are tired of Washington's political games.\n\nProminent conservative opinion maker, columnist Charles Krauthammer, called the idea \"nuts.\" Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, who has been known to be willing to disrupt government operations if he disagrees with something, told the Washington Examiner that a shutdown could cost Republicans control of the House. His Oklahoma colleague, Rep. Tom Cole, described a shutdown as a \"legislative temper tantrum.\"\n\nHowever, there is evidence that many in the outspoken party base would disagree. Tea party activists have criticized freshman North Carolina Rep. Rob Pittenger for his stance against a shutdown during a town hall event in his district this week. In an interview with CNN's Jim Acosta on Wednesday, Pittenger defended his decision to stand against tea party activists who called for a shutdown to defund Obamacare.\n\nPittenger appears to be an exception among younger lawmakers standing against shutdown proponents. In a bid to find a middle ground, a separate group of conservatives, including anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, have suggested using the threat of a shutdown to force a one-year delay in implementing the law instead of pursuing a full repeal.\n\nBacklash against Obamacare helped propel Republicans to take control of the House in 2010. However, exhaustive efforts since to repeal it have been ineffective. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, the leader of the shutdown effort, was elected in 2010 after defeating longtime Republican Sen. Bob Bennett in the primary.\n\nWhile Lee's proposal to shut down the government is not embraced by establishment Republicans, it has received praise from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, two conservative stars who are believed to be considering runs for president in 2016. Both, like Lee, defeated more establishment GOP candidates on their way to Washington in 2010.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has not taken a definitive position on the shutdown plan, is now facing a primary challenge in his bid for reelection in Kentucky.\n\nAdd to all of this the potential economic calamity that has resulted from a string of battles over the federal borrowing limit and government spending. These conservative newcomers to Washington have seen the White House make dire warnings about the negative effects of the recent forced spending cuts, known formally as sequestration, on the government and military.\n\nHowever, months later, the forced spending cuts have been largely swept out of the news, and the federal government\u2014from the Pentagon to the Health and Human Services Department\u2014has shown an ability to absorb it for now.\n\nCruz recently argued in a speech at the Heritage Foundation that shutting down the government would not be that bad and could help the GOP. \"There are some Democrats, some in the media, and some Republicans who portray a shutdown as a horrible calamity,\" Cruz said. \"I think the term'shutdown' is a misnomer. It's actually a partial, temporary shutdown. We have seen them before.\"\n\nCruz argued that weekends are kind of like government shutdowns. However, it is Mitt Romney, who has acknowledged that he is probably the last person Republicans are now looking to for advice, who gave the most earnest argument against shutting down the government.\n\n\"I badly want Obamacare to go away, and stripping it of funds has appeal. But we need to exercise great care about any talk of shutting down government,\" said Romney, according to a prepared text of his remarks at the private fundraiser. \"What would come next...what would come next when soldiers are not paid, when seniors fear for their Medicare and Social Security, and when the FBI is off duty? I'm afraid that in the final analysis, Obamacare would get its funding, our party would suffer in the next elections, and the people of the nation would not be happy.\"\n\nA spokesman for Cruz responded to Romney on Wednesday, arguing that Americans see Obamacare as \"a train wreck.\" \"They expect their elected representatives to fight to undo it,\" said Cruz spokesman Sean Ruston. \"If Republicans stand up for principle, we can win this debate.\"",

He discussed his 12-year tenure as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, often referred to as the second most important court in the country, and his five-year service in the White House for President George W. Bush.\n\nKavanaugh emphasized his long-standing commitment to advancing and promoting women, with a majority of his 48 law clerks being women, and his coaching of girls' basketball teams.\n\nKavanaugh reiterated his belief in the role of a judge as a neutral and impartial arbiter, stating that he does not make decisions to reach a preferred result but rather follows the law and the Constitution. He highlighted his record of ruling in various cases, including for prosecution, criminal defendants, workers, businesses, environmentalists, and coal miners.\n\nKavanaugh underscored the importance of an independent judiciary, emphasizing the Supreme Court's role as the last line of defense for the separation of powers and the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. He stressed that the Supreme Court should not be viewed as a partisan institution, but rather a team of nine justices committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n\nDuring the confirmation process, Kavanaugh met with 65 senators, participated in over 30 hours of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and submitted written answers to nearly 1,300 additional questions. He was subjected to allegations that he found wrongful and sometimes vicious, which affected his family and led to vile and violent threats against his wife and daughters.\n\nLast Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before the Judiciary Committee to defend his family, his good name, and his lifetime of public service. His testimony was forceful and passionate, reflecting his frustration at being wrongly accused without corroboration of horrible conduct contrary to his record and character.\n\nKavanaugh expressed his deep distress at the unfairness of how these allegations have been handled. He acknowledged that his testimony, at times, reflected his overwhelming frustration and emotional state. He emphasized that he testified as a son, husband, and father, with his family foremost in his mind.\n\nKavanaugh pledged to continue being the same kind of judge and person he has been for his entire 28-year legal career: hardworking, even-keeled, open-minded, independent, and dedicated to the Constitution and the public good. He assured that he would treat colleagues and litigants with the utmost respect, and would continue to contribute to the country as a coach, volunteer, and teacher.\n\nKavanaugh concluded by reaffirming his reverence for the Constitution, his belief in an independent and impartial judiciary, and his commitment to preserving the Constitution of the United States and the American rule of law if confirmed by the Senate to serve on the Supreme Court.",
    " Title: U.S. Fails to Kill Iranian Commander in Yemen, Days After Soleimani Strike\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a development that has added a new layer to the ongoing tensions between the United States and Iran, U.S. military officials have reportedly admitted to a failed attempt to kill a separate senior Iranian commander in Yemen on the same night the Pentagon carried out the successful airstrike that took out Iranian Quds force commander Qassem Soleimani in Iraq.\n\nAccording to U.S. military officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, a military strike targeting Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Abdul Reza Shahlai was unsuccessful. Shahlai, a key figure in financing the activities of the Iranian military force, was reportedly the target of the operation.\n\nThe State Department has described Mr. Shahlai as an individual with a long history of targeting Americans and U.S. allies globally. He is said to have planned multiple assassinations of coalition forces in Iraq and his activities included providing weapons and explosives to Shia militia groups and directing a plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington eight years ago.\n\nThe announcement comes as the Trump administration is vigorously defending the military necessity of the strike in the face of skepticism from Democrats and even some Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post, Pentagon spokesperson Navy Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich, who declined to discuss the operation or confirm the failed strike, said, \"We have seen the report of a January 2 airstrike in Yemen, which is long understood as a safe space for terrorists and other adversaries to the United States.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper, in a tweet on Friday afternoon, avoided explicitly addressing reports of the failed strike but said, \"I want the American people to rest assured knowing they have the best military in the world.

    " Title: Trump Faces Opposition in First UN Security Council Session as Tensions with Iran Escalate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his first session as the presiding member of the United Nations Security Council, President Donald Trump is expected to face determined opposition from his fellow leaders over his Iran policy. The session, which will be primarily focused on counter-proliferation, including North Korea, is set to take place today.\n\nDonald Trump will chair the meeting due to the US currently holding the rotating presidency of the security council. The original plan was to devote the session to Iran, allowing Trump to highlight Iran's role in the Syrian and Yemeni conflict, its missile developments, and the full range of what Washington calls Tehran's malign activities. However, the administration has broadened the subject to counter-proliferation to avoid highlighting the transatlantic rifts over the Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew in May.\n\nThe US's allies, including the UK's Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the French President, Emmanuel Macron, side with Russia and China in their opposition to Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. They are uneasy about US saber-rattling towards Tehran.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, in his address to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, presented himself as an alternative leader of the western world, flatly rejecting Trump's appeal for national \"patriotism\" to take precedence over multilateral action.\n\n\"Nationalism always leads to defeat,\" Macron said. \"If courage is lacking in the defense of fundamental principles, international order becomes fragile and this can lead, as we have already seen twice, to global war. We saw that with our very own eyes.\"\n\nWhile Trump's address was met with a mix of giggles, murmurs, long periods of silence, and polite applause at the end, Macron's speech was given a rapturous reception.\n\nThe Trump administration has set out its campaign against Iran at the UN General Assembly, producing a special booklet, Outlaw Regime, chronicling Iran's \"destructive activities.\" The administration sent several senior officials to a conference organized by anti-Tehran activists, United Against a Nuclear Iran (UANI), to denounce the Iranian government.\n\nNational Security Advisor John Bolton issued a series of threats, stating that Iran would \"have 'hell to pay' if it does not change its behavior.\" He singled out the commander of the external arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Qassem Soleimani, who has led the Iranian military campaign in Syria in support of the Assad regime, and IRGC operations in Iraq.\n\n\"We will use every tool available to pursue Soleimani and others like him,\" Bolton said. \"Iran's leadership will no longer enjoy a life of security and luxury while their people suffer and starve.\"\n\nBolton stressed that the campaign against Soleimani would focus on funding and arms supplies. However, when asked for clarification, the US envoy on Iran and the head of the state department Iran Action Group, Brian Hook, did not rule out military action.\n\nIn his own remarks to the UANI conference, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that an Iranian-backed militia was responsible for rocket attacks against the US embassy compound in Baghdad and the US consulate in Basra, in southern Iraq. He warned that the US would respond directly against Iran in the event of another such attack from Iran, or a militia deemed to be an Iranian proxy.\n\n\"The United States will hold the regime in Tehran accountable for any attack that results in injury to our personnel or damage to our facilities,\" Pompeo said. \"America will respond swiftly and decisively in defense of American lives, and we will respond against the source of the attack on American interests.\"\n\nThe National Iranian American Council condemned the administration's rhetoric, noting Bolton's role in the buildup to the ill-fated Iraq invasion in 2003.\n\n\"No serious person believes that Bolton and this administration is working towards a diplomatic end with Iran,\" the NIAC statement said. \"He earned his credentials in the Bush White House as an Iraq war architect, he made his intentions for war with Iran well-known as a private citizen, and he is now putting that plan into action.\"",
    " Title: FBI Assists Lebanon in Investigation of High-Profile Assassination, Tensions Rise Across Nation\n\nArticle:\n\nAn FBI team is en route to Lebanon to assist in the investigation of the assassination of Brigadier General Wissam al-Hassan, a top Lebanese intelligence official, who was killed in a car bombing last week. The assassination has triggered sporadic clashes across Lebanon, raising concerns about the country's stability and the potential for further violence.\n\nAccording to a Lebanese lawmaker, Ahmad Fatfat, al-Hassan was on his way to discuss a recent threat allegedly linked to Syria when he was assassinated last Friday. The car bomb killed al-Hassan, a bodyguard, and a bystander, 30 minutes before he was to meet with Fatfat to discuss a threatening text message sent to the lawmaker from a Syrian phone number. Similar threats had been sent via text message to three other lawmakers, including Fatfat, although they did not realize it until after al-Hassan's assassination. All four are members of Lebanon's Future Movement, the largest member of the vocally anti-Syrian March 14 political coalition led by Saad Hariri.\n\nAfter al-Hassan's assassination, Fatfat said he and his colleagues received another text from a similar phone number threatening further killings. \"Congratulations, the countdown has started,\" the text read. \"One of ten.\"\n\nAl-Hassan was a respected figure among many fellow Sunni Muslims for his leadership and efforts in rooting out those responsible for targeted killings in Lebanon. However, he also angered others, especially those backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and many affiliated with Hezbollah, the Shiite militant and political movement that has a prominent role in Lebanon's government. The U.S. government labels it a terrorist organization.\n\nSince al-Hassan's assassination, sporadic fighting has erupted across Lebanon, threatening to plunge the country into chaos and raising fears that it could be drawn into the bloody 19-month-old civil war in neighboring Syria. After al-Hassan's funeral on Sunday, angry protesters clashed with security forces and rushed toward the prime minister's office, calling for his dismissal.\n\nBy midday on Monday, at least three people had been killed in the northern city of Tripoli, while another person was killed in the southern city of Sidon, and another killed in Beirut, Lebanon's official National News Agency reported. More than two dozen people were injured nationwide.\n\nAmid the unrest, the youth wing of the March 14 coalition called for a peaceful rally in Beirut's Martyrs' Square on Monday evening. The March 14 movement is an anti-Syrian coalition that emerged after the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. His son, Saad, leads the coalition.\n\nSyria has condemned the attack but has not stopped accusations it is behind Friday's killing, which marked the country's highest-profile assassination in more than seven years. The United States has also condemned the attack and vowed to assist in investigating the bombing. The U.S. State Department spokesman, Mark Toner, announced on Monday that an FBI team will be sent to Lebanon to assist in the investigation into al-Hassan's death.",

Nearly 100 union members participated in the rally, holding signs that read \"Delta: one job should be enough.\"\n\nEight protesters, including Tlaib, were arrested by airport officers for refusing to move. Tlaib, however, was not arrested, according to union officials.\n\nIn a statement, Tlaib expressed her solidarity with the workers, stating, \"The airline catering workers are desperate for a better quality of life and put their bodies on the line in their fight against the exorbitant corporate greed by the airlines, denying them of their right to a living wage and good healthcare.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Working people in the kitchens at DTW and airports across the U.S. have been hurting for too long, but today we are saying no more. Today, we are calling on Delta Air Lines to say that if it wants to really prove that it cares about the working families more than it does its bottom line, than it will commit to ending poverty in the airline catering industry so one job is enough for all airline workers.\"\n\nThe protest took place on the same day that Delta Air Lines distributed $1.6 billion in profit-sharing to its employees. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\nProtests also occurred in other key Delta hubs in Minneapolis and Seattle, as well as in United and American hubs in Boston, Charlotte, Dallas, Honolulu, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco.\n\nNia Winston, President of Unite Here Local 24 and one of those arrested at Metro Airport, emphasized the contributions of the airline catering industry workers to the success of Detroit Metropolitan Airport, but noted that they cannot afford basic necessities such as healthcare for their children.\n\n\"Until airlines like Delta recognize all the workers whose labor contributes to its record-profits, until airline catering workers get what they deserve in a fair contract, we will keep coming out at the airport and anywhere else Delta will hear us,\" Winston said.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Agreement Reached on Sanctions Bill Targeting Russia, Iran, and North Korea\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - A bipartisan agreement has been reached on legislation that imposes new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea, according to congressional Democrats. The Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act, which was passed by the Senate a month ago, was held up in the House of Representatives due to the inclusion of North Korea sanctions.\n\nThe House is set to vote on Tuesday on a package of bills covering sanctions for the three countries. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's office announced that the measure aims to \"hold them accountable for their dangerous actions.\"\n\nUnder the proposed bill, President Donald Trump must submit to Congress a report on proposed actions that would \"significantly alter\" U.S. foreign policy in connection with Russia, including easing sanctions or returning diplomatic properties in Maryland and New York that former President Barack Obama ordered vacated in December. Congress would have at least 30 days to hold hearings and then vote to uphold or reject Trump's proposed changes.\n\nThe bill is intended to punish Russia for its 2014 annexation of Crimea, a peninsula belonging to Ukraine, and for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Russia's \"outrageous and unacceptable\" behavior in the 2016 U.S. election and in Europe \"demand that we have strong statutory sanctions enacted as soon as possible,\" said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nHowever, Pelosi expressed concerns that the inclusion of North Korea could lead to procedural delays in the Senate. Senior Republican lawmakers did not immediately comment on the latest bill.\n\nIn Brussels, the European Union sounded an alarm about the U.S. moves to step up sanctions on Russia, urging Washington to coordinate with its Group of 7 partners. The European Commission, the EU's executive body, warned of possibly \"wide and indiscriminate\" \"unintended consequences,\" notably on the EU's efforts to diversify energy sources away from Russia.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a strong sanctions bill \"is essential,\" and he expects \"the House and Senate will act on this legislation promptly, on a broad bipartisan basis.\" Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the agreement was reached after \"intense negotiations.\"\n\n\"A nearly united Congress is poised to send President Putin a clear message on behalf of the American people and our allies,\" Cardin said in a statement. \"We need President Trump to help us deliver that message.\"",
    " Title: Hong Kong Protests Escalate as Pro-Democracy Activists Clash with Police in 24th Weekend of Unrest\n\nArticle:\n\nHONG KONG - Police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse protesters who blocked roads and vandalized shopping malls across Hong Kong's New Territories and Kowloon peninsula on Sunday, marking the 24th consecutive weekend of anti-government demonstrations.\n\nThe unrest began in the central new town of Sha Tin, where pro-democracy protesters vandalized a train station and a restaurant perceived as pro-Beijing. Violence also erupted in Tuen Mun outside the \"V city\" mall, with clashes between riot police and protesters.\n\nIn Tsuen Wan, a reporter from Now TV was hit by a tear gas canister, and the rail station in Sha Tin was closed due to scuffles between police and protesters, both young and old. Shopping districts across the harbor on the main island remained quiet.\n\nProtesters also caused damage at Festival Walk in Kowloon Tong and \"stormed\" stores in Tsuen Wan, according to police. The violence spread to the Kowloon district of Mong Kok, where police used water cannon and tear gas to clear Nathan Road, one of the world's most densely populated areas.\n\nProtesters are demanding an end to perceived police brutality and Chinese interference in Hong Kong's freedoms, guaranteed by the \"one country, two systems\" formula since the territory returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies interfering and has blamed Western countries for stirring up trouble.\n\nThousands gathered at a Saturday night vigil for a student who died after falling from a car park during a protest. The student, Chow Tsz-lok, was 22 years old. Thousands also mourned Chow in Chater Garden, Central on Hong Kong island, with many calling for justice.\n\nSeven pro-democracy city lawmakers have been detained or face arrest and are due to appear in court on Monday on charges of obstructing a May meeting of the local assembly. Protesters have called for a general strike on Monday and an independent inquiry into police tactics, which has been refused by the Hong Kong government.\n\nA five-member international panel has suggested a shortfall in the Independent Police Complaints Council's \"independent investigative capability\" to look into policing during the protests. The colony of Hong Kong island and the Kowloon peninsula, acquired after the \"opium wars\" with China, was expanded to include the New Territories on a 99-year lease in 1898. The lease expired in 1997, and Britain returned all the land to China.",
    " Title: Assessing the Tillerson Nomination: A New Approach to U.S.-Russia Relations or a Departure from Republican Orthodoxy?\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the confirmation hearings for Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of State, approach, the question on many minds is whether his ties to Russia will be a stumbling block or a stepping stone in the Senate. Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, has been a friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, earning the Order of Friendship, Moscow's highest accolade for foreigners.\n\nSeveral Republican senators have expressed concerns about Tillerson's ties to Russia, with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio stating that being a \"Friend of Vladimir\" is not a qualification for a Cabinet position. Arizona Sen. John McCain went further, referring to Putin as a \"murderer, a thug, and a KGB agent,\" implying that Tillerson may have similar associations. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham also voiced doubts, suggesting there might be enough Republican defections to block the nomination on the Senate floor.\n\nThe Tillerson pick has sparked controversy, with some viewing it as a departure from Republican orthodoxy. The party that nominated Trump has historically been wary of his defense of Putin and his divergence from the party's longstanding commitment to NATO. In contrast, Tillerson's corporate background and deal-making skills may appeal to those who support Trump for his unconventional approach to diplomacy.\n\nEnvironmental groups and government watchdogs have criticized Tillerson for his ties to the fossil fuel industry and potential conflicts of interest. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders called the nomination \"very troubling\" due to Tillerson's perceived disregard for climate change and the future of the planet. The Environmental Defense Fund stated that Trump is prioritizing the oil-and-gas industry's interests over Americans' health.\n\nDespite the criticism, Tillerson's nomination may be a reflection of Trump's desire to break the mold of traditional diplomats and politicians who typically lead the State Department. Tillerson's lack of government experience is not disqualifying in the Trump administration, as both he and the president are corporate businessmen with global interests.\n\nTillerson's confirmation hearings will likely feature discussions about his stance on U.S.-Russia relations, particularly regarding the sanctions imposed on Russia after the annexation of Crimea. Tillerson has opposed these sanctions, which blocked his company's plans to drill below the Arctic Sea with Moscow's blessing.\n\nIn a Trumpian world, Tillerson's nomination makes sense, as he represents a departure from the traditional diplomat or politician. Whether Tillerson will serve as a heat shield or a hotspur in Trump's negotiations remains to be seen. One thing is certain: Tillerson's nomination is a reminder that elections have consequences, and Trump is choosing a team that reflects his vision for America's place in the world.",
    " Title: Christian Students Seek Supreme Court Review in Free Speech Rights Case on College Campus\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo students, Chike Uzuegbunam and Joseph Bradford, have petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review a lawsuit against Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC), alleging that the college's speech zone and speech code policies violated their First Amendment rights. The students, represented by the religious rights law firm Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), claim that these policies restricted their freedom of speech and freedom to exercise their religious beliefs.\n\nIn 2016, Uzuegbunam attempted to distribute religious literature on the GGC campus, but was told to stop by a campus security officer. The college's speech zone policy, which made up only 0.0015 percent of the campus, required students to reserve one of the two zones available to exercise their free speech. In response, Uzuegbunam reserved and was granted one of the speech zones to distribute religious literature for three separate dates. However, on one of those days, Uzuegbunam was ordered to stop due to complaints about his faith-sharing efforts. Bradford, who shared the same religious views as Uzuegbunam, self-censored after witnessing Uzuegbunam's treatment.\n\nADF filed a lawsuit against GGC officials, but the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia dismissed the case, which was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. During the time the case was in the district court, GGC amended its speech zone policy and eliminated its speech code, but did not provide any relief for the students. The new policies allow students to engage in expressive activity in open outdoor areas on campus without a permit, unless the group is over 30 people.\n\nThe lower courts found that the lawsuit became moot when Uzuegbunam graduated from GGC and after the college changed its speech zone policy and code. However, ADF attorneys argue in the petition filed on Jan. 31 that the case is still alive, citing opinions from other circuit courts. They argue that the 11th circuit is the only federal appellate court that does not hold officials accountable for violating constitutional rights when they change the policies during the litigation.\n\n\"[T]he Eleventh Circuit's outlier view allows these institutions to violate constitutional rights with impunity\u2014avoiding judicial review through a well-timed policy shift,\" the petition states. \"This rule sends a clear message to students when school officials trample their freedoms: 'Don't bother retaining counsel; we know how to game the legal system.' And it signals that colleges can keep censoring students without consequence...This Court should intervene and declare that federal courts remain open to everyone when colleges violate students' constitutional rights.\"\n\nADF Senior Counsel Tyson Langhofer, director of the ADF Center for Academic Freedom, said in a statement that he hopes the top court will weigh-in to \"make sure that this denial of justice doesn't occur to anyone else.\"\n\n\"We need to ensure that the wrong done to our clients is righted\u2014something that both the district court and the 11th Circuit failed to do,\" Langhofer said.\n\nThe case came under the spotlight in 2017 after the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a Statement of Interest supporting the two students. At the time, the DOJ argued that the students had adequately provided enough evidence to allege a violation of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights and that GGC's speech policies were not \"content-neutral,\" established an impermissible heckler's veto, and were not narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.\n\n\"A national recommitment to free speech on campus and to ensuring First Amendment rights is long overdue. Which is why, starting today, the Department of Justice will do its part in this struggle. We will enforce federal law, defend free speech, and protect students' free expression,\" former Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at the time.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Pursues \"Politically Binding\" Climate Change Agreement, By-passing Senate Ratification\n\nThe New York Times has reported that President Barack Obama's administration is planning to forge an international climate change agreement without Senate ratification, bypassing the U.S. Constitution's requirement for a treaty to be approved by the Senate. The agreement is expected to be signed at a United Nations meeting in Paris next year.\n\nThe administration's negotiators are reportedly working towards an alternative agreement, a \"politically binding\" deal that would serve as a substitute for a bona-fide treaty. This move is a response to the administration's dim chances of securing the constitutionally mandated two-thirds majority in the Senate to ratify a new international treaty.\n\nThe development has been met with criticism from lawmakers, with Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) stating, \"Once again, the president is trying to go around Congress and ignore Americans who cannot afford more expensive, extreme energy regulations.\"\n\nState Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki downplayed the reported developments, stating that \"Not a word of the new climate agreement currently under discussion has been written.\" She added, \"Our goal is to negotiate a successful and effective global climate agreement that can help address this pressing challenge. Anything that is eventually negotiated and that should go to the Senate will go to the Senate. We will continue to consult with Congress on this important issue.\"\n\nThe Times reported that while the agreement would not have the full force of a treaty, it would \"name and shame\" countries into cutting fossil fuel emissions. The proposal is described as a hybrid, combining the legally binding conditions from an existing 1992 treaty with \"new voluntary pledges.\"\n\nUnder the terms, co-signers would have to enact climate change policies but would be on the honor system for cutting to specific emissions levels and sending money to poor countries. House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) stated, \"International agreements require congressional approval as an 'important safeguard.'\"\n\nSen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) reiterated that the Senate would not ratify a treaty, stating, \"This is another example of a president who is willing to ignore the rule of law to get what he wants.\" He added, \"We will continue to fight the president's economy-crushing domestic greenhouse gas regulations. U.S. economic competitiveness is hanging in the balance, and additional U.S. restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions will only hurt the United States as other nations like Australia either scrap or water down their unsuccessful green dream policies.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Expresses Doubt on DACA, Calls for Merit-Based Immigration System\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, President Donald Trump expressed doubt over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, placing the blame on Democrats for its potential demise.\n\n\"DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don\u2019t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military,\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe program, which protects immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children, has been a contentious issue since Trump announced last year that he would rescind it, giving Congress six months to craft a legislative fix. However, lawmakers have yet to reach a deal with the White House, with the president insisting that a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border \"must be part of any DACA approval.\"\n\nIn a separate tweet, Trump also expressed a preference for a merit-based immigration system, stating, \"I, as President, want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again, people coming in through a system based on MERIT. No more Lotteries!\"\n\nThis statement comes after a heated controversy over a report that Trump during a White House meeting with lawmakers last week referred to immigrants from African nations, El Salvador, and Haiti as coming from \"shithole countries.\"\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced on Saturday that it would begin taking new requests for immigrants seeking protections under the Obama-era program following a preliminary injunction last week that blocked Trump's decision to end DACA.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
    " Title: Unity and Solidarity: Parisians and World Leaders March in Show of Strength After Terror Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a powerful display of unity, solidarity, and defiance, hundreds of thousands of Parisians marched through the streets on Sunday, following last week's devastating terrorist attacks. The demonstration, which attracted \"more than 40 world leaders,\" according to the BBC, was a poignant testament to the resilience of the French people and their commitment to freedom and national pride.\n\nNotable attendees included British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas. U.S. President Barack Obama was represented by Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nThe march was characterized by themes of freedom and French national pride. Marchers chanted \"liberte\" (freedom) and \"Charlie\" in reference to Charlie Hebdo magazine. Some waved French flags, cheered, and sang the national anthem. A group of demonstrators carried a large model pencil with the words \"not afraid\" written on the side.\n\nThe slogan \"Je suis Charlie\" (I am Charlie) was ubiquitous, appearing on homemade placards, armbands, and T-shirts. Flags were also prevalent, with full-sized French tricolors carried by demonstrators and the colors of the Republic on display at the Republic monument.\n\nFrench law enforcement officers have been advised to erase their social media presence and to carry their weapons at all times due to the activation of terror sleeper cells over the past 24 hours in the country, according to a French police source who attended a briefing Saturday. Amedy Coulibaly, a suspect killed during a deadly kosher market hostage siege, had reportedly made several phone calls about targeting police officers in France, the source said.\n\nIn a separate incident, several stones and an incendiary device were thrown through the window of the archive of the regional tabloid daily, the Hamburger Morgenpost, early on Sunday morning. The paper had splashed three Charlie Hebdo cartoons on its front page after the Paris massacre, running the headline \u201cThis much freedom must be possible!\u201d No one was hurt in the attack in the northern port city, and two people were detained.\n\nCorresponding events were held throughout France and all over the world. However, the specter of violence remains, with British intelligence issuing a chilling admonition on Friday and French authorities warning that new terror cells have been \"activated\" after the Charlie Hebdo massacre.\n\nIn addition, a branch of Al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the deadly raid, with both jihadist brothers believed to have received training in Yemen. Their associate who took hostages and shed blood at a Kosher supermarket reportedly recorded a martyrdom video pledging his allegiance to Al Qaeda and ISIS.\n\nMeanwhile, in Germany, Charlie Hebdo's offices were firebombed in 2011 in a precursor to last week's horror. Amid rising antisemitic violence in France and across Europe, many Jews are choosing to leave. A survey last year from the European Jewish Congress and Tel Aviv University found that France had more violent anti-Semitic incidents in 2013 than any other country in the world. Jews were the target of 40% of all racist crimes in France in 2013 \u2013 even though they comprise less than 1% of the population. Attacks on Jews have risen sevenfold since the 1990s.\n\nIn conclusion, the march in Paris was a powerful display of unity and solidarity in the face of terrorism. The specter of violence remains, with rising antisemitic incidents and the activation of new terror cells. The world stands shoulder-to-shoulder in spirit against terrorism, but the challenges are far from over.",
    " Title: A Change of Heart: A Journalist's Reflection on the Second Amendment and Gun Safety\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the past, I held a different perspective on gun safety reform, viewing it as an overblown issue. However, the tragic events that have transpired in recent years, particularly the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, have led me to reconsider my stance.\n\nBefore the Sandy Hook tragedy, I believed that a few sensible gun laws could prevent such incidents from occurring. After the shooting, I realized that an outdated ideology needed to be laid to rest so a more compassionate one could take its place.\n\nThe Second Amendment, which states, \"A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed,\" was once a point of contention I found reasonable. However, in light of the increasing number of gun-related deaths in America each year, I now question whether this amendment promotes our life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness, or if it threatens them.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the importance of a well-regulated militia for the security of a free state, I believe that role is now fulfilled by our military, a professional and disciplined force drawn from our families and friends, whom we have no reason to fear. We no longer need Minutemen. The threat of foreign invasion is not imminent, and we are not under alien attack, as portrayed in movies like \"Independence Day.\"\n\nThe NRA, with its fervent defense of gun rights, reminds me of the Scopes monkey trial defenders, fighting to preserve a worldview that is no longer tenable. Their theatrics, such as parading through stores with rifles slung over their shoulders, are a desperate attempt to justify their beliefs. I have never felt threatened in a Home Depot or Target, and I question the necessity of such displays.\n\nThe increase in gun sales and the decline of the white majority in America has led to speculation about the motives behind the gun culture. As social scientists predicted a white minority in America by 2043, we began to hear talk of \"taking back our country.\" Gun shops have proliferated in white enclaves, and it is not unreasonable to wonder if the fervor for weaponry has been fueled by the same dismal racism that has driven other social ills.\n\nIn conclusion, it is time for America to grow up, to become adults, so that children like Noah Pozner have a fighting chance to do the same. We cannot let the most fearful among us set our nation's tone, lest we descend to a state we have worked centuries to rise above. It is time for America to address the fear and ignorance that feed our gun culture, for no nation can ascend until it cures the virus of violence.",
    " Title: Vatican Rejects Concept of Self-Chosen Gender, Emphasizes Biological Complementarity in New Document\n\nThe Vatican has issued a document rejecting the idea that individuals can choose their gender, marking the first official statement on gender theory from the Catholic Church. Titled \"Male and Female He Created Them,\" the document, published during LGBTQ Pride Month, advocates for a \"path of dialogue\" and listening on the issue of gender theory in education.\n\nThe document, intended to guide Catholic teachers, parents, students, and clergy in addressing the \"educational crisis\" in sexuality education, appears to rely solely on previous papal pronouncements, Vatican documents, and philosophers and theologians.\n\nThe Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest known for his work on improving the Catholic Church's outreach to the LGBT community, criticized the document for lacking real-life experiences of LGBT individuals. \"We should welcome the congregation's call to dialogue and listening on gender,\" Martin said, \"and I hope that conversation will now begin.\"\n\nLGBT Catholics have denounced the formal document, labeling it harmful and contributing to hatred, bigotry, and violence against gay and transgender people. Pope Francis, who has previously argued against self-chosen gender, is credited with first articulating the Vatican's position in a 2012 speech.\n\nThe document calls for a new alliance among families, schools, and society to provide a \"positive and prudent sexual education\" in Catholic schools, ensuring that children learn the \"full original truth of masculinity and femininity.\" It characterizes gender fluidity as a symptom of the \"confused concept of freedom\" and \"momentary desires\" that define post-modern culture.\n\nThe document also rejects terms such as \"intersex\" and \"transgender\" and argues that the purpose of the biological \"complementarity\" of male and female sex organs is to ensure procreation.",
    " Title: Baltimore Courts Immigrants to Revitalize City Population and Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn September, hundreds of people gathered at Baltimore's harbor to be sworn in as U.S. citizens. The city, once a major port and destination for immigrants, is now moving ahead with its own agenda to revitalize its shrinking population. Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake aims to bring in 10,000 new families over the next decade, focusing on immigrants, a group that has helped other large cities grow.\n\nBaltimore, which peaked in population in the 1950s, has since experienced decades of decline, with its population falling to just half of what it was in the 1960s. The city's administration is trying to make all immigrants feel safe and welcome, with initiatives such as prohibiting police and city officials from asking residents about their immigration status.\n\nZakaria al-Sagheer, an Iraqi immigrant who moved to Baltimore County with his family in September, is one of the newcomers. He is currently learning the ropes of life in the U.S. through a small discussion group at Baltimore's International Rescue Committee. Al-Sagheer was convinced to settle just outside of Baltimore by his relatives, who spoke highly of the city's population and treatment of new immigrants.\n\nBaltimore is spending money on training programs like the one Al-Sagheer is attending, as well as offering Spanish-language nutrition and exercise classes, and Spanish story time at the library. The city has even begun cultural training for the police. Catalina Rodriguez, Baltimore's Hispanic Community Liaison, is responsible for ensuring these programs run smoothly.\n\nPhiladelphia, another Northeast city that also tried to fight population decline by recruiting immigrants, experienced similar growth in the 2010s, with the bulk of the newcomers being Asian and Hispanic immigrants. Amanda Bergson-Shilcock, who has worked for nearly a decade at The Welcoming Center for New Pennsylvanians, notes that without the growth in the city's immigrant population, Philadelphia would have continued to experience population losses.\n\nHowever, Steven Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies is skeptical that Baltimore, or any city, can grow its immigrant population simply by ignoring immigration status or offering services. He argues that immigrants go where there are jobs and that even if cities like Baltimore, which has a stubbornly high unemployment rate, could attract immigrants, it would not mean much for the local economy.\n\nDavid Kallick, director of Immigration Research at the Fiscal Policy Institute, disagrees with Camarota, arguing that attracting new immigrant residents does help a city, whether they make a million dollars a year or $30,000. Kallick notes that having empty buildings is expensive to a city, and that new residents will pay property taxes.\n\nIn the short-term, Baltimore's open-door policy is likely not going to fill city coffers, as there is a cost to providing new immigrants services like language classes and health care. For Baltimore to be successful, Kallick says, it's going to have to do more than roll out a nice welcome mat to newcomers; it's going to have to invest long-term.",
    " Title: U.S. State Department Official's Request for Additional Security in Benghazi Ignored Before Deadly Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, the State Department's top security official in Libya, Eric Nordstrom, had requested additional security for the consulate but received no response from superiors, according to documents obtained by CNN. The revelation comes ahead of a congressional hearing on Wednesday regarding the September 11, 2012, attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.\n\nU.S. intelligence believes the incident was a terrorist act. The Republican-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will hold the first hearing on the attack.\n\nNordstrom, who served as the regional security officer in Libya until July 2012, had expressed concerns about the Libyan government's overall ability to protect American diplomatic facilities. In March and July of 2012, he sent two cables to State Department headquarters requesting additional security agents for the Benghazi post, but did not receive any response, according to a summary of his interview with House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Democrats obtained by CNN.\n\nNordstrom told the committee that Deputy Assistant Secretary Charlene Lamb wanted to keep the number of U.S. security personnel in Benghazi \"artificially low.\" He said Lamb generally believed that extra security was unnecessary because there was a residential safe haven to fall back on in an emergency. Lamb reportedly thought the \"best course of action\" was to assign three agents to the Benghazi post, while the facility usually had three or four agents.\n\nHowever, Undersecretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy issued a memo last December requiring five agents be assigned to Benghazi. Senior State Department officials have said security personnel in Benghazi were outmanned and outgunned during the attack and that no reasonable security presence could have successfully fended it off.\n\nThe Oversight Committee hearing has been criticized by Democrats as election-year political grandstanding rather than a serious effort to find answers about the attack. Nordstrom, Lamb, Kennedy, and Army Lt. Col Andrew Wood, commander of a security support team in Tripoli, are expected to testify at the hearing.\n\nNordstrom also described in an email a list of specific security incidents that occurred in Libya from June 2011 to June 2012. The email and the list of incidents provided to CNN by the Oversight Committee outline examples of common conflict zone incidents, such as carjackings and grenade attacks, to more serious cases that include assassinations and an attack on the motorcade of the British ambassador.\n\nThe document describes a general increase in crime in Tripoli, the large numbers of armed civilians, clashes between rival militias, widespread unemployment, random violence, and revenge killings. One incident refers to a June 6, 2012, bomb attack on the consulate in Benghazi and notes that an al-Qaeda-affiliated group had claimed credit. The list concludes that \"the risk of U.S. mission personnel, private U.S. citizens, and businesspersons encountering an isolating event as a result of militia or political violence is 'HIGH.' The government of Libya does not yet have the ability to effectively respond to and manage the rising criminal and militia-related violence, which could result in an isolating event.\"\n\nDemocratic staff allege that Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa and his staff have failed to consult them, refused to make witnesses available to Democratic staff, and withheld documents. Democrats also assert that Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the Oversight panel's security, homeland, and foreign operations subcommittee, effectively excluded them from joining his delegation on a trip to Libya last weekend. But Chaffetz denied that was the case.",
    " Title: Unmasking Requests for Michael Flynn's Information Revealed: Biden, Comey, Clapper, and Others Included\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, a list of government officials who made unmasking requests for information about Michael Flynn, former National Security Advisor, has been released. The documents, declassified last week by the acting director of national intelligence, Richard Grenell, show that former Vice President Joe Biden, along with James Comey, John Brennan, and James Clapper, the former directors of the FBI, CIA, and Office of the Director of National Intelligence, respectively, made such requests.\n\nUnmasking refers to the process where high-level U.S. government officials request information regarding American citizens mentioned in classified foreign intelligence reports. The documents show that an unmasking request was made in Biden's name on January 12, 2017, with similar requests under the names of Comey, Brennan, and Clapper. Denis McDonough, who served as President Obama's chief of staff, also submitted a request on January 5, 2017.\n\nThe documents do not confirm whether these officials saw the information related to Flynn. The document released on Wednesday stated, \"While the principals are identified below, we can not confirm they saw the unmasked information.\" The list includes several high-profile Obama administration figures, including Brennan, Clapper, and Biden, but also includes lesser-known officials at the Treasury Department and State Department.\n\nThe unmasking issue has been a focus for Republicans trying to determine who leaked information about communications between Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition period. Kislyak contacted Flynn on December 28, 2016, the same day that the Obama administration ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the U.S. due to Russian hacking during the presidential campaign.\n\nThe records do not settle the question of who made the unmasking request for information from Kislyak's communications with Flynn. Comey suggested in testimony to the House Intelligence Committee on March 2, 2017, that someone in the FBI made the request that revealed Flynn spoke with Kislyak. Clapper submitted an unmasking request on December 28, 2016, but Clapper suggested in testimony that the FBI submitted the request regarding the Kislyak phone calls.\n\nThe declassified records list Comey as the only FBI official to make an unmasking request for Flynn records. That request was submitted on December 15, 2016, two weeks before Flynn spoke with Kislyak. John Bass, who served as U.S. ambassador to Turkey, submitted a request for Flynn information on December 28, 2016. The next request was not submitted until McDonough, the White House chief of staff, did so on January 5, 2017.\n\nBoth McDonough and the Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment. The flurry of requests was submitted in mid-December 2016, according to the records. The unmasking issue is significant due to the leaked information about Flynn's communications with Kislyak, which became central to the Michael Flynn case.",

The airstrikes, which took place on Sunday, targeted Islamic State positions around the dam, a hydroelectric facility on the Euphrates River.\n\nThe military stated that the new strikes are in line with the Pentagon's mission to support humanitarian operations and protect U.S. personnel. Rear Adm. Kirby said, \"We conducted these strikes to prevent terrorists from further threatening the security of the dam, which remains under control of Iraqi security forces, with support from Sunni tribes.\"\n\nCaitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council, noted that the dam is the second-largest hydroelectric contributor to Iraq's power system. She stated, \"Destruction of the dam or release of water would create a level of flooding that would potentially pose a catastrophic threat to thousands of Iraqis.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel, speaking in Georgia, rejected the suggestion that the strikes open a new front in the war against the Islamic State or that they represent an escalation of U.S. military operations.\n\nThe airstrikes on Saturday involved a mix of fighters and bombers, and resulted in the destruction of five Humvees, one armed vehicle, a checkpoint, and damage to a bunker, according to U.S. Central Command.\n\nThis marks the first shift toward targets in western Iraq, a region that is a patchwork of conflicting loyalties. Some Sunnis have supported the Islamic State as a bulwark against the Shiite-dominated government, but tribes have taken different stands in the face of the militant offensive.\n\nTribes in the Haditha dam region have been fighting against the militants for months. The U.S. military stated that the dam remains in the hands of tribes working in support of the Iraqi government and Iraqi security forces.\n\nThe U.S. air campaign began on August 8 and has gradually expanded as it has taken on more missions. U.S. planes have targeted areas around the Mosul Dam, allowing a combination of Iraqi counterterrorist forces and Kurdish peshmerga fighters to retake the facility from Islamic State militants.\n\nU.S. aircraft also targeted militants around Mount Sinjar, where a religious minority had taken refuge after militants had overrun their community. More recently, U.S. aircraft also helped break the siege of Amerli, a Shiite Turkmen town.\n\nSince the air campaign began, the U.S. military has conducted 138 airstrikes in Iraq.",
    " Title: Ferguson Protests Turn Violent: Five Arrested, Businesses Damaged, and Memorial to Michael Brown Destroyed\n\nA memorial to Michael Brown, the unarmed teenager who was shot by a Ferguson police officer in August, was destroyed in a fire Tuesday night, reigniting tensions in the St. Louis suburb. The unrest resulted in five arrests and damage to local businesses.\n\nDuring a news conference Wednesday, Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol reported that two St. Louis County police officers were injured during the unrest. One officer was hit with a rock, and is expected to recover.\n\nThe violence began Tuesday when a beauty supply store was looted and vandalized. Captain Jeremy Corcoran with the Ferguson police stated that this was the third time the store had been broken into in the last six weeks.\n\nFollowing the break-in, gunshots were heard, and approximately 200 people gathered at the site where demonstrations were held after the Aug. 9 shooting of Brown. A fire was then reported at a restaurant on Carson Road. The investigation shows gasoline was poured around the restaurant, and the fire was put out by Ferguson firefighters.\n\nProtesters stated they were in the streets because the makeshift memorial to Brown had been burned earlier in the day. Protesters believed the fire was set intentionally.\n\nThe fire started around 6:45 a.m. CT Tuesday on Canfield Drive, the street where Brown was killed, said Captain Jeremy Corcoran with the Ferguson police. The fire started small enough to have been put out with a cup of water, but instead of acting, some people stood watching the fire for 11 minutes until police and firefighters arrived. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined, but Captain Ron Johnson does not believe that a police officer started it. A full investigation is underway to determine the cause.\n\nLater Tuesday, residents rebuilt the memorial. The blaze angered many people who live near the scene, with one man describing it as a grave being desecrated.\n\nAround 12:15 a.m., unpeaceful protesters started shining lights into the eyes of police, shouting about shooting officers and burning down the town, according to Captain Ron Johnson. The protesters were positioning themselves close to officers, so the decision was made to disperse the crowd. When they attempted to break up the group, some started throwing bottles, rocks, and other items at police, injuring two officers.\n\nThe unrest continued when someone near Canfield fired shots at the officers. Captain Ron Johnson said he saw the muzzle flash from the gun and sought shelter. Officers were wearing bulletproof vests, but Captain Ron Johnson stated that a lot of the heavy equipment used during the unrest in August was not used Tuesday, but they will start to respond to the area in riot gear if it becomes necessary.\n\nCaptain Ron Johnson also reported that a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a parking facility. Of the five people arrested for failing to disperse, Captain Ron Johnson believed one person also is facing assault and inciting a riot charges.\n\nBrown's death led to weeks of protest and unrest in the St. Louis suburb. After a month without an arrest, Brown's parents and activists questioned why Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson had not been indicted in the killing. At the time of the shooting, witnesses in the area stated that Brown had raised his hands to surrender as he was shot. A state grand jury and the U.S. Department of Justice are continuing to investigate.",
    " Title: Mother Confronts EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt in Washington D.C. Restaurant Over Ethics Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent incident, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt was approached by a mother and her 2-year-old son while dining out, making him the latest Trump administration official to be confronted in public. The woman, identified as Kristin Mink, a 33-year-old sixth-grade teacher at Sidwell Friends, the school former President Obama\u2019s daughters attended, walked up to Pruitt while he was at a Washington D.C. restaurant.\n\nMink, who had notes that she occasionally glanced at while talking to Pruitt, expressed her concerns about Pruitt's tenure at the EPA. \"This is my son, he loves animals, he loves clean air, he loves clean water,\" she said. \"So I would urge you to resign before your scandals push you out.\"\n\nPruitt faces a barrage of ethics complaints and federal inquiries. The EPA's inspector general, the Government Accountability Office, and the White House are investigating numerous allegations concerning Pruitt's spending on first-class travel and security, his dealings with subordinates and with lobbyists, and other matters. The EPA's senior counsel resigned last month just days after appearing before a panel of House oversight committee investigating allegations of mismanagement and spending at the EPA.\n\nPruitt has also been criticized in connection with the rental of a Capitol Hill condo tied to a prominent oil and gas lobbyist, and the use of first-class travel and luxury hotel suites, among other things.\n\nIn response to the encounter, Mink told The New York Post, \"I had to decide what to say, he\u2019s so scandal-ridden.\" Pruitt left after the encounter, but according to his spokesman, Lincoln Ferguson, EPA spokesman, that was not the reason.\n\n\"Administrator Pruitt always welcomes input from Americans, whether they agree or disagree with the decisions being made at EPA,\" Ferguson said in a statement. \"This is evident by him listening to her comments and going on to thank her, which is not shown in the video. His leaving had nothing to do with the confrontation, he had simply finished his meal and needed to get back to EPA for a briefing.\"",
    " Title: Federal Judge Holds Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in Contempt for Violating Court Order on For-Profit College Loans\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was held in contempt of court after a federal judge said she violated an earlier order to stop collecting loans from former students of a defunct for-profit college chain.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim issued the ruling Thursday in San Francisco, stating that DeVos and the department made \"only minimal efforts\" to comply with a 2018 court order. Kim also fined the Education Department $100,000 and required the agency to make monthly reports to prove it is complying with the order.\n\nThe dispute stems from a lawsuit filed by thousands of former Corinthian Colleges students who say they were defrauded by the chain before it collapsed in 2015. The suit says the students are owed full forgiveness of their federal student loans under a rule created by the Obama administration, and it challenges DeVos' 2017 decision to provide only partial relief based on borrowers' incomes.\n\nIn a May 2018 decision, Kim ruled that the partial-relief formula was unlawful. She ordered the department to stop using the formula and to stop collecting student loans from former Corinthian students.\n\nHowever, in a September court filing, the department acknowledged that it incorrectly sent loan bills to more than 16,000 former Corinthian students, prompting more than 3,000 to send payments. The department also garnished wages or tax refunds from 1,800 borrowers and provided credit agencies with negative reports about 800 borrowers.\n\nThe judge wrote that there was \"no question\" the department and DeVos violated the May 2018 injunction. She said the defendants had \"not provided evidence that they were unable to comply with the preliminary injunction, and the evidence shows only minimal efforts to comply with the preliminary injunction.\"\n\nThe Education Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLawyers for the former Corinthian students called the ruling a \"rare and powerful action\" that provides consequences for the \"extreme harm\" DeVos caused.\n\nDeVos \"repeatedly and brazenly violated the law to collect for-profit college students' debts and deny their rights, and today she has been held accountable,\" said Toby Merrill, director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending, which helped file the suit. \"The judge is sending a loud and clear message: Students have rights under the law, and DeVos' illegal and reckless violation of their rights will not be tolerated.\"\n\nIn her ruling, the judge said the department sent just a single, three-sentence email with instructions to loan servicers, along with an \"equally cursory\" email to certain borrowers. There were no meetings or phone calls, Kim wrote, and little effort to make sure loan servicers received the emails.\n\nThe judge threatened to impose further sanctions if the department fails to follow her order, saying she would appoint a court official to help enforce the injunction. The $100,000 fine will repay students for expenses they incurred to raise the issue to the court. The fine is to be paid by the department, not by DeVos personally.",
    " Title: \" Ethical Dilemma: The Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic on Food Delivery Services and Workers\"\n\nThe ongoing coronavirus pandemic has led to a significant increase in demand for food delivery services as people opt to stay at home and practice social distancing. This surge in demand has put pressure on delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash to hire more workers to meet the spike in orders. Grocery orders have seen a 150% increase in March compared to the same period last year.\n\nThe food delivery system relies on an army of delivery workers who face one of the highest risks of exposure to the virus. These couriers, who are often independent contractors, lack health coverage and other benefits. In March, Instacart workers staged a nationwide strike, demanding sick leave and protective gear like masks.\n\nThe question of whether it is fair to ask someone else to take on the health risks associated with public exposure during the pandemic has sparked an ethical debate. Health experts argue that limiting the number of people shopping for food is beneficial in the nationwide effort to curb the spread of the virus. However, choosing not to order could negatively impact delivery workers and the struggling restaurants that prepare the food.\n\nThe popularity of delivery apps has been met with accusations of exploitation, with some cities experiencing a scarcity of delivery slots. Refraining from ordering could potentially deny food to individuals who are unable to shop for themselves due to illness, immunocompromised conditions, or disabilities.\n\nIndustry experts and labor rights activists agree that anyone ordering delivery should acknowledge the burden couriers are taking on by tipping well, giving good ratings, and taking precautions to protect the couriers from infection.\n\nSome labor rights activists view the increased importance of delivery workers and other essential, low-paying jobs as an opportunity to push for better conditions and benefits. This could lead to more strikes and protests as the pandemic continues in the coming weeks and months.\n\nAdele Peters of Fast Company notes, \"If a gig worker relies on orders to make a living, not ordering could affect their ability to pay their bills. But the sheer volume of deliveries now makes that unlikely.\"\n\nLuke Tsai of Eater advises, \"If you do order via one of the apps, at a minimum, please, please, please tip your driver beyond generously. People are out there risking their health so you get that carton of chow mein!\"\n\nFood labor expert Saru Jayaraman told The Atlantic, \"Our industry is definitely worried about people's safety, including their own, but they're also worried about survival and feeding their kids.... It's not that they don't think this is a scary time to be doing delivery, but they also need their jobs.\"\n\nKhushbu Shah of Food & Wine suggests, \"Delivery apps should not be allowed to continue the same vulturous practices they deployed in a pre-coronavirus world. Until these apps actively start agreeing to commission caps, it's time to delete your delivery apps and let them burn.\"\n\nAs the pandemic continues, it is crucial to consider the impact of our actions on delivery workers and the restaurants they support. Acknowledging the risks they take on and showing appreciation through generous tips and precautions can help ensure their safety and survival during these challenging times.",
    " Title: Lawsuit Challenges University of Michigan's Speech Regulation Policies: A Constitutional Conundrum\n\nArticle:\n\nA legal battle is unfolding at the University of Michigan, as the institution faces a lawsuit alleging constitutional violations in its speech regulation policies. The lawsuit, spearheaded by the organization Speech First, aims to dismantle Michigan's elaborate investigatory and disciplinary apparatus, which is accused of suppressing and punishing speech deemed \"demeaning,\" \"bothersome,\" or \"hurtful\" by students.\n\nIn 2016, University President Mark Schlissel addressed a crowd of over 1,000 students, declaring that those who had favored the losing candidate had rejected \"hate.\" This statement, in effect, marked those who disagreed with him and the campus majority as potential targets of the university's \"bias response teams.\"\n\nThe lawsuit targets Schlissel, as well as Michigan's vice-provost for equity and inclusion and the director of the Office of Student Conflict Resolution. These bureaucrats, who have professional stakes in finding inequities to rectify and conflicts to resolve, are part of a nationwide trend of social-justice crusaders and orthodoxy enforcers living off universities whose primary purpose is scholarship.\n\nSpeech First's complaint argues that Michigan's speech regulation system, with its Orwellian threats of \"restorative justice,\" \"individual education,\" and \"unconscious bias training,\" amounts to unconstitutional prior restraint of speech and is too overbroad and vague to provide due notice of what is proscribed.\n\nThe vaguely defined terms such as \"verbal conduct\" that \"victimizes\" or jeopardizes a \"safe and inclusive\" social climate, or constitutes \"cultural appropriation,\" could have a chilling effect on humor, parody, satire, or plain speech about almost any topic. What constitutes forbidden \"cultural appropriation\" is often determined after someone, encouraged by the administration, has reported an incident to law enforcement.\n\nWhen the Wall Street Journal's Jillian Kay Melchior requested a year's worth of bias incident reports, the university thwarted this inquiry by imposing a fee of over $2,400 for the public records. This secretiveness suggests that the university may be embarrassed by its own speech regulation policies.\n\nThe Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) argues that bias response teams create a \"surveillance state on campus where students and faculty must guard their every utterance for fear of being reported to and investigated\" by bureaucrats. These bureaucrats are primarily targeting conservatives, whose attitudes and opinions are often labeled as \"hate\" by students, as Schlissel's 2016 statement demonstrated.\n\nFIRE has established a grading system whereby colleges and universities are given green, yellow, or red ratings depending on their commitment to freedom of speech and inquiry. Institutions are increasingly interested in earning FIRE's green approval. FIRE gives Michigan the red rating that identifies a university that has \"at least one policy that clearly and substantially restricts freedom of speech.\"\n\nFrederick M. Hess and Grant Addison of the American Enterprise Institute, writing in National Affairs, note that, after World War II, the federal government's decision to direct scientific and medical research through universities rather than government-run laboratories raised concerns about government threatening free inquiry on campuses. Today, ideological homogeneity in academia is producing \"formal policies and practices\" whereby \"limits on speech and expression have become ingrained in campus culture.\"\n\nHess and Addison propose a sensible solution: \"Taxpayer funds should not be subsidizing research at higher-education institutions where the conditions of free inquiry are compromised.\" Of the 30 academic institutions that received the most research funding in 2015, six (20%) received $4.5 billion from the federal government (11% of all federal research funds) and a red rating from FIRE. According to FIRE, almost 40% of all federal research funds went to 25 institutions that have formal policies that restrict constitutionally protected speech.\n\nMichigan ranks third among all universities as a recipient of federal research funding. In 2015, its $735 million in federal funding was 54% of the university's total R&D grants. Although Schlissel may be ideologically blinkered, tone-deaf, and complacent about his own flagrant biases, his bias-response teams probably are not worth $735 million to him.",
    " Title: CPAC 2013: A Shift in Conservative Perspective on Military Intervention and Foreign Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in the conservative movement's stance on military intervention and foreign policy, the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) this year has seen a noticeable change in the discourse, with younger members gravitating towards a more restrained view, as exemplified by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and his 13-hour filibuster last week against the President's unchecked drone authority.\n\nDuring a panel discussion on Thursday, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) delivered a hawkish speech, revisiting past conflicts such as the Vietnam War, the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, primarily attributing them to former President Jimmy Carter. However, Gohmert's comments, typically well-received at such gatherings, received a tepid response from the crowd, with one attendee commenting, \"I'm sure we could hear all about this on the History Channel.\"\n\nIn contrast, Sen. Paul, who has been a vocal proponent of a more restrained foreign policy, received an enthusiastic response from the crowd during his speech. Paul, the son of the libertarian, anti-war icon former Rep. Ron Paul, called attention to the cultural divide within the GOP, stating, \"The GOP of old has grown stale and moss-covered. I do not think we need to name any names, do we? Our party is encumbered by an inconsistent approach to freedom.\"\n\nThe panel discussion's title, \"Too Many American Wars? Should We Fight Anywhere and Can We Afford It?\", underscores the changing discourse at CPAC. The event, which continues to attract a diverse range of conservative voices, including the hawkish old guard and the conflict-averse new guard, such as Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), will all be speaking in prime spots at the three-day gathering.\n\nFor younger attendees, the Paul message seemed to have a certain appeal. Kasey Leander, a student at Taylor University and CPAC participant, expressed, \"I appreciate the old guard and the hard-line conservatives, but there are a lot of different policies, both Libertarian and conservative \u2013 and I don't want to be disrespectful, but I see his (Paul's) appeal in the 21st century too.\"\n\nThe CPAC gathering comes as the GOP is grappling with identity issues and trying to carve out a future. With the sting of 2012 behind them and midterm elections approaching, the GOP is racing to retool their image and their message. The roster of speakers at this year's CPAC speaks to the struggle, with some marquee names, but also some notable absences, such as popular New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell. American Conservative Union chairman Al Cardenas explained, \"I am a firm believer that if the Republican Party's going to have success, it's going to do so by being a conservative party and not a home for everybody.\"",
    " Title: American Airlines' Preemptive Wage Hike Sparks Wall Street Backlash and Economic Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and debate, American Airlines announced this week that it would be giving its flight attendants and pilots a preemptive raise, aiming to close a gap in compensation that had emerged between its employees and those at rival airlines Delta and United. The decision, while hailed by labor unions as a step towards fairness and sustainability, has sent shockwaves through the stock market, with Wall Street expressing concern over the potential impact on the airline industry's overall profitability.\n\nThe decision has been met with criticism from financial analysts, who argue that the wage increase could signal higher wages across the industry, leading to increased costs and potential negative consequences for the industry as a whole. Kevin Crissey, a widely-circulated note from Citi analyst, wrote, \"Labor is being paid first again, shareholders get leftovers.\"\n\nJP Morgan's Jamie Baker was even more scathing, suggesting that the move was not just contestable as a matter of business strategy, but somehow illegitimate, writing, \"We are troubled by AAL's wealth transfer of nearly $1 billion to its labor groups.\"\n\nHowever, American's management and unions argue that the raises are a matter of basic fairness and long-term sustainability. The airline had been paying pilots and flight attendants less than its direct competitors, creating a morale problem. With the collective bargaining agreement set to expire in two years, a showdown was inevitable. By granting the raise now, American is demonstrating good faith to its workforce and setting the table for future negotiations.\n\nThe debate over American's wage increase is part of a larger conversation about the state of labor compensation in the United States and other rich countries. A report last year from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showed that workers as a whole have been receiving a smaller and smaller share of national income.\n\nNoah Smith of Bloomberg View recently wrote a column summarizing the various main theories professional economists have about why this is happening, with monopoly power, global trade, robots, and landlords being the leading contenders for villain.\n\nWhile the reasons for this trend are complex and multifaceted, one under-appreciated factor may be the management fad for treating workers poorly. The backlash American faced in the stock market, and the outraged tone of the analyst letters, is a clear sign of the constant pressure that modern companies are under to be as stingy as possible with their workforce.\n\nA company like Apple, which invests money in environmental or accessibility initiatives, would never dream of taking a similarly high-minded attitude toward labor issues, even though it could make Apple Store retail employees as well-paid as any manufacturing worker from the \"good old days\" if it wanted to.\n\nThe potential benefits of a different approach are clear. Broad-based income growth creates broad-based business opportunities. The vast majority of Americans earn a living supplying services to other Americans, so when wages don't rise, we struggle to find economic opportunities. As the rich get richer, they still find limits to what they can realistically consume, plowing money instead into financial assets. That creates low interest rates that the government could take advantage of to go deeply into debt and massively expand public sector employment.\n\nHowever, politicians, with some good reason, are reluctant to embrace a growth strategy that's so heavily dependent on debt and centralized control. A far better approach would be something more like a generalization of the American Airlines model. Profitable companies could pay workers more and shareholders less, leading to more spending on the products made by other companies. Those companies would then see their revenue, profits, and wages rise, and people might find themselves buying more plane tickets. That's how functioning market economies used to work, and in the end, even executives and shareholders ended up just fine.\n\nWith the unemployment rate finally down to a reasonably low level after years of painfully slow improvement, there's a chance we just may get it. But for it to happen, economic elites will have to learn to live with a world where labor really does get paid first.",
    " Title: President Trump Outlines New Rules for White House Press Conferences Following Jim Acosta's Reinstatement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace, President Donald Trump has outlined new rules for White House press conferences following a federal judge's decision to reinstate CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta's press pass. The temporary order, which lasts for 14 days, was issued after U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly ruled that Acosta should be allowed back in the White House.\n\nDuring the interview, Trump stated that if Acosta \"misbehaves,\" he would be removed from press conferences or the event would be terminated. The President also mentioned that new rules of decorum would be established to ensure a fair and orderly press conference.\n\n\"We're writing them now. We'll have rules of decorum, you can't keep asking questions. We had a lot of reporters in that room, many many reporters in that room, and they were unable to ask questions because this guy gets up and starts, you know, doing what he's supposed to be doing for him and for CNN and you know just shouting out questions and making statements,\" Trump said.\n\nThe temporary order is not a final decision, and further hearings are expected to take place in the coming weeks to determine whether the White House's decision to revoke Acosta's press pass violated CNN and Acosta's First and Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nTrump emphasized his support for the First Amendment, stating, \"I will say this, look, nobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do and if I think somebody is acting out of sorts I will leave. I will say thank you very much everybody, I appreciate you coming and I'll leave.\"\n\nAcosta's \"hard pass,\" which provided expedited access to the White House grounds, was suspended last week after a contentious exchange with Trump during a press conference. CNN filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration on Tuesday demanding the restoration of Acosta's press credential, but Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called the move \"more grandstanding from CNN.\"\n\nSanders issued a statement following the judge's decision, stating, \"Today, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House. In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter's hard pass. We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future. There must be decorum at the White House.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Fox News announced it would support CNN's effort to restore Acosta's White House credential and filed an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court. The entire interview will air Sunday on \"Fox News Sunday\" at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. ET.",
    " Title: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel Faces Challenges as He Prepares to Confront New Round of Defense Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who has maintained a low profile at the Pentagon since his appointment nine months ago, is facing what some sources close to him describe as his biggest challenge as he prepares to confront a new round of defense cuts. According to a report in Politico Magazine, Hagel, who some administration officials refer to as a \"paper tiger,\" has shown signs of fighting back against sequestration cuts by reinstating five of the 11 furlough days for Pentagon civilian employees without White House approval.\n\nHowever, whether the White House will allow Hagel the same level of autonomy in the future is still uncertain, according to administration officials who spoke to Politico. These officials suggest that Hagel's approach to dealing with the impact of the sequester on the military differs from the way President Obama wants to handle it.\n\nWith a new round of defense cuts on the horizon that could take $100 billion a year from the Pentagon, Hagel and his commanders will need to decide between retaining troops and their benefits programs or paring back on modern weapons systems. This decision could shape the military's future as the nation winds down its war presence in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nHagel shares Obama's goal of a more efficient, if leaner, military, reports Politico, but he is pushing to separate Pentagon spending entirely from the rest of the nondefense budget, putting him at odds with the White House, which is trying to put pressure on Republicans to spare social programs while they are moving to restore some defense cuts.\n\n\"If you just start to carve out certain popular items from the sequester, you don't solve the problem,\" a source close to Obama told Politico. \"Chuck is just doing his job. He wants to exempt the military from the sequester, and that's understandable. But we're looking to get rid of the sequester across the board.\"\n\nPolitico also notes that Hagel is facing challenges within the Pentagon itself, including finding a replacement for top deputy secretary Ashton Carter, who is leaving the Pentagon at the end of the year. Hagel is reportedly still interviewing candidates for the job, but Politico reports that Robert Work, a former undersecretary of the Navy, is considered the top candidate.\n\n\"To some extent, you are seeing the Clinton effect,\" an unnamed former defense official told Politico, explaining why filling important positions at the Pentagon may be difficult. \"Why take the risks of working in a second Obama administration when you can make $300,000 in the private sector and then go work for Hillary?\"\n\nDealing with the budget cuts will be Hagel's most pressing and constant challenge, and this may eventually lead to a more public conflict with the president, according to Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican who voted against Hagel during his confirmation. \"The first thing he's got to do is confront the political team in the White House, which is asserting too much influence over policy decisions,\" Sessions told Politico. \"I just think it's his duty to speak the truth to the president and stand up. You can't just always continue in office if you are asked to execute a policy that you truly believe is harmful. You have to make up your mind if you should stay or leave.\"",
    " Title: Obama's Strike on ISIS Triggers Congressional Debate Over War Powers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent airstrikes by the United States against the Islamic State in Iraq have sparked a debate in Congress, potentially challenging one of President Barack Obama's campaign promises: to reduce the Pentagon budget. The White House maintains that the strikes, carried out under the President's constitutional powers as Commander in Chief, are in response to requests for assistance from the Iraqi central government and Kurdish regional officials in Erbil to combat ISIS.\n\nWhen President Obama announced the limited bombing campaign against ISIS, he stated that the objective was to protect Iraqi minorities under siege by ISIS and to safeguard American citizens and U.S. facilities in Iraq. The President has been providing Congress with notifications on the airstrikes under the War Powers Act, which prohibits American troops from engaging in military action for more than 60 days without congressional authorization. However, recent presidents have disregarded this requirement.\n\nWith lawmakers in both parties growing increasingly uncomfortable with the president unilaterally deciding on military action in Iraq and potentially Syria, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader from Kentucky, has called on the President to clarify how any additional authority he might seek to strike ISIS would safeguard Americans. McConnell argues that training and equipping the militaries of partner nations to counter ISIS, as the President has done in Iraq and is proposing to do in Syria, \"is not tenable and will not generate sufficient combat power to protect America.\"\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, McConnell stated that if the President is prepared to engage Congress \"with a strategic plan\" to protect the United States and its allies from ISIS, he would have significant congressional support. McConnell emphasized that the ISIS threat \"is real and it's growing,\" and it is time for President Obama to take a leadership role in launching a response.\n\nDuring an interview on Sunday, President Obama expressed his vision of the Free Syrian Army providing the ground presence needed to confront ISIS in Syria. He stated that until a moderate Sunni opposition emerged, there was no real hope of ousting President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. However, the opposition has been fractured, and the moderate militias are viewed as less capable than ISIS.\n\nPresident Obama reiterated that the U.S.'s focus is specifically on ISIL (the name used by administration officials for the militant group). He added, \"Our attitude towards Assad continues to be that through his actions, through using chemical weapons on his own people, dropping barrel bombs that killed innocent children, that he has foregone legitimacy.\" However, when it comes to U.S. policy and the coalition being assembled, the focus is on ISIL.",
    " Title: Louisville Police Chief Announces Intent to Fire Officer Involved in Breonna Taylor's Death\n\nArticle:\n\nLouisville, Kentucky's police chief, Robert Schroeder, announced on Friday his intention to terminate Detective Brett Hankison, one of the officers involved in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician. Taylor was killed in a series of gunshots when drug investigators, who had a \"no-knock\" arrest warrant, mistakenly entered her apartment.\n\nIn a letter posted on Twitter, Schroeder stated that Hankison's actions displayed an \"extreme indifference to the value of human life\" and that he intended to fire the officer for what he called \"extreme\" violations of standard operating procedures.\n\n\"Your actions displayed an extreme indifference to the value of human life when you wantonly and blindly fired ten (10) rounds into the apartment of Breonna Taylor,\" Schroeder wrote. \"I find your conduct a shock to the conscience.\"\n\nThe River City Fraternal Order of Police, which represents Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) officers, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHankison, who joined the department in 2003, had previously been disciplined in January 2019 for reckless conduct that injured an innocent person, according to Schroeder's letter. Hankison will have the opportunity to provide additional information or mitigating factors before his termination is finalized.\n\nBenjamin Crump, an attorney for Taylor's family, called the police chief's letter \"damning,\" and on Twitter, he expressed his desire to see the other officers fired and criminally charged.\n\nTaylor's death, along with the May 25 death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd and other police killings of Black people, has become a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement and has sparked nationwide protests against racism and police brutality.\n\nHours after the March 13 raid, Louisville police Lieutenant Ted Eiden told reporters that the officers had knocked on the door before forcing entry and were shot at by Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. One officer was struck in the leg, and all three returned fire, hitting Taylor at least eight times, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal. Walker was charged with attempted murder and assault, but last month state prosecutors dropped the charges, the Courier-Journal reported.",
    " Title: A Comprehensive Review of Denials Regarding Campaign Contacts: A Look Back at Statements Made by Trump, Jr., Pence, Conway, and Spicer\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of Donald Trump Jr.'s admission of a meeting with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer during the presidential campaign, it is worth revisiting the numerous denials made by Donald Trump, Jr., Vice President Mike Pence, advisor Kellyanne Conway, and former press secretary Sean Spicer regarding any contacts with Russian individuals.\n\nOne of the denials made by Donald Trump Jr., for instance, was on Saturday, when he stated that his meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya was primarily about a program concerning the adoption of Russian children. However, in March, he claimed that during the campaign, he had met with Russians but was not representing the campaign in any way, shape, or form. In July 2016, following allegations that Russia was attempting to aid Trump's campaign, Junior stated that the Clinton campaign's claims were \"bigger lies.\"\n\nPresident Trump himself also denied collusion, though his denial was made off-camera after making himself appear evasive during a press conference. After being asked twice whether anyone connected to him or his campaign had any contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign, he reportedly gave a firm denial off-camera to two reporters later.\n\nVice President Mike Pence responded with \"of course not\" to two different versions of the collusion question. Kellyanne Conway stated \"absolutely not,\" and Sean Spicer referred reporters back to Donald Trump's off-camera denial.\n\nThese denials were made after Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian with Kremlin ties who claimed to have damaging information on Hillary Clinton. The Washington Post has compiled a total of seven such denials, three of which were made by Donald Trump Jr. himself. The question now remains as to whether these denials were, in fact, truthful.",
    " Title: Obama Hails Iran Nuclear Deal as Diplomatic Success, Amidst Bipartisan Concern Over Dollar Use in Iranian Business Transactions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement made during the bi-annual Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, President Barack Obama declared the Iran nuclear deal a \"substantial success\" in preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The deal, which has been met with bipartisan concern in Congress, has been criticized for allowing Iran too much leeway in its nuclear program undetected by international inspectors.\n\nDuring the summit, Mr. Obama emphasized the deal's focus on nuclear proliferation and its effective approach to the issue. He expressed hope that the success of the Iran nuclear deal could serve as a model for future diplomatic efforts.\n\nHowever, critics, including Republican lawmakers, presidential candidates, and the Israeli government, argue that the agreement allows Iran too much wiggle room to continue work on nuclear weapons undetected. The latest point of contention is reports that, as the deal is being implemented, the administration will allow Iran to use the dollar in business transactions. This move contradicts the administration's previous stance that it would not allow such a move.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, such as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, have expressed concern that further rewarding Iran, in light of its recent ballistic missile tests, is not advisable. Ryan stated, \"As Iran continues to undermine the spirit of its nuclear agreement with illicit ballistic missile tests, the Obama administration is going out of its way to help Tehran reopen for business. The president should abandon this idea.\"\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, also voiced opposition to the move, stating, \"I want to make clear my concerns that the administration had indicated that there would be no further concessions beyond those specifically negotiated and briefed to Congress.\" Hoyer further expressed his concerns about Iran's involvement in terror financing, missile procurement, and its saber-rattling against America's allies, as well as its despicable threats against Israel and the Jewish people.\n\nU.S. officials have stated that the Treasury Department is considering the matter, and any changes would not give Iran substantial access to the U.S. financial system. The Obama administration maintains that Iran has complied with the terms of the nuclear deal, as evidenced by the dismantling of two-thirds of its installed centrifuges, the shipping of 98 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile out of Iran, and the removal and concrete filling of the Arak reactor core. The agreement, which lifts economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program and international inspections of its facilities, has been in effect since January 2016.",
    " Title: Sen. Tom Cotton Accuses Media of 'Stalin-like' Cover-up of Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal FAQ\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) has accused the news media of engaging in a \"Stalin-like\" cover-up of a Green New Deal document produced by the office of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\nDuring a discussion of the ambitious environmental resolution introduced last week by the freshman congresswoman, Cotton pointed to a \"frequently asked questions\" explainer released, and then retracted, as part of the resolution's rollout.\n\nCotton, in a radio interview on \"The Hugh Hewitt Show\" Tuesday, said the document revealed a liberal ambition to \"have the power and the control of those Americans' lives to implement their radical vision for humanity.\"\n\nThe senator said it was \"remarkable\" how many Democratic presidential candidates \"you had leap onto a proposal that was going to confiscate every privately owned vehicle in America within a decade, and ban air travel so we could all drive or ride around on high-speed light rail, supposedly powered by unicorn tears.\"\n\nSeveral ideas from the FAQ, which were not included in the actual resolution, were flagged and mocked by opponents to the legislation. The most widely derided lines included a call for \"high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary\"; expanding public transit \"with goals to replace every combustion-engine vehicle\"; \"economic security for all who are unable or unwilling to work\"; and a goal to \"fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump referenced ideas from the FAQ in his criticism of the Green New Deal during his rally in El Paso, Texas, on Monday.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has tried to distance herself from the FAQ. In a tweet on Saturday, she claimed that \"doctored\" Green New Deal documents were \"floating around,\" and that a \"draft version\" had been uploaded and then taken down.\n\nSaikat Chakrabarti, Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, said \"an early draft\" that \"was clearly unfinished and that doesn't represent the GND resolution got published to the website by mistake.\"\n\nCotton called it \"a classic example of a gaffe being when you say what you really mean.\"\n\n\"I understand the Democrats that proposed this immediately tried to retract that white paper that went along with their resolution,\" Cotton said. \"And too many people in the media have been complicit in the Stalin-like or 1984 technique of disappearing it, sending it down the memory hole.\"\n\nCotton did not specify how the news media were \"complicit,\" but many conservatives were outraged when a Washington Post fact check conceded on Monday that Ocasio-Cortez's claim that the FAQ had been doctored was \"misleading\" but did not award her any \"Pinocchios.\"\n\nEven without some of the ideas from the controversial FAQ, Cotton and other Republicans have made it clear that the Green New Deal resolution is too radical for them. As written, the document calls for \"net-zero greenhouse gas emissions\" within 10 years and \"guaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) jumped at the opportunity to nail Democratic presidential hopefuls from the Senate down on their supportive positions of the resolution. He announced he plans to bring the resolution to the floor for a vote \"to give everybody an opportunity to go on record to see how they feel about the Green New Deal.\"\n\nMost of the declared 2020 Democratic candidates have expressed support for the Green New Deal, including Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).\n\nKlobuchar plans to vote for the resolution, but also implied she might not vote for it as written if it came to the Senate floor as \"actual legislation.\"\n\n\"I see it as aspirational, I see it as a jump-start,\" she said in an interview on Fox News Tuesday. \"So I would vote yes, but I would also \u2013 if it got down to the nitty-gritty of an actual legislation as opposed to, 'oh here\u2019s some goals we have,' that would be different for me.\"",
    " Title: CNN's John Avlon's \"Reality Check\" Sparks Controversy Over Factual Accuracy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent segment on CNN's New Day show, analyst John Avlon delivered a \"Reality Check\" aimed at Fox News host Tucker Carlson. However, the segment has sparked controversy due to its reiteration of Illinois Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth's false claims about President Donald Trump's speech at Mt. Rushmore.\n\nDuring the segment, Avlon criticized Carlson for his comments about Senator Duckworth, emphasizing her family's long history of military service and her own record of military and public service. The controversy arose when Avlon played a clip of Senator Duckworth from Sunday's State of the Union, in which she criticized President Trump for spending more time at Mt. Rushmore \"honoring dead Confederates\" than discussing the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn the clip, Senator Duckworth stated, \"What really struck me about the speech that the President gave at Mt. Rushmore was that he spent more time worried about honoring dead Confederates than he did talking about the lives of our 130,000 Americans who lost their lives to COVID-19 or by warning Russia off of the bounty they're putting on Americans' heads.\"\n\nHowever, President Trump's speech at Mt. Rushmore did not, in fact, focus on \"dead Confederates.\" Instead, he spoke about former Presidents and other historical figures, none of whom were Confederates. In a portion of the interview not shown by Avlon, Senator Duckworth even went so far as to claim that Trump \"spent all his time talking about dead traitors.\"\n\nCarlson had quoted this false claim on his Tuesday show, recalling that the Democratic Senator had turned down an invitation to discuss the issue of whether statues of George Washington should be taken down.\n\nAvlon let Duckworth's misinformation stand, suggesting that it was Carlson and Fox News who could not be trusted to provide facts to their viewers. After citing Duckworth complaining about Carlson calling her a \"coward\" for not appearing on his show, Avlon concluded, \"But some folks fearmonger when they don't have facts on their side. And, speaking of facts, here's something to ponder if you're wondering just who you can trust in this hailstorm of hate. Fox News's own lawyer argued in federal court three weeks ago that Tucker Carlson's audience does not expect him to report the facts. And that's your 'Reality Check.'\"\n\nThis episode was sponsored by Finishing Touch beauty products and Liberty Mutual insurance. Their contact information is linked.",
    " Title: Secret Service Protection of President Obama: A Concern for Many Black Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the eight years of President Barack Obama's tenure, the Secret Service's protection of him has been a topic of concern for many African Americans. This apprehension stems from a series of security lapses that have occurred during his presidency, which echoes a long-held fear among blacks - the safety of the first black president.\n\nRecently, a fence-jumper was able to breach the White House security, making it all the way into the building, an event that has brought this fear to the forefront. Roland Martin, a talk show host, commented on his radio program this week, \"One of the greatest fears of a first black president was harm being done to him.\"\n\nThe Secret Service has acknowledged a spike in security incidents around the time President Obama won the presidency and took office. However, they have denied reports that he received three or four times as many threats as other presidents, stating that the incidents have since leveled out and are consistent with his predecessors.\n\nCharles D. Ellison, writing for The Root, a black-oriented online news site, raised questions about the security lapses, suggesting either the agents missed the memo that he is the first black president or they are overwhelmed.\n\nJoshua DuBois, a former White House aide to President Obama, noted that the president's security feels personal for many blacks. \"There's a broad extended family around the country of moms and aunts and uncles who feel a real sense of kinship with this first family, and they want to make sure they're protected and whole,\" he said.\n\nSome supporters of the president have long asserted that he has been treated with less respect by political opponents and the media, attributing that to his race. This has fueled suspicion that perhaps the Secret Service has not been as committed to him either.\n\nDonald W. Tucker, a retired black member of the Secret Service, has no reason to believe the agency has not protected President Obama vigorously but has heard the concern regularly. The concern persists, and many African Americans continue to watch closely as the Secret Service carries out its duty to protect the president.",
    " Title: The Blurred Line Between Issue Ads and Political Campaign Ads: A Look at Crossroads GPS and the Supreme Court's Citizens United Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of political advertising, the distinction between issue-based ads and campaign ads has become increasingly blurred, making it difficult for the general public to discern the difference. This issue was at the heart of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010, a case that involved the tax-exempt social welfare organization Citizens United and its film \"Hillary the Movie.\"\n\nThe film, which was essentially a character attack on then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, was not considered an issue ad by Citizens United's legal team. However, the Supreme Court disagreed, with Justice Anthony Kennedy explaining on that decision day that \"the film is quite critical of Sen. Clinton\" and that it \"is susceptible of no other interpretation than to argue to the public that she lacked qualifications for the office.\"\n\nFast forward to the present, and the issue of issue ads versus express advocacy is still a contentious one. Take, for example, an ad from Crossroads GPS, a social welfare organization co-founded by Republican strategist Karl Rove. Crossroads GPS President Steven Law states that the group is not just focused on the election, but on changing policies in Washington.\n\n\"You can't achieve that merely by producing the TV equivalent of a policy white paper,\" Law says. \"You need to reach viewers viscerally, and so we spend a lot of time figuring out how to explain issues in ways that get viewers to be persuaded and also to get fired up to take action.\"\n\nCrossroads GPS has been one of the most prominent political advertisers this spring, running ads attacking President Obama on a wide range of issues. The donors who finance these ads remain anonymous, a significant advantage for Crossroads GPS and other social welfare organizations, or 501(c)(4) groups as they're known in the tax code.\n\nPolitical scientists argue that the line between issue ads and express advocacy has almost been erased. Deborah Jordan Brooks, a government professor at Dartmouth College who studies political attack ads, notes that \"ads that are largely issue-based often have a real personal zinger right in there, and it may just be one line.\"\n\nCampaign finance lawyer Robert Kelner is not surprised by the vagueness. Ultimately, he says, it's all about free speech. \"The price that we pay for the benefits of the First Amendment is that we have to essentially give a pass to some ads that you and I would probably agree look an awful lot like a campaign ad,\" he says.\n\nHowever, it still matters which side of the line a group is playing on. A federal judge recently ruled that for certain types of issue ads, 501(c)(4)s have to name the donors. But for now, some groups are switching to express advocacy ads. Kelner warns that this is risky because social-welfare organizations cannot make politics their primary purpose.\n\n\"We don't know where the line is,\" he says. \"We don't know how many ads the (c)(4) could run before it would jeopardize its (c)(4) status.\" Without 501(c)(4) status, an organization would lose the thing that gives it so much political clout: the ability to take anonymous contributions.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Declines to Intervene in Partisan Gerrymandering Cases, Upholds Political Branch's Role in Redistricting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a landmark decision on Thursday, the Supreme Court declined to intervene in two partisan gerrymandering cases, asserting that conflicts over the practice should be resolved through the political process rather than federal courts. The cases, brought forth by North Carolina Democrats and Maryland Republicans, alleged that the redistricting plans discriminated against them based on their political views and infringed upon their First Amendment associational freedoms.\n\nThe high court's decision not to validate the theory of partisan gerrymandering has been a long-standing position, as various justices have identified the fundamental flaw in every partisan gerrymandering claim. The group right to proportional representation, which underlies these claims, has never been recognized by the court because it is foreign to the Constitution. Defining each political association that deserves a proportion of seats and assigning each voter to one of those groups remains a doctrinal challenge.\n\nThe court was curious to learn whether these problems had finally been solved in the latest set of cases. However, the majority found that the individual right the plaintiffs claimed - to be \"free\" of partisan gerrymandering - was the same as the long-discredited group right to proportional representation.\n\nThe decision keeps redistricting judgments with the political branches, and for that reason, it is a victory for the Constitution. Eddie Greim and Lucinda Luetkemeyer, partners at Graves Garrett LLC, represented the National Republican Redistricting Trust in one of the redistricting cases.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision not to intervene in partisan gerrymandering cases upholds the political process and the Constitution's principles. The court's ruling ensures that the political branches remain responsible for redistricting, and the judiciary will not adjudicate claims for partisan gerrymandering.",
    " Title: Vice President Biden Condemns House Speaker's Stance on Immigration Bill, Urges New Citizens to Advocate for Reform\n\nIn a keynote speech at a naturalization ceremony in Atlanta, Vice President Joe Biden strongly criticized House Speaker John Boehner's recent comments regarding the immigration bill that passed the Senate earlier this year. Biden expressed his disappointment over Boehner's statement that the House has no intention of voting on the bill.\n\nAddressing a crowd of 104 new citizens and their families at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Biden called Boehner's decision a \"step backward in the country's history.\" He emphasized the need for Congress to vote on the bill and \"play by fair play, the American way.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Biden encouraged the new citizens to help the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. He urged them not to \"pull up the ladder behind you\" and instead, to reach back and help others who are \"already acting as decent Americans that deserve a chance, that deserve a path, to earn their way.\"\n\nWith immigration reform talks at a standstill and the fate of undocumented immigrants uncertain, it remains unclear what President Obama could do if the bill fails. In 2012, the President implemented a deferred action program that halted the deportation of undocumented minors.\n\nThe House is in session for only 14 days between now and the end of the year, and the third-ranking House Republican, GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy, has stated that there is not enough time for the bill to be considered.\n\nIn a lighter moment, Biden shared a story about his Irish-Catholic mother and her quintessentially American belief. He recounted a tale from when he was on his way to meet the Queen of England for the first time, and his mother advised him not to bow or kiss the Queen's ring, saying, \"Joey, nobody is better than you.\"\n\nIn closing, Biden pledged to help undocumented immigrants \"out of the shadows,\" stating, \"They all came for the promise of a better life, and they're incredibly capable of contributing, and many are already contributing.\"",
    " Title: Republican Senators Face Pressure to Reject Healthcare Bill as Governors and President Trump Present Opposition\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing efforts by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, are facing significant resistance from a coalition of governors, healthcare providers, patient advocacy groups, and even some Republican senators themselves.\n\nMcConnell, who has long been a vocal critic of the healthcare law, may have underestimated the opposition he would face from Republican governors, particularly those from states that have expanded Medicaid under the law. These governors, many of whom are Republicans, have seen tens of thousands of their residents gain coverage under the health care law and are reluctant to see this coverage disappear.\n\nOhio Governor John R. Kasich, a Republican, expressed his opposition to the current bill at a news conference in Washington on Tuesday, stating, \"When you sit in a room and you say to people, \u2018Should we strip coverage from somebody who\u2019s mentally ill?\u2019 I\u2019ve never heard anybody say yes.\"\n\nSenator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, also voiced his opposition last week, standing alongside the state\u2019s popular Republican governor, Brian Sandoval, and stating, \"The bill that\u2019s currently in front of the United States Senate is not the answer \u2014 it\u2019s simply not the answer.\" Heller added, \"It\u2019s going to be very difficult to get me to a yes.\"\n\nSenators from across the political spectrum are feeling pressure from their governors and, in some cases, state insurance officials, to resist any bill that would raise premiums, increase the number of uninsured, or displease officials in their state.\n\nIn addition to the opposition from governors, President Trump, who would typically be a valuable asset to McConnell in this effort, has instead become a hindrance. Trump\u2019s public criticisms, cajoling, and mild wooing of House Republicans to secure their support for their version of the healthcare bill have been closely watched by Republican senators. The divisions within the House Republican caucus have left many senators wary of the current bill and uncertain of its prospects for success.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Advocates for Environmental Protections, Faces Opposition from Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move towards preserving the environment, President Obama has announced plans to implement protections for clean water, clean air, threatened species, and threatened landscapes. However, these proposals have faced resistance from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republican lawmakers, who are reportedly attempting to block these measures through a series of legislative counterattacks.\n\nThe opposition's arguments revolve around accusations of \"executive overreach\" and \"job-killing regulations.\" Yet, beneath the political rhetoric lies a deeper, less vocal concern that President Obama is fulfilling the intent of environmental laws that have been passed in the past but would struggle to pass through today's Congress.\n\nThe debate has also extended to the presidential campaign, with proposals such as Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin's suggestion to transfer the Environmental Protection Agency's functions to the states. This proposal, aimed at appeasing business interests, could potentially lead to a chaotic situation with 50 different sets of environmental rules across the nation, making federal environmental law enforcement uneven.\n\nIn May, the administration approved a rule significantly expanding the number of streams and wetlands protected under the Clean Water Act. This rule, designed to improve drinking water quality and promote responsible development, has already faced opposition. The House has passed a stand-alone bill to undermine this rule, while Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming has introduced a similar bill in the Senate, citing concerns over private property rights.\n\nPresident Obama's most significant initiative lies in the upcoming rule to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. This rule, which requires individual states to develop emission-reduction plans tailored to their energy mix, is crucial to the president's pledge to reduce America's greenhouse gas emissions by 28% from 2005 levels by 2025, and to his standing as a global warming leader. Senator McConnell, in alignment with the coal industry, has been urging states not to cooperate, while sending mixed messages to the international community about the feasibility of Obama's environmental commitments.\n\nAs the summer approaches, Republicans are reportedly considering strategies to undermine the carbon dioxide emissions rule. However, the administration remains committed to implementing these environmental protections, aiming to ensure a cleaner, safer, and more sustainable future for the nation.",
    " Title: White House Explores Repurposing Federal Funds for Border Wall in Case of Emergency Declaration\n\nThe White House is reportedly examining potential federal funds that could be redirected for the construction of a border wall, should President Trump invoke emergency powers to do so. According to sources from Congress and the Pentagon, the Army Corps of Engineers has been asked to identify projects that could be canceled or delayed to free up funds for a border barrier.\n\nPresident Trump has previously threatened to declare a national emergency if he fails to reach a deal with Democratic lawmakers regarding border wall funding. However, on Friday, he stated he was not planning to take such action \"so fast\" as this is a matter that Congress should handle.\n\nAn emergency declaration would enable the president to activate special powers, allowing him to redirect federal funds without additional authorization from Congress. Some view an emergency declaration as a potential solution to the ongoing spending stalemate that has led to the partial shutdown of the federal government for the past three weeks.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) urged Trump to declare a national emergency and build the wall immediately. On Friday, he stated, \"Mr. President, declare a national emergency now. Build a wall now.\" On Thursday, Graham tweeted in support of the emergency powers, stating, \"I hope it works.\"\n\nHowever, tapping emergency powers to bypass a political impasse would likely result in a legal challenge. Trump reiterated on Friday that he was not inclined to take this step immediately. With negotiations at a standstill over the president's demand for $5.7 billion in border wall funding and 800,000 federal workers missing their paycheck on Friday, the White House is evidently considering this option.\n\nAccording to a Democratic congressional aide, funds that could be redirected include those appropriated for flood control and disaster prevention in February 2018, as well as the Army Corps' current budget for energy and water projects. Diverting these funds for the border wall would likely face opposition from lawmakers who rely on Army Corps projects in their districts and those concerned about losing control of the purse strings.\n\nRep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) described the idea as \"a spectacularly bad idea, a complete waste of money.\" He stated, \"The only emergency we have on the border right now is people seeking asylum. And people seeking asylum are not trying to sneak in. They're turning themselves in and asking for a hearing.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) declined to comment on Friday about a potential emergency declaration and the administration's use of Army Corps funds for the wall. \"When the president acts, we will respond to whatever he does,\" she said.\n\nTrump continues to argue that a wall is necessary. On Friday, he hosted a roundtable discussion with state, local, and community leaders to highlight what he describes as a humanitarian and national security crisis. A new NPR/Ipsos poll indicates that the president's Oval Office speech on the subject had little impact on public opinion. Only 38 percent of those surveyed believed there is a crisis on the border, and fewer still were convinced of the need for a border wall.\n\nIllegal border crossings were lower in 2018 than in 2014 and 2016. However, there has been a recent increase.",
    " Title: FBI Concludes IRS Targeting Investigation Without Interviewing Affected Parties, Raising Questions of Bias and Partisanship\n\nArticle:\n\nThe FBI's decision to close its investigation into the IRS targeting scandal without interviewing any of the 41 American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) clients targeted in the multi-year probe has raised questions about the impartiality of the investigation and the Obama administration's handling of the scandal.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported this week that the FBI does not expect to file any criminal charges in connection with the IRS's admitted systemic targeting of conservative nonprofits for improper scrutiny. The FBI's decision was made without interviewing a single one of the ACLJ's targeted clients, and other Tea Party attorneys report their clients were not interviewed either.\n\nThe FBI's decision to make its conclusions public without interviewing the victims of the potential crime is inexcusable, but it is hardly surprising. Just days before the FBI leaked its determinations, the news broke that the Department of Justice attorney in charge of the investigation was a longtime, significant donor to President Obama.\n\nThe attorney, who came from the DOJ's civil rights division, its most partisan division, began her cycle of donations on January 30, 2008, early in the primary season and just days after then-Senator Obama defeated Hillary Clinton in the South Carolina primary. Her donations totaled nearly $7,000 over the years, putting her in the top tier of financial contributors to President Obama's campaigns.\n\nThe timeline of events suggests that the Obama Administration quickly reversed course from public contrition and damage control to aggressive anti-conservative spin and now to burying the scandal. On May 10, 2013, the IRS's Lois Lerner admitted to systematic targeting, blamed lower-level employees, and apologized on behalf of the IRS. On May 14, with the media in full cry, Attorney General Holder announced a criminal investigation, and the next day President Obama condemned IRS misconduct.\n\nIn June, FBI Director Mueller was unable to even identify the lead investigator of the investigation. By July, only two months later, the IRS scandal transformed from a source of outrage to a \"phony scandal,\" with the President openly dismissing its significance in public statements.\n\nIn the months since, the message from the White House has been the same: Move along. Nothing to see here. Throughout, our clients waited\u2014patiently\u2014for the phone to ring. And it didn't ring until late December, more than seven months after Lois Lerner's apology. Then, before the first interview could be arranged, the news broke of the partisan investigator followed quickly by the news that the results were predetermined.\n\nRepresentatives Darrell Issa and Jim Jordan are calling for an investigation into the Department of Justice's Inspector General to launch his own investigation, and that investigation should answer a few key questions:\n\n* Why didn't the FBI interview the victims of the potential crime before making its determinations?\n* Why did the lead attorney's record of partisan giving create an appearance of a conflict of interest within the meaning applicable federal regulations and local bar association rules?\n* Did its conduct mirror that of other investigations, or was it cursory and conclusory\u2014with a predetermined outcome?\n\nRegardless of what ultimately happens in the criminal investigation, the Obama Administration is mistaken if it thinks it can use its considerable resources and executive discretion to insulate itself from accountability. It may be able to appoint partisan investigators within the DOJ, stonewall congressional investigators (for now), and intensify efforts to publicly sweep this unlawful targeting scheme under the rug, but it still faces civil litigation and accountability before a federal judge.\n\nThe ACLJ lawsuit on behalf of 41 clients in 22 states is ongoing, and discovery looms in the case. We will get to the bottom of one of the most significant\u2014and consequential\u2014political scandals in recent American history. Justice may be delayed, but it will not be denied.",
    " Title: Trump Admitted Mistake on Iran Cash Payment, Reverses Claim of Watching Classified Video\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump admitted on Friday that he had made a mistake regarding the $400 million cash payment made to Iran by the Obama administration. This admission comes after a week of intense scrutiny following Trump's initial claim that he had seen \"top secret\" footage of the payment.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump had stated that the payment, which was publicly disclosed in January, was a hostage payment to a terrorism-sponsoring government. He claimed to have seen a video of the cash transfer, describing the scene in detail. However, on Friday, Trump admitted that the video he had seen was actually widely-circulated news footage of the plane carrying the U.S. hostages in Geneva.\n\nThe initial claim had sparked a flurry of speculation in the media, with some suggesting that the video Trump had seen might have been part of the classified intelligence briefings that both presidential candidates are currently receiving. Trump's campaign spokeswoman later clarified that Trump had merely seen the b-roll footage included in every broadcast of a specific Fox News clip. Despite this clarification, Trump repeated his previous claim at a Maine rally shortly afterwards.\n\nThis latest admission by Trump, while unapologetic, marks a significant shift in a campaign that has been notoriously fact-averse. The acknowledgement of basic reality, combined with Trump's recent outpouring of gratitude towards his supporters on Twitter, suggests a possible change in tone in Trump's campaign. Whether this \"pivot,\" which has never quite stuck, will last remains to be seen.",
    " Title: House Republicans Indicate Little Appetite for Comprehensive Gun Control Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, there are strong indications that any comprehensive gun control legislation will not be voted on the House floor. Interviews with multiple House Republicans from the Midwest and Northeast reveal a lack of interest in voting on a sweeping gun bill.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner has not received internal pressure from center-right Republicans, and given his difficulties with conservative elements within his conference, there seems to be little political incentive for him to move on the gun issue. This may leave President Barack Obama with few options other than focusing on background checks and what he can accomplish through executive action.\n\nThe political realities of Congress have been largely overlooked in the coverage of Obama's campaign-style blitz for new gun control measures. Leaders in both chambers have stalled on the issue, using the Biden commission as a cover to avoid taking a definitive stance. Even if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid were to attempt to push a bill through, there is minimal support among rank-and-file House Republicans for gun control.\n\nRepresentatives Charlie Dent and Jim Gerlach, two moderate Pennsylvania Republicans from swing districts, have expressed interest in addressing mental health issues to prevent future shootings but do not believe additional gun restrictions are the solution. Dent, who represents the Allentown area, stated, \"I'm frankly more concerned about the mental health situation right now than anything else. It's very difficult to get somebody committed.\"\n\nGerlach, who represents suburban Philadelphia, does not support new curbs on firearms or ammunition. He said, \"That's not something, at least in my district, that's a huge issue. Because most people recognize that responsible gun owners, regardless of what kind of gun they have or the magazine they're using, use them responsibly.\"\n\nGerlah is open to tightening background checks but not gun restrictions. \"I'd be willing to look at [background checks] but actual bans of certain firearms just doesn't seem to be the area we need to be looking at,\" he said.\n\nOther House members and senior GOP aides report that the fiscal cliff and the supplemental spending bill for Hurricane Sandy have dominated the conference's internal conversation for the past month. The gun issue is expected to be raised at their retreat later this week in Williamsburg, Virginia, and additional pressure is likely to come with Obama's inaugural and State of the Union speeches.",
    " Title: President Trump Defends Immigration Restrictions, Blames Protests and Senate Democratic Leader for Airport Chaos\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a fiery defense of his controversial refugee and immigration restrictions, President Donald Trump on Monday blamed protesters and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer's 'fake tears' for the chaos that ensued at U.S. airports over the weekend. The executive order, signed on Friday, imposed a 120-day suspension of the refugee program and a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. from seven terror-prone countries, including Iraq, Syria, Somalia, and Sudan.\n\nThe order led to confusion at U.S. airports as customs agents grappled with interpreting the order, causing outrage among civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers who attended protests at the nation's airports where some travelers were detained. Schumer, D-N.Y., who has vowed to fight the order \"with every fiber of my being,\" tweeted Saturday that \"there are tears running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Schumer struggled to hold back tears at a press conference as he called the order \"mean-spirited and un-American.\" In response, Trump said Monday that only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. He blamed the chaos at airports on a Delta computer outage, protesters, and \"the tears of Senator Schumer.\"\n\nTrump's tweets on Sunday and Monday were met with criticism from Democrats and civil rights groups, who argued that the order unfairly targeted Muslims and refugees. In response, Trump reminded his Twitter followers that \"there is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country\" and urged them to \"study the world!\"\n\nTrump's aide Stephen Miller defended the move on Monday, stating that the list of countries was drawn up by the Obama administration and that the move was a preventive measure to stop terror attacks like those seen in Europe. Miller argued that the order was necessary to prevent long-term security problems in the U.S. caused by large pockets of radicalization.\n\nThe Trump administration was forced to make clarifications on the status of permanent legal residents or \"green card\" holders, while a federal judge issued a stay on deportations late Saturday. The chaos at airports over the weekend has sparked protests and calls for the order to be rescinded, with many arguing that it goes against American values of inclusivity and freedom.",
    " Title: UK Government Faces Legal Challenge Over Approval of Controversial Gas-Fired Power Plant\n\nArticle:\n\nThe UK government is facing a legal challenge from environmental lawyers ClientEarth over its approval of a large new gas-fired power plant, a move that overrules the climate change objections of its own planning authority. The plant, being developed by Drax in north Yorkshire, would become the biggest gas power station in Europe and could produce 75% of the UK's power sector emissions when fully operational, according to ClientEarth.\n\nThe 3.6GW gas plant, if built, would contradict the government's commitment, as set out in the Climate Change Act 2008, to cut greenhouse emissions. The planning inspectorate recommended that the project be refused permission, citing that it would undermine the government's climate change commitments due to its significant adverse effects. This marked the first big project rejected due to the climate crisis.\n\nHowever, Andrea Leadsom, secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, overruled the advice and gave the go-ahead in October. Now, ClientEarth has been given permission by the high court to sue ministers, with the case expected to be heard in about two months. The environmental lawyers have previously inflicted three defeats on ministers over their failure to tackle air pollution.\n\nSam Hunter Jones, a lawyer at ClientEarth, stated, \"With scientists ringing the alarm bells for decades, we shouldn't need to take the government to court over its decision. [Leadsom's] decision is at odds with the government's own climate change plans. As the planning inspectorate found, if this plant goes ahead, the public risks a carbon budget blowout, or a huge stranded asset that would require propping up by the taxpayer, or a combination of the two.\"\n\nA Drax spokeswoman defended the company's ambition, stating that their goal was to be carbon negative by 2030. This would be achieved by burning wood or plants and then capturing and storing the emissions. The spokeswoman also noted that Drax's carbon negative ambition could be achieved alongside \"new, high-efficiency gas power capacity as part of our portfolio\" and provide electricity when the wind was not blowing or the sun shining.\n\nThe UK government's actions to tackle the climate emergency are under particular scrutiny this year as it will host a vital UN summit in Glasgow in November. The world's nations must dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions at the summit to avoid a disastrous 3-4C rise in global temperatures.\n\nIn its planning application, Drax stated that its proposal for four new gas turbines was warranted to replace its existing two coal-fired units ahead of the government's proposed phase-out of coal in 2025. It also claimed that the new gas plant would be \"capable\" of having carbon capture technology fitted in the future.\n\nIn overruling the planning inspectorate, Leadsom argued that the plant's high carbon emissions were not a reason to block approval under the existing rules. However, ClientEarth argues that the combination of the project's large scale, level of carbon emissions, and long operating life make it a significant threat to the UK's carbon targets.\n\nThe planning inspectorate also concluded that wind and solar power would cut payers' bills, while the proposed gas plant would not. \"Both [Drax] and [National Grid] confirmed that it is the production of renewable plants that will deliver cheaper energy,\" the planning inspectorate stated.",
    " Title: \"Victoria Toensing's Allegations of Benghazi Cover-up Resurface in New Claims of Whistleblower Obstruction\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Republican attorney Victoria Toensing has once again found herself at the center of a political storm, this time claiming that anonymous State Department and CIA whistleblowers have been obstructed and even threatened by the Obama administration to prevent their testimony regarding the September 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nThe story has gained traction on Fox News and conservative blogs, with Fox News' Ed Henry posing the question to President Obama during a press conference today. The president responded that he had no idea what Henry was referring to.\n\nIt is important to note that this is not the first time Toensing has made allegations of a cover-up surrounding the Benghazi attack. Back in November 2012, Toensing wrote an op-ed for Fox News, attempting to draw a sinister link between the Benghazi attack and the abrupt resignation of former CIA director David Petraeus.\n\nIn her op-ed, Toensing proposed an intricate conspiracy theory tying the two events together. According to her, the fact that Petraeus supported the White House's initial indications that an anti-Islam video had incited the Benghazi attackers was \"strange,\" given that Petraeus, in her view, must have known otherwise.\n\nToensing's argument was, like most conspiracies, dense and winding. She suggested that the Obama administration was either grossly incompetent or deliberately evading the law by not giving timely notice to oversight committees, or that the administration was using the Petraeus affair to pressure the CIA director into backing the White House theory.\n\nHowever, Toensing's theory fell apart when, just a few days after her column was published, Petraeus testified before Congress as planned. During that testimony, he explained why he backed the White House's early statements on the attack.\n\nIt is crucial to approach such allegations with a discerning eye, as facts and common sense can often be disregarded in favor of wild conclusions. As the latest Benghazi \"controversy\" unfolds, it is essential to maintain a neutral perspective and wait for the facts to emerge.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidate Beto O'Rourke Proposes Classifying White Supremacist Violence as Organized Crime, Unveils Plan to Combat Hate Crimes and Gun Violence\n\nIn a bid to address the escalating issue of hate crimes and gun violence in the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke has unveiled a plan to classify white supremacist violence as an organized crime problem and establish federal domestic terrorism offices. The former congressman made this announcement on Friday, following a two-week hiatus in his campaign trail, during which he was in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, where a white gunman targeted Hispanics, resulting in the deaths of 22 people in a Walmart store on Aug. 3.\n\nO'Rourke's plan, revealed a day after he recalibrated his presidential campaign, aims to confront the plight of immigrants and counter what he characterized as the racially charged and divisive rhetoric of Republican President Donald Trump. In a statement, O'Rourke stated, \"The terrorist attack on El Paso, fueled by the racist rhetoric of Donald Trump, was not only an attack on America, but an attack on the aspirational ideals of this nation.\"\n\nUnder O'Rourke's plan, if elected president, he would ensure that the FBI and the Department of Justice prioritize neo-Nazi and white supremacist violence, and establish dedicated domestic terrorism offices within the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice. The 46-year-old is one of many Democratic candidates vying to become the nominee to take on Trump in next November's election who have decried what they say is the president's divisive and incendiary rhetoric about undocumented migrants.\n\nO'Rourke also proposed holding internet companies and social media platforms accountable for hosting hate speech and the amplification of domestic terrorism. He intends to take on the powerful National Rifle Association gun lobby group and implement a mandatory national buyback program for banned assault weapons and a voluntary buyback program for handguns.\n\nSenator Cory Booker, another Democratic presidential candidate and O'Rourke's rival, had previously announced that he would create a White House office to combat white supremacy and hate crimes if elected. The race for the Democratic nomination is heating up, with candidates presenting their platforms and policies in an effort to secure the party's nomination and challenge Trump in the upcoming election.",
    " Title: Senate Health Care Bill Negotiations: GOP Senators Express Doubts, Bipartisan Approach Suggested\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of interviews on Sunday, several Republican senators expressed doubts about the current health bill aimed at repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) stated that the bill is \"probably going to be dead.\"\n\nSen. McCain's comments came during an appearance on CBS's Face the Nation. He said, \"My view is that it's probably going to be dead.\" Support for the bill has been eroding during the July 4th recess, and McCain suggested that Republicans should work with Democrats to craft health care legislation.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had floated this possibility last week, stating, \"No action is not an alternative.\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) reiterated his push to simply repeal Obamacare, let it go into effect for a year or two, and use that time to debate replacement.\n\nRepublicans need at least 51 votes to pass their repeal and replace proposal, and they haven't been able to get there. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he would support the current proposal, but expressed uncertainty about whether Republicans can come together to pass it.\n\nGraham said, \"Mitch is trying. I would support the proposal before us, but you've got different camps in the Republican Party.\" He added that with insurers dropping out of exchanges and premiums soaring, the failure of Obamacare is inevitable. Graham suggested that if the current bill fails, a bipartisan approach should be taken to replace it.\n\nPresident Trump took to Twitter later on Sunday to prod senators along, writing, \"For years, even as a 'civilian,' I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance!\"\n\nThe current health bill negotiations are facing several challenges, with key issues such as Medicaid expansion, subsidies for low-income Americans, and protections for people with pre-existing conditions still on the table. The Senate is expected to take up the bill after the July 4th recess.",
    " Title: White House Installs Senior Aides at Federal Agencies to Maintain Control Over Policy Implementation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House is installing senior aides atop major federal agencies, creating a direct line with loyalists who can monitor and shape the administration's goals across the federal bureaucracy. These aides, given the title of senior adviser in each agency, have been responsible for hiring at some departments and crafting the blueprint of Trump policy before the Cabinet members win Senate confirmation to take office.\n\nThe arrangement, described by four people involved in the transition planning, appears designed to help the White House maintain control over its priorities despite pledging to give Cabinet secretaries unusual autonomy. Having senior advisers reporting to both the agency chiefs and the White House could spur early tensions and create conflicts with that pledge of autonomy.\n\n\"They want to keep kind of a West Wing-infused attachment to the agencies,\" said a person familiar with the arrangement. \"There will be tentacles from the White House to these agencies.\" The effort is to demonstrate that all points lead back to certain people, such as Donald Trump's son-in-law, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, or chief of staff Reince Priebus.\n\nAnother person involved in the transition said Trump's team wanted a \"real strong line at the agencies to have someone monitoring and directing what they're doing.\" This approach bears out in the administration's picks for these posts, people who are far more political players than policy experts.\n\nFor instance, Wells Griffith will serve as the White House's new senior adviser for the Department of Energy, following stints as the battleground states director for Trump's campaign and as the former deputy chief of staff to Priebus at the Republican National Committee. Other campaign staffers have been given similar roles at several agencies, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nHistorically, the liaison positions are held by more junior staffers. Administrations typically left the bigger tasks, such as the policy agenda or management of the agency, to the Cabinet secretary, deputy secretary, and chief of staff.\n\nPrior administrations have used liaisons to help coordinate low-level policy, staffing, and operations between the White House and Cabinet agencies. President Barack Obama had them across the government for policy areas such as climate change and health care. They often gave the White House a lens into the agency and some understanding of the day-to-day operations, along with keeping tabs on their problems.\n\nWhat's different about the Trump hierarchy is the power these advisers are likely to have, according to people familiar with it. Obama's liaisons were often less powerful, while Trump's will connect directly to senior White House officials such as Kushner and Rick Dearborn, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy.\n\nIn Trump's Cabinet, a number of the secretaries have expressed disagreement with Trump during lengthy confirmation hearings on issues ranging from Russia to climate change to the use of NATO. Some of the picks were neutral in the election or criticized Trump's policies.\n\nTwo people involved in the transition said the new advisers are expected to maintain constant contact with the White House and the agencies and sign off on major decisions. The liaisons will also give the White House a window into agencies where Trump is not as personally close to the Cabinet secretaries. Some of the senior White House advisers in the agencies have frequently met with their respective secretaries, who did not pick them for the post.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said he modeled his own government that way, with a handpicked senior aide installed in every agency. \"I told my commissioners when I was mayor, you're going to have a spy in your agency,\" Giuliani said. \"I'm going to want to get two different perspectives of what's going on.\"\n\nThe jobs have rattled Obama administration political appointees, who have been surprised at young campaign hands having such authority at federal agencies. The advisers at each agency will not face Senate approval, like more than 1,200 other federal government positions, including deputy secretaries and administrators.\n\nTrump himself is likely to have little involvement in the minutiae of the agencies; people close to him expect him to want top-level briefings and little else. He tends to like conflict among his top aides and advisers, with them competing for his attention and respect.\n\n\"The government is too big to run everything out of the White House,\" added Stier. \"That pipeline is too small to deal with the breadth and complexity of the federal government.\"\n\nTevi Troy, a former White House aide and deputy secretary at Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush, said there are potential upsides for these advisers. For instance, they are not likely to face subpoenas in the event of mishaps at the agencies.\n\nYet, they also could face tensions with the Cabinet secretaries for micromanaging or feel torn about where to spend the majority of their time, in the West Wing or at the agency itself.",
    " Title: Maryland Gubernatorial Candidate Doug Gansler Criticizes ACA Implementation in State\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the race to succeed outgoing Democratic Governor Martin O'Malley of Maryland, gubernatorial candidate Doug Gansler has taken a critical stance on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the state. Gansler, who is a Democrat and the current Attorney General of Maryland, has expressed his displeasure over the botched rollout of the ACA, particularly the chronic problems with Maryland's online enrollment platform.\n\nThe state's health care exchange, Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, has faced significant challenges, with fewer than 4,000 Marylanders enrolling in insurance plans by the end of November. The executive director of the state exchange resigned at the start of December.\n\nGansler, who is a candidate in the Democratic primary, has been vocal in his criticism of the state's ACA implementation, arguing that it has \"failed miserably\" and provided \"fodder for Republicans\" who want to scrap the ACA altogether. He has used the health care mess as a case in point to question the performance of Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination and the chair of the state panel on ACA implementation.\n\nGansler's criticism of Brown and the ACA implementation comes as the state is experiencing a unique Democratic primary contest for the governorship between two major candidates, one of whom was directly tasked with implementing a state health care exchange. The success or failure of Gansler's biting message could reveal the level of frustration or patience among rank-and-file Democrats with the progress of the ACA, a law that was intended to usher in a new era of activist government.\n\nGansler's campaign has faced its own challenges, including a recording that surfaced in The Washington Post, capturing Gansler dismissing Brown, who is black, for relying on his race as a campaign asset. Gansler's campaign called the recording a dirty trick. There was also a Post story on accusations that Gansler ordered his state trooper detail to violate traffic laws, a charge Gansler also chalked up to political skulduggery. Most embarrassing was an ABC News report featuring photos of Gansler at a raucous high school beach party featuring apparent underage drinking.\n\nBrown, meanwhile, has rolled up support from a host of unions and prominent elected officials, including O'Malley, Sens. Ben Cardin and Barbara Mikulski, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, and U.S. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer.\n\nGansler's ACA attacks have been met with criticism from Brown's campaign, with Justin Schall, Brown's campaign manager, describing Gansler's criticism as opportunistic and faulting Gansler for his absence from meetings related to health care reform.\n\nWhen asked about his ACA attacks, Gansler said he had a rough rollout due to political dirty tricks on the part of the Brown campaign, but called health care the real issue in the race. Brown declined Maryland \u2588\u2588\u2588's request for an interview and has generally shied away from engaging attacks from Gansler and others.",

The hearing, which will take place on Capitol Hill, will question witnesses about the constitutionality of the president's move to legalize nearly five million undocumented immigrants.\n\nChairman of the Committee, Bob Goodlatte, previewed the hearing on Fox News' The Kelly File, stating that Obama's executive amnesty is \"one of the largest unconstitutional power grabs by any president ever.\"\n\nThe witness list for Tuesday's hearing includes Ronald Rotunda, a professor at Dale E. Fowler School of Law, Jay Sekulow, the Chief Counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice, Thomas H. Dupree Jr., a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, and Marielena Hincapi, the Executive Director at the National Immigration Law Center.\n\nIn his prepared testimony, Sekulow argues that President Obama's recent action on immigration violates the Constitution. He contends that the action contradicts Congress's express and implied intent, and therefore violates the test articulated in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer. Sekulow also claims that by enacting a sweeping new program under the guise of \"prosecutorial discretion,\" President Obama has violated controlling precedent and defied clear instructions from his own attorneys at the Office of Legal Counsel.\n\nLast week, the Congressional Research Service determined that Congress does have the power to defund President Obama's executive amnesty action, despite the agency being primarily funded through fees. The Supreme Court has recognized that Congress may restrict agency discretion to allocate resources by putting restrictions in the operative statutes. If a statute were enacted which prohibited appropriated funds from being used for some specified purposes, then the relevant funds would be unavailable to be obligated or expended for those purposes.\n\nThe hearing is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. ET and can be watched live here.",
    " Title: Congress Approves Debt Ceiling Increase and Hurricane Aid in Bipartisan Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bipartisan move, Congress approved a budget and hurricane relief deal on Friday, brokered between President Donald Trump and top Democrats. The House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 316 to 90, with all 90 votes against coming from Republicans. The Senate had previously approved the bill on Thursday by a vote of 80-17.\n\nThe deal, which was agreed upon in an Oval Office meeting on Wednesday, raises the debt ceiling, funds the federal government through 8 December, and provides $15 billion for relief from Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas and Louisiana last month. The deal comes as Hurricane Irma bears down on Florida.\n\nThe deal was met with enthusiasm by Democrats, while many congressional Republicans, who have long been opposed to raising the debt ceiling without taking steps to reduce federal spending, were forced to grudgingly accept it.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney, who pitched the deal to congressional Republicans in a conference meeting on Friday morning, received a frosty welcome. Mnuchin, a former Democrat, and Mulvaney, a stalwart of the House Freedom Caucus before joining the Trump administration, made less than ideal surrogates.\n\nAt the meeting, Mnuchin provoked hissing and groans when he closed with a plea for members to \"vote for the debt ceiling for me.\" The meeting also got \"a little warm for Mulvaney at times\" according to Mark Walker, a North Carolina representative who noted that people in the room \"reminded him [of] some of the statements he had made in the past about relief packages tied to the debt ceiling.\"\n\nAfter leaving the meeting, Mulvaney dodged a question about whether he would have voted for the bill, choosing to praise Trump's decision to reach across the aisle.\n\nWith these must-pass measures out of the way, President Trump is expected to spend the coming months focusing on promoting his plans for major tax cuts. No bill has yet been introduced in Congress, but Trump has made several speeches touting his proposals to lower corporate taxes to as little as 15%.\n\nOn Friday morning, after tweets about Hurricane Irma and his frustration with Senate rules and the failure of healthcare reform, the president wrote: \"Republicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September. Needed now more than ever. Hurry!\"",

In a letter confirming Barr's testimony, Nadler wrote, \"In your tenure as Attorney General, you have engaged in a pattern of conduct in legal matters relating to the President that raises significant questions for this Committee.\"\n\nEarlier this week, four Department of Justice prosecutors resigned after top DOJ officials stepped in to soften their 7- to 9-year recommended sentence of Stone following a tweet by Trump about the case. Democrats called the move \"without precedent\" and sharpened their already simmering criticisms of Barr.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Barr \"ought to be ashamed and embarrassed and resign as a result of this action directly interfering in the independent prosecution of Roger Stone.\" He also said the controversy was yet another example of \"political interference by the president to alter the independent decisions of the Department of Justice.\"\n\nBarr, on ABC News Thursday, pushed back on Trump's tweet while also defending his handling of the Stone case. \"I'm gonna do what I think is right,\" he said, \"and you know, I can not do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.\"\n\nWhite House officials told Fox News that they knew Barr was doing the ABC interview but that they did not know what the AG would say. \"What Bill Barr REALLY means is that Trump\u2019s tweets saying the quiet part out loud are making it harder for him to do the crimes and cover-up,\" tweeted Jon Cooper, chairman of the anti-Trump organization Democratic Coalition.\n\nSome on the left have even called for Barr's impeachment, including MSNBC legal analyst Glenn Kirschner, who tweeted before the Stone developments last week that Barr has lied \"to Congress, he lied about the Mueller report, he refuses to investigate obvious crimes by the administration, he is conflicted out of many matters but refuses to recuse.\"\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., told CNN Wednesday that he would not rule out launching a new impeachment inquiry into Trump himself over the drama around Stone and Barr. \"We're not going to take our options off the table,\" he said. \"We want to work with him on prescription drugs, background checks, and infrastructure, but we're not going to let him just torch this democracy because he thinks that he's been let off once and we're not going to do something about it.\"\n\nOther prominent figures, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., liberal Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, and self-labeled conservative Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, have also called for Barr's impeachment. House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., condemned Barr on Thursday and called for an investigation but did not outright call for impeachment. Sen. Cory Booker joined calls for an investigation.\n\n\"Justice in America should not depend on your wealth and connections,\" Booker said in a tweet. \"I agree with [Schumer] \u2014 DOJ OIG should open an investigation into improper political interference in the Stone case.\"\n\nAt the same time, Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Chris Coons, D-Del., and Booker, among others, hit Barr in a joint statement on \"the politicization and maladministration of American immigration courts under President Donald Trump.\" The statement announced a letter they sent to Barr asking for documents on the matter.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have largely stuck by Barr. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., released a statement backing the AG on Thursday. \"President Trump, in selecting Bill Barr to be Attorney General, has done a great service to the people serving in the Department of Justice and our nation as a whole,\" Graham said. \"He is the right man at the right time to reform the Department and stand up for the Rule of Law. Attorney General Barr has my complete confidence.\"",

The disagreement was initiated when Kelly criticized Trump for limiting his interviews to Hannity, stating that such a practice does not broaden the political discourse.\n\nDuring her television show, The Kelly File on Wednesday night, Kelly commented, \"Donald Trump, with all due respect to my 10 o'clock colleague, will go on Hannity and pretty much only Hannity these days, which doesn't exactly expand the tent.\"\n\nHannity responded to Kelly's statement on Twitter, writing, \"@megynkelly you should be mad at @HillaryClinton Clearly you support her. And @realDonaldTrump did talk to you.\"\n\nSean Hannity (@seanhannity) @megynkelly you should be mad at @HillaryClinton Clearly you support her. And @realDonaldTrump did talk to you. https://t.co/vsQiNMgHut\n\nThis exchange is the latest drama at the conservative-leaning cable news channel, which has been embroiled in internal dissension since the revelation that longtime CEO Roger Ailes had allegedly engaged in serial sexual harassment over decades. Ailes' resignation in July marked the end of his 21-year tenure at the network, which he co-founded in 1996. Ailes has since become an informal adviser to the Trump campaign.\n\nKelly herself became a campaign issue in the summer of 2015 after moderating the first Republican primary debate. Trump took issue with her tough questioning and, in an interview on CNN the following day, made what was widely interpreted as a reference to menstruation when he suggested she \"had blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of wherever.\" The ensuing uproar led Trump to be banned from a major gathering of conservatives and sparked the biggest crisis of his campaign up to that point.\n\nSince then, Kelly has continued to be a target of Trump, who called her \"crazy Megyn\" in March and even tweeted at her during Tuesday's vice-presidential debate. In contrast, Hannity has appeared in an advertisement for Trump and consistently speaks of the Republican nominee in glowing terms. Trump has appeared in numerous one-on-one primetime interviews with the Fox News host and even cited Hannity as a character witness in the first presidential debate.\n\n\"Nobody called Sean Hannity,\" Trump complained when asked why there was no evidence for his claims that he had opposed the second Iraq war (in fact, Trump is on record stating he supported the invasion of Iraq in 2002).",

The move has enraged Democrats, who accused the Republican lawmakers of creating a potential security lapse by bringing electronics into the secure area.\n\nThe Republican lawmakers, who are not part of the impeachment committees, argue that they have a right to be informed about the proceedings under House rules. They claim that the impeachment inquiry into President Trump's communications with Ukraine, involving former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, is not following established precedents for impeachment proceedings.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, counter that Republicans on the impeachment committees can participate and ask questions, and that they have access to transcripts and information. They argue that the Republicans' actions on Wednesday were a breach of the secure room, known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility or SCIF.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat, threatened to bring ethics charges against the Republican protesters, and Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie G. Thompson asked the sergeant at arms to probe the breach. California Democrat Eric Swalwell said the problem was that lawmakers brought in electronic devices, which are usually banned.\n\nThe disruption came a day after a former U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, William Taylor, testified that President Trump made the release of military aid to Ukraine contingent on that country probing Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, who was on the board of directors of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Taylor also uncovered an \"irregular\" backchannel managed by Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani to push Ukraine into investigating the Bidens and 2016 election interference.\n\nRepublicans have argued that Taylor's testimony was \"contradicted\" by other witnesses who said there was no quid pro quo. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, said much of what Taylor said was second- and third-hand information.\n\nIn response to the developments, the committees leading the impeachment probe issued a new demand for State Department documents, including text messages from witnesses and any memos regarding efforts to press Ukraine to open investigations. Meanwhile, three Democratic senators filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Justice Department for documents related to Ukraine. A federal judge also ordered the State Department to begin releasing Ukraine-related documents within 30 days. These documents include communications between Giuliani and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.",
    " Title: Senator Rand Paul Addresses Temperament and Interview Controversies in Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Rand Paul, a Republican presidential candidate, acknowledged on Wednesday the need to \"get better at holding my temper\" after a series of contentious interviews with reporters, including a clash with \"Today\" show anchor Savannah Guthrie and a heated exchange with CNBC anchor Kelly Evans earlier this year.\n\nPaul, who announced his presidential bid on Tuesday, admitted to CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he has been short-tempered with both male and female reporters, contradicting previous claims of targeting female journalists.\n\n\"I think I've been universally short-tempered and testy with both male and female reporters,\" he said. \"I'll own up to that.\"\n\nThe senator attributed his testiness to the challenging nature of being interviewed, particularly when facing only a camera and not being able to see the reporter, especially in hostile interviews.\n\n\"I do think interviews should be questions and not editorializing. You feel somewhat at a loss at the other end,\" he added, showing a hint of contrition.\n\nPaul's combative day began with a contentious interview with Guthrie, where the discussion turned when she detailed what she perceived as shifts in his foreign policy views over the years. Paul, speaking by satellite from Nashua, New Hampshire, attempted to interject, stating, \"Why don't you let me explain instead of talking over me, OK?\"\n\nWhen Guthrie persisted in asking about his stance on Iran, Paul contended that she had editorialized. \"Listen, you've editorialialized,\" he said. \"Let me answer a question. You ask a question, and you say, 'Have your views changed?' instead of editorializing and saying my views have changed.\"\n\nLater in the day, Paul bristled at a question about abortion while talking with reporters in New Hampshire. He referred to the Democratic National Committee, stating, \"Why don't you ask the DNC, 'Is it OK to kill a seven-pound baby in the uterus?'\"\n\nHis comment came after The Associated Press published a report that said Paul had ducked questions about his views on abortion exceptions. Paul has previously supported measures that included exceptions for situations like rape and incest, as well as measures without those exceptions.\n\nIn February, Paul clashed with CNBC anchor Kelly Evans, chastising her for posing \"slanted\" questions. When Evans tried to press him on a proposed corporate tax holiday, Paul shushed her.\n\nPaul offered Evans a suggestion on how she might conduct a better interview, stating, \"So, frankly, I think if we do this again, you need to try to start out with a little more objectivity going into the interview.\"\n\nWhen asked about his testy interview with Guthrie later on Wednesday, Paul decried questions about the apparent changes in his positions. \" 'O.K., well we understand that you've been beating your wife for years and you've flip-flopped on 25 different issues and you used to believe this and you used to believe that,'\" he told the New York Times. \"That is not journalism.\"",
    " Title: Obama Administration Announces New Policy to Defer Deportation of Certain Illegal Immigrant Students\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has elicited widespread praise from Democrats, Latino leaders, and illegal immigrant students, the Obama administration announced a new policy on Friday that will defer the deportation of certain illegal immigrant students. The policy shift, which has been met with criticism from Republicans, aims to lift the threat of deportation for large numbers of illegal immigrant students who meet specific criteria.\n\nAccording to administration officials, the impetus for the change came from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who approached the White House in mid-May with a plan to use existing laws to implement the policy. Napolitano's shift comes after increasing criticism from Latino and immigrant advocates who felt she was thwarting the president's policies.\n\nSince his first campaign in 2008, President Obama had pledged his support for the Dream Act, a proposal before Congress that would provide a path to legal status for illegal immigrant students. The new policy is seen as a step towards fulfilling that promise.\n\nA significant hurdle in implementing the policy was resistance from career staff members and enforcement agents at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to a policy adopted a year ago. This policy required them to use prosecutorial discretion in picking and choosing among illegal immigrants facing deportation, a practice that was new to immigration officers.\n\nThe National ICE Council, a union representing deportation agents, openly questioned the policy, stating that its members had not been consulted and that they faced serious risks in distinguishing among immigrants who had violated the law. A review of more than 411,000 deportation cases before the nation's immigration courts showed that by this month, prosecutors had halted the deportation of only 593 illegal immigrant students.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican whose star is rising in his party, was close to introducing a bill to help illegal immigrant students by giving them a temporary status, similar to the White House's proposal. White House officials feared that Rubio's proposal would pre-empt the president, making it appear he did not want to work with Republicans.\n\nThe White House is also awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court on the administration's lawsuit against Arizona over a tough state immigration enforcement law. The ruling is expected any day, and a negative decision could leave President Obama without a significant policy achievement when he tries to mobilize Latino voters for the November election.\n\nA major concern for President Obama, White House officials said, was whether he had legal authority to offer relief to so many immigrants. In recent weeks, the White House counsel, Kathryn Ruemmler, and Homeland Security lawyers pored over the law and concluded they were on firm ground. The main point, the officials said, was that the policy would have to be carried out case by case, meaning the workload for the immigration bureaucracy would be substantial.\n\nUnder the policy, officials are to exercise discretion in deferring deportations of immigrants who qualify for two years. A grant of deferred action, as it is formally known, allows immigrants to apply for work permits. To be eligible, they must be 30 or younger and have come to the United States before they were 16. They must be in school or high school graduates or military veterans, with no criminal records.\n\nPresident Obama has been hearing often from exasperated Democratic lawmakers. Senator Durbin, who first introduced the Dream Act 11 years ago, said he advised the president recently that he would not be able to muster enough votes in the Senate to pass the bill before the November election. In a vote in late 2010, the Dream Act was blocked by Republicans in the Senate.\n\n\"Meanwhile,\" Mr. Durbin said, \"we were getting calls every week saying that young people were being deported. We would jump in and save them. But there was anger and uncertainty and fear among them.\"\n\nMr. Durbin said he had urged Mr. Obama to \"do something much more sweeping.\" Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a leading Hispanic Democrat, also prodded the White House. The Democratic leaders' message found a sympathetic hearing from Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, a former immigration reform advocate who is a senior White House adviser to Mr. Obama.\n\nIn the end, the policy shift came quickly, White House officials said, with President Obama making his choice early last week, leaving officials scrambling to prepare the logistics in time for his announcement on Friday. The White House agreed that Ms. Napolitano would make the initial statements. Later, President Obama went before the news cameras in the White House Rose Garden.\n\n\"As long as I'm president,\" Mr. Obama vowed, \"I will not give up on this issue.\" He called it \"the right thing to do.\"",
    " Title: \"Democrats Address 'Are You Better Off?' Question at 2012 National Convention\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Democratic National Convention commences in Charlotte, North Carolina, the age-old question, \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\" is once again a subject of intense debate. This classic query, famously posed by then-candidate Ronald Reagan in 1980, has resurfaced as Democrats gather to nominate their candidate for the 2012 presidential election.\n\nOver the weekend, Democratic Governor Martin O'Malley provided an opening for the Republicans when he answered the \"are you better off\" question during an interview with CBS News' Bob Schieffer, stating, \"No, but that's not the question of this election. The question, without a doubt, we are not as well off as we were before George Bush...\"\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan swiftly responded, stating, \"President Obama can't tell you that you are better off. Simply put, the Jimmy Carter years look like the good old days compared to where we are right now.\"\n\nDemocrats promptly offered some clarifications. Vice President Joe Biden, speaking in Detroit, told supporters, \"You want to know whether we're better off? I got a little bumper sticker for you. Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive! Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive!\"\n\nMuch more is expected to be said about this topic between now and late Thursday evening, when the president is set to accept his party's nomination. As during last week's Republican National Convention in Tampa, NPR is helping out our friends on the NPR Elections Desk with some blogging from the Democratic convention. Eyder is in Charlotte this week, filing for NPR's It's All Politics blog.

    " Title: Attorney General Holder Recuses Himself from AP Leak Investigation, Launches IRS Scrutiny Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press conference on Tuesday, Attorney General Eric Holder announced his recusal from the ongoing national security leak investigation involving the Associated Press (AP) and the subsequent probe into the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scrutiny of conservative political groups. Holder's comments mark the first official response from the Justice Department regarding the twin Obama administration scandals that have recently come to light.\n\nThe Justice Department, and Holder himself, are currently under increasing pressure as the twin inquiries continue to unfold. This pressure is expected to escalate on Wednesday, as Holder is set to appear before Congress for previously scheduled hearings that have been reoriented to address the recent developments.\n\nIn the AP leak case, Holder described the story that sparked the investigation as \"a very, very serious leak,\" but revealed Tuesday that he had recused himself from the investigation due to his prior involvement. Holder had been interviewed by the FBI as part of the initial inquiry, leading him to step aside \"out of an abundance of caution.\"\n\n\"I was one of the people who had knowledge of this matter,\" Holder said. \"I have frequent contact with the media.\" He added that he stepped aside \"to try to make sure this was independent and to avoid even the possibility of the appearance of a conflict.\"\n\nThe decision to subpoena AP phone records was made by Deputy Attorney General James Cole, according to a Justice Department official who requested anonymity. The leak probe was initiated following an AP story last May about a counter-terrorism investigation in Yemen that involved efforts to bomb an aircraft headed for the United States.\n\nHolder stated that the leak warranted an aggressive response from the federal government. \"I have to say this is among, if not the most serious, among the top two or three most serious leaks I have ever seen. It put the American people at risk,\" he said.\n\nRegarding the IRS scandal, Holder announced on Friday that he had launched an investigation into the agency's actions targeting Tea Party-related groups. He described the IRS actions as \"outrageous and unacceptable\" and stated that the FBI was coordinating with the Justice Department to determine if any laws were broken.\n\nIn a letter to the Associated Press on Monday, Deputy Attorney General James Cole defended the decision to seek the AP's phone records. The Justice Department remains supportive of a shield law to protect journalists, Holder added.",
    " Title: Trump's Twitter Tirade: A Shift from War on Terror to War on Women\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a span of 48 hours last week, the national discourse underwent a significant shift from the War on Terror to the War on Women, following a series of tweets from Donald Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner. Tara Setmayer, former communications director for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-California) and a CNN political commentator, offers her analysis on the matter.\n\nLast week, Trump's tweet threatening to \"spill the beans\" on rival Ted Cruz's wife came at a time when the world was still reeling from the latest ISIS terrorist attack in Brussels. The timing was particularly unfortunate, as it coincided with Trump's own struggles in the foreign policy arena.\n\nDuring a speech to the pro-Israel group AIPAC, Trump's lack of foreign policy knowledge was criticized, and he raised eyebrows when he refused to rule out the use of nuclear weapons to fight ISIS and suggested the United States should pull back its role in NATO. Belgium, a member of NATO, and whose headquarters are in Brussels, was the target of Trump's misstep.\n\nIn the Utah caucuses that followed, Cruz handily defeated Trump, 69% to 14%. Although Trump won Arizona, he has yet to secure over 50% in any state thus far. Cruz, the only candidate to beat Trump in multiple contests, has done so twice.\n\nThe Twitter war that ensued between Trump and Cruz can be seen as a response to Trump's defeat in Utah. Some argue that Trump was defending his wife, as spouses are supposed to be off-limits in elections. However, Trump's history of attacking women raises questions about the true motivation behind his actions.\n\nTrump's reaction to the Melania photo was more about distraction than a noble act of chivalry, according to Setmayer. It was a direct assault against all women and young girls who are often harshly and unfairly judged by their looks. Trump's behavior sends a troubling message coming from a presidential front-runner.\n\nTrump's history of insulting women is well-documented, with comments such as calling women disgusting, fat pigs, and bimbos, and remarks about dropping to their knees and having a nice piece of a * * on his arm. Trump's treatment of women has been a recurring issue, with 73% of registered female voters in the United States holding an unfavorable view of Trump, according to a recent CNN poll.\n\nTrump's latest antics demonstrate once again that he lacks the temperament, judgment, and common decency to be President of the United States, according to Setmayer. As the race for the GOP nomination continues, it remains to be seen whether Trump will pivot towards becoming more presidential and unifying the party.",
    " Title: Hewitt Outlines Suggestions for Future Republican Elections, Debates, and Conventions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the annual RedState Gathering in Denver, Colorado, conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt outlined several suggestions for the future of Republican elections, debates, and conventions.\n\nOne of Hewitt's proposals is to end open primaries. He argued that political parties are vehicles for change in government and should be protected, and that allowing non-party members to participate in the process of deciding presidential candidates could lead to chaos.\n\nSecond, Hewitt suggested that the Republican National Convention should be permanently located in either Cleveland or Denver, two swing states that have successfully hosted the event in the past. He praised the execution of the 2016 Republican Convention in Cleveland, while criticizing the Democratic convention and previous Republican conventions in Minnesota, Tampa Bay, and New York City. Hewitt argued that planning early and getting organized is key to executing a successful convention.\n\nThird, Hewitt emphasized the benefits of holding the Republican convention early in the election cycle, citing advantages in campaign finance and messaging for the 2020 election.\n\nLastly, Hewitt touched upon the media, praising CNN for its professionalism but expressing a desire for more conservative moderators to lead future debates. He questioned why mainstream media figures should be the ones to moderate debates, and suggested that conservative media personalities such as Katie Pavlich, Ed Morrissey, or Guy Benson could do a better job. Hewitt also questioned the need for the Commission on Presidential Debates, comparing it to a dinosaur in the process.\n\nHewitt described the current election cycle as a transition year, and argued that conservatives should take control of the debates to better represent their views and nominees. He also pointed out that the high ratings for the debates during the 2016 election cycle, with the exception of the CNBC debate, demonstrate the appeal of conservative debates to viewers.",
    " Title: Rep. Chris Collins Resigns Ahead of Insider Trading Hearing, Leaving New York's 27th District Seat Vacant\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Chris Collins (R-NY) has announced his resignation from Congress, effective Tuesday, following a change of plea hearing related to insider trading charges. The New York Republican submitted a resignation letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday, which will be read on the House floor during a pro forma session the following day.\n\nCollins, who had previously entered a not guilty plea in his federal criminal fraud case, is scheduled for a hearing Tuesday afternoon, raising the possibility he could agree to a deal offered by federal prosecutors. The hearing is set for 3 p.m. before Judge Vernon Broderick of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nCollins faces eight counts of federal criminal charges, including conspiracy to commit securities fraud, securities fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and false statements. His trial is scheduled for Feb. 3.\n\nCollins, along with his son, Cameron, and Stephen Zarsky, the father of Cameron's future fianc\u00e9e, are alleged by federal prosecutors to have engaged in an insider trading scheme involving an Australian biotechnology company\u2014Innate Immunotherapeutics. Collins, who was on the company's board, allegedly provided nonpublic information to his son about confidential drug test results, paving the way for Cameron Collins and others to trade on that privileged information before the public could.\n\nSince being indicted in August 2018 on fraud charges, half of Collins' full-time staff has left the office. Seven of 14 full-time staffers are no longer working in the office, according to payroll records from May 2019, the most recent filing available at the Legislative Resource Center. Those who departed include his deputy chief of staff, Michael Kracker, communications director Sarah Minkel, and health policy adviser, Charlotte Pineda.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, would set the date of a special election if he were to call one before November 2020. For such an election, county party officials would select their respective party's nominees.\n\nCollins, one of President Donald Trump's earliest backers in the House GOP conference, hails from the deep-red 27th District in Western New York. Trump won the seat by 25 points in 2016, but Collins won reelection by less than half a percentage point last fall against Democrat Nate McMurray, the supervisor of the town of Grand Island.\n\nMcMurray, who is seeking a rematch against Collins, said in a statement Monday that \"the real victims of Collins' crimes are the people of his district that he repeatedly lied to about his guilt.\"\n\nCollins' exit could boost Republicans' chances of holding onto the seat, given its partisan lean. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales has changed its race rating from Leans Republican to Solid Republican.\n\nSeveral GOP candidates are likely to run for Collins' seat, whether for a special election or for a full term in 2020. A trio of Republicans had already jumped in the race to challenge Collins, who, until Monday, had been non-committal about running for reelection.\n\nGOP State Sen. Chris Jacobs had the most cash on hand at June 30, the end of the second fundraising quarter, with nearly $748,000. He also loaned his campaign $325,000. Collins had claimed Jacobs was a \"Never Trumper\" for dodging questions in 2016 about his support for the president, but Politifact found that claim was false. GOP state Sen. Rob Ortt and Beth Parlato\u2014an Afghanistan War veteran and attorney\u2014were also in the race.\n\nThe Republican field could grow with Collins' departure. Two sources said another potential candidate to watch is Erie County Comptroller and former local television news reporter Stefan Mychajliw, who has been making the rounds at GOP events. State Assemblyman Steve Hawley is another potential candidate.\n\n\"There are candidates who I think will be in before we get off the phone. Things are moving fast,\" said GOP consultant Michael Caputo, who advised Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Caputo said Monday that he was launching an effort to draft Army veteran and local radio host David Bellavia for the seat, although Caputo would not rule out running himself if Bellavia chose not to run.\n\nBellavia, who was recently awarded the Medal of Honor for his service in the Iraq War, is often mentioned as a potential candidate in the district, although it is not clear if he is interested in running. He ran for the seat in 2012, losing to Collins in the GOP primary\u2014while winning a majority of the counties in the district. Bellavia discussed the 27th District race with Trump when he was awarded the Medal of Honor in June, according to a source with knowledge of their discussion. Bellavia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDemocrat Nate McMurray may not be alone on the Democratic side in an open-seat race. Erie County Democratic Party Chairman Jeremy Zellner said in a phone interview that he was already hearing from Democrats who could be interested in running, but he noted that the party is \"laser-focused\" on next month's election for county executive.\n\n\"This district has always been a challenge for Democrats... We're looking for the strongest person who represents that community,\" Zellner said.",
    " Title: Senate Prepares for Partisan Clash as Impeachment Trial Procedures are Set to Unfold\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Senate prepares for a potential impeachment trial, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York, has called for the inclusion of senior White House officials as witnesses. This demand marks the second day of a partisan clash over the trial's procedures.\n\nThe Senate's proceedings are set to unfold amidst a significant week in Congress, with lawmakers returning to the Capitol on Monday. On Tuesday, they are scheduled to vote on a $1.4 trillion spending bill to prevent a government shutdown. On Thursday, they are expected to approve a new North American trade pact to replace NAFTA.\n\nWednesday, however, will see a crucial vote on the impeachment articles against President Donald Trump. A dozen moderate Democrats have yet to announce their voting decision, with only two Democrats indicating they will vote against impeachment. Representative Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota and Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey have signaled their intention to vote no. Notably, Representative Van Drew plans to switch parties, becoming a Republican either before or just after the vote, potentially affecting his re-election prospects in his swing district.\n\nOn Wednesday, the House will vote on the recommendations contained in the Judiciary Committee report. This report, reminiscent of similar documents from the impeachment inquiries involving Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton, offers a detailed argument for the two articles of impeachment the committee approved. The report does not provide new allegations or evidence, but it does offer a comprehensive defense of the charges, which allege that Mr. Trump abused the power of the presidency to tarnish political rivals and obstructed Congress by blocking witnesses from testifying and refusing to provide documents.\n\nThe report concludes, \"President Trump has placed his personal, political interests above our national security, our free and fair elections, and our system of checks and balances. He has engaged in a pattern of misconduct that will continue if left unchecked. Accordingly, President Trump should be impeached and removed from office.\" The Senate trial is expected to begin early next year.",
    " Title: US President Trump and Democrats Clash Over Ukraine Inquiry as Impeachment Proceedings Intensify\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange during a joint press conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6, US President Donald Trump lashed out at congressional Democrats after they vowed to summon the White House to produce documents this week in relation to the administration's dealings with Ukraine. The committees are demanding documents concerning the ongoing impeachment inquiry, which centers on a phone call between Mr. Trump and the Ukrainian president.\n\nDuring the press conference, Mr. Trump accused Democratic leaders of dishonesty and even treason. He directed much of his anger towards House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, calling him \"shifty Schiff,\" a \"lowlife,\" and stating he \"should resign from office in disgrace.\" He added, \"Frankly, they should look at him for treason.\"\n\nThe president also targeted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, accusing Democrats of focusing on \"BULLSHIT\" and describing San Francisco, her hometown, as a \"tent city\" of homeless people.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry, which may seek to remove Mr. Trump from office, stems from a whistleblower's complaint about his 25 July phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the call, Mr. Trump pressed for an investigation of his Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son, who worked for a Ukrainian gas firm that faced allegations of corruption.\n\nAs vice-president and the Obama administration's point man on Ukraine, Mr. Biden threatened to withhold US loan guarantees to the country unless it fired its top prosecutor, at a time when Hunter Biden's employer had been under official scrutiny. However, European countries and international bodies had also wanted Viktor Shokin fired, accusing him of failing to clamp down on corruption.\n\nThe Ukrainian prosecutor general who took over from Mr. Shokin has told the BBC there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. However, questions were raised at the time about a potential conflict of interest for the US vice-president.\n\nDemocrats have pointed out that Mr. Trump's call with the newly elected Mr. Zelensky took place at the same time as the US president decided to withhold military aid from Ukraine. From what has been shared of the call so far, Mr. Trump did not directly reference withholding aid, but a full verbatim transcript has not been made available.\n\nMr. Trump's opponents say he was pressuring a vulnerable American ally to interfere in the 2020 US election for the US president's personal benefit. Democrats have accused the White House of blocking congressional inquiries and refusing to respond to record requests, which has prompted the subpoena threat this week.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings said in a memo, \"I do not take this step lightly. Over the past several weeks, the committees tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents, but the White House has refused to engage with - or even respond to - the committees.\" The subpoena will request documents on Mr. Trump's call with Ukraine and any related items from acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nIn response to the subpoena, Mr. Trump has threatened litigation, stating, \"This country has to find out who this person was, because that person's a spy, in my opinion.\" He also criticized the whistleblower and the impeachment inquiry as a \"hoax\" and a \"fraudulent crime on the American people.\"\n\nThe impeachment process, if the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, will proceed to a trial in the Senate. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict, an unlikely outcome given that Mr. Trump's party controls the chamber. Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted and removed.",
    " Title: Trump Proposes Creation of Space Force as Sixth Military Branch, Sparking Debate and Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday announced his intention to establish a sixth branch of the military, focusing on space exploration and defense. The proposal, which has been met with both support and criticism, could potentially restructure the current space-related military activities, primarily overseen by the Air Force.\n\nDuring a meeting of his National Space Council, Trump emphasized the need for American dominance in space, stating, \"It is not enough to merely have an American presence in space. We must have American dominance in space.\"\n\nThe President's vision includes a 'Space Force' that would operate alongside the Air Force, a concept that has been suggested in the past, with proponents arguing it would streamline the Pentagon's operations. However, critics, including senior military officials, have expressed concerns about the potential impact on the Air Force and the efficiency of creating a new space branch.\n\nThe United States is a signatory to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, an international agreement that prohibits the stationing of weapons of mass destruction in space and restricts the use of celestial bodies for military purposes to peaceful exploration.\n\nThe proposal will require the approval of the U.S. Congress, a body currently divided on the issue. U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, expressed his opposition on Twitter, stating, \"Thankfully, the president can\u2019t do it without Congress because now is NOT the time to rip the Air Force apart. Too many missions at stake.\"\n\nThe Pentagon's policy board is set to prepare for the implementation of Trump's order, with Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White stating, \"Working with Congress, this will be a deliberate process with a great deal of input from multiple stakeholders.\"\n\nIn December, Trump signed a directive aimed at enabling astronauts to return to the moon and eventually embark on a mission to Mars. The U.S. first landed on the moon in 1969, marking the culmination of a decade-long space race between Washington and Moscow.\n\nSince then, U.S. efforts to explore beyond Earth's orbit have primarily focused on unmanned spacecraft, although the idea of sending humans back to the moon or further has been raised by various American presidents. The creation of a Space Force, if approved, could potentially change this trajectory.",
    " Title: Obama Announces Executive Actions to Tighten Firearms Laws, Draws Criticism from NRA\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that is expected to reignite the long-standing debate on gun control, President Barack Obama has announced his intention to tighten firearms laws through executive actions. The National Rifle Association (NRA), the country's most prominent gun-rights advocate, has criticized the move, labeling it a \"political stunt\" that fails to enhance public safety.\n\nOn Monday, President Obama is set to meet with Attorney General Loretta Lynch to discuss options aimed at curbing gun violence. The president has previously ordered his White House team to identify \"new actions\" he can take, following Congress's failure to act on gun control legislation.\n\nThe anticipated changes will reportedly require small-scale firearms sellers to submit background checks for potential buyers. However, these changes are not expected to completely close the so-called \"gun show loophole,\" which allows for firearm purchases at such venues without a check.\n\nThe president's decision comes in the aftermath of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a deranged gunman killed 20 children and six adults. Despite the tragedy, Obama's previous efforts to tighten gun laws in the aftermath of the massacre failed to garner enough support for passage from Senate Democrats and Republicans.\n\nNRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker responded late Saturday, stating, \"President Obama failed to pass his anti-gun agenda through Congress because the majority of Americans oppose more gun-control. Now he is doing what he always does when he doesn't get his way, which is defy the will of the people and issue an executive order.\"\n\nThe president's course of action is expected to follow recommendations from Everytown, the gun-control nonprofit led by billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. This action is likely to result in a rematch with the NRA, the group that led the successful attempt to defeat Obama's post-Sandy Hook efforts.\n\nIn a weekly address from Hawaii, Obama pointed out that his new plan follows the third anniversary of the Sandy Hook massacre. He emphasized, \"All across America, survivors of gun violence and those who lost a child, a parent, a spouse to gun violence are forced to mark such awful anniversaries every single day. Yet Congress still hasn't done anything to prevent what happened to them from happening to other families.\"\n\nExisting law states that those who sell guns with the \"principal objective of livelihood and profit\" have to get a dealer's license through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. This means they also have to conduct a background check on buyers no matter where they sell, including online or at a gun show. In 2014, the ATF proposed that federal officials be notified about lost firearms, but the gun industry successfully argued that voluntary reporting was sufficient.",
    " Title: The Ongoing Battle for Voting Rights in the United States: A Look at Alabama and Beyond\n\nArticle:\n\nThe right to vote, a cornerstone of any democratic society, has become a contentious issue in several states across the U.S., particularly in the five years since the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Shelby County v. Holder effectively weakened the Voting Rights Act. This article examines the efforts to suppress voting rights, particularly in Alabama, and the ongoing struggle to ensure equal access to the ballot box.\n\nIn Alabama, a state with a significant African American population, the state has, for a quarter-century, had all-white appellate court justices. This is due in part to the state's practice of at-large statewide elections for both appellate and Supreme Court judges, rather than district elections, where African American candidates might have a better chance of being elected. This practice, also used in Texas against Hispanic voters, is currently the subject of a lawsuit filed by the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP.\n\nBeyond at-large elections, Alabama has implemented several measures to restrict voting rights. These include requiring a photo ID to vote, closing driver's license offices disproportionately in black areas, imposing a \"proof of citizenship\" mandate for voter registration, and purging voting rolls. Some of these measures have been stalled by judicial decisions, but the effort to restrict the vote continues.\n\nAcross the country, Republican-led states are making voter registration more difficult and limiting voting days, while adopting measures to criminalize the activities of voter registration groups. Partisan gerrymandering is becoming more sophisticated, and hackable voting machines pose a threat to the integrity of elections. Closing polling stations forces some, disproportionately those from minority or low-income districts, to travel longer distances and wait in long lines to vote.\n\nTo counter these measures, massive citizen mobilization is necessary, along with the election of leaders who prioritize voting rights. In 2018, efforts to restrict the right to vote were met with a voter turnout not seen since 1914. In 2020, with the fundamental direction of the country at stake, another record turnout is crucial. Following the Democrats' majority in the House of Representatives in 2018, they passed HR 1, a comprehensive election and democracy reform bill. This bill, which includes same-day voter registration, limits the role of big money in elections, and curbs political gerrymanders, among other things, sits on the desk of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has refused to allow it to come to a vote.\n\nIf voters can overcome the obstacles designed to make voting difficult and vote in large numbers in 2020, fundamental democratic reform may finally become a reality.",
    " Title: Senate Immigration Debate Heats Up as Senators Clash Over Timing and Security Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Monday, top Democrats accused opponents of comprehensive immigration reform of exploiting the Boston Marathon bombings to slow or derail the bill. The bipartisan \"Gang of Eight\" bill, which aims to strengthen national security and address immigration reform, has been a topic of intense debate in recent weeks.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) urged restraint in using the Boston bombings to derail the bill, stating, \"Let no one be so cruel as to try to use the heinous attacks of these two young men last week to derail the dreams and futures of millions of hard-working people.\"\n\nLeahy emphasized that the bill would \"serve to strengthen our national security by allowing us to focus our border security and enforcement efforts against those who would do us harm.\" He also commended the efforts of local and federal law enforcement in the Boston area.\n\nHowever, Leahy's statement was met with a sharp response from the panel's top Republican, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). Grassley argued that opponents of immigration reform were not exploiting the Boston bombings but were ensuring that every aspect of the bill was thoroughly addressed.\n\nGrassley became visibly agitated later in the hearing when Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York) suggested that some were using the Boston tragedy as an excuse to delay or derail the bill. \"I never said that!\" Grassley yelled in response, interrupting Schumer.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) also sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) on Monday, urging a delay of any immigration legislation until more is learned about the alleged Boston bombers. Paul questioned why the current system allowed the alleged bombers to immigrate from an area known for Islamic extremism.\n\nThe White House Press Secretary, Jay Carney, dismissed Paul's concerns, arguing that comprehensive immigration reform would enhance security. The bill now under consideration would prevent undocumented residents from gaining legal status if they have been found guilty of felonies or more than two misdemeanors.\n\nMonday's hearing was the second by the Judiciary Committee on the nearly 900-page proposal. The first hearing, held last Friday, was also marked by several references to security fears raised by the recent bombings. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is scheduled to testify before the panel on Tuesday.\n\nAssuming the immigration bill clears Leahy's committee, full Senate consideration of the legislation will likely occur in June, according to multiple sources. A bipartisan group of legislators in the House of Representatives is also crafting its own immigration reform proposal.",
    " Title: Executive Actions on Immigration: A Year Later, Deportation Amnesty Stalled, but Other Measures Advance\n\nArticle:\n\nA year after President Obama announced a series of executive actions on immigration, the controversial Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) amnesty, which aimed to grant legal status to over 4 million illegal immigrants, remains stalled by the courts. However, the rest of the executive actions, which include a far-reaching set of priorities that effectively shields nearly all illegal immigrants from deportation, are moving forward.\n\nThe DAPA amnesty, often mislabeled as an executive order, has been halted by a federal appeals court, with its fate soon to be decided by the Supreme Court. The rest of the dozen actions announced on Nov. 20, 2014, are still advancing.\n\nRep. Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who was among the chief cheerleaders for the unilateral steps, stated, \"There are 7 or 8 or 9 million people who are now safe under the current policy. That is a victory to celebrate while we wait for the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe actions also included changes to the legal immigration system, such as making it easier for spouses of guest workers to find jobs, allowing foreigners who study science and technology at U.S. universities to remain and work in the country longer, and pushing legal immigrants to apply for citizenship.\n\nOn enforcement, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson announced changes that would let most rank-and-file illegal immigrants off the hook and instead focus deportation efforts on serious criminals, gang members, and other security threats. Deportations, which peaked at nearly 410,000 in fiscal year 2012, dropped to about 230,000 in fiscal year 2015.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is now focusing on convicted criminals, as per Johnson's instructions. If agents adhere strictly to his priorities, some 9.6 million of the estimated 11.5 million illegal immigrants in the country have no real danger of being deported, according to an estimate this year by the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nThe changes are already having a significant effect. Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of the institute's U.S. immigration policy program, stated, \"The enforcement priorities announced last year, if strictly enforced, do protect the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants from being deported, because most immigrants have been here a long time and haven't committed a serious crime.\"\n\nImmigrant rights activists are still waiting for the special circumstances to be applied more broadly. Jessica Vaughan, policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for stricter immigration controls, stated, \"It is tremendously harder now to deport even criminals, much less garden-variety illegal aliens. They have truly dismembered the immigration enforcement system, from the Border Patrol to the immigration courts.\"\n\nThe jewel of the executive actions was the deportation amnesty, which was delayed first by a federal district court in Texas and last week by an appeals court. Without the ability to grant work permits, these changes are less permanent and easier to undo than they would have been had the president been able to implement DAPA.\n\nMr. Obama stated he took the series of steps in response to inaction from Congress, where his push for a broad bill granting illegal immigrants a path to citizenship stalled in 2013. Frustrated by Republicans, Mr. Obama waited until after the 2014 elections, then announced his go-it-alone approach.\n\nHomeland Security has issued proposals to carry out the leniency program for illegal immigrant spouses and children of green-card holders and to allow foreign students in science and technology to stay longer. Both of those still need to be finalized, as does a proposal expanding hardship waivers. Other moves were easier to accomplish, such as Homeland Security now accepting credit card payments for citizenship fees.",
    " Title: White House Launches Renewed Push to Highlight Benefits of Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to refocus public attention on the benefits of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama will launch a three-week campaign on Tuesday, in collaboration with congressional Democrats and their allies. The campaign aims to rebuild public confidence in the healthcare law, which has been marred by the botched HealthCare.gov rollout over the past two months.\n\nThe White House will take the lead in emphasizing a different benefit each day until the Dec. 23 enrollment deadline for Jan. 1 coverage. The daily message will be amplified through press events and social media by Democratic members of Congress, the Democratic National Committee, congressional campaign committees, and advocacy organizations.\n\nThe renewed push comes as the White House believes that HealthCare.gov is now functioning adequately, following the self-imposed November 30th deadline for repairs. However, the website is not yet operating smoothly, and this messaging push will run alongside efforts to make further improvements to the insurance marketplace and to target key populations for enrollment.\n\nPresident Obama will not declare the website fixed during Tuesday's event. Instead, he will reiterate the theme he first pursued in October: Obamacare is more than a website. The benefits of the law, such as reduced costs for preventative care, coverage for those with preexisting conditions, and slowing growth in healthcare costs, will be highlighted.\n\nRepublicans are expected to continue their campaign to weaken the law, and officials have prepared for the Democratic offensive. However, Democrats argue that they need to draw a two-sided picture: Democrats delivering benefits, and Republicans trying to deny them. This, they believe, is what polling indicates will help them win over voters.\n\nThe renewed focus on Obamacare benefits is a political necessity for congressional Democrats, who will face voters in less than a year. If voters are not aware of the law's upside or can't remember it amidst the problems with the rollout, Democrats risk holding onto an anchor rather than a buoy.\n\nDemocratic leaders have welcomed the renewed White House push, emphasizing the potential consequences of Republican repeal. \"Every poll tells us that when we make that case, voters choose Democrats,\" said Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader McConnell Files Cloture on Police Reform Bill, Setting Vote Date\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has filed cloture on the Republican police reform legislation, setting an official date for the vote. The Senate will vote on the GOP's police reform bill, which requires 60 votes to pass. The legislation, introduced by McConnell and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, is a response to the killing of George Floyd and the ongoing protests.\n\nIn a press conference, Scott and McConnell outlined the key components of the bill. It includes a \"notification act\" to track no-knock warrants, anti-lynching legislation, and increased funding for body cameras. The legislation also aims to address police reform in a bid to find common ground between the two parties.\n\nMcConnell expressed hope that the Senate Democrats would support the bill, stating, \"I hope that whatever strange political calculations are making this difficult for our friends across the aisle will yield to common sense and to the American people's hunger for progress.\"\n\nSenator Scott has been appointed to lead the party's effort in passing a police overhaul bill before July 4. The South Carolina senator has ruled out including a revision to qualified immunity, a key measure supported by Democrats and others.\n\nA group of Republican senators, including Lindsey Graham (SC), Ben Sasse (NE), James Lankford (OK), John Cornyn (TX), and Shelley Moore Capito (WV), have collaborated on the bill. The Senate will vote on the legislation later this week, and the outcome will determine the progress of police reform in the United States.",
    " Title: TSA's Airport Security Performance Raises Questions About Effectiveness and Budget Allocation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent report by CNN, it was revealed that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) missed 95% of guns and bombs in airport security tests, raising concerns about the effectiveness and value of the $7 billion annual budget allocated to the TSA. However, a closer look at the data suggests that we may not need such a high level of airport security, as the risk of airplane terrorism appears to be relatively low.\n\nThe high failure rate in the TSA's security tests demonstrates that there is not much risk of airplane terrorism, and it is suggested that we should scale back airport security to pre-9/11 levels. A 95% failure rate is concerning, but a 20% failure rate may be sufficient to deter a sane terrorist, as they would be caught with a high probability if they attempt to evade security.\n\nThe TSA's previous excuses, such as the results being isolated to a single airport or not representative of realistic terrorist behavior, are no longer valid, as the current test was conducted at multiple airports, and the testers did not use advanced stealth techniques.\n\nThe high failure rate is likely due to a combination of factors, including the boredom of the security screening job, the high number of false alarms, and the limitations of current screening technologies. The TSA is failing to defend us against the threat of terrorism, but the good news is that there have been no successful terrorist attacks against airplanes since 9/11.\n\nThe TSA should conduct a thorough investigation into the causes of the high failure rate and take steps to improve the effectiveness of airport security. However, it is also important to recognize that the actual risk of airplane terrorism is relatively low, and we should not overspend on airport security.\n\nThe TSA should focus on implementing security measures that are effective against a wide range of potential threats, rather than relying on guesswork about the tactics and targets of terrorists. Vigilant passengers and good intelligence and investigation are crucial in preventing terrorist attacks, and we should prioritize these areas over airport security.\n\nIn conclusion, the TSA's high failure rate in airport security tests raises questions about the effectiveness and value of the $7 billion annual budget allocated to the TSA. While we should demand better results from the TSA, we should also recognize that the actual risk of airplane terrorism does not justify such a high budget. We should prioritize intelligence and investigation, as well as vigilant passengers, to prevent terrorist attacks.",
    " Title: Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia Expresses Optimism for Economic Recovery Post-COVID-19 Shutdowns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on \"America's Newsroom,\" Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia expressed optimism about the American economy's ability to rebound following the economic shutdowns enforced due to the coronavirus pandemic. Scalia likened the current situation to a war, stating, \"We are in a war, a war that has drawn on Americans across the country in a way I don't think we've seen since World War II.\"\n\nScalia attributed the United States' \"incredible productive capacity\" to its success in winning two world wars, and he believes this same spirit is aiding the country in slowing the spread of the coronavirus. He highlighted the contributions made by individuals at home, such as the iconic Rosie the Riveter, as well as the ingenuity, creativity, and energy in the private sector.\n\nMeanwhile, the ADP National Employment Report, released Wednesday, revealed that private employers slashed 20.2 million jobs in April. This represents the largest decline on record since the survey began in 2002, surpassing the previous record of 834,665 jobs lost in February 2009 during the Great Recession.\n\nAhu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute, stated, \"Job losses of this scale are unprecedented.\" The report, however, may understate the actual damage inflicted by the stay-at-home measures, as it is based on data collected through April 12.\n\nSince the virus outbreak began about two months ago, forcing most states to shutter nonessential businesses and direct residents to stay at home, 30 million Americans have filed for first-time jobless benefits. Job losses were concentrated heavily in the leisure and hospitality industry, with 8.6 million job losses reported in this sector despite businesses trying to compensate with delivery and takeout options.\n\nScalia noted that \"somewhere near 90 percent of people who have gone on unemployment said that they expect to return to their jobs.\" He expressed hope that the country can quickly return to the strong economy it had under the current administration's policies just weeks ago.",
    " Title: Romney Criticizes Obama's Economic Policies Amidst Continued Job Growth Decline\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 Channel, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney criticized President Obama's economic policies a day after the latest Labor Department report showed a decline in job growth in America. The report indicated that only 96,000 new jobs were created in August, with hundreds of thousands of Americans leaving the workforce.\n\nRomney, speaking to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Channel's Bret Baier in Sioux City, Iowa, expressed his displeasure with the latest job growth figure, stating, \"If you look over the last several quarters, last several years, you see the continued pattern which is that we are not creating the jobs we need to create to put Americans back to work.\"\n\nThe former Massachusetts governor argued that the Federal Reserve has exhausted its options, and that business-friendly policies from the White House are the key to turning around the sluggish economy. \"I don't think that there's any action that [the Federal Reserve is] going to take that will have an immediate impact on the economy,\" Romney said. \"And frankly, I think they have shot a lot of their monetary bullets, and those bullets are not able to strike at a target that makes a real difference for the American worker today.\"\n\nRomney also criticized President Obama's speech at the Democratic National Convention, stating that it lacked specifics and failed to address the economy and job growth. \"I was disappointed with the speech,\" Romney said. \"Of course, it has been a disappointing four years. There was nothing in the speech that gives confidence that the President knows what he is doing when it comes to jobs and the economy.\"\n\nThe unemployment rate did decrease slightly in August, but economists attribute this to a record number of Americans leaving the workforce. The labor force participation rate, which measures the proportion of the adult population that is either working or looking for work, fell to 63.5 percent, the lowest level in 31 years.\n\nRomney believes his private sector experience gives him an edge over Obama in the issue Americans care most about \u2013 the economy. He also laid out a five-point plan to create 12 million new jobs if elected, including taking \"full advantage\" of the nation's energy resources to achieve energy independence by 2020 and not catering to small businesses.\n\nThe upcoming debates will offer a chance for Romney to draw a sharp contrast between his vision and Obama's, as well as to clarify Democratic charges that he wants American automakers to go bankrupt. Romney also rejected claims that he showed a disregard for service members by not mentioning them in his acceptance speech in Tampa.\n\nWith just 60 days to go until the election, Romney said the choice will be clear for voters. \"I think people will make up their mind,\" Romney said. \"I can't tell you when everyone will settle down \u2013 the day before or day of the election. It's a horse race [between] two candidates who would take the country in different directions.\"",
    " Title: Obama to Campaign for Hillary Clinton, Aims to Boost Enthusiasm and Gain Positive Mandate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an effort to boost enthusiasm and secure a positive mandate for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama is preparing to campaign for her, emphasizing his transformation from a skeptic to a supporter, and urging voters to follow suit. The strategy is crucial, according to David Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager and current political adviser, to generate the intensity and passion needed to win not only the White House but also House and Senate races.\n\n\"You want people to feel as passionate about Hillary Clinton being president as they do about stopping Donald Trump. If this isn't a close race, it's still going to matter a great deal for her presidency,\" Plouffe stated.\n\nPresident Obama's message will be a key focus when he joins Clinton for a rescheduled joint rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, on July 5. Jen Psaki, White House communications director, explained, \"He can make the case as the highest profile convert to be her supporter.\"\n\nObama's campaigning will not only involve criticizing Donald Trump but also highlighting Clinton's qualifications and her vision for the country under her presidency. \"He will do that too,\" Psaki said, \"but he wants to spend most of his time making the strong, optimistic case for the country under a future President Clinton, and why she presents the best case to be his successor.\"\n\nThe Obama administration and Clinton's campaign are collaborating closely, with conversations led out of the West Wing and Brooklyn, respectively. The collaboration includes scheduling and logistics discussions, as well as the development of a calendar to maximize Obama's popularity beyond traditional Democratic demographics.\n\nObama and his aides believe they can appeal to skeptical sections of the base, particularly young, progressive, and anti-establishment voters who supported Bernie Sanders during the primary. The White House and the campaign maintain minimal contact to avoid leaks and potential legal issues, with Jennifer Palmieri, former White House communications director and senior Clinton adviser, serving as a key intermediary.\n\nPlouffe, Obama's 2012 campaign manager, and longtime political advisers such as David Axelrod and Jim Messina, are among those collaborating with the White House. Bill Clinton, who served as Obama's \"secretary of explaining stuff\" in 2012, is expected to play a similar role this year, emphasizing Clinton's character, integrity, and leadership style.\n\nThe White House is also finalizing the convention speech that will likely be Obama's last major political address, with the fall campaign calendar still under discussion. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney noted, \"Don't discount Bill [Clinton] either.\"\n\nThe strategy aims to persuade and mobilize voters, with Obama's popularity and charisma expected to play a significant role in the upcoming elections.",

Marco Rubio of Florida is trailing Donald Trump significantly in his home state, according to recent polls. The Marist/NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump leading Rubio with 43% to 22%, while Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is almost tied with Rubio at 21%. A separate CBS News 2016 Battleground Tracker poll shows Rubio slipping behind Cruz.\n\nIn Ohio, a similar situation is unfolding as Ohio Gov. John Kasich is locked in a tight race with Trump. The Marist survey shows Kasich holding the edge in the Buckeye State with 39% to Trump's 33%. The latest Quinnipiac poll shows Trump and Kasich tied in Ohio, with 38% each.\n\nBoth Kasich and Rubio need a win in their respective home states to keep their campaigns moving towards the GOP convention in July. Rubio's drop in the polls may indicate that his campaign is nearing its end.\n\nOn Sunday, Rubio continued to criticize the violence at Trump rallies, stating that Trump and protesters share the blame. Rubio said, \"You have a leading contender for president telling people in his audience, 'Go ahead and punch someone in the face. I'll pay your legal bills.' That's wrong if our kids did it. That's disastrous if a president does it.\" He also acknowledged that some of the protesters appeared to be paid.\n\nIn Ohio, Trump criticized Kasich for voting in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) while he was a congressman. Kasich faces a similar situation as Rubio, needing to win in his home state to keep his campaign headed towards the GOP convention.\n\nTrump leads the delegate count with 460, followed by Cruz with 370, Rubio with 163, and Kasich with 63. The three other states holding primaries on Tuesday are North Carolina (72 delegates), Missouri (52 delegates), and Illinois (69 delegates). Trump also leads in Illinois, with 38%, followed by Cruz at 34%, Kasich at 16%, and Rubio at 11%.\n\nOn the Democratic side, frontrunner Hillary Clinton has a big lead in Florida over rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 62-to-34%, according to the CBS poll. However, she leads Sanders by single digits in Ohio, 52-to-43%, and Sanders has a narrow 48-46% lead in Illinois.\n\nEarly voting in Florida's primary ends on Sunday, with more than 1.9 million voters having already made their presidential choice. Republican voters far outnumber Democratic ones, according to the latest figures released Sunday by the state Division of Elections. Republicans account for more than 1.1 million early voters, while about 819,000 Democrats have cast ballots. Early voters are projected to account for at least half the total number expected to vote in Tuesday's primary.

    " Title: State Department Faces Criticism for Lack of Security Risk Management at Foreign Missions, OIG Report Rejects Claims of Political Bias in Benghazi Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nA year after the devastating terrorist attacks in Benghazi, the State Department is still grappling with managing security risks at foreign diplomatic missions, according to a report released by the department's internal auditor on Wednesday. The report, a \"special review\" conducted by the State Department's Office of Inspector General, criticizes the department for lacking a systematic approach to enhancing security personnel at 27 high-risk posts, and highlights gaps in the department's ability to balance security needs with the necessity of engaging in volatile regions worldwide.\n\nThe report concludes that the State Department \"neither has a conceptual framework nor a process for risk management.\" It further states that there is no specific individual or office tasked with overseeing the assessment of risk in critical, high-threat locations.\n\nHowever, the report refutes claims made by prominent Republicans over the past year, who have argued that the Accountability Review Board (ARB) investigation, mandated by federal law following an attack on a U.S. diplomatic post overseas, was politically tainted and failed to hold anyone accountable for the security lapses in the Benghazi incident.\n\nIn September 2012, four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, were killed when armed Islamist terrorists attacked a poorly protected diplomatic outpost in Benghazi.\n\nOne of the most vocal critics has been Rep. Darrell E. Issa, a California Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, who has claimed that last year's ARB investigation fell short of uncovering the truth behind the security failures in Benghazi.\n\nWhile the Obama administration appointed longtime diplomat Thomas R. Pickering and retired Adm. Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to oversee the ARB investigation, Mr. Issa has claimed that the \"ARB was not fully independent.\"\n\n\"The panel did not exhaustively examine failures, and it has led to an unacceptable lack of accountability,\" Mr. Issa said in a statement earlier this month.\n\nThe OIG findings contradict these assertions, concluding instead that the \"Accountability Review Board process operates as intended \u2014 independently and without bias \u2014 to identify vulnerabilities in the Department of State's security programs.\"\n\nThe State Department swiftly responded to the findings. \"This independent report underscores that the partisan and political assault on the ARB must end,\" department spokesman Alec Gerlach said in an email to The \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"The IG looked at all 12 ARBs conducted between 1998 and 2012 and determined that the ARB process occurs 'independently and without bias.'\"\n\n\"Chairman Issa might want to read the report before he again slanders the independence and integrity of Admiral Mullen and Ambassador Pickering,\" Mr. Gerlach added. \"The IG also found that our response to the Benghazi ARB 'establishes a model for how the Department should handle future ARB recommendations,' noting that the level of attention of [Secretary of State John F. Kerry and former Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton] reflected their personal concern.\"\n\nThe OIG report, while praising the ARB process itself, found mixed results regarding the State Department's implementation of the recommendations made by the ARB. For instance, one of the ARB's key findings had called for boosting U.S. assets at high-risk posts where the host countries are incapable or unwilling to protect U.S. missions.\n\n\"The department's actions to date do not comply with this recommendation,\" Wednesday's OIG report states, concluding that while State Department standards reflect the quality of construction of posts, they don't address \"minimum security standards for occupancy or address requirements beyond construction standards.\"\n\nThe report, however, did credit former Secretary Clinton for taking a direct role in ensuring the Benghazi ARB recommendations were implemented, and stated that current Secretary Kerry is following through. \"The Benghazi ARB recommendations, when implemented, should significantly improve the department's ability to provide better security for U.S. diplomatic missions and employees,\" the report said.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush and Clint Bolick Propose Overhaul of U.S. Immigration Laws, Offering Legal Status but Not Citizenship to Undocumented Immigrants\n\nIn their new book, \"Immigration Wars,\" former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and co-author Clint Bolick propose a comprehensive overhaul of U.S. immigration laws. The book, which advocates for a more accessible and streamlined immigration system, suggests legalizing undocumented immigrants after they pay a fine, perform community service, and avoid serious criminal convictions.\n\nDuring an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep, Bush outlined the plan, stating that, \"after there is a recognition that if people come here illegally, they have to pay a fine or do community service [and] make sure they don't commit any serious crimes,\" undocumented immigrants could achieve legal residency. However, he emphasized that this status would not necessarily lead to citizenship, in an effort to discourage future illegal immigration.\n\nBush explained, \"Over a period of time, they can have a legalized status that allows them to live a life of dignity, but not necessarily a path to citizenship, so as to not create incentives for future people that aspire to come to our country to do so illegally when they could come legally.\"\n\nFor those seeking citizenship, the plan suggests returning to their country of origin and applying. Bolick, a lawyer and director of the Goldwater Institute's Scharf-Norton Center for Constitutional Litigation in Phoenix, noted that the proposal would increase the number of people who can immigrate to the United States for work.\n\nBolick stated, \"We're the only country in the entire world that places such a low premium on people coming here to work. Two-thirds of our immigrants come as a result of family preferences, which are not just for spouses and minor children, which we think ought to remain, but also siblings and parents, and they, in turn, have a preference to bring in their relatives as well.\"\n\nBush, often mentioned as a potential presidential candidate, has not yet announced his intentions for the 2024 election. When asked about the need for Republicans to support an immigration overhaul, Bush responded, \"Being against other people's policies eventually puts you in a downward spiral. It's fine to be principled and oppose views that you don't agree with, but you also have to have an alternative.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Clint and I believe that what we've proposed is a good, conservative, economically driven, respect-for-the-rule-of-law set of policies that would work, and it's something that the Republicans could embrace.\"\n\nBush also addressed the need for spending restraint and entitlement reform, stating, \"If the president is for increasing the eligibility rate, which I think makes sense, given the changing demographic nature of our country, if he's for whatever substantive changes he's for, he should be public about it. This is not a radical idea. This is how it has been done in American history\u2014presidents have led, and they have used all the skills at their disposal to convince and persuade and to find common ground.\"\n\nBush concluded, \"We just had an election, and a lot will happen between now and the time that I would even begin to consider something like that. So, time would be the leading indicator.\"",
    " Title: Putin's Endorsement of Trump: A Reflection of Statecraft and Showbiz\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, has publicly endorsed Donald Trump, the current frontrunner in the U.S. presidential race. Putin, known for his theatrical style and political maneuvering, praised Trump as the \"absolute leader\" of the race and described him as a \"very lively man, talented without doubt.\"\n\nThis endorsement marks an unusual step for Putin, who has been running Russia since 2000, and raises questions about the motivations behind his intervention in the election process of an adversary.\n\nThe parallels between Putin and Trump are striking, with both men embodying caricatures of their respective eras - Putin, a symbol of the Cold War-era strongman, and Trump, a representation of the 1980s' brash executive. This shared affinity for spectacle and the ability to sway low-information voters could be a significant factor in Putin's interest in the U.S. election.\n\nPutin's approach to politics seems to resonate with Trump's campaign style, which can be seen as a reflection of the reality show-like nature of Trump's campaign. The line from Mel Brooks' musical \"The Producers\" - \"Everything is showbiz\" - could serve as the leitmotif of Trump's campaign.\n\nMoreover, Putin may see an opportunity to exploit Trump's self-referential nature, a tactic he has employed successfully in the past. Putin, a former intelligence officer, is known to have been taught to look for character flaws that can be used to enlist a target as an agent or, short of that, an unwitting helper.\n\nIn the past, American presidents have been easy prey for Putin's manipulations. George W. Bush and Barack Obama, for instance, were both deceived by Putin's diplomatic charms. A President Trump could potentially provide Putin with another opportunity to further his interests, particularly in relation to U.S. policy toward Russia.\n\nTrump's comments on U.S. policy toward Russia have been favorable, with the candidate praising Putin's leadership and expressing support for Russia's actions in Syria. This alignment of interests, however, may be more apparent than real, as Putin's intentions in Syria are primarily to support Bashar al-Assad and fight Assad's non-ISIS opponents, rather than to fight ISIS as Trump suggests.\n\nPutin's endorsement of Trump and Trump's positive comments about Putin's leadership style raise concerns about the potential for further Russian influence in U.S. politics and policy. As the race heats up, it remains to be seen how this relationship will develop and what impact, if any, it will have on U.S.-Russia relations.",

This figure is on track to surpass 50 million, setting a record for votes cast before Election Day, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nAngel Del Carpio, a retired hairdresser and long-time voter, was among those who cast their ballots early in Nevada, a closely watched swing state. Del Carpio, who has voted in every election since he can remember, made an early appearance at The Boulevard Mall, about three miles east of The Strip, to vote at a polling station set up inside.\n\n\"I did my part,\" says Del Carpio, holding up his \"I voted\" sticker. \"It's very important because our vote is what's going to save this country.\"\n\nThe surge in early voting may suggest that Americans continue to value their role in the electoral process, particularly when they perceive that the stakes are high, political analysts say. Voters are eager to take advantage of ways that make it easier for them to participate, they add.\n\n\"People want to choose the most convenient thing, especially if they're anticipating long lines on Election Day,\" says David Damore, professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\n\nIn this election in particular, Democrats and Republicans alike tend to see a win for the other side as an existential threat. \"The importance of the outcome looms over most people,\" Dr. Damore says. \"That may not fire enthusiasm, but it becomes important to people to participate.\"\n\nAs voting options expand, the percentage of voters nationwide casting their ballots early have soared from about 11 percent in 1996 to 33 percent in 2012, Pew reports. Data for 2016 suggests the trend will hold. In states such as Nevada and Colorado, nearly half the total electorate had already cast their votes five days before the election, says Paul Gronke, founder and director of the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College in Portland, Ore. In Tennessee and Arizona, nearly two-thirds have turned in their ballots.\n\n\"That's the biggest story, the earliness,\" Professor Gronke says. His theory as to why is somewhat less optimistic: \"People are very unhappy with this campaign. They want to get it over with.\"\n\nThe notion of casting ballots ahead of Election Day has been around since the Civil War, when Republicans \u2013 in an effort to secure the soldier vote for Abraham Lincoln \u2013 pushed for legislation to allow servicemen to cast their vote while away from their home states. Early voting for convenience, however, took shape only in the 1970s.\n\nFor some Las Vegas voters, the expansion of early voting \u2013 and laws that require employers to give workers time to vote \u2013 provides a chance to reaffirm their role in the democratic process.\n\n\"We're fortunate to get to do it on the clock,\" says Belinda, a hotel employee who declined to give her last name. She and two of her coworkers had arrived at a polling station about a mile off The Strip on a charter bus that takes hotel workers to and from the site.\n\n\"It makes a big difference,\" she says. \"Our voices are being heard.\"\n\nSome say the main draw is the luxury of getting in their ballots minus the hassle of Election Day crowds \u2013 particularly in a race as volatile as this one.\n\n\"With everybody split up the way they are, the country's going to be crazy on Nov. 8,\" says Timothy Salmon, a father and video producer, as he left a satellite polling station in the parking lot of a local shopping center. Except for work, he says, \"I don't want to go out that day.\"\n\nFor others, the chance to vote early simply means an easy way to fulfill a sense of obligation. After all, voters had only to go online to find the site closest to their home or workplace.\n\n\"It was very fast. I thought it was going to be more difficult,\" says Raul Sanchez, who plays in a mariachi band. Though in his 50s, Mr. Sanchez is a first-time voter, spurred to the polls by a desire to see someone who isn't Donald Trump win the White House. Sanchez says the experience left him encouraged \u2013 and inspired him to take part in future elections.\n\nThat Nevada is a swing state has also led residents here to feel more keenly the weight of each individual vote.\n\n\"We have to make the election count,\" says Del Carpio, the retired hairdresser.\n\n\"This is a state where your vote actually matters,\" adds Alex Zachary, who works at the Marquee, a popular nightclub, as he inched forward in line. \"I want to make sure I have my say.\"",
    " Title: 2020 Democratic Presidential Hopefuls Face Calls to Address Border Wall Stance as Beto O'Rourke Advocates for Destruction of Existing Barriers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could potentially set a litmus test for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman, has expressed support for tearing down the existing barriers along the southern border with Mexico. This statement has sparked a wave of questions for other Democratic candidates regarding their stance on the issue.\n\nDuring an interview on MSNBC, O'Rourke, who is widely speculated to be a potential candidate in 2020 but has not formally announced his intention to run, was asked if he would remove the wall in his hometown. O'Rourke responded, \"Yes, absolutely. I'd take the wall down.\"\n\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) is the first notable 2020 candidate to signal openness to O'Rourke's idea. In an interview with Fox News in New Hampshire on Friday, she stated, \"I could look at it and see which part he means and why and if it makes sense I could support it.\"\n\nRepublicans have seized on O'Rourke's comments, using them to portray Democrats as extreme and pro-open borders. Texas Senator John Cornyn, who is up for re-election in 2020, tweeted, \"Correct me if I am wrong, but did Beto say he would tear down existing border fencing and walls?\"\n\nArkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton commented, \"Give Beto O'Rourke points for honesty: he admits that he wants to tear down existing border walls & have totally open borders.\" RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel used O'Rourke's comments to say it's proof that Democrats are \"the party of open borders.\"\n\nNot all Democrats have embraced the idea of tearing down existing barriers. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) stated during an interview on Fox News' \"Special Report with Bret Baier\" last month that border walls \"obviously\" work in some areas and rejected suggestions that barriers should be removed where they already exist.\n\nIn recent weeks, other lesser-known Democrats have suggested support for the idea. Democratic Texas Representative Veronica Escobar told CNN in January that \"walls do not work, that they do not stop drugs, that they do not stop migration.\" Escobar also suggested she was open to destroying existing walls, remarking that they are \"really ugly\" and \"monuments to division.\"\n\nAs the 2020 Democratic primary heats up, the issue of border walls and fences is likely to remain a contentious topic, with candidates grappling to balance their liberal base's views on immigration with the need to appeal to a broader electorate.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Hears Arguments on Obama's Deportation Amnesty, Divided Justices Grapple with Presidential Power and Congressional Authority\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly anticipated hearing on Monday, the Supreme Court grappled with the legality of President Obama's deportation amnesty, as conservative justices expressed concerns over the president's encroachment on Congress's lawmaking powers, while liberal justices argued for the court's non-intervention. Outside the courthouse, thousands of Hispanic rights activists rallied, demanding leniency from the justices and vowing political retribution on Congress, particularly Republicans, if President Obama loses the case.\n\nThe case, United States v. Texas, centers around a set of policies announced by President Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in November 2014. One of these policies set deportation priorities, carving most illegal immigrants out of any danger of deportation, a policy not being challenged. However, another policy granted temporary legal status, work permits, and a three-year stay of deportation to as many as 5 million illegal immigrants with children who have legal status in the U.S., entitling them to driver's licenses and some taxpayer benefits, including Social Security.\n\nDuring oral arguments, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. questioned Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., President Obama's liaison to the high court, about the president's previous statements denying the existence of such expansive powers. Mr. Verrilli responded by stating that Mr. Obama had changed his mind after the Justice Department's legal advisory branch took a closer look.\n\nThe case has drawn intense interest from Congress, where Democrats and Republicans have filed opposing briefs, and from activists on issues ranging from presidential power to immigration law to business interests. With eight justices on the bench after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, a 4-4 split is possible, leaving in place the ruling of the lower appeals court, which decided 2-1 that President Obama's amnesty violated immigration law. A tie decision would also leave for future courts the biggest questions over the extent of presidential powers, limits that President Obama has repeatedly tested.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, the only Hispanic member of the court, argued that President Obama's actions appear to be in line with actions of previous presidents who deferred deportations and offered work permits to illegal immigrants caught in a legal limbo in the 1980s and 1990s. The possibility of a 4-4 tie could sap much of the energy from the case, since it would mean the court would not issue a definitive opinion on the limits of presidential power. The court had asked all sides to submit briefs on whether President Obama was violating the Constitution's admonition that the president \"take care\" that the laws are faithfully executed, but there was no discussion of that during oral argument.\n\nThe liberal justices also questioned whether Texas even had standing to sue in the first place, doubting the state's worry that it will face a flood of new illegal immigrants and will have to subsidize driver's licenses and pay for other benefits for the folks who qualify for President Obama's policy. Justice Sotomayor said that if Texas could sue to stop immigration policy like this, it would open the door for states to sue any time they find fault with a federal policy, making judges the referees in myriad disputes. \"That really pits the states against every federal agency,\" she said.",
    " Title: Clinton Employs Humor and Animal Impersonations in Nevada Campaign, Amidst Growing Competition with Sanders\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to secure victory in the upcoming Nevada caucuses, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton employed humor and animal impersonations during a campaign rally in Reno on Monday. The former secretary of state, who is facing a surging challenge from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, used a dog's bark to fact-check potential false statements made by her Republican opponents.\n\nSpeaking before a crowd, Clinton recounted a political ad she had heard on the radio in Arkansas, featuring a dog that supposedly barked whenever a candidate made an untrue statement. Clinton mimicked the dog's bark, \"Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!\" to general applause.\n\nThe race between Clinton and Sanders has intensified in recent days, with both candidates criss-crossing the Silver State. On Sunday, they found themselves on opposite ends of a pew in the same Las Vegas church.\n\nSanders' campaign has been gaining ground, with over 100 staffers on the ground in Nevada and a more than doubled paid staff since last month. His television ad spending has also increased, with $2.93 million spent compared to Clinton's $1.46 million.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the Nevada caucuses is heightened by a relative lack of polling and the momentum seemingly behind Sanders following his resounding victory over Clinton in the New Hampshire primary. In an effort to emphasize the importance of Saturday's caucuses, Clinton opted to skip a campaign event in Florida, sending her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to stump in her stead.\n\nLike in Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders has placed his hopes in Nevada on voter turnout. \"Everything in my political gut tells me that we have the momentum here in this state,\" he told a rally in Las Vegas Sunday. \"And if people come out in large numbers on caucus day, we\u2019re going to win.\"\n\nWhile it is possible to win the Nevada caucuses, history shows that this may not guarantee victory in the Democratic National Convention. In 2008, Clinton lost the all-important battle for Democratic National Convention delegates to then-Senator Barack Obama.\n\nThe Clinton campaign may have inadvertently created controversy last week with comments made by campaign spokesman Brian Fallon. In these comments, he compared Nevada to the more racially and ethnically homogenous Iowa and New Hampshire. This remark reportedly angered allies of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, with one telling Politico that Reid had \"pushed hard to move Nevada near the front of the primary calendar precisely because of its diversity.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Criticizes Democrat Senators' Alleged Meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint press conference with Ethiopian Foreign Minister Gedu Andargachew on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo addressed reports that a number of Democrat Senators had secretly met with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during the Munich Security Conference.\n\nPompeo stated, \"I have seen that piece about some senators meeting with Foreign Minister Zarif. This guy is designated by the United States of America. He's the foreign minister for a country that shot down a commercial airliner and has yet to turn over the black boxes. This is the foreign minister of a country that killed an American on December 27. And it's the foreign minister of a country who is the largest world sponsor of terror and the world's largest sponsor of anti-Semitism.\"\n\nThe initial report was first published by The Federalist, which stated, \"Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and other Democratic senators had a secret meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during the Munich Security Conference last week.\" Murphy's office did not respond to repeated requests for comment by press time.\n\nZarif was designated for sanctions by the Treasury Department last summer for sponsoring terrorism around the world. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated at the time, \"Javad Zarif implements the reckless agenda of Iran's Supreme Leader, and is the regime's primary spokesperson around the world. The United States is sending a clear message to the Iranian regime that its recent behavior is completely unacceptable.\"\n\nSenator Murphy, along with other Democrats, have repeatedly worked to preserve the deeply flawed Iranian Nuclear Agreement. The United States officially left the deal, struck during the Obama administration, in 2018.\n\nNotably, former Secretary of State John Kerry, who has been openly undermining U.S. foreign policy since President Trump took office in 2017, was also seen with Zarif in Munich.\n\nPompeo's comments come after a commercial airline flight was shot down by Iran in January, killing all 176 people on board from Iran, Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan, Germany, and Great Britain. The Iranian government lied about the crash for days, blaming it on engine failure, before admitting to shooting down the plane. The regime arrested the individual who took video of two missiles being launched at the aircraft, leading to its demise.\n\nUPDATE: Senator Murphy has since confirmed he did in fact meet with Zarif in Munich.",
    " Title: U.S. Presidential Race: Free Trade Consensus Emerges as Economic Drag, Affecting Both Parties\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing presidential race, the impact of free trade has emerged as a significant issue, with a majority of voters viewing it as a detriment to the U.S. economy, costing American jobs. This consensus, according to exit polling, cuts across party lines, with Republicans showing more opposition to free trade than Democrats, a shift that challenges conventional wisdom.\n\nIn the Wisconsin primary, only a third of Republican voters believed free trade spawns American jobs, while a staggering 54 percent held the opposite view. Among Democratic primary voters, the numbers were more evenly split, with 41 percent saying free trade helps jobs and 42 percent saying it costs the country jobs. Similar results have been observed in states including Illinois and Mississippi.\n\n\"Americans' attitudes toward trade are becoming more protectionist in large part because of the downward pressures on Americans' earnings in recent years, regardless of their political party,\" said Matthew J. Slaughter, dean of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.\n\nThe tough economic times and a ready target in trade have pushed both parties' presidential fields toward protectionism. Four of the five remaining candidates oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the 12-nation deal that President Obama signed but has yet to submit to Congress for final approval.\n\nBusinessman Donald Trump, who is leading the Republican race, has threatened to rip up not only the TPP but also previous deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This has forced Sen. Ted Cruz, his closest competitor and the winner of Wisconsin's primary on Tuesday, to adopt a stiffer stance on the issue.\n\nIn the Democratic race, Sen. Bernie Sanders has made his opposition to trade deals over the past two decades a chief selling point, and front-runner Hillary Clinton has played a feverish game of catch-up, recanting her previous glowing praise for TPP as a secretary of state and now saying the deal signed by her former boss, Mr. Obama, falls short.\n\nOnly Ohio Gov. John Kasich, trailing badly in the Republican race, remains a defender of the TPP. Economists can calculate the benefits to the overall U.S. economy from trade, and there is little question that it does help. However, the benefits are not as salient to those who lose out, and those are the voices to which the candidates are responding.\n\n\"Historically, trade is always a hard sell in difficult times. The costs are concentrated and salient. The benefits are more widely spread and the links to trade are not as transparent,\" said Gene M. Grossman, a Princeton University professor who has studied the politics of trade. \"What's needed in such times is leadership from some with a longer horizon and broader vision. Alas, such leaders seem to be in short supply these days.\"\n\nThe near-uniform opposition at the top of the ticket this year could doom the chances for trade deals for years to come\u2014though some analysts said there is a brief opening this year, with both Mr. Obama and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan supporters of a deal while still in office and seeing their window of opportunity closing.\n\n\"My hope is that Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell somehow figure out how to get this passed during an Obama presidency,\" said Simon Rosenberg, a longtime trade supporter who founded NDN, a center-left think tank.\n\nThat Democrats are conflicted on trade has long been apparent in Washington, where the party has experienced deep rifts. However, Republican voters' aversion is striking given the near-monolithic support for free trade agreements by the party's officeholders in Washington. In the vote last year to grant Mr. Obama fast-track powers to negotiate trade deals\u2014the most recent test of free trade\u2014nearly 80 percent of House Republicans voted in favor, as did 90 percent of Senate Republicans. Since then, as the presidential campaign has intensified, so has opposition among Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who voted for the fast-track powers, now says he has serious questions about the TPP deal reached with those powers. He has told Mr. Obama not to submit the deal until after the elections, leaving a lame-duck Congress as the only chance for passage.\n\nMr. Rosenberg says the Republican opposition isn't that surprising. Indeed, he said it's been Democrats who have advanced every major trade deal of the last century, going back to Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, who set the ground for the liberalized international system. More recently, he said, NAFTA, the creation of the World Trade Organization out of the Uruguay round of talks in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and normalized trade relations with China were all Democratic priorities. And Mr. Obama, not President George W. Bush, completed the TPP.\n\n\"The truth is the heavy lifting on trade has been done by Democrats, and the Republicans haven't been nearly as involved in putting together the deals and the legislative pieces to get these done in the way Democrats have,\" Mr. Rosenberg said.",
    " Title: Attorney General Barr Skips House Hearing on Mueller Report, Tensions Escalate Between Congress and White House\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Attorney General William Barr, in a move that escalated tensions between the White House and the House of Representatives, chose to skip a House hearing on Thursday regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election. The decision led to a heated exchange between lawmakers, with both parties accusing the other of political grandstanding and obstruction.\n\nThe confrontation marks the latest escalation in a series of confrontations between Congress and the Trump administration over congressional investigations into President Donald Trump and his administration. Lawmakers argue they are being stonewalled in their inquiries, while the administration claims the requests are politically motivated.\n\nBarr's absence from the House Judiciary Committee hearing was due to the committee's decision to add an hour of questions by staff lawyers. The hearing was to have been Barr's second day of testimony about the investigation and his handling of the special counsel's final report. Barr spent four hours before a Senate panel on Wednesday.\n\nChairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) accused the Trump administration of ignoring subpoenas and refusing to testify, a pattern he said reflects an effort to prevent Congress from providing any check on the president's actions.\n\n\"The challenge we face is that if we don\u2019t stand up to him together, today, then we risk forever losing the power to stand up to any president in the future,\" Nadler said.\n\nRep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) brought a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken to the House hearing room to mark Barr's absence. The top Republican on the panel, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, called the meeting a \"circus political stunt\" that prevented Barr's testimony for lawmakers of either party.\n\n\"We will ensure that no president becomes a monarch,\" Nadler said as he gaveled the 20-minute session's end.\n\n\"And will do so while trampling minority rights,\" Collins said as the microphones were turned off.\n\nThe Justice Department refused to provide an unredacted version of the Mueller report to Congress despite a subpoena deadline. Barr redacted portions dealing with grand jury testimony, information about pending cases, intelligence gathering secrets, and information that could infringe on the privacy of people who were not charged.\n\nCongressional Democrats insist they deserve to receive the full report and the underlying information that Mueller's team gathered during 22 months. In a letter Wednesday to Nadler, the Justice Department's Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the committee has not \"articulated any legislative purpose for its request\" for documents relating to Mueller's investigation.\n\nNadler said in an opening statement facing an empty chair for Barr that lawmakers must come together to protect the integrity of the House.\n\n\"Every member of this committee should understand the consequences when the executive branch informs us that they will simply ignore a congressional subpoena,\" Nadler said.\n\nCollins said Democrats wanted a circus rather than to pose questions to Barr.\n\n\"Not hearing from him is a travesty for this committee today,\" Collins said.\n\nMueller's report identified \"systematic\" efforts by the Kremlin to interfere in the 2016 election by hacking emails and posting disinformation to help Trump win, and it detailed how Trump and his aides appeared to welcome that help. It found no conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia, and it did not reach a conclusion about whether Trump sought to obstruct justice.\n\nAfter Thursday's abbreviated hearing, Democrats said they supported Nadler's plan to negotiate with the Justice Department for \"a few more days\" to obtain the full report.\n\n\"The next step is to hold the attorney general in contempt for failing to comply with our subpoena,\" Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) said.\n\nAnother step would be to subpoena Barr to testify. Democrats plan to call Mueller to testify, tentatively scheduled for May 15.",
    " Title: Internal GOP Politics Take Center Stage as Senate Faces Cloture Vote on Budget Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Tuesday's cloture vote on the short-term budget compromise in the Senate approaches, the focus is not just on the budget deal but on internal Republican politics within the Senate Appropriations Committee. The vote, which rests on the 14 Republicans on the committee, could be a deciding factor in the race for chairmanships if the GOP were to regain the Senate in the 2014 elections.\n\nThe recent decision by Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) to seek reelection has added a new dimension to the race, potentially pitting him against Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the current ranking Republican on the committee. While a Shelby spokesman has denied that the potential competition has any bearing on Shelby's opposition to the budget deal, his office announced Sunday that he will vote against cloture on Tuesday.\n\nThe internal politics within the Senate Appropriations Committee are reminiscent of the famous line from the war in Vietnam: \"The U.S. had to 'destroy the town to save it.'\" By opposing cloture, Shelby may help himself become chairman, but if he kills the deal, what will be left of the committee when he gets the gavel?\n\nFor many on Appropriations, Tuesday's vote is almost existential. The budget agreement would negate sequestration in January and reset the Budget Control Act with more manageable caps on discretionary spending for fiscal 2014 and 2015. This is pivotal for the committees if they are ever to be a force again in this Congress. And only with the deal can the Appropriations leadership salvage the work it's already done on the dozen fiscal 2014 spending bills.\n\nIn the wake of the House vote, meetings are already underway to package the 12 together in a single omnibus package in January. But if the budget deal were to collapse, Appropriations would be pushed aside again, leaving the government under a long-term continuing resolution for the third time in four years.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) expressed her confidence in getting the votes but admitted some bafflement as to why this is a close call for her fellow Republicans on Appropriations. \"I would think appropriators would welcome the chance to have a top-line and write our bills,\" Collins said. \"We Republicans have said for years that we want to get back to normal order and a budget. Now we have a bipartisan agreement negotiated by a conservative House budget chairman. Why is this close?\"\n\nThe contrast with House Republicans could not be more stark. House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) worked hard inside his committee, losing just Reps. Jack Kingston of Georgia and Andy Harris of Maryland. Equally important, Republicans on House Appropriations from seven states\u2014also represented by Republicans on the Senate committee\u2014voted for the deal.\n\nThe states were Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, Mississippi, and Tennessee\u2014represented in the Senate, respectively, by Shelby, John Boozman, Jerry Moran, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Mike Johanns, Cochran, and Lamar Alexander. McConnell, Cochran, and Alexander all face primary challenges at home in which elements of the tea party are agitating to oust them. However, Shelby is not up for reelection and has enjoyed a longtime working friendship with Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.).\n\nPart of Shelby's opposition now could be a courtesy to his fellow Alabaman, Jeff Sessions\u2014the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee and candidate in 2014\u2014who is fiercely against the budget plan. But the chairmanship side of the equation can't be ignored. Shelby has firmly installed himself as the ranking Republican\u2014having succeeded Cochran at the beginning of this year. But if the GOP were to win back the Senate in 2014, Cochran would have the right under Senate GOP rules to come back as Appropriations chairman. This would set up a potential party fight between the two powerful Southerners if Shelby wanted to stay on. Cochran's more moderate record could leave him exposed within the GOP conference. And Shelby has been careful to never stray far from McConnell, who undercut Cochran badly when the Mississippian was the ranking Republican on the committee.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Disagreement Over Republican and Democratic Memos on Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the release of the Republican memo, which was aimed at casting doubt on the origins of the Russia investigation, has sparked a bipartisan disagreement. The Republican memo, drafted by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, has not cleared President Trump of allegations of collusion with the Russians or obstruction of justice, as claimed by Mr. Trump. Instead, the memo confirmed that contacts between former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and Russian intermediaries, not the material from former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, were the primary factors in the opening of the investigation in July 2016.\n\nHowever, Democrats have denounced the document as a tactic to undermine the investigation and protect President Trump. They argue that the memo is riddled with errors and omissions. According to sources familiar with the Democratic memo, it reveals that the FBI was more forthcoming with the surveillance court than Republicans had claimed. The Democratic memo is said to contend that the FBI disclosed to the court that the information it had received from Steele was politically motivated, although it did not name the Democratic National Committee or Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n\nOn Monday, when confronted with Democratic claims that such a disclosure was included in the application, Mr. Nunes conceded on \"Fox & Friends\" that there had been a \"footnote\" to that effect. However, he called its inclusion a \"far cry from letting the American people know that the Democrats and the Hillary campaign paid for dirt that the FBI then used to get a warrant.\"\n\nDemocrats also contest Republican claims that Andrew G. McCabe, the deputy director of the FBI at the time, had testified before the Intelligence Committee late last year that the agency would not have sought a wiretap of Carter Page without Steele's dossier of information. Carter Page, a former Moscow-based investment banker who was under investigation once before, was suspected by the FBI of acting as a Russian agent.\n\nIn a move to shed more light on the matter, The New York Times filed a motion on Monday asking the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to unseal all materials related to the wiretap of Carter Page, including the FBI's application for the warrant and other court documents. Since Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1978, no such wiretapping application materials have been made public.",
    " Title: GOP's American Health Care Act: A Challenging Repeal-and-Replace Plan for Trump and Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, House Republicans have unveiled their long-awaited replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act, aiming to repeal key provisions of the Obamacare while introducing a new system of tax credits for individual health insurance policies. The plan, named the American Health Care Act, is set to upend the existing healthcare system, but its implementation may test President Trump's ability to unify the Republican party.\n\nThe American Health Care Act generally adheres to GOP principles by repealing the individual and employer insurance mandates, which are viewed as intrusive in personal healthcare choices and market dynamics. Instead, it offers tax credits for individuals to purchase their own policies.\n\nThe plan also overhauls Medicaid, a federal program that provides healthcare for the economically disadvantaged, which many Republicans view as excessively costly given the escalating federal debt.\n\nHowever, independent analysts question the plan's ability to provide \"insurance for everybody\" and comprehensive coverage while reducing costs. G. William Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, estimates that 8 million to 12 million fewer people would be covered under the GOP plan compared to the ACA, which added coverage for more than 20 million people.\n\nThe plan faces opposition from both conservative and moderate Republicans, creating a \"nasty crossfire\" between the two factions. Conservatives view the tax credits as a new entitlement program, while moderates argue that the credits are insufficient for low-income Americans.\n\nFurthermore, many of the 16 Republican governors, as well as their Democratic counterparts who expanded Medicaid under the ACA, are expected to object to the reduced outlays under the House plan. Thirty-one states, including the District of Columbia, have expanded Medicaid coverage to more than 11 million people.\n\nThe American Health Care Act: Key Provisions\n- Immediately drops the individual and employer mandates by repealing their penalties retroactively to 2016. It encourages continuous insurance coverage by imposing a 30 percent premium surcharge if consumers let their coverage lapse.\n- Replaces subsidies with tax credits that can be applied to private plans. The credits, based on age, range from $2,000 to $4,000 for individuals and up to $14,000 for families.\n- Funds Medicaid expansion only through 2019, after which funding declines. In a radical change, all states would receive a set amount of money for Medicaid each year based on the size of their state's Medicaid population. A $100 billion \"stability fund\" would be available to all states to use as they see fit to lower health costs.\n- Continues popular parts of the ACA, such as allowing young adults to stay on their parents' health insurance until age 26 and prohibiting denial of coverage for a pre-existing condition.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) stated that the plan would \"drive down costs, encourage competition, and give every American access to quality, affordable health insurance.\" However, Democrats strongly disagree, even as premiums have risen and choices have declined in many Obamacare insurance markets.\n\nRepublicans will have to push the plan through using a budget process known as \"reconciliation,\" which requires only a majority vote for passage in both houses of Congress. However, even this low threshold seems elusive given the Republican division over the plan.\n\nThe American Health Care Act marks the beginning of a significant overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system. Its success will depend on the ability of Republicans to unite and navigate the complexities of the legislative process.",
    " Title: Top Democrats Caution Against \"Blue Wave\" Predictions for Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the midterm elections approach, top Democrats are urging caution about the prospect of a \"blue wave\" sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill. With just over two weeks remaining before the critical elections, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez stated Monday that he does not use the term \"blue wave\" to discuss a possible Democratic victory.\n\nPerez, who was speaking to CNN, predicted a tight race for control of Congress. \"We always knew that this election was going to be close\u2014I don't use the term 'blue wave,' I always talk about the need for the blocking and tackling,\" Perez said. \"I always talk about the need for organizing, to make sure you're leading with your values, and that's how we've been winning throughout this year and throughout 2017.\"\n\nDespite his cautious tone, Perez expressed confidence that Democrats would take control of the House and win in several gubernatorial races. \"I don't think the Democratic advantage has ebbed,\" Perez said. \"We're talking about the issues that matter most to people.\"\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders further cast doubt on the \"wave\" narrative. \"A lot of people talk about this 'blue wave' and stuff,\" Sanders told The Hill. \"I don't believe it.\" Sanders, an independent who ran for president in 2016 as a Democrat, added: \"I happen to think that on election night we'll find a very, very close situation, and maybe a handful of votes determining whether Democrats gain control of the House.\"\n\nThe cautious comments come as the shifting midterm landscape reflects a Republican advantage in the Senate and a tough fight for control of the House, which could be determined by just a handful of races. The statements from Perez and Sanders stand in stark contrast to the optimism displayed last week by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nPelosi, D-Calif., expressed little doubt of a major Democratic victory in the midterms during a speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. \"People ask me all over the country, 'Is it a wave, or is it a tsunami?'\" Pelosi said. \"And I said, well, in either case, it's little drops of water. And many of them. How many a wave, how many more a tsunami. But they're all close. They're all very, very close. These are many close races.\"\n\nAn NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll released over the weekend found that Democrats continue to hold a sizeable lead in the closing weeks before the midterms, but noted that in districts rated as the most competitive by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, they are now in a dead heat with Republicans on the question of which party should control Congress.\n\nOverall, the poll found that 48 percent of registered voters would prefer having Democrats in control of Congress, compared with 41 percent supporting the GOP. That 7-point gap has narrowed from the 12-point lead the Democrats had in September. Early voting in certain states, meanwhile, has offered positive signs for Democrats.",
    " Title: Former Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort's Trial Begins in Virginia Amidst 18 Counts of Fraud\n\nArticle:\n\nThe highly anticipated trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is set to commence on Tuesday in Alexandria, Virginia. Manafort faces 18 criminal charges, including bank and tax fraud, which could potentially result in a 30-year prison sentence. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nThe charges against Manafort stem from his lobbying activities in Ukraine on behalf of politicians with ties to Russia. Prosecutors allege that Manafort was paid over $60 million for his work, which includes support for former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.\n\nGovernment attorneys claim that Manafort engaged in a scheme to conceal his income from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other U.S. authorities. Instead of paying taxes on the income, they assert that he used it to maintain a luxurious lifestyle, which included owning three homes, a $21,000 watch, a $105,000 car, and New York Yankees season tickets.\n\nApproximately 500 pieces of evidence and up to 35 witnesses are expected to be presented by prosecutors. One of these witnesses is Manafort's former business associate Rick Gates, who was charged alongside Manafort but pleaded guilty and has cooperated with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team.\n\nManafort's work as a Ukrainian political operative occurred nearly a decade before he joined the Trump campaign in mid-2016. He organized the Republican convention in July 2016, but he left President Trump's team one month later.\n\nProsecutors have stated that they will not present evidence of Russian collusion during Manafort's trial. However, they have claimed they have the authority to prosecute him under a May 2017 order by Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein.\n\nManafort's attorneys have challenged that order, claiming that Mueller exceeded his authority. District Judge T.S. Ellis III, who is overseeing the Virginia trial, denied their motion, ruling that Mueller's mandate authorizes him to pursue charges in the case.\n\nThe Virginia trial marks the first of two trials Manafort will face this year. He has a September trial scheduled in Washington, D.C., on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent and making false statements to investigators.",
    " Title: Obama and Romney's Final Push: A Look at Their Closing Arguments in the 2012 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final two weeks of the 2012 presidential race, both candidates, Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama, are making their closing arguments. With few opportunities left to significantly shift the race, both campaigns are relying on strong turnout operations and well-crafted messages to secure a slight edge.\n\nIn a 60-second TV ad released Tuesday, President Obama outlined his plans for the next four years, focusing on education, manufacturing, energy, and deficit reduction. This ad, along with the campaign's decision to mail 3.5 million policy booklets, is an attempt to counter criticism that Obama's second-term agenda is thin on specifics.\n\nDavid Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, stated in a conference call that these new tactics are not a response to the \"where's the beef\" criticism, but rather a reflection of the campaign's entry into the closing argument phase. Axelrod explained, \"Obviously, a lot of people have made up their minds. There is a small universe of voters who haven't. We want to make sure those voters have access to the information they need.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Romney spokesman Kevin Madden, speaking to reporters onboard the campaign plane, expressed confidence in Romney's performance in the foreign policy debate, stating, \"Many swing voters looked at the foreign policy debate last night, and they were asking themselves, 'Does Gov. Romney pass the commander-in-chief test? And clearly he did.' He also gave people a sense of confidence that he has a plan for what he wants to do over the next four years as it relates to positioning America around the globe, and that they feel safer and more secure that he does have a plan.\"\n\nAs the race enters its final stretch, both candidates are presenting their final arguments, aiming to sway undecided voters and secure victory in the upcoming election.",
    " Title: White House and House Speaker John Boehner Disagree on Fiscal Cliff Compromise Plan B\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tense exchange on Tuesday, the White House rejected House Speaker John Boehner's call for a fall-back option to avoid the impending fiscal crisis, a move that Boehner's office described as \"defying common sense.\" The disagreement comes as both sides inch towards a potential middle ground in private negotiations, but the differences that remain are evident.\n\nBoehner introduced his alternative plan, dubbed \"Plan B,\" in the hope that it would serve as a failsafe option if the ongoing negotiations fail to produce a compromise before the January 1 deadline, when taxes are set to rise for all and spending cuts are set to take effect.\n\nUnder Boehner's plan, taxes would only increase for households earning more than $1 million. The plan also calls for entitlement cuts and a tax reform debate next year. However, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney criticized the plan, stating that it \"does not ask enough of the very wealthiest in taxes and instead shifts the burden to the middle class and seniors.\"\n\nIn response, Boehner's spokesman, Brendan Buck, accused the White House of \"moving the goal posts\" and \"threatening every American family with higher taxes.\" Boehner, with his leadership on the line, is walking a tightrope in negotiations as the president demands tax hikes that many Republicans adamantly oppose.\n\nA Boehner aide stated that the speaker is \"hopeful an agreement will be reached,\" but expressed concern that the president's latest counteroffer includes $1.3 trillion in revenue increases and \"only\" $850 billion in spending cuts.\n\nHouse Republican Leader Eric Cantor is also putting pressure on the president, stating that the \"alternative plan\" is being discussed in case Obama \"cannot come our way.\"\n\nA significant challenge for Boehner is whether he can sell any compromise struck with the White House to rank-and-file Republicans. His offer to raise taxes on those making more than $1 million drew the ire of some conservatives, as did talk that he's considering allowing a debt ceiling increase that would prevent a battle over that issue for another year.\n\nObama, on the other hand, is demanding far more. In his latest offer, the president asked for a two-year reprieve on the debt ceiling and backed off his position that tax rates rise on households making more than $250,000, upping the threshold to $400,000. However, this still represents a larger swath of taxpayers than Boehner is considering. Additionally, the president continues to call for stimulus spending to be part of the package.\n\nFor taxpayers, a host of benefits and tax provisions are at stake. Without a deal, tax rates would rise for everyone, with middle-income families facing a roughly $2,000 increase next year. Capital gains and dividends rates would also go up, and long-term unemployment aid would expire.\n\nWith a deal, most Americans would likely be spared major tax increases, but those making above a certain threshold could still be affected, depending on what both sides agree to. Certain entitlement programs could also be cut, including Medicare and Social Security. Obama has indicated he's willing to agree to smaller cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients.\n\nIn terms of logistics, the House is tentatively planning to take up the \"Plan B\" proposal later this week, as early as Thursday. They would do so by amending a bill previously passed by the Senate that tracked more with Obama's original offer. Then, the House would send the bill back to the Senate, where it would likely sit as a potential last resort in case Obama and Boehner cannot strike a deal.",
    " Title: Federal Report Predicts Slight Increase in U.S. Health Care Spending Over Next Decade Due to Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a new report released Tuesday, the federal government has estimated that the U.S. will spend slightly more on health care over the next decade due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) compared to if the law had not been passed. According to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, the ACA is expected to add $478 billion to health care costs over the next decade, resulting in a slightly faster rate of spending growth.\n\nThe report states that if the Supreme Court upholds the law later this month, the ACA will cause health care spending to grow at a rate of 1/10th of a percent faster than if the law had never been passed. The CMS expects health care spending to continue growing at unusually low levels in the next year due to the slow economic recovery, but spending growth will spike in 2014, jumping from 3.8 percent in 2013 to 7.4 percent in 2014 as major provisions of the law go into effect.\n\nRepublicans have criticized the report, stating that it shows President Obama failed to make good on his promise to use the ACA to bend the cost curve on health care costs as a percentage of the American economy. \"Exploding health care spending is hardly the relief the president promised the American people,\" said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, Utah Republican. \"Instead of working to address skyrocketing costs and reforming our nation's broken entitlement programs, the president opted to jam through a partisan government takeover of health care.\"\n\nThe administration, however, has defended the law, stating that Americans' out-of-pocket expenses will be less beginning in 2014, particularly on prescription drugs. \"That's real money back in the pockets of millions of Americans,\" said Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius in a blog post defending the law.\n\nThe report also notes that overall health care spending is expected to continue growing at a slower rate in the long term, as millions of Americans obtain health coverage with the help of insurance exchanges, federal subsidies, and expanded Medicaid programs. By 2021, federal, state, and local governments will make up nearly 50 percent of all health spending in the U.S., up from 46 percent in 2011.\n\nThe report also highlights key provisions in Mr. Obama's health care law, such as bringing more healthy Americans into insurance pools, allowing Medicare to experiment with new \"bundled payment\" methods, and cutting down on emergency room visits by mandating coverage for everyone. The report suggests that these provisions could help control spending further, but it remains to be seen whether they will be enough to bend the cost curve in future decades.\n\nThe newly insured population is expected to be younger and healthier than those currently insured, and they are expected to drive up the demand for prescription drugs and doctors. This could be a good sign for reducing spending in the long term, as patients who regularly visit the doctor and practice preventative medicine can avoid more expensive health problems in the future.",
    " Title: The Role of Elections and Domestic Politics in Iran's Shift on Nuclear Program: A Closer Look at the Rouhani Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the third round of talks on the Iranian nuclear program commences in Geneva, it is crucial for the United States to navigate the negotiation table with caution. The narrative that Iran has entered negotiations due to economic hardships and vulnerability resulting from sanctions may lead to misinterpretations about the US's negotiating position.\n\nHowever, this perspective overlooks the intricate domestic and internal politics of the Islamic Republic of Iran, treating the regime as a monolithic entity and underestimating the significant impact of President Hassan Rouhani's election and the delicate political balancing act he is engaged in on the domestic political scene.\n\nWhile sanctions have played a role in Iran's behavioral change, they did not force Iran to the negotiation table out of fear of economic collapse. Instead, sanctions facilitated a shift in the balance of power within the Iranian political system, a transformation that was already underway since 2009, prior to the current sanctions regime. Sanctions helped pave the way for Rouhani's victory in the 2013 presidential elections by exacerbating the divide within the conservative forces of the Iranian establishment over the economy. The sanctions also solidified an emerging alliance among members of the ruling elite against the administration of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\n\nThe election, rather than sanctions, was the key to Iran's shift on foreign policy and nuclear negotiations. The election of another candidate, such as former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, would not have produced such a change in foreign policy despite the same sanctions regime. The impact of sanctions should be viewed through the lens of electoral turnover and the domestic shifts of power that brought Rouhani to office.\n\nThe current realignment of forces in Iran and the country's intention to engage with the international community presents the US with a significant opportunity and an essential condition to safeguard. The success of the Rouhani administration and his coalition alliance is critical for reaching a mutually beneficial deal on the nuclear program and for advancing a more moderate and politically inclusive Iran.\n\nThe persistence of sanctions without any meaningful relief or significant incentives, however, will undermine the Rouhani administration and hinder the potential for such a resolution. Not only will continued sanctions contribute to the mistrust between the US and Iran, but they will strengthen the hand of Iranian hardliners.\n\nA recalibration of political forces back toward the hardline elite would divide the cross-factional coalition supporting the Rouhani presidency. If members of the Iranian elite perceive that the door to a renewed engagement with the world financial markets will be closed to them for the medium- to long-term, then many of them will alter their calculations and gravitate toward an alternative political and economic program \u2013 one of domestic self-sufficiency and resistance that has been increasingly called for by hardliners.\n\nIn negotiating over the nuclear program with Iran, it is critical that the US and its partners get the sanctions narrative right. While sanctions contributed to an ongoing re-alignment of political factions that was conducive to Rouhani's electoral victory and the shift in Iranian foreign policy, they alone did not bring Iran to the negotiating table. And their continuance can also undermine the new government that is now in power.\n\nGiven the opportune environment to reach a negotiated deal with Iran, the US would be best served to devise a meaningful incentives package with an eye on the domestic Iranian political scene rather than increasing sanctions on Iran.\n\nPayam Mohseni, a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Government at Harvard University and a postdoctoral research fellow in the International Security Program at the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, underscores the importance of understanding the intricacies of Iran's domestic politics in the context of the nuclear negotiations.",
    " Title: Trump and Congress Grapple with Government Shutdown Threat as Shutdown Showdown Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the deadline for government funding approaches, the standoff between President Donald Trump and Congress over border wall funding has reached a critical juncture. The Senate, led by Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, is waiting for Republican leader Mitch McConnell to persuade President Trump to accept a deal that Democrats can support. The current proposal is a one-year \"continuing resolution\" (C.R.) that would temporarily fund parts of the government at their current levels.\n\nSome Hill Republicans suggested that the president should push for a shorter, two-week C.R., which would postpone the conflict until early January, allowing Republicans to potentially shift some of the blame onto the incoming Democratic House majority. However, the president reportedly was not keen on this option.\n\nEarly this week, the White House signaled that the president was not in a conciliatory mood. The administration sent hard-liner Stephen Miller on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday to state that, without wall funding, a shutdown was \"absolutely\" on the table. On Monday, the president tweeted that a wall was essential for \"good Border Security.\"\n\nBy Tuesday, the president had reversed course and began seeking a way out of the predicament without appearing to cave. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that he would be open to a bipartisan compromise, which included $1.6 billion for fortifying existing barriers, with the remaining $5 billion being diverted from other agencies. This proposal prompted immediate pushback from Democrats.\n\nSenator Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also rejected Senator McConnell's offer of a spending plan that contained an additional $1 billion for what they deemed an immigration \"slush fund.\"\n\nLawmakers from both parties agree that some form of continuing resolution is still the most likely way forward. However, the specifics of what the president would agree to remain unclear, and Press Secretary Sanders provided no clarity during a press briefing Tuesday afternoon.\n\nRegardless of his plan (assuming he has one), the president is clearly looking to milk every ounce of drama from this game of chicken. These standoffs align with his belief that negotiations, and life in general, are an unending battle of wills. He thrives on making the other side blink and is eager to signal that he will do whatever it takes to get his way\u2014even when he ultimately concedes.\n\nShutdown showdowns are particularly favorable for President Trump because they pit him against a political establishment that, as he sees it, stubbornly refuses to pay proper deference to his genius. He has repeatedly expressed frustration with Congress' unwillingness to defer to his leadership. Threatening to plunge the government into chaos\u2014to furlough, or in the case of essential personnel, withhold paychecks from hundreds of thousands of workers\u2014allows him to exact a cathartic form of retribution, reminding lawmakers just how uncomfortable he can make their lives.",
    " Title: Clinton Campaign Remains Confident Amidst Email Investigation, Citing Strong Ground Game and Early Voting Numbers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final week of the U.S. presidential race, Hillary Clinton's campaign is maintaining its momentum, asserting that its extensive ground game and early voting efforts have put it in a strong position. The sudden resurfacing of Clinton's private email server as a campaign issue, following FBI Director James Comey's announcement of newly discovered emails potentially relevant to the probe, is being viewed as a significant test for the Democratic nominee.\n\nCampaigning in Kent, Ohio, on Monday, Clinton downplayed the investigation, stating that voters have already made up their minds on the email issue. \"I think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all this,\" Clinton said. \"Now, what people are focused on is choosing the next president and commander-in-chief of the United States of America.\"\n\nThe Clinton campaign has built a robust infrastructure over the past 18 months, outperforming Republican opponent Donald Trump in fundraising and get-out-the-vote efforts. In the final weeks, Clinton has emphasized her campaign's Get Out the Vote and early voting campaigns, enlisting the help of high-profile celebrities like Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Katy Perry, and Jay-Z.\n\nEarly voting data show that over 3.5 million people have already voted in Florida, making up nearly one-quarter of all registered voters in the state, with Democrats outpacing 2012 vote-by-mail numbers. Similarly, in Nevada, where nearly one-quarter of registered voters have already cast their ballot, Democrats are outpacing Republicans by nearly 30,000. Clinton aides attribute this trend to the core of their base, particularly Hispanic voters, turning out in high numbers.\n\nHowever, the campaign is monitoring any potential damage from Comey's announcement. In some swing states, aides acknowledge that the FBI's renewed probe has created some volatility with voters. There is anecdotal evidence of Clinton volunteers fielding questions about the FBI's investigation while door-knocking over the weekend. On the flip side, the campaign has also seen evidence of Democrats who are now more eager to vote for Clinton as a way to rebuke the FBI.\n\nSince Friday, Clinton and her aides have maintained that Comey's action is unprecedented this close to an election and that there is nothing new to be discovered. Clinton has repeatedly stated that while she regrets using a private server, the FBI simply has \"no case.\"\n\nThe campaign is also pressing Comey, with top campaign officials criticizing his decision not to publicly comment on the Trump campaign's potential ties to alleged efforts by Russia to meddle with the U.S. election. Trump, on the other hand, is lauding Comey and his announcement, frequently using it to his advantage during campaign rallies.\n\nThroughout the general election, Clinton has consistently attacked Trump's temperament and readiness to be president, a strategy that her aides are confident has been effective in presenting a clear contrast between the two candidates to voters. Clinton continued this attack line on Monday in Ohio, questioning Trump's qualifications to be commander-in-chief.",
    " Title: Trump Rallies in Pennsylvania, Mocks Impeachment Process as \"Impeachment Lite\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rally held in Hershey, Pennsylvania on Tuesday, President Donald Trump mocked the ongoing impeachment inquiry, referring to it as \"impeachment lite.\" The President's visit to the key swing state followed a significant day at the U.S. Capitol, where House Democrats unveiled articles of impeachment and signaled their support for the President's long-sought United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA).\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her fellow Democrats are attempting to demonstrate their ability to pass legislation and pursue an impeachment inquiry simultaneously. However, Trump argued, \"It plays down the impeachment because they're embarrassed by the impeachment.\" He also stated, \"And our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment.\"\n\nThe President highlighted some of his achievements during his tenure, mentioning the killing of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the creation of the Space Force, and a strong economy. He reiterated, \"This country is so respected. And we were not respected four years ago. We were laughed at.\"\n\nTrump's comments came less than a week after he left a NATO meeting in London prematurely following the release of a video showing a few world leaders discussing him. In 2016, Trump won Pennsylvania, the first Republican presidential candidate to do so since 1988, by garnering support in Pennsylvania's rural areas and among working-class whites.\n\nThe President won the state and its 20 electoral votes by approximately 44,000 votes, and Pennsylvania is expected to be among several states that the presidential candidates will heavily target in their bid to reach the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. As most Democratic candidates focus on Iowa, New Hampshire, and other early voting states, the President has taken advantage of uncontested access to top general election swing states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\n\nHouse Democrats unveiled two articles of impeachment on Tuesday: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Democratic leaders claim that Trump put U.S. elections and national security at risk when he asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination. They also assert that Trump impeded Congress' investigation into the matter.\n\nIf the House votes to impeach Trump, the case moves to the Senate, where a two-thirds vote is required for conviction. With Republicans holding 53 of 100 seats, it is unlikely that Republican senators would cross party lines and vote to remove Trump from office.\n\nDuring the rally, Trump also addressed the long-awaited release of the Justice Department report into the 2016 Russia investigation. The inspector general found that the FBI was justified in opening its investigation into ties between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia and that the FBI did not act with political bias, despite \"serious performance failures\" up the bureau's chain of command.\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that the inspector general's report detailed \"outrageous, scandalous, and unprecedented abuses of power.\" He said FBI agents had \"destroyed the lives of people that are great people\" and called them \"scum.\" He also looked forward to a report from John Durham, the prosecutor whom Attorney General William Barr has selected to investigate how intelligence was gathered in the Russia probe.\n\nTrump stated Tuesday that not many leaders could withstand what he's been through. \"A regular president would be under the table, thumb in mouth, saying: 'Take me home, Mommy. This is enough for me.'\"",
    " Title: Breitbart's Traffic Decline: A Sharp Contrast to Early 2017 Numbers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the early days of the Trump administration, Breitbart News, with Steve Bannon as White House chief strategist, was on a trajectory to become a major player in the media landscape, boasting a passionate audience and unparalleled access. In November 2016, Breitbart was the 45th most trafficked website in the United States, surpassing Fox News, Huffington Post, Washington Post, and Buzzfeed, according to Alexa.com.\n\nHowever, a few months later, the story seems to have taken a different turn. As of May 26, 2017, according to the same web-ranking analytics company, Breitbart has dropped significantly, now ranking 64th, below Fox News (60th), Huffington Post (60th), Buzzfeed (50th), and The Washington Post (41st).\n\nThis decline is not isolated to Alexa's rankings. Other web-analytics companies also reflect a similar, unusually steep drop in Breitbart's traffic. ComScore estimated that Breitbart had nearly 23 million unique visitors during the month of November 2016, but only drew 10.7 million in April 2017, a 53% drop. Last month, the site had fewer visitors than it did in April 2016, when 12.3 million people visited the site.\n\nIn contrast, the four sites that Breitbart benchmarked itself against saw nowhere near that drop\u2014and, in the case of both Fox News and Buzzfeed, saw small increases in traffic since the November election.\n\nThe decline in Breitbart's traffic is not unique to the news industry. Other conservative media sites have also experienced declines in recent months, but none as pronounced as Breitbart's. According to Alexa data, National Review Online, Infowars.com, The Daily Caller, and Drudge Report all saw slumps in their rankings.\n\nOver the last week, as President Trump was engulfed in the Comey scandal, Fox News's viewership dropped to third place behind CNN and MSNBC for the first time in 17 years. The exact reasons for the decline in Breitbart's traffic are unclear, but the site's traffic graph in Alexa, the service that Breitbart cites when they celebrate their traffic goals, shows an oddly shaped graph, rocketing up to a high plateau where it remained over a period of months, then dropping back precipitously around April 30, Trump's 100-day mark.\n\nAn email to The Hive from an Alexa customer representative suggests that the traffic anomalies could have been caused by Breitbart enabling, then disabling, Alexa's certified-results feature, which temporarily created an apples-to-oranges comparison with sites that don't enable the feature, like The Washington Post. The dates the representative provided coincide perfectly with the dates that Breitbart's traffic spiked, and then plummeted.",
    " Title: Vice President's Office Disputes Comparison Between Elaine Chao and Rep. Ilhan Omar\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate surrounding President Donald Trump's controversial tweets targeting four Democratic congresswomen of color, the office of Vice President Mike Pence has disputed a comparison made between Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Darin Miller, the deputy press secretary for Vice President Pence, contends that the comparison, as reported in a previous article, misconstrues the comments made by Marc Short, Pence's chief of staff, during a Fox News interview.\n\nShort's comments, made on Monday, were in defense of Trump's tweets, suggesting that the President could not have had \"racist motives\" because he appointed Chao, a former secretary of labor during the George W. Bush era and wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), as the secretary of transportation.\n\nHowever, Miller argued that Chao and Omar have distinctly different perspectives, with Chao being an example of what the President supports: a legal immigrant who worked hard, assimilated, and is dedicated to giving back and serving her country. In contrast, Miller portrayed Omar as a critic of America who focuses on criticizing the country rather than finding solutions to problems she identifies, such as her opposition to the overwhelmingly bipartisan emergency border aid bill.\n\nThe office of the Vice President's characterization of Omar, however, has been met with criticism. The truth is there isn't a meaningful difference between Chao and Omar's immigration stories. Like Chao, Omar immigrated legally to the country and now serves in the federal government, albeit with a different agenda. Omar, along with many other of her Democratic colleagues, did not vote for the border bill due to policy disagreements.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the saga of Trump's racist tweets continues to unfold in Congress. Tuesday night, as the House of Representatives debated a vote on a resolution to officially condemn Trump's tweets, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ran afoul of an old House rule that prohibits lawmakers from insulting a president's character on the floor. Trump, of course, had something to say about it.",
    " Title: Santa Claus Makes an Appearance at Ted Cruz's Minnesota Rally, Collecting Data for Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nST. PAUL \u2014 In an unusual twist, the Cruz campaign incorporated a festive element during the first night of Senator Ted Cruz's seven-day, 12-city tour in Minnesota. A costumed Santa Claus, who posed with children and adults beside a fireplace, was present at the reception hall.\n\nHowever, the Santa's presence was not merely for holiday cheer. Visitors were handed cards directing them to Mr. Cruz's website, where they were asked to provide their names, email addresses, and ZIP codes.\n\nJeff Roe, Mr. Cruz's campaign manager, explained the strategy, stating, \"The Santa's presence is fun, but you still have to run a campaign when these are over. You can't just come out and do rallies and have nothing left when you leave except for a bunch of uneaten cookies. Now we're going to have living data of people. They'll have an experience they'll remember forever.\"\n\nThe campaign, known for its sophisticated data operation, had been brainstorming ways to connect with supporters since an August swing through several southern states. About 19,000 people attended 13 rallies during that trip, but the campaign was disappointed not to collect more information from them.\n\nPast efforts to amass voter data through photography had been too complicated and time-consuming, according to Mr. Roe, involving business card accumulation and handwritten names.\n\n\"So on Saturday, I had the idea: Let's have a Santa,\" Mr. Roe said. He instructed a staff member, who bore a resemblance, that if a proper Santa could not be located, he would be asked to don the suit.\n\n\"The Santa market is a little bumpy, so we had a lot of vetting to go through to get Santas,\" Mr. Roe said, adding that he hoped to have a Santa for every stop on the tour. \"We got this Santa today.\"\n\nThat Santa was Red Bartholomew, a 64-year-old supporter with past performances at Tea Party events, fund-raisers, and church functions.\n\nMr. Bartholomew said the campaign had reached him through his work with \"constitutional-minded people,\" noting that he was a member of Overpasses for America, a group that flies flags and posts signs\u2014often sharply critical of Barack Obama\u2014along pedestrian overpasses.\n\nIn Mr. Cruz, he seems to have found a kindred spirit. In an interview, Mr. Bartholomew summarized his worldview (\"I have no fear\"), described an alternative character he has portrayed (\"some people call me Liberty Claus\"), and lamented the burdensome Santa industry regulations that had in the past hamstrung his work.\n\n\"You ever heard of Santa Claus University? Yes, there's a Santa Claus University,\" Mr. Bartholomew said. \"After seeing regulations, I went, 'Oh for crying out loud, it's just Santa Claus.'\"\n\nHe added, admiringly, that \"part of what Ted is about is, we've gotten tied up in regulations.\"\n\nHe also suggested that his history as a protester had earned him some enemies. \"I've been dealing with the police for years,\" he said. \"They know who I am and they don't scare me.\"\n\nMr. Bartholomew seemed to betray little of his biography to the well-wishers on his knee.\n\nSupporters of Mr. Cruz appeared broadly grateful to see him, though many of them snapped photos on their phones and left before anyone could assign them a \"photo number\" and hand them a card that read: \"Merry Christmas! Get your photo at tedcruz.org/christmastphotos.\"\n\nMary Kay Storhaug, 45, from Andover, Minn., said Mr. Bartholomew had provided a welcome distraction for her children during the rally.\n\n\"Santa's there, there's free candy canes for the kids to keep them from yelling,\" she said.\n\nMr. Roe said the photos were part of building \"a lasting relationship\" with voters, particularly in states like Minnesota that often receive little attention from candidates until just before voting begins.\n\n\"When they do engage with a presidential campaign, I want it to be a meaningful engagement that lasts for hopefully their whole life and our whole life,\" Mr. Roe said.\n\nStill, at least one attendee seemed wary of letting his information reach the wrong hands.\n\nMr. Bartholomew, asked to provide a phone number where he could be reached, said he would not answer his landline unless a caller left a message.\n\n\"I have to screen my calls,\" he said, \"for a lot of different reasons.\"",
    " Title: The Evolution of Senator Ron Johnson: From Tea Party Pioneer to Establishment Figure\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2010, Wisconsin businessman Ron Johnson was hailed as the face of the Tea Party movement by political commentator George Will. A self-proclaimed fan of Ayn Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged,\" Johnson, then a political neophyte, launched his campaign for the Senate through Tea Party rallies across Wisconsin.\n\nDuring a Madison Tea Party rally, Johnson expressed his conservative ideals, stating, \"We need to elect true conservatives, not politicians but citizen legislators, people who actually listen to us. People who will tell the truth and in the end will do what actually needs to be done.\"\n\nHowever, in a recent interview at the Republican Leadership Conference, Johnson seemed to distance himself from the Tea Party movement, stating, \"I think the conservative movement may just be maturing a little bit. You can be very doctrinaire, you can demand purity, but in the end if you want to advance policy that you want enacted, you have to win elections.\"\n\nJohnson's comments come after a series of Tea Party losses in recent elections. He also mentioned that the Tea Party movement's groups may not represent all individuals in the movement, suggesting a divide between the grassroots and certain organizations.\n\nThe senator's comments have sparked speculation about the nature of this divide. Some believe Johnson is referring to groups like Americans for Prosperity, a Tea Party organization closely associated with the Koch brothers. Johnson has been referred to as the Koch brothers' \"model senator\" by political journalist Ken Vogel.\n\nJohnson's evolving relationship with the Tea Party and the Koch brothers raises questions about his commitment to the movement that propelled him to political power. As the Republican Party continues to grapple with internal divisions, Johnson's evolving stance may serve as a microcosm of the broader struggle for control within the party.",
    " Title: Sequester Impasse: Washington Braces for Austerity as Obama and Republicans Dig In\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing standoff between President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans over the $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester, there is no immediate resolution in sight. The sequester, designed to be so severe that it would discourage its implementation, has become a stalemate, with neither side showing signs of compromise.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) admitted in a recent interview that the full impact of the sequester is not fully understood. The cuts, initially intended to be so onerous that they would be unacceptable, have been accepted by Republicans as the only guaranteed way to reduce government spending.\n\nThe sequester could potentially be less severe than anticipated, but both parties are reluctant to risk a government shutdown over sequester politics. The cuts, if left unaltered, could mark a new era in Washington, signaling a temporary halt in the emergency budget wars that have dominated the capital since Republicans took control of the House in 2011.\n\nCongress could pass legislation to mitigate the impact of the sequester, potentially allowing department heads to target the cuts more precisely. A Republican-sponsored bill aimed at this goal failed in the Senate last week, but it could be rewritten to attract Democratic support, particularly from military states, where representatives might seek to demonstrate their efforts to help constituents while potentially conflicting with the president's stance. House Republicans are also planning to vote on a bill that aims to make the budget cuts more manageable for the military and veterans.\n\nHowever, administration officials argue that even added flexibility would not significantly alter the overall impact of the sequester. Gene Sperling, White House economics adviser, stated on ABC's \"This Week\" that the cuts would result in the loss of 750,000 jobs, comparing the situation to choosing which fingers to amputate.\n\nIf the sequester remains in place until the end of the fiscal year in September, it would signal a pause in the budget wars that have dominated Washington since 2011. The debt limit would not need to be raised until May at the earliest, and it could potentially stretch until August, according to calculations by top-level aides. The prevailing wisdom in the Capitol is that House Republicans cannot demand concessions in exchange for extending the country's borrowing authority, as they lost that right when they agreed to lift the ceiling in January without insisting on an equal amount of cuts.",
    " Title: Donald Trump and Jeb Bush Tied in GOP Presidential Race, According to New Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent poll conducted by Reuters-Ipsos, businessman Donald Trump and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush have found themselves in a virtual tie for the lead in the race for the 2016 Republican U.S. presidential nomination. Trump, a real estate mogul, garnered the support of 15.8 percent of respondents, while Bush received 16.1 percent.\n\nThe poll, which surveyed self-identified Republicans, also showed New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in third place with 9.5 percent, followed by Kentucky Senator Rand Paul with 8.1 percent, surgeon and author Ben Carson with 7.2 percent, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker with 5.8 percent.\n\nHowever, when respondents were given a choice of three candidates - Bush, Trump, or Florida Senator Marco Rubio - Bush had a comfortable lead at 42 percent, compared to 28.4 percent for Trump and 20 percent for Rubio.\n\nIn the Democratic presidential nomination race, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton remained in the lead with the support of 48.3 percent of self-identified Democrats polled, with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in second place at 22.9 percent and Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet entered the race, in third place with 10.7 percent.\n\nThe poll was conducted from July 6-10 and surveyed 404 self-identified Republicans age 18 or over, with a credibility interval of 5.7 percentage points. In the Democratic race, 504 self-identified Democrats age 18 or over were surveyed over the same time period, with a credibility interval of 5.1 percentage points.\n\nThe poll results come after numerous businesses, including NBC Universal, Univision, Macy's, Serta, and NASCAR, cut ties with Trump following his controversial comments about illegal immigration. In his June 16 speech announcing his candidacy, Trump accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals into the United States. On July 6, Trump added that illegal border-crossers from Mexico are carrying \"tremendous infectious disease.\"\n\nThe controversy over Trump's immigration comments has dominated news coverage of the Republican campaign in recent weeks, and he has climbed in the polls to draw essentially even with Bush. On June 30, the poll had Bush at 16.9 percent and Trump at 12.8 percent.\n\nA hard line against illegal immigration may find a receptive audience in Republican primary voters, with U.S. conservatives often accusing President Barack Obama of doing too little to secure America's border with Mexico. Trump has also come under fire from some of his rivals for the Republican nomination, including Bush.\n\n\"Everybody has a belief that we should control our borders,\" Bush said last week. \"But to make these extraordinarily kind of ugly comments is not reflective of the Republican Party. Trump is wrong on this.\"\n\nThe Reuters-Ipsos poll is the latest in a series of surveys that have shown Trump gaining ground in the Republican race. However, it remains to be seen whether Trump's controversial comments on immigration will ultimately hurt or help his campaign.",
    " Title: The Detrimental Impact of Trade Wars and Recessions on Global Economy and Workforce\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate on economic policies, it is crucial to acknowledge the detrimental effects of trade wars and recessions on both domestic and international economies. While a recession may seem like a potential solution to political unrest, it is essential to understand the far-reaching consequences that such an economic downturn could have on employment, livelihoods, and mental health.\n\nThe past few recessions in the United States have led to so-called jobless recoveries, where the labor market struggles for years even after GDP starts growing. This prolonged unemployment could be particularly harmful to low-skill, routine-based jobs, as companies may accelerate their adoption of labor-saving technology during economic downturns.\n\nFor instance, a retail giant like CVS might use a recession to fully automate the customer-checkout process, leading to job losses among cashiers. This could result in a concentration of pain among the poorest workers, who might struggle to find new employment opportunities in a tight labor market.\n\nMoreover, the progress made in wage growth for the poor, a remarkable reversal of the past few decades, could be undone with rising unemployment for low-skill workers. They would lose their leverage with employers, leading to stagnant or decreasing wages.\n\nFurthermore, the deplorable treatment of migrants at U.S. border facilities has been a moral stain on the Trump administration. However, if one cares about the lives of Central Americans after they cross the U.S. border, it is crucial to consider their living conditions before they cross or even if they don't cross any border at all.\n\nA global downturn that reduces growth in the U.S., the largest trading partner of Central America, would immediately worsen the lives of this hemisphere's most vulnerable workers. Therefore, it is essential to approach economic policies with a nuanced understanding of their potential impacts on both domestic and international economies and workforces.",
    " Title: Beto O'Rourke Releases Tax Returns, Shows Income of $370,412 in 2017\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Texas Representative Beto O'Rourke, a 2020 presidential candidate, has released his tax returns for the years 2008 through 2017, following other candidates in the race, including Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris.\n\nAccording to the tax returns, O'Rourke and his wife, Amy Sanders O'Rourke, reported a total income of $370,412 in 2017, the latest year reported. The couple plans to release their 2018 tax return \"as soon as possible after they are filed,\" according to a campaign news release.\n\nThe O'Rourkes' largest annual income in the 10-year period was $496,280 in 2009, when they reported a $272,775 gain from an investment partnership. Their lowest reported income in the 10-year period was $163,539 in 2012, the year after O'Rourke left the El Paso City Council and just before he took his seat as a United States congressman in January 2013.\n\nIn 2017, the O'Rourkes reported selling Stanton Street Technology, the El Paso Internet web design firm started by Beto O'Rourke about 20 years ago, for $300,000, making a net gain of $195,627 after costs. However, they ended up losing $3,000 after all capital gains and losses were calculated for that year, according to their income tax return.\n\nO'Rourke earned $162,211 for serving in Congress in 2017, according to his tax return. His wife, who works for the Council on Regional Economic Expansion and Educational Development (CREEED), an El Paso business leaders group aimed at improving education levels in the El Paso area, reported $53,364 in income. She is the group's Choose to Excel director, according to its website.\n\nThe O'Rourkes paid $81,019 in federal income tax in 2017. They paid $88,798 in 2009, when they had their largest reported income. Other Democratic presidential candidates have released their tax returns, including Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and California Senator Kamala Harris.\n\nSanders' 2018 return showed he and his wife, Jane, earned more than $550,000, including $133,000 in income from his Senate salary and $391,000 in sales of his book, \"Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In,\" according to the Associated Press. He made more than $1 million in 2017 from his U.S. Senate salary and sales and royalties from his books.\n\nHarris' 2018 returns showed she and her husband had an adjusted gross joint income of about $1.9 million last year, The AP reported.",
    " Title: Unsealed Trump University Files Detail Sales Tactics Targeting Financial Vulnerabilities\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, more than 400 pages of Trump University files have been made public, offering an unprecedented insight into the sales tactics used by Donald Trump's business empire. The documents, which are central to a class-action lawsuit against Trump University in California, were released by US district court judge Gonzalo Curiel on Tuesday.\n\nThe documents detail how Trump University staff were instructed to target prospective students' financial weaknesses to encourage them to sign up for a $34,995 Gold Elite three-day package. The courses, which are now subject to legal proceedings from unhappy clients, are at the heart of a controversy surrounding Trump's business practices.\n\nThe documents contain an undated \"personal message\" from Trump to new enrollees at the school: \"Only doers get rich. I know that in these three packed days, you will learn everything to make a million dollars within the next 12 months.\"\n\nThe courses are now the subject of a class-action lawsuit, with New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman renewing his attacks on Trump on Tuesday. \"You are not allowed to protect the trade secrets of a three-card Monte game,\" Schneiderman said ahead of the document's release. \"If you look at the facts of this case, this shows someone who was absolutely shameless in his willingness to lie to people, to say whatever it took to induce them into his phony seminars,\" Schneiderman said.\n\nThe playbook contains long sections telling Trump U team members how to identify buyers and push them to sign up for the most expensive package, and to put the cost on their credit cards. The documents also reveal that if potential students hesitate, teachers are told to read a script designed to push them towards the Gold Elite package.\n\nThe documents' release comes despite Trump's repeated public attacks on Judge Curiel, who is American and was born in Indiana. Trump has called Curiel a \"hater\" and a \"total disgrace,\" and has attacked him further on Twitter and at a press conference in New York on Monday.\n\nThe documents' release is significant as Trump is the front-runner in the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential race, and has placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue. The documents offer a rare glimpse into the business practices of one of the most controversial figures in American politics.",
    " Title: Presidential Debate: Obama and Romney Clash in Final Showdown, Displaying Moderated Tone and Agreeing on Some Foreign Policy Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final presidential debate of the 2012 election cycle, President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney faced off in Boca Raton, Florida, in a more subdued and less confrontational setting compared to their previous encounter. The debate, the last before a two-week sprint of campaigning, focused primarily on foreign policy, although it occasionally dipped into economic and budgetary matters.\n\nThe debate marked a departure from the candidates' previous encounter, which was marred by interruptions and bickering. This time, the candidates were seated next to each other, allowing for a more civil exchange of ideas, despite their clear differences.\n\nRomney accused Obama of overseeing a decline in American influence, citing Iran as an example of a country that has been emboldened under the current administration. Obama, in response, characterized Romney as being \"all over the map\" on foreign policy, claiming that the Republican nominee's positions were either incorrect or similar to his own, but with a louder tone.\n\nRomney, who has been trailing Obama in polls for much of the campaign but has recently seen a surge, appeared at times to chide Obama for being too aggressive. In response to Obama's assertion that Romney's foreign policy positions were wrong, Romney retorted, \"Attacking me is not an agenda.\"\n\nBoth candidates found common ground on several issues, including ruling out military action in Syria, continuing to support sanctions against Iran, and supporting the withdrawal timetable in Afghanistan. Romney rejected Obama's suggestion that he would be eager to engage in war with countries like Iran, and dismissed Obama's claims that Romney would revert to the foreign policies of the previous administration.\n\nRomney's main criticism of Obama was that he had not provided a clear example of American leadership on the world stage, whether it be in Syria, Iran, or Russia. Obama, in turn, sought to portray Romney as unsteady and out of his depth on foreign policy matters. The president employed sharp, at times sarcastic, language to cast Romney as inexperienced and out of touch with the complexities of foreign policy.\n\nThe debate touched on several hot-button issues, including the Libya terror attacks, Iran's nuclear ambitions, and the ongoing conflict in Syria. However, the most contentious topic, the Libya terror attacks, was barely addressed, with Romney making only one reference to the September 11 attack in Benghazi.\n\nThe 90-minute debate, moderated by CBS News' Bob Schieffer, offered both candidates a final opportunity to make a significant impact on the race, with just two weeks remaining until Election Day. The debates this month have been among the most consequential in modern campaign history, with Romney entering the debates as the slight underdog but surging in recent polls. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll on Sunday showed the president and Romney tied at 47 percent nationally, while a Suffolk University survey released Monday showed the two tied at 47 percent in the crucial swing state of Ohio. Other recent polls have given Obama a slight edge.",
    " Title: Revised Job Figures Suggest Obama as Net Job Creator in U.S. Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, new data released by the Labor Department on Thursday indicates that President Obama may now be a net job creator, with the U.S. economy having added back 4.4 million jobs since his inauguration in 2009. This figure surpasses the 4.3 million jobs lost in the year following his inauguration.\n\nThe jobs recovery has been a gradual process, with jobs trickling back since early 2010, particularly in professional services, health care, and manufacturing. As of August, the Labor Department had indicated about 4 million jobs had been recovered overall. However, these figures have been revised, with the Labor Department using unemployment insurance records that employers are required to file.\n\nThe revised figures show that the economy has recovered 4.4 million jobs since early 2010, enough to fully account for the jobs lost in Obama's first term. In fact, Obama would be ahead by exactly 125,000 jobs.\n\nPresident Obama's economic adviser, Alan Krueger, in a blog post on Thursday, acknowledged the new data, stating, \"The jobs recovery over the last 2.5 years has been a bit stronger than initially reported, although much work remains to be done to return to full employment.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, still has ample material to criticize Obama on economic issues. Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, stated, \"President Obama's administration promised, with the passage of the stimulus, that unemployment would currently be at 5.4% with 9 million more people working.\"\n\n\"With unemployment at 8% or higher for the 43rd consecutive month and 23 million Americans struggling for work, President Obama's policies have failed miserably by his own standards,\" Saul added.\n\nIt is important to note that the jobs decline started before Obama entered office, and employment is still far below 2007 levels. Hiring has barely been strong enough to keep up with population growth, and that's why the unemployment rate is still stuck at 8.1%. A survey of households shows the U.S. population has grown 3.8% since Obama entered office, but jobs have only grown by 1.5% over that same time period. About 12.5 million Americans were still counted as unemployed in August.\n\nThis new data provides a fresh perspective on the economic recovery under President Obama, but it also underscores the significant challenges that remain in achieving full employment.",
    " Title: Former Obama Administration Officials Criticize Trump's Decision to Withdraw from Iran Nuclear Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets and statements, former Obama administration officials have expressed their disapproval of President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\n\nFormer United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power tweeted, \"I will never forget the dark cloud that hung over the White House in the years Iran was advancing its nuclear program while Obama was briefed on all the risks of using military force.\" She added, \"Trump has demolished America's credibility and paved the way for Iran to restart its nuclear program.\"\n\nBen Rhodes, a former Obama national security aide and amateur-fiction-writer-turned-professional-fiction-writer, tweeted, \"One tragicomic element of Trump's presidency is that the more he tries to tear down Obama's legacy, the bigger he makes Obama look.\"\n\nFormer Secretary of State John Kerry, who has been traveling the world in an attempt to conduct his own personal foreign policy on behalf of the Iranian government, stated, \"Today's announcement weakens our security, breaks America's word, isolates us from our European allies, puts Israel at greater risk, empowers Iran's hardliners, and reduces our global leverage to address Tehran's misbehavior.\"\n\nObama himself stated, \"Walking away from the JCPOA turns our back on America's closest allies.\"\n\nIn response to these statements, it is important to note that Iran has been actively pursuing a campaign of terrorism in Yemen and Syria, sponsoring the takeover of Lebanon by the terrorist group Hezbollah, funding the Palestinian terror group Hamas, and developing long-range ballistic missiles while leading chants saying \"Death to America.\"\n\nFurthermore, it is important to acknowledge that the Obama administration repeatedly lied to the American people about the Iran deal. When Kerry says that the deal will \"empower Iran's hardliners,\" he is repeating an outright fabrication, as the hardliners are in charge of the government, and the deal strengthened them. When Power speaks as though Obama alleviated the possibility of Iran's nuclear program, she is lying, as the deal explicitly paved the way for an Iranian nuclear program free and clear of consequences from the international order. When Obama speaks as though our Middle East allies were pleased by the deal, he is lying, as they all opposed it, and they are all celebrating its end.\n\nIn conclusion, President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal has been met with criticism from former Obama administration officials. However, it is important to consider the actions of Iran in the region and the lies told by the Obama administration about the deal.",
    " Title: A Debate on Felon Voting Rights: Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Pete Buttigieg Take Stances\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent town hall event, Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Pete Buttigieg discussed the issue of felon voting rights, with Sanders and Harris expressing support for allowing convicted felons to vote while incarcerated, and Buttigieg rejecting the idea.\n\nSanders argued that the right to vote is a matter of principle and that opposing the idea of felons voting while incarcerated is akin to endorsing GOP-backed voter suppression efforts. Harris also expressed openness to the idea, but later walked back her comments after realizing the proposal's unpopularity.\n\nButtigieg, on the other hand, flatly rejected the notion, earning strong applause from the Democratic audience. CNN's anchors seemed surprised by Sanders' stance, with some arguing that the idea of allowing convicted terrorists to vote from their Supermax prisons was extreme.\n\nSaikat Chakrabarti, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, tweeted that there was no reason not to let incarcerated people vote, arguing that the people most affected by unjust laws should have a say in electing people to change them.\n\nHowever, many critics argue that the right to vote is a privilege that should be earned after serving a sentence. Guy Benson, a conservative commentator, questioned why non-violent felons should be allowed to vote while those convicted of violent crimes, such as armed robbery or assault, should not.\n\nOthers argue that the right to vote is a fundamental right of eligible US citizens, and that felons, who have broken the law, should not be allowed to participate in the process of shaping laws while they are still imprisoned for their crimes. Critics also point out that felons are already deprived of many other rights, such as the right to bear arms, freedom of speech, and the right to privacy.\n\nThe debate over felon voting rights is likely to continue as the 2020 presidential election approaches, with some candidates advocating for criminal justice reform and others taking a more conservative stance on the issue.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Purchases Illinois Prison for Overcrowding Relief, Not Guantanamo Housing, Officials Assert\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at alleviating overcrowding in high-security prisons and creating jobs, the Obama administration has announced its decision to purchase the Thomson Correctional Center, an under-used state prison located 150 miles west of Chicago. The purchase, which is estimated to cost $165 million, has sparked controversy, with some Republican lawmakers suggesting it could potentially serve as a future home for Guantanamo detainees.\n\nHowever, administration officials have vehemently denied any intention of using the Thomson Correctional Center as a new home for Guantanamo inmates. Instead, they maintain that the purchase is solely a means to address the 50 percent overcrowding in high-security prisons.\n\n\"This is about public safety,\" a Justice Department official stated. \"We are not planning to house Guantanamo detainees in Illinois.\"\n\nRepublican Rep. Frank Wolf, who opposes the federal purchase of the prison, argued Tuesday that the Obama administration could still potentially carry out its plan by moving prisoners from another federal prison to Thomson, and then using that prison to house Guantanamo detainees.\n\n\"The president says his goal is to shut down Guantanamo Bay and move the prisoners here,\" Wolf told Fox News, accusing the administration of circumventing Congress. \"This gives him a great opportunity to do it, particularly right after the election.\"\n\nWolf chairs a key House subcommittee overseeing the sale. He was referring to President Obama's pledge immediately after taking office that he would shut down the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, a promise that remains unfulfilled.\n\nThe move to transfer prisoners stateside, though, has been met with a fierce backlash among some lawmakers, who worry it would pose a security risk. The Obama administration and the Federal Bureau of Prisons insist the purchase of the Illinois prison is strictly a move to ease overcrowding.\n\nIllinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin and Gov. Pat Quinn announced the move, stating that the creation of hundreds of construction jobs and over 1,000 permanent jobs at the federal facility would result from this action.\n\n\"After facing a political standoff in the House of Representatives, I went directly to the president and asked him to take this action,\" Durbin said in a statement.\n\nHouse Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., warned his committee would oppose the purchase.\n\n\"The Obama administration has been trying for years to open Thompson prison in order to transfer terrorists from Guantanamo Bay onto U.S. soil,\" Rogers said. \"This back-door move by the Obama administration to open Thompson and reject the will of Congress and the American people is dangerously irresponsible and will be met with the full and unfettered opposition of the Appropriations Committee.\"\n\nThomson was built in 2001, but budget troubles kept it from fully opening.",
    " Title: Clinton Takes Aim at Trump in National Security Speech, Aims to Appeal to Broader Center in General Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising move, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton delivered a scathing speech on national security on Monday, taking aim at presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump rather than her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders. The speech, billed as a national security address, lacked new proposals but was a forceful rebuke of Trump, as Clinton framed her pitch in patriotic terms that could also resonate with Republicans.\n\nClinton presented herself as the real defender of American values and a commander-in-chief with a steady hand who believed in America as an exceptional country. In contrast, she portrayed Trump as someone who believes America is weak and an embarrassment.\n\nSpeaking in San Diego, a city with 95,000 military personnel, Clinton said, \"Donald Trump believes America is weak. An embarrassment. He called our military a disaster. He said we are, and I quote, a third-world country.\"\n\nClinton was introduced by the spouse of an active duty naval officer and spoke with 20 US flags prominently displayed behind her. Although still fighting a primary, Clinton is clearly making a play for independent and Republican voters who are concerned about Trump's erratic foreign policy pronouncements but also his statements on women, Mexican immigrants, and Muslims.\n\nOn Thursday, the head of Hispanic media relations for the Republican National Committee, Ruth Guerra, resigned. Clinton has always had the potential to appeal to moderate Republicans turned off by their party's stance on social issues such as gay marriage, abortion, and even guns, but who feel she is tough enough on foreign policy.\n\nIn late April, during her speech after her victory in the Pennsylvania primary, Clinton appealed to \"thoughtful\" Republicans, independents, and Democrats to stand together against divisive candidates on the Republican side. Although House speaker Paul Ryan finally endorsed Donald Trump on Thursday after weeks of hesitation, prominent Republicans are not rushing actively to back the presumptive Republican nominee just yet. At least nine Republican governors, and a number of senators, are steering clear from their party convention in July.\n\nThere has also been a trickle of lifelong, prominent Republicans who openly say they will vote for a Democrat for the first time in their life in November. Clinton's message on American global leadership may not resonate widely with the GOP base, which is turning more isolationist, but it is finding an audience with many moderates and foreign policy thinkers.\n\nOn Twitter, the hashtag #RepublicansforHillary was trending for a day this week, after an interview on US cable TV with a former Reagan administration official, Doug Elmets, who said that \"four years of Hillary Clinton is better than one day with Donald Trump as president.\" Widely quoted in the US media was retired army colonel Peter Mansoor, a former aide to General David Petraeus during the Iraq war.\n\nMr. Mansoor said he would be voting for Clinton not because he had converted to being a Democrat, but because Trump was dangerous. Elections are not won on Twitter and a handful of Republicans won't tip the balance in November, but the chatter on social media is bringing out voices from the Republican party silent during the raucous days of the Republican primaries and raising questions about a ripple effect.\n\nTrump has been criticized by leading names such as former secretary of defense Robert Gates, former CIA director Michael Hayden, former Bush administration spokesperson Tony Fratto, historian Max Boot, and commentator David Frum, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush. Clinton campaign aides were not willing to discuss their strategy to appeal to moderate Republicans, especially while the Democratic primary is still underway. But they acknowledged there were Republicans, particularly those concerned with foreign policy issues, who could support her.\n\nVin Weber, a Republican strategist and former congressman who supported Jeb Bush in the primaries, said Clinton should enlist Republican advisors. \"If she were campaigning like her husband, she would move to the center, and try to get votes that are not locked up by the Republican Party,\" said Mr. Weber, who said he was still doing some hard thinking about how to vote in November.\n\nDemocratic pollster Stanley Greenberg says a recent poll shows moderate Republicans represent a \"stunning 31% of the GOP base.\" \"They are disproportionately college graduates in a white, working-class party, and they are socially liberal,\" said Greenberg. On marriage equality, climate change, or abortion rights, those GOP moderates are more in sync with the Democratic party. The poll, conducted in February when all the Republican candidates were still in the race, showed that 10% of Republican moderates would vote for Clinton.\n\nKori Schake, a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution, said Clinton's challenge would be to convince anti-Trump Republicans they actually need to vote for her - not simply refrain from voting for Trump. \"Republican refuseniks are not enough to make a difference,\" she said. Schake said presenting Trump as dangerous was an effective strategy, but it was also key for Clinton to frame her pitch in economic terms. She had to press home the damage she believed a Trump presidency would cause to the economy - but to do so would require moving decisively to the right of Sanders, and risk alienating many in her own party.\n\n\"I've just come back from Cuba, and I've seen what a Sanders economy looks like,\" said Schake. Clinton will seek to unify the Democratic party ahead of the convention, but to win those moderates Republicans, she will now need to present herself not just as the candidate of her party's middle but of America's center.",
    " Title: President Obama to Discuss Economic Opportunity and Poverty at Georgetown Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to address the ongoing issues of poverty and racial tension in the United States, President Barack Obama will participate in a three-day Catholic-Evangelical leadership summit on poverty at Georgetown University. The summit, inspired by a call from Pope Francis, aims to focus on the pressing issue of poverty.\n\nThe President's involvement in the summit comes amidst a series of high-profile confrontations between law enforcement and African-American communities, which he believes are often rooted in a lack of economic opportunities. White House aide Jerry Abramson, in an email to supporters, stated, \"These issues are not new. What we are witnessing in cities across America is not only about policing. This is also about opportunity.\"\n\nThe President's remarks follow the unrest in Baltimore last month, sparked by the death of a black man in police custody. In response, President Obama described the tensions between minority communities and police departments as a \"slow-rolling crisis\" that has been simmering for decades in the U.S.\n\nAt the summit, President Obama is expected to discuss the need for more opportunities for urban children. Jerry Abramson, the White House director of intergovernmental affairs and former mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, emphasized, \"Unfortunately, in America, too many young people are limited by the ZIP code into which they are born.\"\n\nSince his first day in office, President Obama has been actively working to address these issues. His efforts include rebuilding the economy, protecting civil rights, expanding college access, providing tax credits to working families, and targeting more resources to high-poverty neighborhoods. The White House reiterated that the President does not view this conversation as one to be had only in response to the latest tragedy, but as an ongoing, critical dialogue for the nation.",
    " Title: US, Canada Reach Last-Minute Deal on USMCA, Updating NAFTA\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the United States and Canada have reached a last-minute agreement on Sunday night, marking the conclusion of a weeks-long impasse in the negotiations to update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The new agreement, now known as the USMCA - the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement - is an updated version of the original trilateral agreement between the three countries.\n\nIn a joint statement late Sunday, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland announced that they, along with Mexico, had reached a \"new, modernized trade agreement.\" The statement read, \"USMCA will give our workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses a high-standard trade agreement that will result in freer markets, fairer trade, and robust economic growth in our region.\"\n\nThe breakthrough came as a reversal of the tense negotiations, particularly the hardline stance taken by President Donald Trump and his administration. Last week, the US had indicated its readiness to move ahead with a bilateral deal between the US and Mexico, potentially leaving Canada out. However, a bilateral text was held off on Friday, to allow for negotiations between the US and Canada to update the decades-old NAFTA over the weekend.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hailed the agreement as a \"good day for Canada,\" while President Trump, in a series of tweets on Monday, congratulated both Canada and Mexico, calling it a \"great deal for all three countries.\"\n\nSenior Trump administration officials have described the deal as a significant win for the US, Canada, and Mexico, fulfilling one of President Trump's key campaign promises. The deal addresses several contentious issues that had stalled negotiations over the past month.\n\nOne of the key issues was the US's demand for greater access to Canada's dairy market. According to senior Trump administration officials, the US has secured \"a good deal for American farmers\" on this front, with the deal also calling for the elimination of Class 7 milk pricing, a new dairy class created by Canada that US dairy farmers argued decreased their ability to export to Canada.\n\nCanada, on the other hand, had sought to preserve NAFTA's Chapter 19, an independent panel set up to resolve special trade disputes. Though it's renumbered in the final USMCA agreement, the provision remains largely intact. Canada also sought protections from Section 232 tariffs, the mechanism used by the Trump administration to impose steel and aluminum tariffs, which require a national security justification. Accommodations will be made to protect Canada from tariffs on automobiles, but Canada did not secure guarantees over steel and aluminum tariffs, which will be addressed separately.\n\nThe USMCA incorporates components of the bilateral agreement between the US and Mexico, including rules of origin for automobiles, new digital trade rules, intellectual property protections, and strengthened labor rules. The agreement is expected to bring about freer markets, fairer trade, and robust economic growth in the region, as stated in the joint announcement.",
    " Title: Strategic Advice for a Potential Republican Presidential Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Republican primary season nears its conclusion, and with the possibility of becoming the party's nominee and potentially the next President of the United States, this article offers strategic advice to help close the gap between the current 40 percent support and the coveted 50 percent majority. The focus is on the need to address four key areas: tone, factual accuracy, policy knowledge, and policy announcements.\n\n1. Tone: The candidate's aggressive and divisive rhetoric, including personal attacks on opponents and inflammatory tweets, is driving away potential voters. To win over the remaining 10 percentage points, the candidate should choose smarter fights, engage in less belittling and pejorative language, and focus on making provocative points in a more measured manner.\n\n2. Factual Accuracy: The candidate's frequent inaccuracies in statements and anecdotes, such as misrepresenting poll numbers, trade deficits, and historical events, raise doubts about the candidate's substantive knowledge. To build trust and credibility, the candidate should strive for factual accuracy in their statements.\n\n3. Policy Knowledge: The candidate's lack of familiarity with key issues, such as abortion, has alienated potential voters. To demonstrate a thoughtful and knowledgeable approach, the candidate should invest time in learning about a variety of issues and seek advice from trusted sources in Washington.\n\n4. Policy Announcements: As an outsider with business experience, the candidate can surprise and grow support by delivering a small number of policy addresses on various issues, such as energy policy, corporate welfare, and agriculture policy. This will demonstrate the candidate's ability to govern and address the country's challenges.\n\n5. Avoid Citing Polls: The candidate's frequent references to polls can come across as self-centered and detract from the issues that matter to voters. To avoid this perception, the candidate should focus on the hopes and dreams of the electorate, rather than relying on polls to define their campaign.\n\nThe candidate's success in the past can be attributed to their outsider's bravado, but to win over the remaining 10 percentage points, the candidate must demonstrate a more thoughtful and knowledgeable approach. The candidate's best moments have come when demonstrating a more measured tone, as seen in the Super Tuesday news conference at Mar-A-Lago and the policy speech to AIPAC. Ultimately, the candidate cannot win without earning a majority of the vote.",
    " Title: Senate's Three-Day Sessions: A Potential Barrier to Supreme Court Recess Appointments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the race to fill the vacant seat has sparked a political standoff between the White House and the Republican-led Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed not to consider any nominee President Obama may submit, and if he holds firm, the President may resort to a recess appointment. However, the GOP has a strategy to prevent this: scheduling three-day sessions every three days.\n\nAccording to the Constitution, the House and Senate must meet every three days unless there is an agreement between the two bodies to go on recess. With the Supreme Court nomination battle intensifying, it is unlikely that the Senate will agree to a recess in the near future. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan can simply schedule what are called \"pro-forma\" sessions at three-day intervals for the rest of the year.\n\nPro-forma sessions are brief meetings of the House and Senate, lasting only a minute or two, and sometimes, a matter of seconds. During these sessions, the Senate does not conduct any business, and the House and Senate do not consider themselves adjourned or on recess. This means that if the Senate continues to hold pro-forma sessions, it will block a recess appointment for the remainder of the President's term.\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, when Democrats still controlled the Senate, Republicans in the House refused to agree to an adjournment resolution to block Obama from making recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). As a result, the House and Senate met every three days. In early 2012, the President made four recess appointments in the window between the three-day pro-forma sessions. However, the Supreme Court later voided those appointments, stating that the Senate was indeed in session, and the three-day sessions were a means to block the recess appointments.\n\nThe strategy of meeting every three days to prevent recess appointments is not a new tactic. In 2003, during the final two years of President George W. Bush's term, the Democrat-controlled Senate met every few days to block Bush from making a recess appointment. In 2003, Senate Republicans criticized minority Democrats for holding up a number of judicial nominations, particularly the nomination of Judge Bill Pryor to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Georgia. Democrats filibustered Pryor, and during a summertime adjournment, Bush appointed Pryor without the Senate's advice and consent.\n\nAs the political standoff over the Supreme Court vacancy continues, it remains to be seen whether the Democrats will try to force the Republicans to take a vote this summer. However, the Republicans are well-prepared to prevent a recess appointment by simply meeting every three days.",
    " Title: Protesters Confront Sen. Ted Cruz at Washington Restaurant Over Kavanaugh Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a heated incident on Monday night, Sen. Ted Cruz was driven out of an upscale restaurant by a group of protesters chanting \"We believe survivors.\" The incident, which was captured on video and shared on social media, took place at Fiola, an Italian restaurant in Washington's Penn Quarter neighborhood.\n\nIn the video, a woman approaches Cruz and his wife Heidi as they prepare to sit at their table. She asks Cruz about his vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, as the chanting grows louder in the background.\n\n\"Hi. I'd love to talk with you about Brett Kavanaugh tonight,\" the woman says. \"I'm a constituent. Love to know what your vote is going to be tonight. I know that you're very close friends with Mr. Kavanaugh. And do you believe survivors, sir?\"\n\nTwo women, Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, have accused Kavanaugh of past sexual misconduct. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.\n\n\"Senator, I have a right to know what your position is on Brett Kavanaugh,\" the protester tells Cruz.\n\nThe woman then identifies herself as a survivor of sexual assault and mentions the women who have accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault.\n\n\"I know that you're close friends with him, could you talk to him about that?\" she asks.\n\nAt this point, Cruz tells his wife, \"Let's go ahead and go,\" and begins to put his coat back on. In a second video, which has been viewed more than 2.3 million times, more than a dozen people are seen shouting at the couple and recording the incident on their phones as the senator and his wife try to exit.\n\nCruz politely says \"excuse me\" as he tries to work his way through the chanting crowd and adds, \"God bless you,\" as one protester waves a middle finger in his direction.\n\n\"Excuse me, let my wife through,\" the senator says, turning back toward Heidi Cruz. A few protesters cheer and yell \"bye\" after Cruz and his wife exit the establishment. \"We booted him out,\" one voice exclaims.\n\nA restaurant employee is then heard asking the protesters to \"leave the premises.\"\n\nOne protester asked Cruz, \"Are you going to confirm your best friend, Brett Kavanaugh?\"\n\n\"Beto is way hotter than you, dude,\" another shouted in reference to Cruz's Democratic opponent in his re-election fight, Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke.\n\nO'Rourke tweeted Tuesday that Cruz should not have been treated that way. \"Not right that Senator Cruz and his wife Heidi were surrounded and forced to leave a restaurant last night because of protesters,\" O'Rourke wrote. \"The Cruz family should be treated with respect.\"",
    " Title: UN General Assembly Vote: 128 Countries Rebuke U.S. Jerusalem Decision, 128-9\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant rebuke of President Donald Trump's controversial decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital earlier this month, 128 countries, including some of the U.S.'s closest allies, voted in favor of a United Nations resolution on Thursday calling for a reversal of the U.S. position. Only nine countries voted against it.\n\nThe resolution, while not explicitly referring to the U.S., is clearly directed at the White House. The measure declares that any changes to the status of Jerusalem \"have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded.\" It also \"calls upon all States to refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the Holy City of Jerusalem\" \u2014 another shot at the administration, which announced plans to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nThe U.S. received the closest thing to support from allies with 35 abstentions. Countries like Canada, Mexico, and Australia abstained, which means they didn't support the U.S. with a vote against it but didn't criticize the U.S. either with a vote in favor of it.\n\nWhile the passage of the resolution isn't binding \u2014 meaning the U.S. doesn't actually have to reverse its position \u2014 it's a stark illustration of just how isolated the United States is in its stance toward Israel. Thursday's vote took place at a rare emergency session of the 193-member UN General Assembly. Turkey and Yemen, on behalf of two international organizations of Arab and Muslim countries, called for the emergency session after the U.S. vetoed a similar resolution at the UN Security Council on Monday. Unlike at the Security Council, the U.S. does not have veto power at the broader General Assembly.\n\nThe administration made a concerted effort to sway countries to its side before the UN vote. U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley promised the U.S. would be \"taking names\" of those who voted against the U.S. She also sent a letter to the UN ambassadors of more than 180 member countries warning that any vote in favor of the resolution would be taken \"personally\" by President Trump himself.\n\nPresident Trump suggested during a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday that he would withhold billions of dollars in aid for countries that voted against the U.S. \"Let them vote against us; we'll save a lot,\" Trump said. \"We don't care.\"\n\nAnd in a speech before the General Assembly right before the vote on Thursday, Haley escalated things even further, threatening to cut off U.S. funding to the UN over the vote.\n\n\"When we make generous contributions to the UN, we also have a legitimate expectation that our goodwill is recognized and respected,\" Haley said. \"When a nation is singled out for attack in this organization, that nation is disrespected.\"\n\n\"We have an obligation to demand more for our investment,\" she said.\n\nBut the pressure campaign didn't work very well. Even close U.S. allies like the U.K. and Egypt were unmoved by America's dark warnings. And the fact that the vote stacked so heavily against the U.S. after an unusually aggressive campaign from the Trump administration against it only exacerbated the optics of isolation.\n\nRichard Gowan, a UN expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told me Haley's abrasive politicking was a bit surprising. \"While diplomats expect Trump to be crude, they may have expected a bit better from Haley. She is normally more pragmatic.\"\n\nThere are even signs that the heavy-handed threats backfired. Barak Ravid, a correspondent for Israel's Channel 10 news, reported that Canada switched from voting against the resolution to abstaining in order to avoid looking like a puppet of the U.S.\n\nThat Haley had to resort to such measures to try to convince even a few countries to side with the U.S. highlights the extraordinary sensitivity surrounding Jerusalem, which has sites holy to Jews, Christians, and Muslims, and which both the Palestinians and the Israelis claim as their capital.\n\nJerusalem has always been polarizing. Now it's even more so. Trump's December 6 speech recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital broke with decades of bipartisan American foreign policy about the city's future. Presidents of both parties have supported the idea of creating an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, with the final status of Jerusalem to be decided as part of a peace agreement between the two sides.\n\nTrump's language during his speech wasn't quite as inflammatory as it could've been. As Sarah Wildman pointed out for \u2588\u2588\u2588 at the time of the announcement, Trump didn't call Jerusalem the undivided capital of Israel \u2014 suggesting the U.S. would still support potentially dividing Jerusalem between the Israelis and the Palestinians as part of future peace negotiations.\n\nBut the move \u2014 along with the announcement that the U.S. would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem \u2014 sparked outcry in the international community and further polarized one of the most contentious territorial disputes in the world.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said on Sunday that he intends to open an embassy in East Jerusalem \u2014 the part of the city that Palestinians officially want as the capital of a future Palestinian state. That came days after he convened a gathering of Muslim leaders to call for the world to see East Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian state.\n\nA statement signed by more than 50 Muslim-majority countries at that summit declared that the U.S. had lost its role as a \"sponsor of peace\" in the Middle East. And Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said in a speech last week that Trump's Jerusalem announcement was a \"crime\" and that he no longer wants the U.S. to broker peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nGowan, the UN expert, says that ultimately all the UN theatrics probably won't actually end up hurting the U.S.\n\n\"This is, ironically, a diplomatic win for all concerned,\" he said. \"The vast majority of UN members have shown that they are principled defenders of international law and the Palestinian people. The U.S. has shown that it will go to the wire for Israel, and Trump can boast he is tougher than Obama on the Middle East. And everyone can go home for the holidays with a warm glow.\"",
    " Title: National Donors Fuel Controversial Wisconsin Sheriff Race as Gun Control Groups Clash with NRA\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming local election in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, the race for sheriff is attracting significant attention and financial investment, with national political donors pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into the contest. The race pits controversial incumbent Sheriff David Clarke Jr., a staunch supporter of Second Amendment rights, against police lieutenant Chris Moews.\n\nClarke, who made headlines last year for a radio ad encouraging citizens to enroll in firearms classes following budget cuts, has been a vocal advocate for personal safety and self-defense. In a 30-second commercial, he urged residents to \"point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger\" because \"911 is not our best option.\"\n\nThe primary race is a rematch of the one four years ago, in which Clarke beat Moews by six points. Both candidates are running as Democrats, and the winner will likely become the next county sheriff, as no Republicans are contesting the position.\n\nLieutenant Moews, armed with substantial financial backing, aims to take down the Clarke camp. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has publicly committed to spending $50 million on gun-control politics in 2014, has invested $150,000 in a series of television ads targeting Clarke's conservative pro-gun policies. This investment surpasses the combined spending of both Clarke and Moews on their entire campaigns.\n\nBloomberg's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, told the Wall Street Journal on Monday that the decision to get involved in the sheriff's race was made to shape policy on a local level. \"The issue of guns is one that (Bloomberg) cares an awful lot about, and there's a very clear contrast on that issue in this race,\" Wolfson said.\n\nHowever, Bloomberg is not the only one injecting cash into the primary. The Greater Wisconsin Committee has spent $400,000 on its own anti-Clarke ads.\n\nClarke, who identifies as a Democrat but often aligns himself with conservative Republicans, has received support from the National Rifle Association (NRA). The NRA, who calls Clarke a \"rising national star,\" has come to Clarke's defense, soliciting donations from its members on his behalf and buying online ads for his re-election bid.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Sheriff Clarke is fighting the reelection battle of his life right now because he dared to stand on principle by standing up for you, me, and the NRA,\" Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, said.\n\nClarke recently told Wisconsin News Radio 620 WTMJ, \"If I have the opportunity to defend myself and my family, I will do so to the best of my abilities, but I'm certainly also going to call 911 if I have the ability because I need the cavalry to come and help me.\" Moews, in the same political event, stated, \"If I have the opportunity to defend myself and my family, I will do so, but I'm certainly also going to call 911 if I have the ability because I need the cavalry to come and help me.\"\n\nThe race is set to take place on Tuesday, with the winner moving on to the November general election. The outcome of this contest could significantly impact local gun policies and the future of law enforcement in Milwaukee County.",
    " Title: Egypt Launches Airstrikes Against Islamic State Targets in Libya in Response to Execution of Egyptian Christians\n\nArticle:\n\nEgypt has reportedly launched airstrikes against Islamic State (IS) targets in the eastern Libyan city of Darna, in retaliation for the gruesome execution of 21 Egyptian Christians shown in a video released on Sunday. The mass murder threatens to open a new front in the ongoing battle against the self-declared Islamic State, potentially drawing Western powers once more into military intervention in Libya.\n\nAccording to Egyptian state television, government warplanes struck camps, training sites, and weapons storage areas of the IS affiliate in Libya. The strikes, made in coordination with the military of the recognized Libyan government based in Tobruk, reportedly resulted in the death of 40 to 50 militants, according to a Libyan air-force commander, as reported by Reuters. The Associated Press reports that a second airstrike is currently underway.\n\nThe strikes were in response to an IS video released on Sunday showing the execution of 21 Egyptians, all Coptic Christians, at the hands of masked IS supporters. The video, shot in IS signature style, demonstrates the group's Libyan branch's ability to hold captives for weeks and carry out a highly-produced murder show without fear of intervention from Egypt or anyone else, as reported by The \u2588\u2588\u2588's Dan Murphy.\n\nHowever, Egypt's ability to respond is limited, as the military is mostly trained for domestic control and running the expansive business empires of its senior officers. The extent of Egypt's capacity to combat the group in Libya, rather than its hundreds of followers in the Egyptian Sinai peninsula, remains to be seen.\n\nThe recognized Libyan government in Tobruk has already called for the US-led coalition attacking IS forces in Syria and Iraq to turn its attention to Libya. Libyan Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni, speaking to Reuters, has asked for Western military intervention against IS and Al Qaeda members he claims are present in his country.\n\nReuters notes that the Islamist rival government in Tripoli, a group called Libyan Dawn, denies any affiliation with either IS or Al Qaeda. The New York Times adds that at least three groups among the multitude fighting in Libya's civil war have declared loyalty to IS, \"one in each of the country\u2019s component regions: Barqa in the east, Fezzan in the desert south, and Tripolitania in the west, around the capital.\"\n\nThe Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed provinces have compounded Libya\u2019s instability by introducing the prospect of Islamist-against-Islamist violence between those who support and those who oppose the group. However, Tripolitania has leapt to the fore as the province that most clearly threatens Westerners and Western interests. Last month, fighters under the group\u2019s banner claimed responsibility for a brazen attack on a luxury hotel in the capital, Tripoli, that is a hub for visiting Westerners and leaders of the Islamist-backed provisional government.\n\nIn a commentary published in the Daily Telegraph, Shashank Joshi warns that \"it\u2019s important to separate [the IS] role in Libya from the broader civil war there. Not every Libyan opposition faction is jihadist, and acting as if it were, by taking firm sides, is a recipe for disaster.\"",
    " Title: \"Examining the Influence of Reality TV on Donald Trump's Presidential Campaign: A Closer Look at the \"Survivor: Oval Office\" Phenomenon\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the whirlwind of the 2016 presidential race, one candidate's background often overshadows others: Donald Trump, the former reality TV star. While his rise in the Republican presidential race has been a topic of much discussion, less attention has been paid to the impact of his reality TV career on his political campaign. This article aims to bridge that gap, exploring the ways in which the conventions of reality television have seeped into Trump's campaign strategy.\n\nRobert Thompson, founder of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University in New York, offers a compelling perspective. He suggests that Trump's campaign has employed numerous tactics borrowed from reality television, and that these tactics have not only shaped Trump's campaign but have also permeated the entire presidential race landscape.\n\nThompson posits that Trump's success can be attributed to his adherence to the rules of reality TV, a format that is largely unconsciously followed by the media covering him. While Trump's campaign is not an exact replica of his television show, it is, in essence, a political version of a reality show.\n\nHere are six significant ways in which Trump's campaign aligns with the conventions of reality television:\n\n1. Conflict: Trump's campaign is characterized by a high level of conflict, a staple of reality TV. This conflict serves to keep the campaign in the spotlight and generates interest among voters.\n\n2. \"Confession Rooms\": Trump's campaign rallies often resemble the \"confession rooms\" of reality TV, where contestants are given a chance to express their thoughts and feelings. In Trump's case, these rallies provide him with a platform to address his supporters and express his views.\n\n3. Soundbites: Trump's campaign is marked by memorable soundbites, a common feature of reality TV. These soundbites, such as his catchphrases, help to create a lasting impression in the minds of voters.\n\n4. Theatrics: Trump's campaign is theatrical, with grandiose announcements and dramatic gestures reminiscent of reality TV. This theatricality helps to captivate the media and the public.\n\n5. The \"Villain\": Trump often plays the role of the \"villain\" in the political narrative, a role he is familiar with from his reality TV days. This role helps to generate interest and excitement, as viewers are drawn to the drama and intrigue of a villain.\n\n6. Control: Trump has extended his control over other campaigns, using reality TV tactics to shape the narrative and maintain his dominance in the race.\n\nWhile Trump's success can be attributed to various factors, including his appeal to nativist and populist sentiments, his adherence to the conventions of reality television is a significant factor. As the race continues, it will be interesting to see how these reality TV tactics continue to shape the political landscape.",
    " Title: Defense Secretary Mattis Emerges as Trump's Clarifier in Unpredictable White House\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the tumultuous first year of the Trump administration, Defense Secretary James Mattis has earned a reputation as a clarifier for President Donald Trump's off-the-cuff comments. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, has deftly shifted the tone and message of the president's seemingly never-ending stream of statements, without drawing the ire of the commander-in-chief.\n\nOn various topics, including torture, the importance of NATO, the regional conflict between Qatar and neighboring countries, and leadership confidence in Afghanistan, Mattis has altered Trump's words into more diplomatic and less emotional messages.\n\n\"Let's call Mattis the great clarifier,\" said one source close to the Defense secretary. \"He's just providing a more detailed clarification to the president's statements.\"\n\nIn his most recent demonstration of savvy, Mattis sought to downplay Trump's assertion that seemed to rule out a diplomatic solution to North Korea's missile tests. Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that the United States \"has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!\"\n\nThe former Marine Corps general, when asked about the tweet later that day, said, \"We're never out of diplomatic solutions.\"\n\nThe source close to Mattis described the secretary's message delivery as methodical, stating, \"He expresses in a terminology that he feels fits. He's very methodical in his process.\"\n\nMattis's relationship with Trump has remained strong, even as the president has soured on several administration officials. \"I think they communicate to each other very openly, very clearly, even warmly,\" the source told \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nMattis's savvy became apparent within the first few weeks after Trump's election. The retired Marine Corps general, who has long disapproved of using torture to gather intelligence, prompted Trump to change his tune after meeting with him to discuss the Defense secretary position.\n\n\"Mattis said that he does not intend to use [torture]. I'm with him all the way,\" Trump later said in an interview on Fox News in January.\n\nThe secretary also opposed Trump's early views that NATO was \"obsolete\" and later placated world leaders after Trump did not reaffirm America's commitment to the military alliance while at an opening ceremony for NATO's new Brussels headquarters in May.\n\n\"To quote a British observer of us from some years back, bear with us,\" Mattis said at the Asian security forum in Singapore when asked about Trump's omission and recent pledge to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. \"Once we have exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing.\"\n\nMore recently, when Trump reportedly sought to fire the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Jon Nicholson, because the United States is \"losing\" the war, Mattis defended the general while not disparaging Trump's view.\n\n\"I will tell you right now, he is our commander in the field, he has the confidence of NATO, he has the confidence of Afghanistan, he has the confidence of the United States,\" Mattis told reporters earlier this month when asked if Trump has confidence in Nicholson.\n\n\"The president, again, is looking at all aspects of our effort over there, as he must in his responsibilities as the commander-in-chief,\" Mattis added.\n\nOne source familiar with the situation described Mattis's interpretations as \"holding the line until a semblance of normalcy is restored during the tumultuous first year of this administration.\"\n\n\"I believe [Mattis] hopes that once the administration gets its feet under it and learns D.C., that things will get better and move toward the campaign agenda,\" the source said.\n\nMattis also is adept at responding when faced with criticism that he is pushing back on Trump's assertions. He himself called the idea that he contradicted Trump \"ludicrous\" and \"widely misinterpreted.\"\n\n\"I was asked if there were any diplomatic efforts left, and I said of course,\" Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday. \"It did not contradict anything the president said. We're not talking to the North Koreans right now.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I can't help people who misinterpret things. I'll do my best to call it like I see it, but right now if I say six and the president says half-a-dozen, they're gonna say I disagree with him.\"\n\nThe secretary did admit that there are issues he and the president disagree on but revealed the division of opinions in a complimentary tone.\n\n\"The first time I met with President Trump, we disagreed on three things in my first 40 minutes with him, on NATO, on torture, and something else, and he hired me,\" Mattis said. \"This is not a man who's immune to being persuaded if he thinks you've got an argument.\"\n\nWhen asked about critics who say he and other national security leaders should step down when Trump makes divisive remarks, Mattis pointed to service to the greater good.\n\n\"You know, when a president of the United States asks you to do something, I come\u2014I don't think it's an old-fashioned school at all. I don't think it's old-fashioned or anything. I don't care if it's Republican or Democrat, we all have an obligation to serve. That's all there is to it.\"",
    " Title: Biden Warns Foreign Interference in U.S. Elections, Cites Concerns Over Congress as Target\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has issued a warning to Russia and other foreign governments, stating that he would take aggressive action as president to counter any interference in U.S. elections. The statement comes in response to a new warning from Democratic leaders that Congress appears to be the target of a foreign interference campaign.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Biden said he would treat foreign interference as an \"adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation's government.\" He criticized President Donald Trump for not doing enough in response to U.S. intelligence agencies' assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\"If any foreign power recklessly chooses to interfere in our democracy, I will not hesitate to respond as president to impose substantial and lasting costs,\" Biden said.\n\nThe renewed alarms have given urgency to concerns that foreign actors could be trying to influence the vote or sow disinformation. Biden said last week that he had begun receiving intelligence briefings and warned that Russia, China, and other adversaries were attempting to undermine the presidential election. He gave no evidence, but he said that Russia was \"still engaged\" after 2016 and that China was also involved in efforts to sow doubts in the American electoral process.\n\nDuring an online fundraiser Monday night, Biden added, \"It's going to be tough, there's not much I can do about it now except talk about it, and expose it, but it is a serious concern. It is truly a violation of our sovereignty.\"\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC, Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin \"knows I mean what I say.\"\n\nDemocratic leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, and Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, wrote a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Monday, expressing concern that Congress appears to be the target of a \"concerted foreign interference campaign\" to influence the 2020 presidential election. The letter contains no details about the threats, but describes them as serious and specific.\n\nWhile the Democrats' exact concerns were unclear, there have been worries since Trump was elected that Russia's efforts to sow American chaos are ongoing in the 2020 election. The 2016 effort included hacking of Democratic email accounts during the campaign by Russian military intelligence officials and the subsequent disclosure by WikiLeaks.\n\nIntelligence authorities said that hack-and-leak operation was aimed at helping Trump's presidential campaign and harming that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Russians also used a covert social media campaign to spread misinformation and posts aimed at dividing American public opinion. In the end, former special counsel Robert Mueller charged 25 Russian nationals for their roles in foreign interference and influence during the campaign.\n\nDemocrats, including members of the Senate intelligence panel, have voiced concerns that an ongoing Republican probe into Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and his work in Ukraine would amplify Russian disinformation. That probe is being led by Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis.\n\nIn a statement, Johnson spokesman Austin Altenburg said the committee's staff had already requested and received a briefing on Russian disinformation, and Johnson had requested an additional briefing at the member level.\n\nBiden's pledge that his intelligence community would report \"publicly and in a timely manner\" on any foreign efforts to interfere in an American election also appeared to be a course correction of sorts to the approach of the Obama administration, which waited months after Russian hacks of Democratic email accounts in 2016 to officially attribute them to Moscow.\n\nOfficials did so only after a rigorous internal debate over what they should say. Even when the administration did issue its October 2016 statement blaming Russia for the hacks, it did not mention Putin by name nor an ongoing effort to determine whether the Kremlin's election interference efforts were being coordinated with the Trump campaign.\n\nHillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 presidential election to Trump, said Monday she was \"glad\" Biden was speaking up. \"It's very clear that Russia succeeded,\" she told MSNBC. \"They believed that they were able to influence the minds and even the votes of Americans, so why would they stop?\"",
    " Title: Immigrant Families in New York Await Obama's Summer Immigration Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nImmigrant Families in New York Await Obama's Summer Immigration Decision\n\nNancy Paredo, a resident of Staten Island, came to the United States illegally 13 years ago from Ciudad Juarez. She, along with her family, is not afraid of being deported every day due to New York's liberal immigration philosophy. However, they are careful and closely watching Washington this summer.\n\nFive-year-old Axel was born here, but his brothers Yan, who is 15, and Demis, 13, were born in Mexico and remain undocumented. President Obama announced on June 30th that he would begin a new effort to fix as much of the immigration system as he can, without Congress.\n\nOnly Congress has the power to grant people like Nancy and her family legal status, and so President Obama's options are limited. The focus will be on reducing deportations among people who have been here for years. Here's how various executive actions could impact the 11 million people living in the United States with no legal status.\n\n\"Yo espero... carga,\" Nancy Paredo hopes, perhaps we can't really get much, but at the very least, an ID number that would say to us, you are not an immigrant, you count in this society. You are someone here. Because you contribute to this country, you're not weighing it down.\n\nOne of Obama's easiest options would be to refine a 2010 policy that says undocumented, non-criminal, breadwinning immigrants would not be high deportation priorities. Such a change could ease some of the fears in the family, but immigrant advocates and immigrant families say it's uncertain whether it would make a big difference.\n\nYan Carlos Valdez, who is currently applying for protection under a policy known as DACA, that's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, hopes Obama does something by this summer. \"I'm going to do something and then he doesn't do it,\" he says, referring to past promises made by the President.\n\nA more forceful step from the President would fully eliminate deportation for some immigrants - at least for a time. Yan is currently applying for protection under DACA, a policy that lasts two years, and would give him work permits and a social security number. A move from the President could grant DACA-like protections to the parents of United States citizens.\n\n\"Once I have papers, I could set myself up really well,\" Juan Carlos says. \"I work in construction. I could pay my taxes, I could contract with more people... That's why we want papers, finally to have dignity.\"\n\nExtending these protections like this could impact some 3.8 million people. The number would be even higher if the President chose to extend protections to the parents of DACA-recipients. But that's a step that government lawyers say would almost surely invite legal scrutiny and Republican opposition.\n\n\"This is a problem of the president's own making,\" says Republican John Boehner. \"He's been president for five-and-a-half years. When is he going to take responsibility for something?\"\n\nPresident Obama's most far-reaching - and controversial - move would be to extend DACA-like protections to all undocumented immigrants who meet a certain criteria. That's an estimated 9.6 million people. Nancy and her family could be free from deportation fears, but it's another move that would almost surely bring a legal challenge.\n\n\"Obama made us a big promise... from the very first time he ran for President he made us a promise and Latinos supported him... because he said he would reform immigration,\" Nancy Paredo says. \"President Obama has promised action by the end of the summer, but, not content to wait, the Valdez family often visits Washington to add to their voice to the pressure for reform.\"\n\n\"What do you want for your mom and dad?\" Emily asks Axel. \"I want them to be safe,\" he replies.",
    " Title: Assessing the 2020 Democratic Candidates: A Look at the Opposite Day Theory\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the 2020 Democratic primary race, the question on many minds is: Who can effectively challenge President Donald Trump in the upcoming election? The current political climate has led some to propose the Extreme Pendulum Swing Theory of Presidential Displacement, which suggests that changing the party in power requires a total opposite of the current chief executive, not in policy but in style and attitude.\n\nThis theory was first observed in 1980 when a feckless and besweatered Jimmy Carter gave way to the robust Ronald Reagan, whose strong and confident approach offered a shot in the arm to a country that had been down on itself for over a decade. In 1992, fuddy-duddy George H.W. Bush lost to the cool and modern Bill Clinton. A lifetime of service? Please. This guy plays the saxophone on late-night TV!\n\nIn 2000, George W. Bush restored \"honor and dignity to the White House\" after eight years of personal scandal and drama, as the nation turned to a moral, conservative family man as it punished Al Gore for Bill Clinton\u2019s numerous sins. In 2008, the sales job was easy\u2014America wanted its seat back at the cool kids\u2019 table. Barack Obama formed articulate and complete sentences, shot hoops, hung with celebrities, and sounded like he had all the answers. Sold.\n\nIn 2016, a nation no longer concerned with experience bought Donald Trump\u2019s anti-elite pitch, as he railed against the elitist in the White House and the one opposing him. With the country having lurched too far left too fast, Trump\u2019s job was easy.\n\nSo, which 2020 Democrats provide enough opposite magic? There are three: Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Andrew Yang.\n\nFor reasons already explored, former Vice President Joe Biden is too much of a bully and a blowhard to fit this theory. Elizabeth Warren seems like an opposite on her face, but is she? For all the carping Democrats do about Trump making things up, Warren\u2019s penchant for whoppers makes her a future Burger King franchisee. And she lacks a contrasting optimism to boot. Warren\u2019s angrier about the personal hardships she made up than most people are about their real travails.\n\nMike Bloomberg? Septuagenarian New York City billionaire with an authoritarian streak who pisses people off on the regular. A reboot with different hair. And Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201cget off my lawn\u201d angry white man populism seems all too familiar.\n\nBut Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and Yang\u2014while not exactly the '27 Yankees of American politics'\u2014represent a near opposite choice. And Democrats often gravitate to and win with \u201cnerdy wonks,\u201d according to one Democratic strategist I trust.\n\nIn Buttigieg, you have a young, Ivy League-educated Navy veteran who speaks softly and offers a contrasting attitude regarding America\u2019s place in the world. He enjoys Middle America street cred while espousing big-city liberal values. His biggest similarity to Trump? St. Pete\u2019s confidence and ambition far outstrip his experience. Somewhere, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey is screaming (crying?) into a pillow watching Buttigieg\u2019s rise and, I suppose, stands ready to fill this slot should the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, falter.\n\nKlobuchar, another Midwesterner, is a U.S. senator with real-deal political experience. Her deliberate and understated style (at least in public) is the opposite of bombastic. Nominating a woman plays to the gaping gender gap that has opened on Trump\u2019s job approval. Her most Trump-like trait could be in the way she treats staff in private, if you believe the stories. Think Hillary Clinton without the 9 tons of baggage and condescension.\n\nYang is a detail-oriented Asian American technocrat who, as he often says, likes math. He\u2019s young and has worked in the modern economy as well as the nonprofit sector. He appears to be having fun\u2014how novel! While I find him to be Trump\u2019s opposite in almost every way, his one similarity comes in his instinct that impeachment is \"a loser\" for Democrats.\n\n\"If all that happens is all of the Democrats are talking about impeachment that fails, then it seems like there is no vision,\" Yang told the Rolling Stone magazine. \"It seems like all we can do is throw ineffective rocks at Donald Trump, and then it ends up leading unfortunately toward his reelection.\"\n\nI still consider Trump the favorite, although his struggles with women and college-educated whites are real political problems. To ride the pendulum fully across America\u2019s political axis in 2020 and turn Election Day into Opposite Day, Democrats might find their best chance among this threesome.",
    " Title: Pakistani High Court Upholds Controversial Ruling on Child Marriage, Sparks International Outcry\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a ruling that has sparked international outcry, a Pakistani high court has upheld a decision allowing men in the country to marry girls who have undergone their first menstrual cycle, despite the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act, which forbids marriage below the age of 18.\n\nThe ruling, handed down by a two-judge panel, came during a court hearing into the kidnapping, forced conversion, and marriage of Huma Younus, a 14-year-old Christian girl. According to reports, Younus was kidnapped by three men from her home in Karachi last October, and was taken to Dera Gazi Khan, a city in the Punjab province of Pakistan, more than 370 miles from her home.\n\nSince her abduction, Younus' parents have been doing everything they can to recover their daughter. The family argued the marriage to a man named Jabbar was invalid under the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act, and supplied the court with baptismal and school documents proving Huma is 14. She was born on May 22, 2005, according to the Independent Catholic News.\n\nDuring the court hearing, judges Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Irshad Ali Shah ruled that the marriage between Huma and Jabbar is valid because she has already had her first period. The family has vowed to take her case to the Supreme Court of Pakistan.\n\nThe Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act was passed almost six years ago in an effort to stop forced marriages to minors in the province. The practice is prevalent among Hindus and Christian girls, according to various media outlets.\n\nTabassum Yousaf, Younus' lawyer, told Aid to the Church in Need (ACN) that they hoped the law could have been applied for the first time in Huma's case. \"But evidently in Pakistan these laws are formulated and approved only to improve the image of the country in front of the international community, ask for development funds, and freely trade Pakistani products on the European market,\" he said.\n\nAnother hearing in the case has been scheduled for March 4. In an email to \u2588\u2588\u2588 News, ICC President Jeff King responded to the court's ruling. \"Pakistan's High Court decision to rule in favor of underage marriage is wrong on so many levels,\" King wrote. \"In the last few years, the world has been awakened to the disastrous practice and effects of child marriage (child brides) through various organizations and brave female voices throughout the world.\"\n\nKing went on to describe the plight of young Christian women in Pakistan, who are frequently targeted by Muslim men. \"In the most fundamentalist Muslim countries (ie. Pakistan, Egypt, and others), where Christians are a minority, young Christian girls are routinely targeted by Muslim men,\" he noted. \"It usually starts with a young Christian girl being approached by a Muslim boy or man with a request to date or marry. If these requests are ignored, she will start to hear how she's too pretty to be a Christian and other statements that represent a more dangerous level of harassment.\"\n\nKing added that the family usually knows the perpetrator. \"Usually, and often tragically, the next step is that she will be kidnapped, drugged, beaten, and raped multiple times, and often the family knows who is responsible,\" he continued. \"In a fundamentalist, shame-based culture, the girl's prospects for marriage, and a decent life, are permanently ruined. She is left feeling incredibly useless and ashamed. Then, she will be presented with an offer to save her dignity by being married to her rapist. If she refuses, she will be raped and beaten repeatedly.\"\n\nKing also pointed out that Pakistani law enforcement officials are of little help to parents. \"When the parents inquire of the police and try to get them to do something, they will be presented with a statement from their daughter saying that she has become a Muslim,\" he continued. \"If the Christian parents continue to fight, they're often slapped around and threatened with arrest. If the parents are especially brave, the daughter is often then dragged in front of them in a drugged state (with her torturer and rapist in the room) to say that she is a Muslim and does not wish to come home \u2013 never making eye contact with her parents.\"\n\nKing concluded that none of this is a rare occurrence, unfortunately. \"So it is with tremendous sadness that we receive the news that Pakistan's High Court has allowed this practice to continue. Even more tragically, it means that for 14-year-old Huma, whose case the trial was based on, will not be returned to her parents and is probably lost to them forever,\" he said.",
    " Title: California Politicians Vow to Lead Progressive Resistance Against Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia, a state that heavily leans towards the Democratic party, is gearing up to challenge President-elect Donald Trump's policies, particularly on immigration and civil rights issues. With a significant left-leaning population, the state is home to Silicon Valley and Hollywood, two industries that have historically supported Democratic candidates. California's political influence is substantial, contributing 13% to the nation's gross domestic product.\n\nThe state is home to a powerful group of Democratic politicians, including Senators Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein, Governor Jerry Brown, and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. California's growing Latino population, which makes up about 40% of the state's population, will be a key focus for Trump's immigration agenda.\n\nOutgoing Representative Xavier Becerra, who was appointed as California's Attorney General earlier this month, will lead the state's immigration fight. Becerra has already vowed to fight federal immigration enforcement through legislation and litigation.\n\nCalifornia mayors, including Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, have also pledged to resist aggressive immigration enforcement. Garcetti announced a fund to defend immigrants from deportation on Monday.\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, who will be the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee next year, will play a key role in opposing Trump's pick for Attorney General, Senator Jeff Sessions. Becerra and Feinstein have both expressed their willingness to use all legal means to defend California's policies.\n\nCalifornia's political leaders have also vowed to defend voting rights at a national level. Secretary of State Alex Padilla, an outspoken voting rights advocate, has already pushed through aggressive policies to expand California's voter registration.\n\nTrump has accused California of voter fraud, claiming it contributed to his loss in the popular vote. However, he has provided no evidence to support these accusations. Padilla has criticized Trump's comments about voter fraud, calling them unsubstantiated, reckless, and unbecoming of a president-elect.\n\nWhile California and Trump have been at odds, state politicians are willing to work with the president-elect where their interests align. However, they have also made it clear that they will confront Trump's administration where necessary, particularly on issues such as Social Security, Medicare, and healthcare reform.\n\nKenneth Romero, executive director of the bipartisan National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators, argued that California's local leaders are likely to turn to the issue of states' rights to make their case against Trump's agenda. Romero suggested that the potential conflict between California and the federal government is not unprecedented.",
    " Title: \"Mainstream Shift: Abolish ICE Movement Gains Momentum Among Democrats\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant political shift, the call to abolish the Immigration and Customens Enforcement (ICE) agency has moved from the fringes of the Democratic Party to the mainstream, with high-profile Democrats such as Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Mayor Bill de Blasio, and Sen. Kamala Harris expressing support for the cause.\n\nIn an interview with Maria Bartiromo on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" President Trump predicted that Democrats would face electoral defeat if they campaigned on the policy of abolishing ICE. \"Well I hope they keep thinking about it,\" he said. \"Because they're going to get beaten so badly.\" Trump praised ICE for their role in apprehending MS-13 gang members, stating that the agency is \"much tougher than MS-13, like by a factor of 10.\"\n\nThe shift in Democratic sentiment towards ICE comes in response to the Trump administration's tough policies on illegal immigration, particularly the \"zero tolerance\" policy on detaining all illegal border crossers. In New York, far-left primary challenger Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory over Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., has emboldened the movement. Sen. Gillibrand and Mayor de Blasio have since added their support to the cause.\n\nSen. Gillibrand stated in a CNN interview that she believes ICE has become a \"deportation force\" and should be abolished. Mayor de Blasio echoed this sentiment on WNYC radio, while Gov. Andrew Cuomo faces pressure to back such calls after primary challenger Cynthia Nixon labeled ICE a \"terrorist organization.\"\n\nSen. Harris has suggested that the U.S. should consider \"starting from scratch\" with immigration enforcement, while Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., has announced plans to introduce a bill to abolish the agency.\n\nWhile the movement is unlikely to gain much traction on the right, Trump has also weighed in, tweeting his support for ICE agents and stating that there is \"zero chance\" of the agency being abolished. \"To the great and brave men and women of ICE, do not worry or lose your spirit,\" he said. \"You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements.\"\n\nRepublicans and immigration hardliners are welcoming the Democratic shift on the issue, believing it spells electoral victory for the GOP outside of Democratic strongholds like New York and California. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., tweeted this week that Democrats are campaigning on \"open borders, mass migration, & abolishing ICE.\" \"Give them points for honesty. Let's vote,\" he said.",
    " Title: \"Unjust: A Critical Examination of Social Justice and Its Impact on American Society\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his debut book, \"Unjust: Social Justice and the Unmaking of America,\" Noah Rothman, a renowned writer and editor at Commentary magazine, delves into the concept of social justice, arguing that it lacks a coherent definition and is often used as a tool for political gain.\n\nRothman's book, titled \"Unjust: Social Justice and the Unmaking of America,\" is not, in itself, nonsensical. It is a well-written, insightful, and passionate exploration of a topic that Rothman contends is nonsensical due to its lack of internal logic and definitional rigor.\n\nIn his quest for a universally agreed-upon definition of social justice, Rothman found that the term is used by a wide range of groups, from labor unions to universities to gay-rights groups, with the only disagreements revolving around who is most in need of this elusive resource.\n\nOne common thread in most definitions of social justice is the concept of \"economic justice,\" which Rothman describes as \"distributive justice\" - the redistribution of wealth from the haves to the have-nots. However, Rothman argues that what social justice is really about is power, with its advocates seeking the power to impose their will on society.\n\nRothman's critique of social justice extends to political parties as well. For instance, the Green Party's platform on social justice is nearly 60 pages long and includes a wide range of policy proposals, from stopping speech that perpetuates \"oppression and abuse\" to reinvesting a \"significant portion\" of military spending on family support, living-wage job development, and work training programs.\n\nAccording to Rothman, the animating passion behind social justice is identity politics, with historically oppressed or disadvantaged groups seeking payback in the name of social justice. Rothman refers to this as \"retributive justice,\" arguing that whites have historically enjoyed privileges that non-whites did not, and therefore non-whites are owed something, and \"white privilege\" must be overthrown.\n\nOne of the problems with this worldview, Rothman argues, is that it boils away individual circumstances, treating vast abstract categories of human beings as collectively guilty or victimized. This is partly why Rothman sees social justice as the very negation of traditional justice, as it holds individuals accountable for the wrongs committed by others based on their race or other characteristics.\n\nRothman's critique of social justice has not been without controversy. When he appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe to discuss his book, critics often dismissed his arguments as invalid due to his race. This, Rothman argues, is a prime example of how social justice is used as a magical incantation to render inconvenient impediments to its champions' agenda illegitimate.\n\nIn conclusion, Rothman's book offers a critical examination of the concept of social justice and its impact on American society. While some may find his arguments provocative, his book serves as a reminder of the importance of clear thinking and definitional rigor in our political discourse.",
    " Title: Democrats Raise Alarm on Potential Consequences of Sequester Cuts on Public Safety\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate over the sequester cuts, Democrats are focusing on the potential impact of the spending reductions on public safety. The party is emphasizing the potential increase in crime, prison riots, and drug trafficking as a result of the budget cuts.\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, recently highlighted the effects of the sequester on law enforcement agencies. She pointed out that the spending cuts could hinder the ability to combat white-collar crime, street crime, and human trafficking. Mikulski noted that federal grants, which local law enforcement officials rely on for staffing and equipment purchases, are being affected by the sequester.\n\n\"It's not the biggest thing in the federal budget, but it's the biggest thing to cops,\" Mikulski said in a recent floor speech. \"Because it buys bullet-proof vests.\"\n\nRep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.) stated that a significant event would likely change the public's perception of the sequester. However, he acknowledged that convincing voters of the immediate and dangerous threat of the sequester's effects is challenging, as there have been no reports of tainted meat or other direct consequences so far.\n\nFederal prison union officials have expressed concerns about the impact of the sequester on prison safety. Dale Deshotel, president of the Council of Prison Locals, pointed to past budget cuts and continued staffing shortages, and the potential consequences of sequestration, after a federal prison inmate stabbed a guard to death last month in Canaan, Pa. Deshotel is worried about the Bureau of Prisons' plans to cut $339 million this fiscal year and impose 12 mandated furlough days for all its employees.\n\nTo deal with the cuts, prison wardens are subbing in guards who aren't as prepared as regular staff for handling emergencies. Deshotel expressed hope that signs of potential problems will emerge before a full-blown riot or other catastrophic event occurs.\n\nWarnings are also growing that the sequester will lead to an increase in illicit drugs reaching U.S. soil. At a hearing last week before the House Armed Services Committee, Southern Command chief Marine Gen. John Kelly stated that sequestration could result in a loss of critical air and water surveillance for monitoring cocaine trafficking.\n\n\"If I lose those assets, if they go to zero \u2014 and there are some that are predicting they will go to zero \u2014 then all of that cocaine, all of it, will get ashore, and more, I would predict, would get ashore and be on the streets of New York and Boston and Portland, Maine,\" Kelly said.\n\nAs the debate over the sequester continues, Democrats are hoping that their warnings about increased crime and other dangers will resonate with the public. However, polls show that roughly half of Americans are undecided about the sequester's effects due to a lack of knowledge about the issue.",
    " Title: The Refugee Crisis in Europe: A Complex Challenge with Historical and Future Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe refugee crisis in Europe, fueled by the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, presents a complex humanitarian issue that defies simple solutions. While the immediate concern is the influx of desperate individuals fleeing war and terror, the crisis cannot be viewed in isolation from its historical and future implications.\n\nThe future generation of refugees, who will be born in Europe or other places of refuge, will likely face challenges integrating into their new societies. They will grow up knowing they are not as well off as others and will grapple with cultural differences, potentially leading to clashes with Western values. This is a scenario Europe has already experienced, with strife and even terrorism arising from a minority of individuals who adhere to antagonistic beliefs.\n\nThe capacity of any nation to absorb immigrants is not limitless, especially when the immigrants' cultures are antithetical to the values of the host society. Admitting a foreign population, particularly one with a history of maintaining distinct cultural identities, presents long-term challenges.\n\nThe past and future cast a shadow over the current refugee crisis. The decision to withdraw American troops from Iraq, which was presented as ending a war, has led to new conflicts and unforeseen consequences. The rise of ISIS, once dismissed as a minor threat, now controls significant territories in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe Obama administration's foreign policy, marked by the undermining of stable Middle Eastern governments and the subsequent rise of chaos, has contributed to the refugee crisis. President Obama's current focus on renaming Mount McKinley, rather than addressing the refugee crisis, may reflect a political calculus that prioritizes domestic concerns over international ones.\n\nWhile Middle Eastern countries could potentially take in more refugees, oil-rich nations like Saudi Arabia have not done so in significant numbers. Western countries, including the United States, could provide more financial aid to Middle Eastern countries hosting refugees, such as Jordan and Egypt, as a more feasible and politically acceptable solution.\n\nAddressing the root causes of the refugee crisis may require a shift in policy after the Obama administration. Until then, the West must grapple with the immediate humanitarian crisis while acknowledging the long-term implications of admitting refugees and providing support to those who choose to help.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney and Foreign Policy: Iran, Syria, and Egypt\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the past few days, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has focused on accusations that President Obama has shown weakness in foreign policy, particularly in the recent unrest in Cairo and the violence in Libya. During a speech in Fairfax, Virginia, Romney criticized the current administration's approach, stating that a strong America is essential to shape events, rather than being at the mercy of them.\n\nWhen asked about the turmoil in Egypt and Libya, Romney chose to discuss a more general critique of the president's foreign policy. In an interview with ABC News, Romney declined to respond to Obama's charge that he shoots first and aims later, stating, \"This is politics. I'm not going to worry about the campaign.\"\n\nThe sharpest foreign policy difference between Romney and Obama emerged in response to questions about Iran. President Obama has stated that he aims to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but has so far refused to set a \"red line\" that would trigger military action if Iran continued to develop nuclear capabilities. In a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, the debate over red lines continued.\n\nAccording to Paul Pillar, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and a former senior official in the State Department under President George W. Bush, Romney would not tolerate Iran being \"one screwdriver's turn away from a nuclear weapon.\" However, Pillar did not specify exactly where Romney would draw the line.\n\nThe vagueness is significant because, by some definitions, Iran already has the capability to produce a nuclear weapon, though it might take several months or years to realize. Pillar stated, \"Once they get a weapon, or on the verge of getting it, it's too late.\"\n\nRomney has stated that he would never allow Iran to enrich uranium, suggesting he would enforce a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding that Iran \"suspend\" its production of all nuclear fuel. However, Iran was in violation of that demand during most of Bush's second term, and suffered fewer economic consequences than it has under Obama, who has imposed the first sanctions against Iran's oil revenues.\n\nBoth Pillar and former ambassador Robert W. Kelley described the president as too risk-averse in the Middle East, particularly in Syria, where 20,000 people have died as the conflict continues. Pillar suggested that engaging the opposition was necessary to separate the \"good guys and the bad guys,\" but both men stopped short of endorsing the provision of lethal arms.\n\nOn Egypt, Pillar suggested that the administration had failed to make clear that American aid was contingent on the protection of American interests. In fact, Obama's aides, during trips to Cairo, have been careful not to threaten pulling that aid, but they have warned the Egyptian authorities that Congressional approval could be difficult unless the country's leaders reaffirmed the peace treaty with Israel.\n\nRomney's campaign has also criticized a conciliatory statement issued by the American Embassy in Cairo hours before protests began there, stating that it did not support freedom of speech. The statement did condemn a virulent anti-Muslim video that set off the violence, but it also included references to both the importance of free speech and religious tolerance.",
    " Title: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Calls for Briefing on U.S. Military Strike, Criticizes Trump's Syria Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the U.S. military operation that resulted in the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has demanded a briefing on the details of the raid and the administration's strategy in the region.\n\nPelosi, in a statement on Sunday, called for a comprehensive briefing on the raid, which she noted was not shared with top Congressional leaders in advance, unlike the Russians. She emphasized the need for \"strong, smart, and strategic leadership from Washington.\"\n\nDuring his announcement of the successful operation, President Trump singled out Pelosi, suggesting that congressional leaders were not trusted in the planning of the attack in Syria. Trump stated, \"Washington is a leaking machine.\"\n\nPelosi acknowledged the significance of al-Baghdadi's death but cautioned that the elimination of the ISIS leader does not signify the end of ISIS. She pointed out that numerous ISIS fighters remain in uncertain conditions in Syrian prisons, and many others continue to pose a threat in the region and globally.\n\nPelosi's comments echo those of Democratic presidential hopeful and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, who has criticized Trump's military policy in Syria, suggesting it may have strengthened ISIS.\n\nThis month, Trump faced criticism from both sides of the aisle when he withdrew U.S. troops from the Turkey-Syria border, enabling a Turkish military advance on U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in the region. In response, the House passed a joint resolution on a bipartisan 354-60 basis, rejecting Trump's green-lighting of Turkish aggression in Syria and calling on him to present a clear strategy to defeat ISIS.\n\nPelosi's statement did not mention Trump, who took credit for the operation and ordered the strike on al-Baghdadi. The U.S. military carried out the raid, but the details of the operation remain classified.",
    " Title: New Tax Overhaul Brings Bigger Paychecks for Most American Workers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe contentious tax overhaul, passed in December by the GOP, is starting to deliver a change that many will welcome \u2014 bigger paychecks. Workers are starting to see more take-home pay as employers implement the new withholding guidelines from the IRS, which dictate how much employers withhold from pay for federal taxes. Those whose checks have remained the same should not fret, as employers have until Feb. 15 to make the changes.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has estimated that the new rules will mean more take-home pay for about 90 percent of American workers. The amount of extra cash depends on several factors, such as workers' income, how often they are paid, and the number of withholdings allowances they claim on their IRS Form W-4 with their employer.\n\nWorkers who have already seen a change in their paychecks welcomed the extra money, anywhere from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars. Wayne Love, who works in managed care in Spring Hill, Florida, got an extra $200 in his paycheck last week, which he said will help offset a $300 increase in the cost of his health insurance.\n\nJulia Ketchum, a secretary at a public high school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, said she was pleasantly surprised her pay went up $1.50 a week. She didn't think her pay would go up at all, let alone this soon. That adds up to $78 a year, which she said will more than cover her Costco membership for the year.\n\nTodd Anderson of Texas and his fianc\u00e9e, who are both educators, got an extra $200 in their paychecks combined that they plan to use to cover the costs of a second baby on its way.\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a middle-income household would on average get a tax cut of $930 this year, lifting their after-tax income by about 1.6 percent. However, that increase won't be perfectly reflected in their paychecks, as lower tax withholding on paychecks is just a piece of a complicated set of changes to tax law.\n\nAs a result, taxpayers may find they are unintentionally over- or underwithholding for their taxes if they don't do some legwork. Senators Ron Wyden and Richard Neal, both Democrats, have asked the Government Accountability Office to analyze the new tables to make sure workers' paychecks weren't being systematically underwithheld, which would make paychecks bigger now but lead to a bigger bill at tax time.\n\nExperts suggest that all taxpayers take a look at the new IRS calculator when it becomes available later in February to ensure they are having the correct amount withheld. And they should update the information on their W-4 after the IRS releases a revised version later this year.\n\nThe IRS, payroll, and tax professionals have been scrambling to react to the passage of the new tax law. The IRS plans to make further changes involving withholding matters in 2019. Many in the industry say they expect the IRS to update the W-4 form in 2019 in a more dramatic fashion to fully reflect the scope of the law.\n\nNo worker should anticipate a negative impact from the new withholding table if their pay remained the same, said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior researcher at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. However, someone who got a raise may face a higher tax rate as a result. And some corporations have been handing out bonuses and wage increases in reaction to passage of the law. A worker's net pay may also fall if other factors that go into their paycheck changed \u2014 such as an increase in health insurance premiums or higher state taxes.\n\nStill, a little extra money in the hands of most Americans may also help boost support of President Donald Trump and his tax plan. Trump and the Republican backers of the plan have deflected criticism of the legislation, insisting that Americans will come to love the new law when they see their heftier paychecks.\n\n\"It's tough to be upset about more money in my pocket,\" said Jefferey Snively, an aerospace engineer who got a 4 percent bump in his last paycheck due to the lower tax rate. He said that's not enough to feel like a windfall or change his spending habits, but is a pleasant change. Yet, he thinks the tax overhaul wasn't really about him or other workers, but more about corporations and the wealthy.\n\n\"I think the people this bill made the most difference for are the ones who needed it least,\" he said.",
    " Title: Former President Obama's Midterm Endorsements Divide Democrats: Timing and Strategy Under Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer President Barack Obama's midterm endorsement list has sparked debate within the Democratic party, with some members expressing disappointment that the list was released after most primary elections and arguing that it failed to significantly impact the Democratic primaries.\n\nStrategists, former Obama aides, and fundraisers have expressed confusion over the list, which was released after many states had already held their primaries. A former senior Obama administration official stated, \"I think a lot of us have wondered why he didn't feel the need to get involved earlier. There are a lot of folks that could have used his help much earlier. And there are a lot of people who think he should put a stamp on the party.\"\n\nObama's decision to largely stay away from primaries is consistent with the behavior of many other former presidents, who have generally sought to stay above internal party fights. However, the political environment, particularly in light of Donald Trump's presidency, has led some Democrats to argue that Obama should play a more significant role.\n\nDemocratic strategist Brad Bannon stated, \"These are not traditional times. He's the most popular Democrat in our nation, and we really need all the help we can get. So if I were advising him, I would have told him to get out there much sooner and get in the trenches because we're playing high stakes poker.\"\n\nThe release of the endorsement list was consistent with Obama's post-Oval Office goal of seeking to stay above the fray and to not become more of a foil to Trump. Aides and others close to Obama have repeatedly stated that his desire is to allow a new crop of Democrats to take over the party.\n\nDespite Obama's decision to stay out of the primaries, his endorsement was seen as valuable in some races. Katie Merrill, who helps head up the super PAC Fight Back California, stated, \"Obama's endorsements created quite a buzz and are very helpful to the candidates\" in California.\n\nHowever, Obama's approach has left some former aides and donors feeling snubbed. In Texas, for example, Ed Meier, a State Department official under the Obama administration, fell short in a congressional primary. Similarly, Alison Kiehl Friedman, a former State Department aide running for Congress in Virginia, and Sam Jammal, a former Commerce Department aide running for a seat in California, also lost their primaries.\n\nOne top Obama fundraiser stated, \"His endorsement during the primary would have changed the outcome of a number of races. Obama was playing it safe and doing what was best for him, not them, and not for the country.\"\n\nSome strategists argue that Obama's decision to stay on the sidelines has hurt the party. A Democratic strategist stated, \"I was on a call this morning where it was coming up a lot. I think a lot of people say it as lazy, a bit half-assed and a little too methodical. There are ramifications for this, and I hope we don't suffer the consequences. We can't just go red to blue. We need to make states blue for the long term.\"\n\nDespite the criticism, Obama is expected to release another list of endorsements in the coming weeks. Some strategists argue that his endorsements can be crucial in unifying the party and energizing volunteers and donors. Seth Bringman, a Democratic strategist based in Ohio, stated, \"Just knowing that their campaigns are on his radar energized volunteers and helped candidates raise money.\"",
    " Title: Appeals Court Rules in Favor of Ohio Business Owners Challenging Birth Control Mandate on Religious Grounds\n\nArticle:\n\nA divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has sided with two Ohio business owners, Francis and Philip M. Gilardi, who challenged the birth control mandate under the Affordable Care Act on religious grounds. The brothers, who own Freshway Foods and Freshway Logistics of Sidney, Ohio, argued that the mandate to provide contraceptive coverage would force them to violate their Roman Catholic beliefs and moral values by providing contraceptives such as the morning-after pill for their employees.\n\nThe ruling, which is one of several on the birth control issue, is likely to be resolved by the Supreme Court. There are at least three other rulings by federal appeals courts on the mandate: one sided with Oklahoma businesses, and two sided with the Obama administration in challenges brought by Pennsylvania and Michigan companies.\n\nWriting for the majority, Judge Janice Rogers Brown stated that the mandate \"trammels the right of free exercise -- a right that lies at the core of our constitutional liberties -- as protected by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\" Brown, an appointee of President George W. Bush, said that the mandate presented the Gilardis with a \"Hobson's choice\": they can either abide by the sacred tenets of their faith, pay a penalty of over $14 million, and potentially cripple the companies they have spent a lifetime building, or they become complicit in a grave moral wrong.\n\nFriday's ruling reversed a lower court ruling that had denied the Gilardis' request for a preliminary injunction to block the Department of Health and Human Services from enforcing the mandate against them as business owners. The appeals court ruled that the lower court erred when it concluded the Gilardis were unlikely to succeed on the merits, and sent the case back to the lower court to consider other factors for an injunction.\n\nHowever, Brown upheld the lower court's dismissal of an injunction for the brothers' companies, writing, \"we have no basis for concluding a secular organization can exercise religion.\"\n\nIn an opinion dissenting from the court's main holding in the case, Judge Harry T. Edwards wrote that legislative restrictions may trump religious exercise. He asked what, if the Gilardis' companies were exempted from covering contraception, would stop another company from seeking an exemption from a requirement to cover vaccines?\n\n\"The mandate does not require the Gilardis to encourage Freshway's employees to use contraceptives any more directly than they do by authorizing Freshway to pay wages,\" wrote Edwards, who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter. He added that the Gilardis remain free to publicly express their disapproval of contraceptives.\n\nComing from the other direction, Judge A. Raymond Randolph joined Brown's main conclusion about the Gilardis but dissented from her conclusions about Freshway companies' exercise of religion.\n\n\"Why limit the free-exercise right to religious organizations when many business corporations adhere to religious dogma?\" asked Randolph, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush. \"If non-religious organizations do not have free-exercise rights, why do non-religious natural persons (atheists, for example) possess them?\"\n\nThe Gilardis' lawyer, Francis Manion, senior counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, an anti-abortion legal group that focuses on constitutional law, said he was pleased that the court accepted the \"bulk\" of his arguments, but will appeal the part of the ruling on the free exercise religious rights of corporations.\n\n\"It's a big victory, but not total,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\nIn a statement, the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United, a church-state watchdog group, said the Friday's ruling turns \"the concept of religious freedom on its head.\"\n\n\"Religious liberty means the right to make decisions for yourself, not other people,\" Lynn said. \"Freedom of religion should never be a blank check to meddle in the personal medical decisions of others.\"\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services was unable to comment on pending litigation.",
    " Title: Obama and Trump: A Study in Contrasting Presidencies and Legacies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent series of public statements, former President Barack Obama has continued his criticism of his successor, President Donald Trump. The former president's charges, however, seem paradoxical, as he appears to claim credit for Trump's economic successes while also criticizing Trump's policies as pernicious and failing.\n\nObama's assertion that Trump's successes are due to his own administration and that Trump's setbacks are his own overlooks the traditional rule that presidents, fairly or not, are credited or blamed for everything that happens during their tenure, from the start of their term to the last hour.\n\nTrump ran on a platform of \"Make America Great Again,\" promising a economic renaissance, massive deregulation, fair trade, and tax reform and reduction. He sought to reindustrialize the Midwest, open new federal land to fossil-fuel production, complete proposed pipelines, and lift burdensome restrictions on fracking and horizontal drilling.\n\nIn contrast, Obama had argued that the U.S. could not drill its way out of oil shortages and advocated making the use of coal so expensive that it would disappear as an American energy resource. Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar were Obama's vision of an America energy future.\n\nAs late as last year, Larry Summers, director of the National Economic Council for two years during the Obama administration, ridiculed Trump's boasts that he could achieve annualized GDP growth of 3 percent as the stuff of \"tooth fairies and ludicrous supply-side economics.\" Summers had also predicted that the U.S. economy would be in recession by now. Instead, it is likely to match or exceed Trump's promise of 3 percent growth over a twelve-month period.\n\nAfter Trump's victory, economist and Obama supporter Paul Krugman predicted that the stock market would crash and would probably \"never\" recover. \"We are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight,\" Krugman wrote in November 2016. In fact, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed about 7,000 points since Trump was elected. Unemployment has hit near-record lows, wage gains are up, and the economy is growing.\n\nHowever, after 22 months, no one knows what the final verdict will be on the Trump administration. It seems wise to wait until Trump's four-year term is over before weighing in on his legacy or lack thereof.\n\nSimilarly, Obama should take a deep breath, stop arguing the past, and allow history to adjudicate his own eight-year economic and foreign-policy record. Given that Obama was a strong progressive while Trump has proven to be a hard-right conservative, their presidencies offer a sort of laboratory of contrasting worldviews.\n\nHistory will decide whether a more managed or more deregulated economy works best. We will learn whether a focus on traditional energy sources is preferable to an emphasis on subsidized green energy.\n\nIn recent times, Republican ex-presidents - Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush - left the limelight at the end of their tenures. They kept silent about their successors and allowed history to be the judge of their relative successes or failures. Reagan and the younger Bush often were ensconced on their ranches in out-of-the-way places. Obama would do well to buy a ranch, too.\n\nIn contrast, progressive ex-presidents such as Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Obama saw the presidency as a never-ending story. Politics were a 24/7, 360-degree, all-encompassing experience. All envisioned their retirements as opportunities to relitigate their administrations and to politick the present in hopes that future kindred presidencies would be progressive and would continue their own agendas.\n\nCarter frequently warned that the Reagan defense buildup and tough stance toward the Soviet Union were dangerous and would lead to an existential confrontation. Clinton became a fierce critic of the Iraq War as his wife Hillary prepared to enter the 2008 presidential race as an anti-Bush candidate. Obama still seeks to convince the country that Trump is \"unfit\" to be president.\n\nAfter the recent passing of George H. W. Bush, there are now four living ex-presidents: Carter, Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama. There are five living former vice presidents: Walter Mondale, Dan Quayle, Al Gore, Dick Cheney, and Joe Biden. If all ex-presidents and ex-vice presidents were to weigh in nonstop on the current president and present-day politics, the result would be as chaotic as it would be boring.",
    " Title: Political Polarization and the Role of Rhetoric in the 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing 2016 presidential race has been marked by a significant increase in political polarization, with candidates such as Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump drawing criticism for their use of inflammatory language. The debate about American political polarization has gained nationwide attention, as both Cruz and Trump have been at the center of media attention for their extreme rhetoric.\n\nIn a recent interview, Frederick Mayer, professor of public policy, political science, and environment at Duke University, explained that the candidates' rhetoric is tapping into the anxieties of certain American populations about American decline, threats from terrorism, and perceived threats to the American way of life.\n\nDuring last Tuesday's State of the Union address, President Barack Obama assured Americans that the country is not in decline, despite inflammatory claims. He stated, \"I told you earlier all the talk of America's economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. Let me tell you something\u2014the United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth, period.\"\n\nMayer noted that factors such as low unemployment, low crime levels, and fewer instances of terrorism on American soil should ease the anxiety of Americans. He stated, \"It's ironic because you can make the claim that we have less to fear today than just about any people in any time in history.\"\n\nJunior Adam Lemon, president of the Duke College Republicans, said that extreme rhetoric was necessary for the success of Trump and Cruz in a field of more than 15 candidates, where standing out in any way was imperative. He also noted that cable news has used stories about Trump to boost ratings.\n\nFreshman Steve Hassey, communications director for Duke Democrats, said that Trump's polarizing nature and the mass coverage of him have made the race even more polarizing.\n\nBoth Lemon and Mayer discussed how news can have a negative impact when it focuses on polarizing comments. However, Mayer remained optimistic that bipartisan reform is possible and will occur on certain issues. On campus, there have been a few bipartisan discussions, such as the Battle of the Brains debate between college Democrats and Republicans hosted by Duke Student Government last November.\n\nDespite the bipartisan discussions, Lemon noted that there are barriers to fostering discussion between students of opposing political parties on campus. He stated, \"There are a lot more liberals on campus than conservatives. Liberals tend to talk amongst themselves. Conservatives are afraid to express their opinions, so they don't really talk, and neither side is really willing to engage too much.\"\n\nMayer attributed the polarization and the lack of engagement between the two sides to something more than just extreme rhetoric. He stated, \"At some deep level, many of the problems we've been talking about are really manifestations of a loss of trust in each other, in our institutions, and the like. This whole dysfunction is a trust problem. We stopped trusting institutions. We don't trust politicians. A world where you have very little trust is a much less functional world.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth Slams Trump's Actions, Calls for Unity and Respect for Constitution\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week, the actions of President Donald Trump raised concerns among many Americans regarding the First Amendment rights to peaceably assemble and the potential misuse of the U.S. military. In a strongly worded statement, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) criticized the president's actions, particularly his use of federal law enforcement to forcibly remove peaceful protesters for a photo-op and his threats to exploit the military to achieve political goals.\n\nDuckworth, a former U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and combat veteran of the Iraq War, expressed her disappointment in Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, for following Trump blindly when he violates the Constitution. She also criticized Republican Senator Tom Cotton for his sycophantic defense of Trump's threats in the New York Times.\n\nDuckworth stated, \"Tear-gassing peaceful protesters is not leadership; it's cowardice. Threatening military force and imprisonment against Americans exercising their Constitutional rights is not presidential, it's tin-pot dictatorial.\" She emphasized the importance of the ballot box as the last off-ramp to prevent any commander in chief from using our active-duty servicemembers to silence Americans and exacerbate divisions in the country.\n\nDuckworth concluded her statement by expressing her hope that our leaders would unite Americans during times of crisis, listen to cries for help, and give those fighting for justice a platform to be heard, rather than treating them like enemies who can only be dealt with by using force. She emphasized the need for a commander in chief who pulls the nation together instead of abusing our dedicated servicemembers to push us further apart.",
    " Title: Franklin Graham Criticizes Robert Gates for Reversing Boy Scouts' Gay Scoutmaster Ban\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a strongly worded post on Facebook, Franklin Graham, the prominent evangelist and son of the late Billy Graham, has criticized Robert Gates, the President of the Boy Scouts of America, for his recent call to end the organization's ban on openly gay scoutmasters.\n\nGates, the former U.S. Secretary of Defense, made the announcement at the Boy Scouts' annual meeting in Atlanta on Thursday, stating that the status quo in the organization's membership standards could not be sustained.\n\nIn his Facebook post, which had received over 40,000 \"likes\" and 11,000 comments as of Friday evening, Graham wrote, \"Robert Gates, shame on you for not having the moral courage to do what is right.\" He further expressed his disapproval, stating, \"We should not shift as the winds of cultural change blow through society; we need to stand for God's truth and things that are morally right.\"\n\nGraham's post followed Gates' remarks at the meeting, where he expressed concerns about the potential risks to young boys if the ban were lifted. He did not, however, indicate any immediate plans to revoke the membership charters of troops known to have gay adults in supervisory roles.\n\nGraham, who is also the president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Samaritan's Purse, an international Christian charity, urged Boy Scouts and parents to express their displeasure with Gates' decision and warned that the organization may lose their support and participation if the policy change proceeds.\n\nGates, who was elected as the Boy Scouts' president in 2014, had previously stated that he would not address the issue of gay scoutmasters during his term to avoid causing a \"formal, permanent split\" in the organization. However, he did support the organization's decision to allow openly gay scouts in 2013.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America has faced criticism and lost partnerships with companies such as Lockheed Martin and Walt Disney due to the ban on openly gay scoutmasters. Advocates for gay scouts have welcomed Gates' recent remarks, while others have expressed ambivalence.\n\nDavid Barton, an Orange County, California, cubmaster and father of two boys in scouting, told the Los Angeles Times, \"It's one of those things I was hoping I wouldn't have to think about for years to come.\" Barton also expressed concerns about gay scout leaders accompanying boys on camping trips.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America has not yet announced any changes to their policy regarding openly gay scoutmasters. The organization's board is expected to discuss the issue further in the coming months.",
    " Title: Trump Campaign Launches \"Official Impeachment Defense Task Force,\" Raises Funds Amid Impeachment Calls\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the growing calls for impeachment from Democratic lawmakers, President Donald Trump's reelection campaign has launched an \"Official Impeachment Defense Task Force\" and sent out a fundraising email Tuesday. The email, which was sent out in the afternoon, urged supporters to donate to the campaign to help defend the president amid the impeachment discussions.\n\nThe email, which contained several dubious promises, claimed that immediate contributions would result in donors being added to the \"Official Impeachment Defense Task Force.\" The email also stated that donations would be \"double matched,\" a claim that is unlikely to be true due to federal campaign finance laws that impose strict limits on political donations.\n\nThe number of Democrats calling for impeachment has been gradually increasing over the summer, but as recently as last week, this step was still opposed by the Democratic Party leadership. Following revelations that Trump pressed Ukraine's president to investigate discredited allegations against Joe Biden and withheld military aid from the country to ramp up pressure, dozens of Democratic lawmakers joined the call to begin impeachment proceedings.\n\nAhead of a 5 p.m. press conference Tuesday afternoon, at which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to publicly call for an impeachment inquiry, the Trump campaign fired off its fundraising pitch. The email stated that the impeachment claims have nothing to do with the president and that the Democrats are trying to silence and intimidate his supporters.\n\nThe email also suggested that by donating to the campaign, supporters would be defending the very integrity of America. The future of American freedom, according to the email, rests on the shoulders of men and women willing to defend it from these hateful attacks.\n\nThe fundraising appeal claimed that Trump had personally requested to see a list of people who had joined his \"Official Impeachment Defense Task Force\" and urged donors to send their money before 3:30 p.m., when the list would supposedly be sent to the president. Shortly after the deadline passed, Trump's campaign sent a nearly identical email, this one saying the deadline was 4 p.m.\n\nCampaigns have fairly wide latitude to make promises in campaign fundraising emails, so Team Trump's claims of an official \"Task Force\" or that Trump would personally review the names of donors don't have to be true. Another suspect claim: the email's pledge that donations would be \"double-matched.\"\n\nDonor match programs are common in the nonprofit fundraising world and are considered to be highly effective in encouraging donors who might be on the fence about giving. In the nonprofit world, a match program typically involves a one or several particularly generous donors, who are poised to write big checks if smaller donors start giving. However, in the political sphere, federal campaign finance laws make things a little more complicated, since individual donors are legally capped at giving no more than $5,400 to a campaign per election cycle. That means a single generous donor can't match new small donations. If a campaign wants to raise money on any large scale, even a handful of generous matching donors won't work\u2014hundreds or thousands would be necessary. It's unlikely that would really happen.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to questions about its \"Official Impeachment Defense Task Force,\" how many donors had joined, or how it planned to \"double-match\" their contributions.",

Feld also noted that the transition of the elephants off the road led to an even more dramatic drop in ticket sales.\n\nBefore taking its final bow, the Ringling Bros. circus will perform 30 shows across the United States between now and May. The shows will mark the end of a 146-year run for the iconic circus, which first began in 1871.\n\nThe Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus has been a staple of American entertainment for generations, but the changing landscape of the entertainment industry and the increasing focus on animal welfare have taken their toll on the business. The circus's decision to remove elephants from its performances in 2016 was a significant factor in the decline of ticket sales.\n\nThe circus's final performances will be a bittersweet moment for fans of the iconic show, but the decision to close the circus was a necessary one for the company. Feld Entertainment will continue to focus on other aspects of the entertainment industry, including live events, television, and digital media.\n\nThe Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus will be missed by many, but its legacy will live on as a symbol of American entertainment and the magic of the circus.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Praise for Sen. Orrin Hatch Amidst Political Tensions in the Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, the Senate floor witnessed a moment of bipartisan unity this week as Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah was recognized for his historic service as the longest-serving Republican senator in history. The two majority and minority leaders, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), put aside their partisan differences to honor Hatch's career and contributions.\n\nThe recognition ceremony took place on Thursday, with both leaders praising Hatch's bipartisan approach and his key role in powerful committees. McConnell, the Republican leader, highlighted Hatch's achievements beyond politics, mentioning his career as a songwriter with gold and platinum albums. Schumer, the Democratic leader, described Hatch as a \"terrific guy\" and an \"honorable man,\" noting his ability to work productively with political adversaries, such as the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA).\n\nHatch, who has been in the Senate for 40 years, 1 month, and 6 days, responded to the praise with a humble demeanor, expressing concern about the current state of the Senate and President Trump's administration. He urged patience with the president and called for senators to work together, stating, \"I\u2019m concerned about this body and how it\u2019s going. I\u2019m also concerned about the president.\"\n\nHatch also expressed support for President Trump's cabinet choices and asked for understanding and consideration when criticizing the president, who is a newcomer to politics. He noted the slow pace of confirming cabinet nominees and expressed hope for a more cooperative atmosphere in the Senate.\n\nIn his remarks, Hatch invoked his work with Sen. Kennedy and their ability to find common ground despite their deep ideological differences. He also praised both McConnell and Schumer, stating that they have the potential to \"really help us save this country\" if they could dial back the fighting.\n\nThe moment of bipartisan unity was not without its political undertones, as Hatch's comments were seen as a veiled criticism of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who he had sharply criticized for her floor speech earlier in the week. However, the moment served as a reminder of the Senate's tradition of disagreeing without being disagreeable, a tradition that seems to be fading in the current political climate.\n\nSchumer acknowledged Hatch's service and contributions, stating, \"I thank my friend from Utah and for his kind words and much more importantly for his distinguished service to this country.\" The Senate adjourned shortly after, having tussled its way to a party-line confirmation of Tom Price as the next secretary of Health and Human Services.",
    " Title: Trump Family Files Lawsuit Against Deutsche Bank and Capital One to Block Congressional Subpoenas\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a federal lawsuit filed on Monday in New York, President Donald Trump and his family members, including his sons Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and daughter Ivanka Trump, as well as the Trump Organization, are suing Deutsche Bank and Capital One to block subpoenas issued by the House Financial Services and Intelligence Committees. The lawsuit aims to invalidate the subpoenas, which the Trumps' lawyers argue serve \"no legitimate or lawful purpose.\"\n\nThe lawsuit contends that the subpoenas are part of a political effort to \"rummage through every aspect\" of the President's personal finances, businesses, and private information, in search of material that could be used to cause political damage. The Trumps' lawyers claim that no grounds exist to establish any purpose other than a political one.\n\nThis latest move is the latest escalation in Trump's fight against mounting House investigations into his administration, presidential campaign, and business empire. In recent days, Trump has vowed to fight all congressional subpoenas, accusing Democrats of trying to sully his presidency.\n\nIn a joint statement, House Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) described the lawsuit as a \"meritless lawsuit\" not designed to succeed but to \"put off meaningful accountability as long as possible.\" They added that Democrats are seeking Trump's financial records as part of investigations into potential foreign influence on the U.S. political process and the abuse of the U.S. financial system for illicit purposes.\n\nDeutsche Bank, a German lender that has served as Trump's go-to lender for years, said in a statement that it is \"committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations.\" Capital One also intends to comply with the subpoena before May 6, absent court intervention.\n\nThe lawsuit describes a sweeping inquiry into the Trump family's finances going back decades. The two banks provide the Trumps with numerous \"personal, family, and business accounts.\" The committees, according to the Trumps' lawyers, have refused to provide copies of the subpoenas to the Trump family, and their scope was learned from Deustche Bank and Capital One. The committees are seeking \"all banking and financial records not just concerning the individual plaintiffs, but also their own family members,\" the lawyers said.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by lawyers representing the Trumps, including Marc Mukasey, a former law firm partner of Rudy Giuliani's, the president's personal lawyer. In a statement, Mukasey and Patrick Strawbridge, who is also representing the Trumps in the case, said the lawsuit was filed to \"protect the privacy rights of the President, his family, and their businesses.\" The lawsuit claims that the subpoenas violate the Right to Financial Privacy Act.\n\nThe lawsuit comes a week after the president asked a federal court to block the House Oversight and Reform Committee's subpoena to accounting firm Mazars USA. The Democrat-led committee subpoenaed the firm to obtain eight years of Trump's financial records. The Oversight Committee said it needs the documents in order to corroborate testimony from former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, who alleged that the president artificially inflated and deflated the value of his assets for his personal benefit.\n\nDuring an explosive public hearing in February, Cohen disclosed copies of Trump's financial statements, which he said were turned over to Deutsche Bank as Trump was seeking a loan to place a bid on an NFL team, the Buffalo Bills. Those statements, according to Cohen, contained false information. The committee has requested similar records from Capital One, which asked for a \"friendly\" subpoena before it could comply.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Republicans have rushed to Trump's defense amid the onslaught of investigations and subpoenas, claiming Democrats are abusing their authority to take down the president and eventually impeach him. Democratic leaders remain opposed to launching impeachment proceedings against Trump, preferring instead to continue investigating the president for obstruction of justice allegations and financial misdeeds.",
    " Title: Jury in Paul Manafort Trial Sends Four Questions to Judge, Leaves Court Without Reaching Verdict\n\nArticle:\n\nThe jury in the trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has yet to reach a verdict, as deliberations entered their second day on Thursday. The jury deliberated all day but did not come to a conclusion, instead sending Judge T.S. Ellis four questions, one of which asked for a clarification on the definition of \"reasonable doubt.\"\n\nThe case against Manafort is complex, with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team charging him with four different types of offenses and 18 counts in total. Prosecutors submitted hundreds of exhibits of evidence for the jury to review, and a unanimous verdict is required for each count, with a mistrial being declared for any counts on which the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict.\n\nOne of the questions posed by the jury pertained to Manafort's offshore accounts, which contained tens of millions of dollars. Prosecutors charged him with four counts of failing to file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR), a legally required form to disclose foreign holdings to the US government. The jury asked whether someone would have to file an FBAR if they owned less than 50% of a company and had no signatory authority. Judge Ellis answered this question, stating that if a person controlled the disposition of money from the account or if the listed owner of the account was acting as an agent for that person, the person would indeed be legally required to file an FBAR.\n\nAnother question related to the definition of a \"shelf company,\" a term used to describe Manafort's complex offshore holdings in Cyprus that were structured as companies with no apparent activity. The jury asked for the definition of a shelf company, but Judge Ellis declined to answer, instructing the jury to rely on their \"collective recollection.\"\n\nThe jury also asked Judge Ellis to define the concept of \"reasonable doubt\" again, as Manafort's lawyers emphasized during their closing argument that the government had to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, a high and difficult standard to meet. Judge Ellis answered this question by telling the jury that prosecutors do not have to prove their case beyond \"all possible doubt,\" but instead beyond doubt that is based on reason.\n\nFinally, the jury asked whether they could get a list of which particular pieces of evidence are said to match up with each of the 18 separate charges against Manafort. Judge Ellis declined to provide this list. The jury ended the day without reaching a verdict and will continue deliberations on Friday.",
    " Title: New IRS Commissioner Vows to Restore Trust, Address Scandals and Misconduct\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his first appearance before a Congressional committee, newly appointed Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Daniel Werfel has pledged to restore trust in the tax collection agency, following allegations of political targeting of conservative groups and misconduct.\n\nDuring the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on Monday, Werfel, who has been in office for 12 days, stated his \"primary mission\" is to restore trust in the IRS. He has ordered a comprehensive review of IRS operations and has installed new leadership at several critical levels of the agency.\n\nThe hearing followed the release of a report in May by the IRS Inspector General, which revealed that during the 2010 and 2012 elections, groups with conservative-sounding names that applied for tax-exempt status were singled out for extended questioning by an IRS office in Cincinnati. Werfel described the conduct as \"inappropriate and unacceptable.\"\n\nMembers of Congress from both parties criticized the IRS's misconduct. Rep. Hal Rogers (R) of Kentucky, chairman of the full appropriations committee, stated that the IRS \"has committed grave violations of the public trust\" and that \"we will not tolerate another political enemies list.\"\n\nThe hearing also addressed the issue of excessive spending on employee conferences and videos. The Inspector General's office is scheduled to release a report on Tuesday that the Associated Press says will show the IRS spent $50 million to hold 220 employee conferences between 2010 and 2012. Among the embarrassing evidence is a video showing IRS employees dancing to the rhythm and blues song \"Cupid Shuffle\" at a 2010 conference.\n\nThe IRS scandals come at a sensitive time for the agency, as it will play a key role in implementing the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's signature legislative achievement. The Obama administration is seeking a 9 percent increase in IRS funding for the federal budget year that starts in October.\n\nCommissioner Werfel stated, \"The solution here is not more money.\" He suggested finding the \"optimal footprint\" for agency operations before turning to the question of agency funding.\n\nThe political impact of the controversy has been on display. On CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, Rep. Darrell Issa (R) of California stated that interviews with workers in the Cincinnati IRS office show the targeting of conservative groups was \"a problem that was coordinated in all likelihood right out of Washington headquarters \u2013 and we're getting to proving it.\"\n\nRep. Rita Lowey (D) of New York, the ranking Democrat on the full Appropriations Committee, stated that reports of the spending on employee conferences left her \"simply wondering what the IRS was thinking.\"\n\nCongressional scrutiny of the agency will continue. The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing Tuesday featuring representatives from conservative groups that were targeted by the IRS. Some of those groups filed a joint lawsuit against the agency last week.\n\nLater in the week, the Inspector General will appear before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to discuss his audit of IRS spending on employee gatherings.",
    " Title: U.S. Embassy in Baghdad Under Siege as Protests Erupt Over Airstrikes in Iraq\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions escalated in Iraq on Tuesday as crowds of protesters, some reportedly wearing militia uniforms, stormed the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad, prompting U.S. guards to respond with tear gas. The demonstrators, who were chanting \"Down, Down USA,\" set up tents outside the embassy, vowing to stage a sit-in until American troops leave Iraq and the embassy is closed.\n\nThe unrest followed U.S. airstrikes on Sunday that killed 25 fighters of the Iran-backed Kataeb Hezbollah militia. The U.S. military said the airstrikes were in retaliation for last week's killing of an American contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base, which the U.S. blamed on the militia.\n\nAs of Tuesday night, about 100 Marines were being sent to the embassy to bolster security, and an Army Apache helicopter flew over the premises and dropped flares in a \"show of force.\" A U.S. defense official told Fox News that the goal was to disperse the crowd.\n\nEarlier in the day, at least six U.S. soldiers were seen standing on the roof of the main building, pointing their firearms at the demonstrators, and sounds of gunfire could be heard. U.S. Ambassador Matthew H. Tueller was not evacuated, but was out of the country on a planned vacation, a U.S. official said.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted, \"Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!\"\n\nThe embassy attack, one of the worst in recent memory, followed the deadly U.S. airstrikes on Sunday. A video obtained by the AP showed the demonstrators trashing the embassy's reception area and also taking away paperwork.\n\nThe U.S. military said military jet fighters conducted \"precision defensive strikes\" on five sites belonging to Kataeb Hezbollah. Two defense officials added that Air Force F-15 jet fighters carried out the strikes.\n\nSupporters of the militia held funerals Tuesday for the fighters killed before setting their sights on the embassy. The mob shouted \"Down, Down USA!\" as the crowd first tried to push inside the embassy grounds, hurling water and stones over its walls. They raised yellow militia flags and taunted the embassy's security staff who remained behind the glass windows in the gates' reception area. The mob also sprayed red graffiti on the wall and windows, in support of the Kataeb Hezbollah, reading: \"Closed in the name of the resistance.\"\n\nFollowing the breach of the gate, an Associated Press reporter at the scene saw flames rising from inside the compound. Smoke from tear gas that was fired rose in the area, and at least three of the protesters appeared to have difficulties breathing. A man on a loudspeaker also was heard urging the mob not to enter the compound, saying: \"The message was delivered.\"\n\nNo one was immediately reported hurt in the rampage, and security staff withdrew inside the embassy when protesters started to gather outside. The U.S. Embassy, on its Facebook page, urged American citizens not to approach the compound and \"to review their personal security and emergency preparedness.\"\n\nAs the situation unfolded, Iraqi security forces were deployed to protect the embassy, and the U.S. differentiated between the militia groups and the legitimate protesters who have been in the streets for the last couple of months demanding a better government and a better future for themselves. The Iraqi troops would not move in to break up the crowd by force.\n\nThe U.S. and Iraqi governments have yet to comment on the situation's future developments.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Outlines Four Priorities for First 100 Days as President\n\nIn the run-up to the upcoming presidential election, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has outlined her four priorities for her first 100 days in office. The former First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State has emphasized her commitment to creating jobs, comprehensive immigration reform, campaign finance reform, and criminal justice reform.\n\nClinton's first priority is to invest in job creation and infrastructure. She plans to invest in infrastructure and manufacturing to stimulate economic growth and produce renewable energy for every home in America within a decade. She also aims to cut red tape for small businesses and make it easier for entrepreneurs to secure credit.\n\nSecond on Clinton's list is comprehensive immigration reform. She intends to work across party lines to pass legislation that keeps families together, creates a path to citizenship, secures the border, and focuses enforcement resources on violent criminals.\n\nThird, Clinton plans to introduce a constitutional amendment within her first 30 days in office to overturn the Citizens United decision, aiming to remove secret, unaccountable money from politics.\n\nLastly, Clinton is committed to criminal justice reform, advocating for the release of non-violent offenders and a focus on respect for the law and respect by the law for all citizens.\n\nClinton's campaign emphasizes unity and cooperation, contrasting her opponent's divisive and confrontational approach. She has stated her intention to be president for all Americans, regardless of political affiliation or background.\n\nThe election is a significant turning point for the nation, with the outcome determining the direction of change in America. Clinton's priorities reflect her focus on job creation, immigration reform, campaign finance reform, and criminal justice reform, with a commitment to working together and investing in the American people.",
    " Title: House Intelligence Committee Advances \"Phase 2\" of Dossier Probe, Issues Questionnaire to Former and Current Officials\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee, led by Republican Devin Nunes, has moved forward with \"Phase 2\" of its investigation into the origins of the unverified anti-Trump dossier. In a letter obtained by Fox News, Nunes has sent a series of dossier-related questions to current and former intelligence, law enforcement, and State Department officials.\n\nThe letter, dated February 20, poses a dozen questions about the dossier, including when the officials learned of its Democratic funding and how it was used to obtain one or more surveillance warrants at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Nunes has threatened to issue subpoenas if the officials do not provide timely answers voluntarily.\n\nIn early March, Nunes, with cooperation from the White House, released a controversial memo alleging that the anti-Trump dossier, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele and funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign, was crucial in the application for a surveillance warrant against Trump associate Carter Page.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the memo as misleading and have expressed a desire to release a counter-memo, though this has been delayed by national security objections from the White House. Amid the ongoing controversy, Nunes announced earlier this month that his committee would pursue \"Phase 2\" of the investigation, focusing on scrutinizing the State Department and other agencies.\n\nThe questionnaire, sent to about two dozen current and former officials, includes inquiries about the officials' knowledge of the dossier's Democratic funding and any meetings or official actions related to the unverified allegations against Trump. Among the recipients are former FBI Director James Comey, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and former CIA Director John Brennan, who testified in May 2017 that he was unaware of the FBI relying on the dossier as part of any court applications.\n\nA source close to the investigation has suggested that more officials may be questioned as the investigation continues. In anticipation of this phase of the investigation, an Obama State Department official earlier this month acknowledged regular contact with the dossier's author, Jonathan Winer. In a Washington Post column, Winer detailed an extensive exchange of documents with Steele, a friend since 2009. He shared more than 100 of Steele's reports with the Russia experts at the State Department over a period of two years, but these were not related to American politics. However, he later shared information about the Trump dossier with the top levels of the Obama State Department.\n\nFurther, Winer said he shared separate Trump-related material passed on by a Clinton contact with Steele. He also acknowledged that material, originally from Clinton-tied activist/journalist Cody Shearer, made its way to the FBI. In publishing his Op-Ed, Winer wrote that he suspects Nunes wants to know about his own relationship with Steele while at the Obama State Department.\n\nA spokesman for the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, said Schiff was unavailable for an interview. The ongoing investigation continues to shed light on the role of the dossier in the surveillance of Trump associates and the political climate surrounding the 2016 election.",
    " Title: \" Tulsa Rally: Trump's Campaign Struggles to Draw Crowds Amid National Crises\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to revitalize his reelection campaign, President Donald Trump held a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday. However, the event, which was expected to attract thousands, saw a significantly lower turnout, with only about 6,200 people attending.\n\nThe rally, which was initially touted as a sign of the President's enduring popularity, was marred by empty seats in the arena and an unused second stage set up for an overflow crowd. The President's campaign attributed the low attendance to protesters blocking his supporters, a claim refuted by reporters on the ground.\n\nSeveral explanations have been proposed for the lackluster attendance. Some speculate that TikTok users, who had reserved tickets with no intention of attending, contributed to the low turnout. Health concerns over the coronavirus may also have deterred potential attendees.\n\nThe event's poor showing has sparked debate over its implications for Trump's reelection prospects. Some observers view the small crowd as a sign of waning enthusiasm among the President's base supporters, while others argue that the rally's significance should not be overstated, given the current uncertain times.\n\nCritics argue that the rally's content was equally inauspicious. The President's speech focused on his walking awkwardly down a ramp and his claim that he had advised his coronavirus task force to \"slow the testing down\" to keep the number of positive cases lower. The speech, some argue, lacked a clear case for why voters should want him in office for another four years.\n\nHowever, some experts caution against drawing sweeping conclusions from a single event. They argue that elections are not determined by rally crowds and that health concerns may have kept many Trump supporters from attending the rally, but may not have the same impact on Election Day.\n\nTrump's reelection chances will hinge on his ability to manage the economic, public health, and social crises currently gripping the country, some experts argue. If he is able to do so effectively, a poorly attended rally months before the election will likely be mostly forgotten.\n\nThe President held a series of small campaign events in Arizona focused on border security on Tuesday. His campaign is planning upcoming rallies in Florida, Texas, and North Carolina, with dates yet to be set.\n\nThe small crowd size at the Tulsa rally suggests Trump's base of devoted supporters is shrinking, according to some observers. Jonathan Allen of NBC News stated, \"To explain how he might be able to win despite poor polling numbers \u2014 and amid national crises \u2014 he has posited that a'silent majority' of Americans backs him. But the poor turnout suggests just the opposite \u2014 that enthusiasm for him is weaker than it appears.\"\n\nKevin Liptak and Kaitlan Collins of CNN wrote, \"Once viewed inside the White House and Trump's campaign as a reset button for a presidency beset by crises and self-inflicted wounds, Saturday evening's campaign rally in Tulsa instead became plagued with pitfalls, a disappointing microcosm of the blindspots, denial, and wishful thinking that have come to guide the president as he enters one of the most precarious moments of his first term.\"",
    " Title: New Secretary of State John Kerry Holds First Round of International Calls\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his first weekend as the 68th U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry made a series of international calls to discuss a range of global issues. According to a readout released by the State Department on Sunday, Kerry spoke with leaders from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, Mexico, and Canada.\n\nOn Sunday, Kerry spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the recent Israeli elections and the Middle East peace process. He also discussed Israeli-Palestinian relations with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and vowed to continue efforts with Congress to send funds to the authority.\n\nThe conversations came a day after Kerry spoke with Israeli President Shimon Peres, whom he has known since he was a freshman senator. Kerry also spoke to Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan on Sunday, two days after being sworn-in as the U.S. secretary of state on Friday.\n\nOn Saturday, Kerry spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu about Friday's terrorist attack on the perimeter of the U.S. Embassy in Ankara. Davutoglu updated Kerry on the investigation of the suicide bomber who killed himself and one other. Istanbul police have identified the bomber as Ecevit Sanli, a member of the Marxist Leninist organization known as the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party, or DHKP-C, which the U.S. government and others label a terrorist organization.\n\nKerry and Davutoglu also discussed the violent unrest in Syria and broader Middle East issues. Kerry also spoke with Mexican Foreign Secretary Jose Meade on Saturday, expressing condolences for those killed and injured in Thursday's explosion at the offices of the state oil company, Pemex, in Mexico City. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto posted on Twitter Sunday afternoon that a 35th body had been found.\n\nCanadian Foreign Minister John Baird was also on the list of phone calls Saturday. Among other issues, they agreed to stay in touch on the Keystone XL pipeline, which would extend from Canada's tar sands down to the Gulf of Mexico. Construction on the southern portion of the pipeline has already begun, while the northern leg in the United States awaits approval.\n\nKerry also had a discussion Saturday with former Secretary of State George Shultz, who served under President Ronald Reagan. According to State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, Kerry has now met with or spoken by phone with each living secretary of state.\n\nThe conversations all took place after President Barack Obama announced Kerry as his nominee on December 21.",
    " Title: New York Times Analysis: Republicans Slightly Favorable in Senate Takeover Bid, According to Nonpartisan Polling\n\nThe latest nonpartisan polling, including a YouGov online panel, suggests that the Republican Party has a slight advantage in their bid to regain control of the U.S. Senate in November, according to The New York Times. The data, which incorporates surveys, fundraising data, and other factors, gives the GOP a 60% chance of picking up the six seats they need, up from 54% in April.\n\nThe most likely outcome, according to Amanda Cox and Josh Katz of the Times, is a Republican gain of six seats, the minimum they need to secure a 51-to-49-seat majority. However, the Times notes that a gain of anywhere from four to eight seats is also possible.\n\nThe YouGov poll indicates that Republicans have made gains in Michigan, Georgia, and North Carolina, but these shifts are offset by positive numbers for Democrats in Colorado and Alaska. Meanwhile, Republicans also have a slight lead in Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, Iowa, and Michigan, according to the highest quality data, the Times reported.\n\nHowever, the Republican advantage is not significant in these states, suggesting that the Senate race remains up for grabs, the Times said.\n\nThe accuracy of these predictions hinges on the type of polling used. Most polls continue to use traditional, random-digit dialing to reach a sample of people by phone. However, declining response rates are creating less accurate predictions. Young voters and nonwhite voters, who are least likely to respond to telephone surveys, are making for inaccurate predictions.\n\nThe YouGov survey, which produced the first set of data from an online panel this year, is likely to be more accurate than traditional methods, the Times said.\n\nIn conclusion, the Times reported, \"Republicans appear to have narrow leads in enough states to win the Senate, but only narrow leads.\" The newspaper emphasized that the Senate race remains a close contest.",
    " Title: Christie's Decision to Hold Special Senate Election Sparks Controversy in New Jersey\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and speculation, New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie has announced the scheduling of a special election on October 16 to fill the vacant Senate seat left by the late Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg. The decision has been met with mixed reactions, with some viewing it as a politically advantageous move for Christie, while others see it as a necessary step to ensure New Jersey's representation in the U.S. Senate.\n\nChristie, who is running for a second term and is rumored to have White House ambitions, insisted that the only concern in his decision-making was the importance of elected representation for New Jersey in the U.S. Senate. He argued that the value of having a senator to represent the state's interests outweighed the added costs of scheduling a special statewide election just a few weeks before the regularly scheduled election in November.\n\nHowever, cynics were quick to point out that Christie's move could be a strategic one, aimed at maximizing his re-election victory margin. The theory is that by scheduling the special and general elections on separate dates, Christie hoped to prevent Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a Democrat running for the Senate seat, from drawing big numbers of energized Democrats to the polls, potentially cutting into Christie's expected victory margin in November.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Christie defended his decision, stating, \"The cost associated with having a special primary and general election, in my mind, can not be measured against the value of having an elected representative in the United States Senate when so many consequential issues are being debated and determined this year. The citizens of New Jersey need to have an elected representative to the U.S. Senate, and have it as soon as possible.\"\n\nWhile some remain skeptical of Christie's motives, his explanation for the decision has been plausible, at least in part. Only time will tell how well Christie has finessed this decision and whether it will ultimately prove to be in the best interests of the state and its citizens.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Reach Tentative Commitments on Cyberattacks and South China Sea at Obama-Xi Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping concluded their summit with tentative commitments on two of the most sensitive issues: alleged Chinese cyberattacks on the U.S. and Chinese island-building in the South China Sea. The commitments from Beijing put off any immediate threat of U.S. imposing sanctions on Chinese entities over cyberattacks or taking more robust military action around China's artificial islands.\n\nDuring the joint news conference, President Obama directly accused Beijing of engaging in cybertheft from U.S. companies, stating, \"It has to stop.\" Mr. Xi denied China's involvement in the theft of commercial secrets or other hacking and said the proper approach was to strengthen cooperation to avoid confrontations and not to politicize the issue.\n\nThe U.S. and China announced an agreement not to direct or support cyberattacks that steal corporate records for economic benefit, likely staving off the immediate prospect of U.S. sanctions. However, it wasn't clear how effective the measures would be.\n\nRegarding the South China Sea, Mr. Xi repeated China's long-standing position that it has had sovereignty over the South China Sea islands \"since ancient times.\" Mr. Xi's commitment to not \"militarize\" the islands was new, although it sounded similar to statements made by lower-level officials to Secretary of State John Kerry over the summer.\n\nU.S. officials say China's facilities could be used to enforce territorial claims in the area and to establish an air defense identification zone over much of the South China Sea. The two leaders also made progress toward what could someday be a far-ranging trade and investment agreement that would open up closed sectors of China's economy.\n\nOutside the White House, hundreds of demonstrators, about half supporters of Mr. Xi and the rest detractors calling on the U.S. president to raise human rights concerns with his Chinese counterpart, were present. Mr. Xi's supporters wore red shirts with a bald eagle and a panda holding up peace signs that said \"China, U.S.A. partner to win-win,\" a phrase adopted from the Chinese leader's words.\n\nBefore appearing in the Rose Garden, the two leaders rolled out a stack of agreements, including the cyber measure and a climate-change pledge from Beijing to cap some emissions and put a price on carbon. The two sides also made progress this week toward what could someday be a far-ranging trade and investment agreement that would open up closed sectors of China's economy, U.S. officials said.",
    " Title: U.S. Issues Waivers for Iran Nuclear Sanctions on Adoption Day\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama signed an order Sunday, marking the \"adoption day\" for the Iran Nuclear Deal, a landmark agreement aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear program. The presidential memorandum is a preliminary step, with the waivers only going into effect once Iran fulfills its obligations under the agreement.\n\nThe agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was approved by the United Nations Security Council 90 days ago. The milestone, according to four administration officials, is primarily a calendar-driven event, with no action taken by Iran.\n\n\"Today marks an important milestone toward preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and ensuring its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful going forward,\" Obama said in a White House statement.\n\nObama directed Secretary of State John Kerry to issue the waivers and to \"take all appropriate additional measures to ensure the prompt and effective implementation of the U.S. commitments\" in the agreement.\n\nThe agreement requires the U.S., the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, Germany, and Iran to direct the issuance of waivers on adoption day. The waivers, though not effective immediately, allow businesses to know which sanctions are being lifted, according to another senior administration official.\n\nThe agreement's implementation will only occur when the International Atomic Energy Agency certifies that Iran has complied with its obligations to reduce its stockpiles of enriched uranium, dismantle two-thirds of its centrifuges, and halt construction of new nuclear facilities. Western officials expect this process to take four to six months.\n\nThe agreement lifts most of the sanctions that apply to non-U.S. citizens and companies doing business with Iran. However, most sanctions will still apply to U.S. citizens under separate sanctions imposed on Iran for its support of terrorism and human rights violations. The agreement allows for sales of civilian passenger aircraft and handicrafts, most notably carpets.\n\nThe sanctions against Iran are authorized by Congress but implemented via executive order. Obama can waive those executive orders after Democrats in the Senate filibustered a resolution that would have blocked the agreement last month.\n\nThe adoption day comes amid renewed tensions with Iran over its involvement in Syria's civil war and its October 10 test launch of a ballistic missile. However, Obama maintained that these issues are separate from the nuclear deal's primary objective of ensuring Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon.\n\nIn Munich on Saturday, a top Iranian military official said Iran was eager to cooperate with international inspectors and would implement the agreement with \"utmost prudence.\" The official, Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, stated, \"It will be the gateway to Iran's taking next steps and will demonstrate the level of sincerity in the settlement of the problems which were created unjustly by others.\"",

The list provides a comprehensive overview of the lines of investigation Mueller is pursuing and their intersection with the President himself.\n\nThe questions cover potential ties between Trump campaign associates and the Russian government, as well as possible attempts to obstruct justice by the President. The list includes inquiries related to Michael Flynn, from the President's knowledge of his contacts with the Russian ambassador to whether Trump had extended a possible offer to pardon his former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.\n\nOther questions delve into the President's motivations behind the firing of FBI Director James Comey, the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, and the administration's initial statements about it, as well as the President's contacts with Roger Stone.\n\nAccording to The Times, Robert Mueller's team presented the list of questions to Trump's legal team as part of the negotiations to get Trump to sit down with investigators. The President's lawyers transcribed the questions, which The Times obtained from a person outside Trump's legal team.\n\nMueller has reportedly been pushing to interview the President directly, something his lawyers fretted over given the President's penchant for exaggeration and lying. Trump's top personal lawyer, John Dowd, resigned in March, following reports that Trump wasn't willing to listen to his legal advice, including about sitting for a Mueller interview. Rudy Giuliani, the former prosecutor, New York City mayor, and Trump confidant brought onto the President's legal team in April, is reportedly now trying to decide whether a Mueller interview will go forward.\n\nFor the full list of Mueller questions, read The Times' exclusive here.",
    " Title: Clinton's Delegate Lead Grows as Sanders' Path to Nomination Narrows, but Sanders Remains in the Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing race for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton's delegate lead has grown significantly, making it increasingly challenging for Bernie Sanders to catch up. This development comes as Sanders prepares to add Maine, a small caucus state, to his column, following his victories in Kansas, Nebraska, and Nebraska's second congressional district.\n\nClinton's delegate lead, now at 199, surpasses Barack Obama's highest margin during the 2008 primary. This substantial lead, according to Clinton's campaign, makes it difficult for Sanders to close the gap. The lead was further bolstered by Clinton's resounding victory in the Louisiana primary.\n\nSanders' campaign, however, shows no signs of conceding. His top aides and supporters argue that Sanders' continued participation in the race will boost Democratic voter turnout and keep Clinton in the news, a contrast to the potential months-long focus on Donald Trump and the fractured Republican Party.\n\nTad Devine, Sanders' senior strategist, emphasized the importance of high Democratic turnout, citing exit polls from Massachusetts, a state Clinton won, that showed 17 percent of voters were new to the process and overwhelmingly supported Sanders.\n\nThe issue of Democratic turnout is a concern for the party, with about 3 million fewer Democrats voting in the 15 states that held primaries or caucuses through March 1 than in 2008. Meanwhile, Trump's candidacy has attracted new voters.\n\nThe prolonged primary battle could potentially benefit both candidates. While Clinton is winning, she is not forced to constantly shift her positions to the left to compete with Sanders. On the other hand, Sanders' continued presence in the race could help him bring millions of new voters into the process, a factor that could be crucial in the general election.\n\nHowever, the extended primary could also pose risks for Clinton. As long as she is winning, her campaign strategists argue, it is not a bad thing. The biggest risk, they say, is that Clinton is forced to abandon her centrist brand to out-liberal Sanders, a socialist.\n\nThe primary race is set to continue, with Clinton and Sanders scheduled to debate on Sunday in Flint, Michigan, and again on Wednesday in Miami. The question remains whether the prolonged primary will ultimately benefit or hinder Clinton's general election prospects.",
    " Title: Media's Obsessive Pursuit of Trump-Russia Collusion and Anti-Trump Myths\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the current political climate, turning on the TV often reveals a barrage of anti-Trump rhetoric that mirrors the baseless claims made during the primaries. The discourse, more akin to a prosecution's monologue in a trial, has yet to progress beyond accusations such as \"Trump didn't enter the race to win\" and \"greed\" being the driving force behind his presidential bid.\n\nMSNBC's Joe Scarborough, whose maturity level seems to be that of a high school cheerleader, alleges that Trump viewed the presidency as a get-rich scheme, with the media's latest Russian innuendo serving as proof. However, a closer examination of these claims reveals not evidence of Trump's collusion with Russia, but rather a testament to the media's pathological commitment to their collusion fable.\n\nThe media's renewed focus on Russian connections follows a brief pause, during which they attempted to portray Trump as a defender of Nazis and racists. Having grown tired of this narrative, they have returned to the Russian libel. The sensational claims of a supposedly nefarious Russian felon \"linked\" to Trump's associates have generated a new wave of front-page stories.\n\nA fair reader, if they managed to reach the end of these convoluted stories, might ask, \"Who cares?\" The media's fixation on minor figures like Carter Page, a campaign volunteer, and their speculations about his activities, is unjustified, other than by partisan spite.\n\nThe media's essential publication policy on all things Trump can be summed up as, \"Any stick will do.\" In this sense, anti-Trump journalists are mythmakers, hoping to repeat their lies so frequently that they become associated with Trump by sheer repetition.\n\nThey know that Trump did not collude with Putin to defeat Hillary. Yet, they hope that the myth of Trump's collusion settles in the minds of Americans. Similarly, they aim to instill in Americans the belief that Trump is a racist, a mission that began in the early days of his campaign when they deliberately misrepresented his comments about illegal immigrants.\n\nThe willfulness of it all is grimly comic, a willfulness perfectly encapsulated by MSNBC interrupting a Trump speech to solemnly inform viewers that the president is now \"lying to you.\"\n\nWhat is depressing, though not surprising, is the role that rattled or envious Republicans have played in the construction of anti-Trump myths. Trump's own staff cannot even provide fair characterizations of his statements. Trump has explicitly and repeatedly condemned racists, neo-Nazis, and white nationalists, yet Gary Cohn gives an interview that never once references those statements while reinforcing the libel that Trump drew moral equivalence between racists and non-racists.\n\nNothing pleases journalists more than when Republicans do their propagandistic work for them. They delight in the construction, \"some critics say,\" but they cherish the phrase \"some Republicans say\" even more when they need to smear a reviled target. With Trump, the sticks grow ever more thin, but the media can always count on me-too Republicans and conservatives to sharpen what little remains of them.",
    " Title: \"The GOP's Titanic Moment: Navigating the Uncharted Waters of the 2016 Presidential Primary\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political arena, the sinking feeling of a sinking ship is palpable among the Republican Party as they grapple with the reality of their primary process. The party's decision to frontload this year's primaries and caucuses, in an attempt to protect an establishment frontrunner against an insurgent, has proven to be more disastrous than a Frank Gehry design.\n\nAs of March, only 133 delegates had been allocated, with Super Tuesday adding another 595 delegates. By the end of the month, 1,537 of 2,472 delegates will be gone, leaving a mere 935 delegates to be contested in the remaining 20 states between March 22 and the first Tuesday in June. The problem? The insurgent, Donald Trump, is now the frontrunner.\n\nWith only a few opportunities left to derail Trump, the anti-Trump forces are scrambling to devise a strategy. The first step is to keep the field populated. The notion that the only way to beat Trump is through a head-to-head contest should be discarded. In a hypothetical match-up between Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Rubio lost by six points, and Cruz lost by 13 points, according to the latest NBC News/SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Poll.\n\nIf Rubio continues past the March 15 vote in Florida, he and Cruz need to form an alliance. They should refrain from attacking each other, and their super PACs should focus on attacking Trump. They should also decide, through a mutual agreement, which one of them will ask Jeb Bush to join in the Trump-bashing, as his super PAC could significantly impact the race.\n\nThe second step is to keep Trump under 50 percent. The number that matters most is not states won, but the 1,237 delegates needed to win the GOP nomination. Of the 1,744 Republican delegates left on the board after Super Tuesday, 391 are in winner-take-all states. The two most important are Florida and Ohio, on March 15. Trump must be stopped in one, if not both, to slow down the express.\n\nThe remaining delegates, proportionally or hybrid-allocated, will be crucial. Before Super Tuesday, Trump and Cruz-Rubio split almost equally, with 65 delegates (31 for Trump, 32 for the senators). If something similar occurs in the remaining proportional states, with Trump staying near his mid-30s ceiling, there's still a shot at wheeling and dealing in Cleveland.\n\nFour crucial showdown states must be won to keep the anti-Trump forces alive. Wisconsin's April 5 primary, Indiana's May 3 primary, and California and New Jersey's June 7 primary are the key battlegrounds. In Cleveland, if Trump goes close but shy of a guaranteed first-ballot victory, the GOP will need to outwit Trump by stacking the deck with delegates willing to bail on Trump once their commitment is over. The GOP's 437 \"pledged\" delegates, as well as Cruz and Rubio delegates, will have to unite to outmaneuver Trump in Cleveland.\n\nCan Trump still be stopped? Yes, but it requires a lot of odd-shaped pieces to fall in place. The race is far from over, and the lifeboats are being readied as the violins play.",
    " Title: \"US Election: Concerns Rise as Clinton's Lead Narrows and Trump Experiences Resurgence\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the US election day approaches, pollsters and observers are expressing concerns as the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, experiences a decline in support, while Republican candidate Donald Trump is experiencing a resurgence. A week ago, Clinton held a significant lead in the polls following a series of gaffes by Trump. However, the recent intervention by the FBI and the release of emails related to Clinton's use of a private email server while Secretary of State has caused a shift in the political landscape.\n\nThe FBI's letter to congressional officials, penned by Director James Comey, has raised questions about Clinton's actions, coming at a difficult time with just a week remaining before the election. Proving a negative and re-establishing Clinton's innocence in such a short time frame is challenging, and the letter served as the capstone to a series of news events that have been eroding Clinton's polling lead.\n\nThe momentum for Trump began to recover following the release of emails from WikiLeaks, which allegedly originated from Russian hackers. These emails, primarily containing embarrassing rather than damaging content, have been trickling out for weeks. However, Wednesday's release of a report detailing the Clinton family's blurred boundaries between business, charitable, and political interests provided fresh ammunition for Trump supporters, who were desperate to shift attention from their candidate's own scandals.\n\nIn an election described by many pollsters as an \"unpopularity contest,\" it takes little to sway independent voters. By Friday, the combination of no news from Trump and bad news from Clinton had halved Clinton's average lead in the polls since the last presidential debate.\n\nPolitical consultant Frank Luntz, who has predicted the winner in 2016 will be the campaign that keeps the focus on its opponent, stated, \"When the attention was on Trump, Clinton was winning. Now, the attention is on Clinton.\"\n\nWhile Sunday's average lead for Clinton in national polls of 3.4% still appears to be a healthy safety margin, concerns remain within the Democratic camp. Few published polls have been conducted since the news broke about the FBI and the emails, and one reputable survey showed just a one-point overall lead for Clinton.\n\nThe potential for a decline in Clinton supporters' motivation or a further resurgence among Trump's supporters may cause concern in the Clinton camp, especially since this dynamic was already underway. Intention to vote has grown in Trump support groups in the past week as the intensity of criticisms about him has ebbed.\n\nThe notion that the FBI may not change any minds but will bolster opinion, and thus perhaps turnout, was also supported in a poll of voters in 13 battleground states. This CBS poll showed just 5% of Democrats said the issue might make them less likely to support Clinton, compared with more than a quarter of registered Republicans.\n\nThe risk also helps explain the ferocity of Democratic calls for the FBI to urgently exonerate Clinton. Many loyalists are convinced the latest trove of emails, discovered on equipment shared by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner, are an irrelevance. However, so long as this is not categorically established, there may be a nagging doubt in some minds that the FBI suspects otherwise. Not everyone will be prepared to give Clinton the benefit of the doubt. Some studies have shown just 11% of voters describe Clinton as \"honest and trustworthy,\" lower even than Trump's score of 16%.\n\nWhile it may not be enough to tip the balance, running for president while facing potential criminal investigation is never a good look.",
    " Title: The Looming Threat of National Debt and Entitlement Programs: A Lesson from History\n\nArticle:\n\nThe unveiling of the presidential budget is a ritualistic event in Washington, often perceived as a significant document, despite its symbolic nature. The budgetary process, with its focus on entertainment and political theater, often distracts from the pressing issue of the nation's growing debt and entitlement programs.\n\nThe real threat to the Republic doesn't lie in the gladiatorial arenas of talk radio and cable television; it's the barbarian horde of debt and entitlement. Non-defense discretionary spending amounts to roughly 16 percent of the budget. Even if this were eliminated, it would only delay the fiscal reckoning that would come from the metastasizing growth of the national debt and the entitlement spending that fuels it.\n\nIn 2008, the federal debt was 39 percent of GDP. Last summer, it was 75 percent of GDP. According to the Congressional Budget Office, if we stay on our current course, it will be 86 percent by 2026, and 141 percent of GDP by 2046.\n\nWith regard to the president's rumored plan to cut $10.5 trillion over the next ten years, the Cato Institute's Mike Tanner writes, \"Without making changes to our insolvent entitlement programs\u2014Social Security and Medicare alone face some $80 trillion in future red ink\u2014there is simply no way to get anywhere near $10.5 trillion in spending cuts.\"\n\nHowever, neither President Trump nor the Democratic leadership seems eager to address entitlement reform. Trump's budget merely rearranges funds, and he has yet to reveal the costs of his additional spending for his infrastructure push.\n\nThe causes of Rome's fall are the subject of endless debate, but nearly all historians agree that one of the major factors was the endless accumulation of debt driven by entitlements\u2014largely in the form of land and titles of nobility\u2014to more and more segments of Roman society. The Caesars and the senators found it too difficult a problem to fix, so they played their ritualistic games until reality had its say.\n\nThe lesson from history is clear: the real threat to the Republic isn't the spectacle of political theater; it's the looming debt and entitlement programs that, if left unchecked, could lead to the same fate as ancient empires.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush Announces Exploration of 2016 Presidential Run\n\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush has announced that he will \"actively explore\" a potential run for President of the United States in 2016, as stated in posts on his Facebook and Twitter accounts on Tuesday.\n\nIn his announcement, Bush expressed his excitement about spending the holidays with his family and the discussions they had about the future of the nation. He mentioned that these conversations, along with \"thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership I think America needs,\" led him to \"actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States.\"\n\nBush also revealed plans to establish a Leadership PAC in January. This PAC, he said, will facilitate conversations with citizens across America to discuss the most critical challenges facing the nation and support leaders, ideas, and policies that will expand opportunity and prosperity for all Americans.\n\nBush previously lost to Democrat Lawton Chiles in the 1994 elections but was elected governor of Florida in 1998, serving two terms. If successful, he would join his father, George H.W. Bush, and his brother, George W. Bush, as the third member of his immediate family to serve as Commander-in-Chief. Bush's son, George P. Bush, was recently elected as Texas' next Land Commissioner.\n\nBush did not specify a timeline for his final decision regarding an official entry into the race, but the formation of a leadership PAC is now a common preliminary step for prospective presidential candidates. Florida Senator Marco Rubio, also rumored to be considering a presidential run, formed his own PAC, Reclaim America, after being elected to the Senate in 2010.\n\nIn a holiday season note, Bush wrote, \"Like many of you, our family was blessed with the opportunity to gather together over the recent Thanksgiving holiday. We shared good food and watched a whole lot of football. We also talked about the future of our nation. As a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership I think America needs, I have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States.\"\n\nThe note concluded with Bush's hope to visit with many Americans in the coming months and have conversations about restoring the promise of America. He signed off with \"Onward, Jeb Bush.\"",
    " Title: Virginia Newspapers Criticize Democratic Campaign for Politicizing Charlottesville Tragedy in Gubernatorial Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final days of the Virginia gubernatorial race, tensions are running high as both parties accuse each other of politicizing the Charlottesville tragedy. The latest controversy stems from a mailer sent out by the Democratic campaign of Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, linking his Republican opponent, Ed Gillespie, to white nationalism.\n\nThe mailer, which has been criticized as borderline libelous, features a photo of the Charlottesville Tiki-torch marchers and condemns Mr. Gillespie for not speaking out against President Trump's \"good people on both sides\" comment made on Aug. 12. However, Mr. Gillespie did denounce the white supremacists before the rally ever took place.\n\nThe mailer has been met with strong criticism from Virginia newspapers, with The Richmond Times-Dispatch, which later endorsed Gillespie, calling the mailer \"practically libel.\" The Daily Progress, a Charlottesville-based paper, has also weighed in, describing the tactics of the Northam campaign as \"stomach-turning.\"\n\nThe Daily Progress editorial states, \"We don't need state candidates trying to use our pain to their political advantage.\" The paper goes on to say, \"For his opponent to challenge him on the degree to which he endorses the Trump agenda is fair game. But to take the tragedy of Charlottesville and exploit it for political advantage is stomach-turning.\"\n\nThe Northam campaign has been accused of trying to tie Mr. Gillespie to the unpopular president, as the race is so close that every advantage is being scrambled for, even if it means political exploitation of the Charlottesville tragedy. This has led to a divide in the community, with some feeling that the issue has already been politicized and that the mailer is only exacerbating the problem.\n\nAs the race heats up, both candidates are under scrutiny for their handling of the Charlottesville tragedy and their stance on white supremacy. The mailer has sparked a heated debate, with many questioning the ethics of using such a sensitive and tragic event for political gain.",
    " Title: The Constitutional Debate on Presidential Pardon Power and Its Implications for Impeachment Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nA growing debate, grounded in the Constitution's text, history, values, and structure, suggests that the pardon and reprieve power of a president may be limited in cases directly associated with impeachment proceedings against the president himself. This argument, which transcends partisan lines, posits that a president cannot use the pardon power to commute the sentences of individuals charged with crimes related to impeachment.\n\nIn the recent impeachment trial of President Trump, the focus was primarily on allegations of withholding foreign aid and soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 election. However, the articles of impeachment also mentioned his \"previous invitations of foreign interference in United States elections\" and \"previous efforts to undermine United States Government investigations into foreign interference in United States elections.\"\n\nThis interpretation of the pardon clause stems from the Framers' deep-seated concern about presidents abusing power to protect co-conspirators. For instance, during the Constitutional Convention, Edmund Randolph, a Virginia delegate, expressed his apprehension that the president might be guilty and his co-conspirators the instruments of treason, making the prerogative of pardon a significant trust.\n\nThe votes on the pardon clause at the Constitutional Convention offer insight into the Framers' intentions. On August 25, 1787, delegates voted on the president's pardon power. Initially, the president had \"the power to grant reprieves & pardon.\" Unanimously, the delegates voted to insert \"except in cases of impeachment\" after the word pardon\u2014the language we are familiar with today. Directly afterward, they rejected the addition of the phrase \"but his pardon shall not be pleadable in bar\" in a six-to-four vote.\n\nThese votes suggest that the Framers saw the new phrase as having a meaning distinct from the traditional interpretation. If \"except in cases of impeachment\" already covered both of those limits on presidential pardons, why would the Framers then need to vote on whether to include the British phrase\u2014language that would have merely imposed the first limit they had already unanimously approved?\n\nWhile the exact intentions of the Framers that day remain unclear, any interpretation of its meaning based only on the evidence we have about the day the phrase was adopted is speculative at best. Regardless, this debate underscores the importance of understanding the Constitution's nuances and the potential implications for future presidents, regardless of their political affiliation.",
    " Title: Washington Navy Yard Shooting: A Call for Caution and Reflection in the Wake of Tragedy\n\nArticle:\n\nMonday morning marked a grim day for the nation as another mass shooting occurred at the Washington Navy Yard, leaving at least 12 people dead and several others wounded. This event, while not unprecedented in modern America, serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing issue of gun violence in the United States.\n\nResidents of Washington, D.C., are no strangers to gun violence, with individual shootings being a too-frequent occurrence in the city. However, a mass shooting is a disruptive and violating event that demands a different level of attention and response. As we gather information about this incident at the Washington Navy Yard, it is crucial to refrain from jumping to conclusions about its cause.\n\nThe author, a freelance journalist with a background in counterterrorism and foreign policy, recalls the 2002 \"Beltway sniper\" attacks, during which two perpetrators killed 10 innocents over 20 days. The attacks took place during a time of heightened national anxiety, and speculation ran rampant. The two DC snipers, John Allen Muhammed and his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Lee Boyd Malvo, had at best vague motives.\n\nThe lesson from the DC sniper attacks is clear: Don't jump to conclusions about motive or circumstances. The rush to be first with the news often places incorrect information in the public, and we ultimately do not benefit from such a race to be first.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Washington Navy Yard shooting, we are still in the early stages of understanding the details of the event and the identities of the shooters. The area targeted is technically a military base, but the buildings house mostly civilian agencies. Law enforcement is currently searching for an additional suspect who is at large, while a first suspect, identified as Aaron Alexis, was killed at the scene. If the shooting did, in fact, involve multiple shooters, that suggests a level of coordination and deliberation that goes beyond a lone wolf attack.\n\nAs the investigation unfolds, it is essential to approach the information with caution and patience. The early reports are often contradictory and wrong, and we should avoid drawing conclusions too early. In these first few hours after the tragedy, we must take a step back and wait patiently for credible information.\n\nThe author encourages Americans to reflect on the events and consider the underlying causes of such tragedies. If this is an act of terrorism, how can America better combat the diffuse threat of individuals becoming radicalized and perpetrating violence on US soil? If this is another shooting rampage by disturbed individuals with grievances or mental illness, how can we examine once more issues of mental health, gun control, and public safety?\n\nIn the meantime, Americans will mourn those who have passed, the FBI will investigate, and the streets will once again be washed of spilled blood. We must carry on with our days, waiting and reflecting with wisdom rather than fearful speculation.",
    " Title: The Case for Professional Dress Codes: Learning from Women in Leadership Roles\n\nArticle:\n\nIn today's digital age, where personal branding and public image play a significant role, it is essential to seek guidance from individuals who have navigated traditionally male-dominated environments and have had to consider the impact of their appearance on perception and relationships. This is particularly relevant in the workplace and public sphere, where visual impressions can often precede the substance of one's work.\n\nWhen considering role models for professional attire, women like Hillary Rodham Clinton, Julia Gillard, and Kirsten Gillibrand offer valuable insights. These women have been widely photographed, and their wardrobe choices have been documented extensively. They lead busy lives and require clothes that are functional, comfortable, and suitable for their demanding roles.\n\nUsing celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence, Nicole Kidman, or Rihanna as fashion role models may not be the most practical choice, especially for those over 25 or not deeply engaged in pop culture. These celebrities, who often have their images airbrushed and manipulated, are primarily associated with red carpet events or charity work, rather than professional settings.\n\nWhile women in symbolic positions, such as Michelle Obama and the Duchess of Cambridge, have made fashion statements, their roles often involve diplomatic expression rather than a more tangible professional voice. The rules may not apply equally to those with a more substantial professional voice.\n\nInstead, learning from the wardrobe strategies of women in leadership roles, such as Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo, or Mary Barra of General Motors, could provide valuable insights. These women dress well but are often reticent to discuss their sartorial choices, perhaps due to the fear of not being taken seriously.\n\nTo address this issue, it is crucial to acknowledge its existence and move forward, rather than ignoring it. Embracing the importance of appearance in the professional world and making informed, strategic choices can help women navigate the challenges of leadership roles more effectively.",
    " Title: Global Warming Places Last in UN Survey of 6.7 Million People Worldwide; Climate Talks Face Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of ongoing international climate talks, a United Nations survey of 6.7 million people across 194 countries, including the Palestinian territories, has revealed a surprising indifference towards global warming. The survey, which placed education at the top of the list of 16 subjects, found climate change at the bottom, below access to telephones and the Internet.\n\nThe poll, which went online in March, has recently gained attention after the Breitbart news site highlighted its results. The survey's findings were consistent across gender, age groups, and education levels, with climate change ranking low in priority for the majority of respondents.\n\nIn the United States, climate change was ranked as the 10th most important issue, while in Britain, it was placed at number nine. The survey's results have sparked debate, with some, like Willis Eschenback of the website Watts Up With That, viewing the findings as either \"horribly wrong or totally predictable.\" Eschenback wrote, \"The revealed truth is that of the sixteen choices given to people regarding what they think are the important issues in their lives, climate change is dead last.\"\n\nMeanwhile, delegates attending the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Lima, Peru, are facing difficulties in reaching a final agreement by the end of the forum on Friday. The Associated Press reported on Sunday that the momentum from a historic U.S.-China pact to combat global warming is showing signs of fading at the U.N. climate talks. The news service noted that the familiar rich-poor conflict persists over who should take action to prevent global warming.\n\nThe U.S.-China agreement, reached in November, commits the United States to real cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, while China essentially made another promise to reduce pollution. Foreign Policy recently reviewed the agreement and concluded that China offered little in terms of concrete commitments. The climate talks are set to continue as delegates work towards a final agreement.",
    " Title: White House Blocks Lev Parnas Testimony in Senate Impeachment Trial, Amid Explosive Claims Against President Trump\n\nThe White House has announced its intention to block any attempt to summon Lev Parnas, a key associate of Rudy Giuliani, to testify in the Senate impeachment trial. This development comes after Parnas made explosive claims regarding President Trump's involvement in Ukraine during a series of interviews.\n\nParnas, who was involved in Giuliani's efforts to investigate Joe Biden, stated in an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow that \"President Trump knew exactly what was going on.\" He further claimed that Trump was aware of his movements and that he would not undertake any actions without the consent of Giuliani or the President.\n\nAttorney General William Barr has also been drawn into the controversy, with Parnas accusing him of being aware of Giuliani's and Trump's actions. However, Barr has denied having any knowledge of such dealings.\n\nIn testimony during House impeachment hearings, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch alleged that Parnas, along with Giuliani and associate Igor Fruman, were working to oust her to advance their business interests. The two are also thought to have worked with former top Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko to obtain information on the Bidens.\n\nParnas and Fruman were indicted in October on campaign-finance charges, with Parnas accused of disguising donations to Republican candidates to advance his personal interests and those of other Ukrainian politicians.\n\nPresident Trump's impeachment defense team, which includes heavyweight attorney Alan Dershowitz and former Clinton impeachment manager Ken Starr, has announced that they will call on the Senate to \"swiftly reject\" the articles of impeachment. The team's trial brief states, \"The Senate should speedily reject these articles of impeachment and acquit the President. All that House Democrats have succeeded in proving is that the President did absolutely nothing wrong.\"\n\nDemocrats allege that President Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine to pressure the country to investigate corruption allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden. The trial is ongoing.",

On Wednesday, Barr met with Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) ahead of his confirmation hearings, which are scheduled for next week.\n\n\"I asked Mr. Barr directly, 'Do you think Mr. Mueller is on a witch hunt?' He said no,\" Graham recalled. \" 'Do you think he would be fair to the president and the country as a whole?' He said yes. 'And do you see any reason for Mr. Mueller's investigation to be stopped?' He said no. 'Do you see any reason for a termination based on cause?' He said no. 'Are you committed to making sure Mr. Mueller can finish his job?' 'Yes,'\" Graham added.\n\nThe news comes as Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing the investigation, announced he is stepping down after Barr is confirmed. Some Democrats want Barr to recuse himself from the Mueller probe because of his previous statements criticizing the investigation. Specifically, they're referring to a controversial memo Barr wrote last year to Rosenstein calling the probe \"fatally misconceived.\"\n\n\"The Senate... should subject Mr. Barr's views to the strictest of scrutiny next week and I still believe, after the revelations about Mr. Barr's unsolicited memo, President Trump ought to withdraw this nomination,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Wednesday.\n\nLikewise, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said the memo was \"deeply worrisome because in effect he says the president is above the law... that's incorrect as a matter of law but certainly for an attorney general to have that position is deeply wrong.\"\n\nHowever, Graham says Democrats' fears are unfounded, noting that Barr and Mueller are good friends of more than 20 years and their wives attend a Bible study together. \"I can assure you he has a very high opinion of Mr. Mueller and he is committed to letting Mr. Mueller finish his job,\" the South Carolina lawmaker said.",
    " Title: John Hinckley Jr., Assassination Attempt Perpetrator, Granted Unconditional Release\n\nArticle:\n\nJohn Hinckley Jr., the man who attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981, has been granted unconditional release by a federal judge in Washington D.C. The decision, which could take effect as early as next week, allows Hinckley to live full-time with his elderly mother in Williamsburg, Virginia.\n\nUnder the terms of the order, Hinckley is prohibited from contacting his victims, their relatives, or actress Jodie Foster, with whom he was obsessed. He is also not allowed to knowingly travel to areas where the current president or members of Congress are present. After one year, Hinckley may be permitted to live on his own or in a group home.\n\nThe judge's order stipulates that Hinckley must abide by all laws, refrain from consuming alcohol, illegal drugs, and possessing any firearms, weapons, or ammunition. He is also not to be arrested for cause.\n\nOn March 30, 1981, outside the Washington Hilton Hotel, a shaggy-haired Hinckley aimed his gun at President Reagan and fired six times. Reagan spent nearly two weeks in the hospital recovering from wounds and blood loss. His press secretary, James Brady, was shot in the head. Brady survived but spent the next 28 years in a wheelchair. A year after the attack, a court found the perpetrator, Hinckley, not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nPresident Reagan's daughter, Patti Davis, told NPR last year that the verdict was a \"bad verdict.\" Davis argued that Hinckley knew right from wrong at the time of the attack and that attempting to kill the president is a special kind of crime. \"You can't say well, if he shot the butcher, it would be different,\" Davis said. \"He did try to shoot a president. We hold that crime in a different category than we do other attempted murders.\"\n\nThe Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute issued a statement, stating, \"Contrary to the judge's decision, we believe John Hinckley is still a threat to others and we strongly oppose his release.\"\n\nFor the past decade, Hinckley has been gradually moving towards freedom. Saint Elizabeths Hospital, where he has resided for decades, states that he no longer poses a danger to himself or others. Doctors report his depression and psychosis are in full remission. In court, his lawyer described a man who plays guitar, goes to movies, and browses in bookstores.\n\nHinckley has already been spending 17 days each month with his mother in the Kingsmill resort community in Williamsburg, which bothers his neighbor Joe Mann. \"It could be a grave mistake to try to force fit him into that community with his 90-year-old mother,\" Mann told NPR before the ruling. \"What I think of is Hinckley may be OK as long as he is on his drugs. What goes off when he misses a dose or two? Or decides, I don't need this stuff?\"\n\nHinckley's brother and sister told the court they know their mother is getting old, and they promised the judge they would step in to help if needed. In his order, the judge stated that if Hinckley's relatives \"are unable to travel to Williamsburg or remain in Williamsburg with Mr. Hinckley, Mr. Hinckley shall be returned to inpatient status at the hospital.\"\n\nHinckley's longtime lawyer, Barry William Levine, argued to the court last year that his client is entitled to live under the least restrictive conditions in keeping with public safety. Levine told NPR in an interview Wednesday that Hinckley is \"profoundly sad and sorry for the pain he caused his victims, their families, and the nation.\"\n\nLevine added that the voluminous court record demonstrates Hinckley is not a threat to anyone. \"This case shows that people who are ravaged by disease, mental disease, can get well and become productive members of society without imposing any threat of danger,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Justice Department prosecutors have been leery. The prosecutors want to be able to monitor Hinckley's whereabouts and Internet use. In an interview with NPR a few years ago, former prosecutor Thomas Zeno explained why. \"The question with Mr. Hinckley is because he has this basic character flaw or personality flaw, as it is called, of narcissism, can he really be changed? And will he really be a different person?\" Zeno said.\n\nJohn Hinckley is now 61 years old, and, as the judge wrote, \"suffering from arthritis, high blood pressure, and various other physical ailments like many men his age.\"",
    " Title: Palestinian Student's Harvard Dream Derailed: Visa Revoked After Immigration Interrogation Over Friends' Political Posts\n\nArticle:\n\nA Palestinian student, Ismail B. Ajjawi, who was set to begin his freshman year at Harvard University, found his Ivy League aspirations abruptly ended after landing at Boston Logan International Airport on Friday. The 17-year-old, who lives in Tyre, Lebanon, was interrogated for five hours by immigration officials, had his visa rescinded, and was subsequently deported back to his home country.\n\nAccording to Ajjawi's account to the Harvard Crimson, the immigration officers questioned him about his religious practices and searched his phone and laptop for five hours. The officer then confronted him about his friends' social media posts, which expressed political views critical of the U.S.\n\nAjjawi, who intended to study Chemical and Physical Biology, spent a total of eight hours in Boston before being forced to return to Lebanon. He claims that after landing, he and several other international students faced questioning from immigration officials, but he was singled out for further scrutiny.\n\nDuring the interrogation, Ajjawi alleges that the officer asked him to unlock his phone and laptop, and the officer continued to question him about his religion and religious practices in Lebanon. The officer then reportedly found posts on his friends' social media accounts that expressed political views critical of the U.S.\n\nAjjawi stated that he was not responsible for the political posts and that he did not like, share, or comment on them. Despite his explanation, the immigration officer canceled Ajjawi's visa and told him he would be deported. Ajjawi was allowed a phone call to his parents before he returned to Lebanon.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection told the Crimson that Ajjawi was deemed \"inadmissible\" to the country. The statement said, \"Applicants must demonstrate they are admissible into the U.S. by overcoming all grounds of inadmissibility including health-related grounds, criminality, security reasons, public charge, labor certification, illegal entrants and immigration violations, documentation requirements, and miscellaneous grounds.\"\n\nHarvard University says they are working with the student's family and appropriate authorities to resolve the matter and bring him back to campus before classes start on September 3. Ajjawi has been in contact with Harvard International Office Director of Immigration Services, Maureen Martin, and is being aided by AMIDEAST, a nonprofit organization that provided him with a scholarship.\n\nAjjawi's revoked visa comes after he was highlighted in a local news site, Alaraby Entertainment, for his success story, from being a refugee in Lebanon to gaining admission to the prestigious Ivy League school on a full scholarship.\n\nAjjawi's friend, Selah Chehade, told DailyMail.com that deporting him back to Lebanon was an \"unfair act.\" Ajjawi's father, who was also featured in the news cast, expressed his pride in his son's success, stating, \"This was a very happy moment for us, that all of his hard work paid off. Despite the severe hardships that the Palestinian people face, we are achieving high success.\"",
    " Title: Post-Election Analysis: The Potential Self-Examination Process for the Republican Party in Case of Romney's Loss\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the event that Mitt Romney loses the 2012 presidential election, the Republican Party is likely to undergo a period of introspection and debate to understand the reasons behind their candidate's defeat. This process will not only serve as fodder for political enthusiasts but will also shape the party's approach to governing and campaigning in the future.\n\nEven before the election results are officially announced, speculation about the reasons for a potential Romney loss is already circulating. Here's a glimpse of the top arguments that Republicans might use to explain and justify their candidate's performance:\n\n1. Campaign Strategy and Messaging: Critics may argue that Romney's campaign strategy was flawed, with a focus on economic issues that did not resonate with voters as strongly as President Obama's emphasis on social issues like healthcare and women's rights.\n\n2. Candidate's Personality and Image: Some may contend that Romney's personality and image were not well-received by voters. His perceived aloofness and lack of authenticity could have contributed to his inability to connect with the electorate.\n\n3. Wall Street Ties: Given the lingering effects of the 2008 financial crisis, the Republican Party's choice of a candidate with close ties to Wall Street, such as Mitt Romney, may have been a liability. This could have made him more vulnerable to attacks on his wealth and connections to the financial industry.\n\n4. Missteps and Gaffes: Romney's numerous missteps and gaffes, such as his response to the Supreme Court's Affordable Care Act ruling, his comments about the British and the London Olympics, and his remarks about Americans who don't pay income taxes, could have damaged his credibility and electability.\n\n5. Moderate Image: Some Republicans may argue that Romney was too moderate for the party's base, which could have led to a lack of enthusiasm and turnout among conservative voters.\n\nIf Romney wins on Tuesday, he will be the President of the United States. If he loses, he will be the fall guy for the entire Republican Party. The post-election analysis will provide valuable insights for the future of the Republican Party and the direction they choose to take in the coming years.",
    " Title: Deficit Reduction Experts Express Optimism, Urge Bipartisan Cooperation to Avert \"Fiscal Cliff\" Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a discussion on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" two deficit reduction experts, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, expressed optimism about the stalled talks in Washington over the \"fiscal cliff.\" Despite the logjam and lack of progress between President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner about how to avert the end-of-year spending cuts and tax hikes that could plunge the economy back into recession, Bowles, former President Clinton's chief of staff, said he is \"more encouraged\" than he had previously been.\n\nBowles, who co-chaired Mr. Obama's fiscal commission in 2010, told host Bob Schieffer, \"I think we made some progress this week. I'm more encouraged than I was.\" He explained that the progress is apparent because both sides have taken positions that differ from their previously hardened stances. He noted Speaker Boehner's willingness to increase taxes and the president's openness to cut entitlements.\n\nAlthough Bowles expressed some optimism, he said the president has to go further. He said the president's proposal to cut around $350 billion to Medicare is \"not enough.\" Bowles emphasized, \"We simply made promises we can't keep. We've got to face up to it.\" He added, \"We're going to have to do more.\"\n\nFormer Senator Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., who co-chaired the president's fiscal commission with Bowles and now runs the Fix the Debt campaign, agreed. Simpson stated, \"The entitlements are the engine on the train driving us to the cliff. They were on automatic pilot.\" He added that the AARP and other senior groups \"will have stripped the treasury dry in 30 years\" due to the rising cost of healthcare and the number of baby boomers aging into entitlement programs. That's why he danced \"Gangnam Style\" in a YouTube video to persuade young kids to \"get off your can.\"\n\nSimpson, who is 81, said, \"They're the ones who are going to get it kicked right in the fanny.\" He continued, \"Nobody has any humor in Washington. There ain't none left.\" Simpson also advocated a position similar to Boehner's, promoting raising taxes by limiting tax expenditures through tax reform that should take place after the New Year. Simpson, like Bowles, emphasized that entitlements must be reformed.\n\nBowles and Simpson became prominent voices in the deficit reduction debate in 2010 while co-chairing a bipartisan committee that came up with a plan to reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years. At the time, the president did not embrace the plan, and Congress failed to pass it.\n\nBowles warned that going over the \"cliff\" would be a \"disaster\" because it would slow the economy by 4% and businesses are already \"slowing their head count\" and cutting their capital expenditures. Simpson criticized Washington lawmakers who are playing politics with the \"fiscal cliff\" by saying it would help their argument down the line, stating it is \"terribly bizarre and juvenile.\"\n\nIn conclusion, both deficit reduction experts expressed optimism about the ongoing talks in Washington to avert the \"fiscal cliff\" crisis. They urged bipartisan cooperation, emphasizing the need to reform entitlements and raise taxes through tax reform after the New Year. They warned of the disastrous consequences of going over the \"cliff,\" which could plunge the economy back into recession.",
    " Title: Former White House Strategist Steve Bannon Warns of Imminent Impeachment Threat to Trump, Predicts Surprising 2020 Challengers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Post, former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon has warned that the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump is a \"mortal threat\" to his presidency and urged the White House to take the matter more seriously. Bannon, who served as the chairman of Breitbart News before joining the Trump administration, predicted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would initiate impeachment proceedings within the next six weeks.\n\nBannon expressed dismay at what he perceives as an uncoordinated White House approach to the impeachment inquiry. He criticized Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, citing a disastrous press conference last Thursday where Mulvaney confirmed Trump's decision to withhold military aid to Ukraine was part of a quid pro quo. Mulvaney later walked back his comments.\n\n\"The problem we have is that the president needs a team around him, and somebody has got to step up and make a play,\" Bannon said. \"Trump can't do everything. There is just no coordination with the team.\"\n\nBannon suggested that the White House should establish an impeachment squad, augmenting the legal team, and bifurcating the White House Counsel's office to focus on the impeachment inquiry 24/7. He also advised against dismissing off-message surrogates like Mulvaney or Rudy Giuliani, but rather bringing in people to share the burden.\n\nBannon remained optimistic about Trump's chances in the 2020 election, dismissing the current crop of Democratic candidates. He predicted a total Biden implosion by the end of the year and a centrist revolt against Elizabeth Warren. If Biden falters and Warren appears to be marching toward nomination, Bannon predicted that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would enter the race.\n\n\"Bloomberg or Clinton could be very competitive,\" Bannon said. \"She is a very formidable candidate, and I think Bloomberg would be very formidable.\"\n\nBannon suggested that the Democratic nominee would have to focus on key swing states like Arizona, Texas, Georgia, and the Carolinas, and live in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, which were neglected by Clinton in her 2016 race and turned against the party for the first time in a generation.\n\nSince leaving the White House in 2017, Bannon has traveled the world, speaking at conferences, meeting with billionaires, and promoting his vision of populist nationalism wherever he can find a friendly audience. He has also taken a growing interest in China, which he views as the primary threat to the United States. Bannon spoke with The Post shortly after a screening of his new film, \"Claws of the Red Dragon\" in New York. The movie is a loose retelling of the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Canada last year.",
    " Title: FBI Lawyer Allegedly Alters Document Related to Carter Page Surveillance, Stirring Controversy\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 An FBI lawyer is under suspicion for altering a document related to the surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, a person familiar with the situation revealed on Friday. The allegation is part of a Justice Department inspector general review of the FBI's Russia investigation, a probe that has been one of the most politically sensitive in the bureau's history.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has long criticized the FBI's investigation into ties between Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign as a \"hoax\" and a \"witch hunt,\" immediately seized on the news to allege that the FBI had attempted to \"overthrow the presidency.\"\n\nThe allegation is expected to revive debate about an investigation that has cast a shadow over Trump's presidency since its inception. The inspector general report, set to be released on Dec. 9, is likely to focus on the use of a secret surveillance warrant to monitor the communications of a former Trump adviser.\n\nThe allegation against the lawyer was first reported by CNN, with the Washington Post subsequently reporting that the conduct of the FBI employee did not alter Horowitz's finding that the surveillance application of Page had a proper legal and factual basis. The lawyer was reportedly forced out.\n\nThe FBI obtained a secret surveillance warrant in 2016 to monitor the communications of Page, who was never charged in the Russia investigation or accused of wrongdoing. The warrant, which was renewed several times and approved by different judges in 2016 and early 2017, has been one of the most contentious elements of the Russia probe.\n\nRepublicans have long attacked the credibility of the warrant application since it cited information derived from a dossier of opposition research compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British spy whose work was financed by Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\nFBI Director Chris Wray has stated that he does not consider the FBI surveillance to be \"spying\" and has no evidence that the FBI illegally monitored Trump's campaign during the 2016 election. Attorney General William Barr has said he believed \"spying\" occurred, but he has also made clear that he has no specific evidence that any surveillance was illegal or improper. Barr has appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to investigate how intelligence was collected, and that probe has since become criminal in nature.\n\nTrump and his supporters are likely to seize on any findings of mistakes or bad judgment in the report to support their claims of a biased investigation. Supporters of the FBI, meanwhile, are likely to hold up as vindication any findings that the investigation was done by the book or free of political considerations. The FBI and the inspector general declined to comment on the matter on Friday.",
    " Title: President Trump Announces Ryan Zinke's Departure, Suggests Sen. Joe Manchin as Potential Interior Secretary Replacement\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Saturday that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke would be leaving his position at the end of the year. The president made the announcement via a series of tweets, praising Zinke for his nearly two years of service at the Department of Interior.\n\n\"Ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation,\" said Mr. Trump in one of his tweets.\n\nThe Trump Administration is expected to announce the new Secretary of the Interior next week. One early name suggested as a replacement is Sen. Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat who recently won re-election but has had a complex relationship with Mr. Trump.\n\nIf selected, Sen. Manchin's confirmation process is likely to be smooth, and one influential strategist suggested that he would be loyal to Trump's policies. \"He is going to toe the line,\" the strategist said.\n\nThe departure of Mr. Zinke, who has faced numerous ethics investigations and is widely criticized by environmentalists, is part of a year-end shakeup at the White House. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was let go shortly after the November elections, and this month, it was announced that Chief of Staff John Kelly was on his way out.\n\nThe president has hinted at more staff changes, although he said he \"loves\" his Cabinet secretaries for the most part. Mr. Zinke's job, however, has been under intense scrutiny for months.\n\nThe scandals surrounding Mr. Zinke include high-priced travel on government planes and an alleged shady land deal in his hometown of Whitefish, Montana, involving the Zinke family and Halliburton chairman David Lesar. The Interior Department inspector general has referred the land deal scandal to the Justice Department, and Rep. Raul Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat who will lead the House Natural Resources Committee next year, has vowed to probe the land deal.\n\nKier\u00e1n Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said, \"Zinke will go down as the worst Interior secretary in history. His slash-and-burn approach was absolutely destructive for public lands and wildlife. Allowing David Bernhardt to continue to call the shots will still be just as ugly. Different people, same appetite for greed and profit.\"",
    " Title: Primary Voting Results: A Mixed Bag for Leading Candidates, Surprises in Michigan and Michigan\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest round of primary voting has brought about a mixed bag of results for the leading candidates in both parties, with setbacks for popular campaign narratives in both the Democratic and Republican races.\n\nIn the Democratic race, it was initially believed that Hillary Clinton was poised to extend her Super Tuesday dominance to Mississippi and Michigan, potentially putting the campaign of Bernie Sanders on the ropes. However, the Clinton juggernaut lost a wheel in Michigan, while Donald Trump's model stayed on track.\n\nClinton's expected advantage in Michigan was based on her strong performance in the seventh debate with Sanders and his perceived struggles in more populous states. However, Sanders defied expectations once again, winning a significant number of counties throughout the state, including a majority of counties outside of metropolitan Detroit.\n\nSanders also reprised his astounding dominance of the youth vote, taking 87% of the votes of those under 30. He also won an overwhelming number of counties, large and small, throughout the state. Despite this, Clinton's 65% support among African-American voters was not enough to overcome Sanders' advantage outside of metropolitan Detroit.\n\nIn another surprise, John Kasich, the Ohio governor many hoped might become the establishment alternative to Trump, finished third in Michigan, a hair or two behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. This result may signal the end of Kasich's campaign, as he is now unlikely to be a factor in any other states, including his home state of Ohio on March 15.\n\nIn the Republican race, Trump lost late-deciders again, but the margin was smaller than in previous tests. Cruz, on the other hand, showed himself the master of the small state event, winning in Idaho, and finishing second in Michigan, Mississippi, and Hawaii. Despite his maddening failure to defeat Trump in Southern states with big populations of evangelical white Protestants, Cruz has hung tough and racked up delegates.\n\nCruz is now just 99 delegates behind Trump. If he could win a few of the winner-take-all states, he could catch him, although the prospects of that appear increasingly remote. And if there is any GOP candidate with a chance of preventing Trump from reaching 1,237 delegates for a first-ballot nomination, it is now Cruz.\n\nIt might help Cruz stop Trump if his fellow freshman senator, Marco Rubio, dropped out rather than contest his home state of Florida next week. However, Rubio has vowed to remain for that test, even though he remains behind Trump in Florida polling and must battle Cruz and Kasich for votes there.\n\nTruth be told, Tuesday was a night of total frustration for Rubio, demonstrating how utterly his campaign strategy has failed. He not only finished third or worse in Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho, and Hawaii\u2014he won exactly zero delegates for the night. His delegate count is now further behind Cruz than Cruz is behind Trump.\n\nIn the cold light of the day-after, it is possible the results from Tuesday will look different. Had Clinton eked out another 20,000 votes or so in Michigan, the headline might have been about her crossing the halfway point in pursuit of the 2,383 delegates needed to nominate on the first ballot at the July convention in Philadelphia. She has 1,221 now. Sanders has 571.\n\nThe most frustrating element of the battle for Sanders is that even his best night since New Hampshire did not avail him in the delegate tally. Clinton's 66-point dominance in Mississippi won her nearly all that state's cache of 36 delegates, while Sanders' razor-thin margin in Michigan meant the two candidates split that state's 130 delegates almost evenly.\n\nAll of that makes it difficult for Sanders to overcome Clinton's delegate lead, even if he continues to best her in the voting booths from here through June. Sanders strategist Tad Devine is fond of saying the race is a marathon, not a sprint, but winning a race of any duration still requires you to finish first.\n\nSanders needs to make a habit of doing just that, and by wider margins than his breakthrough in Michigan gave him. Still, however steep the climb may appear, this Tuesday made it harder than ever to count the Vermonter out.",
    " Title: The Importance of Upholding the Electoral College Result and Advocating for Voting Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Electoral College vote, it is crucial to acknowledge the significance of the process and the need for continued advocacy for voting rights. Joshua A. Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law, emphasizes the importance of respecting the Electoral College result, even for those who may be displeased with the outcome.\n\nDouglas, a co-editor of \"Election Law Stories,\" asserts that the Electoral College process functioned as intended, with President-elect Donald Trump securing the necessary 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. He acknowledges concerns regarding foreign interference, FBI Director James Comey's actions, and other issues that may have influenced the election, but maintains that these factors did not prevent people from voting according to their beliefs.\n\nThe Electoral College vote, according to Douglas, reflects the will of the people in each state, and it would have been unprecedented to suggest electors should vote against the majority's will in their state. He argues that the real issues that should concern all Americans are the barriers to voting and low voter turnout.\n\nDouglas highlights the need to remove barriers to voting and encourage civic participation, particularly among younger generations. He also calls for the protection of the fundamental right to vote against undue restrictions and the abolition of the Electoral College, which he considers anti-democratic.\n\nIn conclusion, Douglas encourages Americans to focus their efforts on addressing voting rights and increasing participation, rather than contesting the Electoral College result. He emphasizes the importance of exercising the fundamental right to vote and advocates for the removal of barriers to voting, especially for minority communities and younger generations. The real battle, according to Douglas, is ensuring that all Americans have a voice through voting.",
    " Title: Trump Announces Revised Afghanistan Strategy: Emphasis on Political Settlement, Tougher on Pakistan, and Expanded Troop Authorities\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump unveiled his revised strategy for Afghanistan on Monday, outlining five core pillars for the approach. The strategy, which has been the result of seven months of deliberation, focuses on adjustments to the current strategy rather than a complete overhaul.\n\nThe five pillars of the strategy include:\n\n1. Eliminating any timelines for the duration of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\n2. Utilizing all elements of power, including diplomatic and economic means.\n3. Toughening the stance on Pakistan.\n4. Encouraging India to contribute more to economic development.\n5. Expanding the authorities for U.S. forces to combat terrorists.\n\nThe president did not specify the number of additional troops that would be deployed to Afghanistan, a decision he left to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. However, it has been reported that the president has approved a plan to send approximately 4,000 more troops.\n\nThe president stated that the U.S. would no longer disclose troop levels or withdrawal dates, leaving the number of potential troop increases uncertain. Currently, there are about 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\n\nThe president emphasized the need for a \"political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban and Afghanistan,\" but acknowledged that the timing and feasibility of such a settlement are uncertain. He also called on the people of Afghanistan to take responsibility for their future and work towards an enduring peace.\n\nThe president did not discuss the additional costs associated with the new strategy, but mentioned that the U.S. would seek increased contributions from its NATO and other allies. The U.S. currently spends around $45 billion annually in Afghanistan.\n\nThe president acknowledged the frustration felt by Americans after 16 years of war without a clear end in sight, but emphasized the need to address the reality of the situation in Afghanistan and avoid repeating the mistakes made in Iraq by withdrawing too early and leaving a vacuum for terrorists to exploit.\n\nTrump announced the new strategy at Army Post Fort Meyer in Arlington, Virginia, surrounded by soldiers, and emphasized the unity among military personnel and called for the same unity among Americans. \"All service members are brothers and sisters, they're all part of the same family. It's called the American family,\" he said, urging Americans to find the courage to heal their divisions within.",
    " Title: \"Federal Bailout Proposals Face Criticism as States Seek Alternative Solutions for COVID-19 Budget Shortfalls\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of significant COVID-19-related budget shortfalls, state and local officials are calling for a nearly $1 trillion federal bailout. This equates to approximately $7,800 per household in new federal spending, surpassing the projected COVID-related state and local revenue losses for 2020 and 2021 combined. However, the idea of a federal bailout has sparked controversy, with concerns that it would encourage fiscal irresponsibility and incentivize bad behavior among state and local lawmakers.\n\nThe argument against federal bailouts is not merely about the burden on taxpayers in responsible states, but also about the potential consequences of enabling financially imprudent states to escape the repercussions of their fiscal mismanagement. For instance, states like Wyoming, Alaska, North Dakota, and New Mexico have saved more than 25% of their annual revenues in rainy day funds, while states like Illinois, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey have set aside 1% or less.\n\nWhile some states have implemented austerity measures such as pay freezes and hiring limits in response to the COVID-19 shortfalls, others have opted for a more lax approach, relying on federal aid. Illinois, for example, adopted a 2021 budget that includes record-high spending, a $6 billion deficit, no reductions in personnel costs, large pay raises for unionized state workers and lawmakers, and excessive retiree costs that consume almost one-third of the state's own revenues.\n\nHistorically, big-spending states have benefited less from federal bailouts, as they tend to drive up state spending and delay necessary reforms. However, states can address COVID-19 budget shortfalls, stimulate economic recovery, and pave the way for long-term prosperity without bailouts.\n\nOne approach is to safely reopen parts of society, balancing the need to save lives and livelihoods. Data-driven, localized reopening decisions that prioritize child care availability and in-person school options can help mitigate some of the damage caused by COVID-19 shutdowns.\n\nAnother strategy involves paring back recent spending increases. Florida, for instance, has reduced per-capita and inflation-adjusted spending by 16% over the last two decades. In contrast, New York and California have increased their spending by 49% and 52%, respectively, during the same period.\n\nEducation and Medicaid spending are other areas ripe for reduction. For example, New York's Medicaid spending has increased 20% per recipient over just three years, amounting to a difference of $20 billion in 2019.\n\nStates can also achieve substantial long-term savings by aligning public employee compensation with the private sector. Short-term changes, such as forgoing a 2% cost-of-living adjustment for 2021, could save states a collective $26 billion. A one-year pay freeze could save up to twice as much.\n\nSuspending public employee pension contributions and accruals for one year, a move some private-sector companies have taken to avoid layoffs, could save states up to $234 billion\u2014enough to cover a 13% decline in state and local revenues for 2020.\n\nWhile the federal government can provide assistance, it would be more beneficial to help states cope with revenue losses by relieving them of the burden of unfunded federal mandates, such as the Davis-Bacon Act, the new paid family and sick leave mandate, and education mandates.\n\nIn conclusion, the widespread economic hardships caused by COVID-19 cannot be erased by increasing the size, scope, and debt of the federal government. Instead, state and local officials can respond sensibly, through short-term adjustments and responsible budgeting, to boost recovery and set the stage for a stronger future.",
    " Title: Record Number of Amazon Rainforest Fires in 2019 Raises Concerns Over Brazil's Environmental Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nBrazil is experiencing an unprecedented surge in forest fires in the Amazon rainforest, with nearly 73,000 fires recorded between January and August, according to data from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). This number is significantly higher than the 39,759 fires recorded in all of 2018, marking an 83 percent increase over the same period last year and the highest since INPE records began in 2013.\n\nThe surge in fires has been particularly noticeable since the beginning of the dry season, which ends in late October or early November. Satellite images have shown more than 9,500 new forest fires since Thursday, mostly in the Amazon basin. The northernmost state of Roraima has been covered in dark smoke, while neighboring Amazonas and Acre have declared emergencies due to the fires.\n\nThe unprecedented surge in fires has occurred since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January, vowing to develop the Amazon region for farming and mining. Wildfires often occur in the dry season, but they are also deliberately started in efforts to illegally clear forest for cattle ranching.\n\nINPE researcher Alberto Setzer stated that the large number of wildfires could not be attributed to the dry season or natural phenomena alone. \"There is nothing abnormal about the climate this year or the rainfall in the Amazon region, which is just a little below average,\" he said.\n\nPresident Bolsonaro has brushed off widespread concerns, stating that the fires are a result of the \"queimada\" or burn, a practice used by farmers to clear land. However, environmental activists have pointed to a recent increase in deforestation as the trigger for the fires.\n\nDeforestation in Brazil's portion of the Amazon rainforest soared more than 88 percent in June compared with the same month a year ago, according to INPE data. Last month, INPE published preliminary data showing deforestation in Brazil's portion of the Amazon rainforest soared more than 88 percent in June compared with the same month a year ago, the second consecutive month of rising forest destruction under Bolsonaro.\n\nBolsonaro has faced mounting domestic criticism over his rhetoric regarding the environment, which activists blame for emboldening loggers, miners, and farmers in the Amazon. Bolsonaro has also come under increased pressure from international powers to protect Brazil's environment under the terms of a landmark free trade deal brokered over two decades between the European Union and South American bloc Mercosur - of which Brazil is a member - and agreed to last month.\n\nThe pact requires the Latin American giant to abide by the Paris climate accord, which Bolsonaro has threatened to pull out of, and also aims to end illegal deforestation, including in the Brazilian Amazon. Norway and Germany have halted tens of millions of dollars of Amazon protection subsidies to the Amazon Fund, accusing Brazil of turning its back on the fight against deforestation.\n\nThe move came after Bolsonaro's administration unilaterally changed the fund's governance structure and closed down the steering committee that selects the projects to back, making no formal proposal for the composition of a new committee. Bolsonaro reacted angrily to the suspension of funding and said Brazil would not take any lessons from the donor countries.\n\nThe surge in fires and deforestation has sparked global concern, with the hashtag #prayforamazonia becoming a global Twitter trend. The unprecedented surge in fires has raised concerns over President Bolsonaro's management of the environment and his commitment to protecting the Amazon rainforest, a vital resource in slowing the pace of global warming.",
    " Title: The Absence of a Contested Primary and the Missing Discourse on Systemic Racial Injustice\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an article published by MSNBC, Alex Seitz-Wald suggests that pressure is mounting on Hillary Clinton to address the Ferguson issue, yet the former Secretary of State is not under any significant pressure, objectively speaking. Her strong position as the presumptive 2016 Democratic Party nominee leaves her with no incentive to navigate politically treacherous waters and every reason to maintain a low profile.\n\nThe article highlights the changing demographics of the United States, with the youngest voter cohort being less white and more liberal on economic issues than the national average. This demographic shift is expected to push the Democratic Party to tackle new issues that were too contentious for previous Democratic leaders like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama.\n\nThe article points out that the current President, Barack Obama, is unlikely to address the question of systemic racial injustice in the American criminal justice system. However, it suggests that the next Democratic Party presidential nominee, ideally through a contested primary, could provide a platform for this discussion.\n\nThe article laments the lack of a contested primary in the 2016 Democratic race, arguing that it is a missed opportunity to bring new issues to the forefront. So far, it has been Republican Senator Rand Paul who has made the boldest statements on this issue among prominent national politicians. The article emphasizes the importance of the Democratic Party, with its more multiracial coalition, in representing the interests of people of color for years to come.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that the lack of a contested primary is denying the country the circumstances in which high-profile Democrats are forced to address the issues that Ferguson has placed squarely on the national agenda.",
    " Title: Progressive Congresswomen Endorse Bernie Sanders for Presidential Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development for the 2020 Democratic presidential race, three members of the progressive 'Squad' in Congress have announced their support for Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is set to appear with Sanders at a rally in Queens, NY on Saturday, in an event dubbed \"Bernie's Back,\" aiming to rejuvenate the senator's campaign following his recent health procedure. Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has also endorsed Sanders, according to Fox News.\n\nCNN reported that Representative Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) will also endorse Sanders, although it remains unclear if Omar and Tlaib will appear at Saturday's event.\n\nIn a statement posted on Twitter by the Sanders campaign and retweeted by Omar herself, the congresswoman said, \"Bernie is leading a working-class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity, and geography.\" She added, \"I believe Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020.\"\n\nThe endorsements come after Tuesday night's Democratic debate in Ohio, where Senator Elizabeth Warren faced criticism from multiple candidates following her rise in the polls in recent weeks. The endorsements could be a significant setback for Warren, who, like Sanders, represents the party's progressive wing.\n\nThe backing of the 'Squad' members is also crucial in attracting young voters, as the top three Democrats in the polls are all senior citizens: Sanders is 78, former Vice President Joe Biden is 76, and Warren is 70 years old.\n\nThere is no indication yet that the fourth member of the 'Squad', Representative Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), is ready to make an endorsement, either for Sanders or any other candidate.",
    " Title: Sen. Ted Cruz Links Debt Ceiling to Affordable Care Act, Discusses Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" with Candy Crowley, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas discussed the ongoing government shutdown and the connection between raising the debt ceiling and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCruz stated, \"The debt ceiling historically has been among the best leverage that Congress has to rein in the executive.\" He outlined three objectives for the Republican approach to the debt ceiling: reducing government spending, avoiding new taxes, and finding ways to mitigate the negative effects of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCruz emphasized that since 1978, the debt ceiling has been raised 58 times, with 20 instances involving specific and stringent spending requirements. He criticized the idea of increasing the nation's credit limit without any constraints, stating, \"The president's demand to jack up the nation's credit card with no limits, no constraints - it's not reasonable.\"\n\nThe United States is expected to reach its borrowing limit on October 17. The government temporarily shut down on October 1 due to the House's refusal to pass a spending bill that would allow the government to pay its bills, as Republicans sought changes or delayed implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCruz has been identified as a key figure in the government shutdown standoff, as he has encouraged fellow Republicans in the House to demand that any plan to fund the government be tied to defunding the Affordable Care Act. Cruz argued that allowing Obamacare to continue would \"destroy the private health care system.\"\n\nCruz also criticized Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid for refusing to consider a series of piecemeal bills passed by the House to fund certain government functions. Democrats in the Senate and the White House have stated they will only pass a \"clean\" spending bill, free of restrictions or changes to the health care law.\n\nCruz has faced criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans for his role in the government shutdown standoff. He responded, \"The fact that you're seeing those attacks, I think, is indicative of the fact that we're winning the argument. Obamacare is not working.\"\n\nA CBS News poll released this week showed that 72% of Americans disapprove of the shutdown, with more Americans blaming congressional Republicans than President Obama. Despite this, Cruz maintains that his actions have not negatively impacted his party's image. \"Not remotely,\" Cruz said. \"But I also think far too many people are worried about politics.\"",
    " Title: Houston Rockets GM Apologizes for Tweet Supporting Hong Kong Protests, Amidst International Backlash\n\nArticle:\n\nHouston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey has issued an apology for a tweet he posted on Sunday, which expressed support for the ongoing anti-government protests in Hong Kong. The tweet, which has since been deleted, sparked a rapid escalation of international controversy, with the Chinese Consulate-General in Houston and the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) condemning the statement.\n\nMorey's apology, posted on Twitter, reads: \"I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China.\"\n\nThe original tweet, which read \"Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\" drew over a thousand replies as of 10 a.m. Monday Hong Kong time (10 p.m. Sunday ET), with most urging Morey not to apologize. Thousands of Hong Kongers have been protesting for four months over concerns about Beijing's influence over the city, which the British handed over to China in 1997.\n\nThe Chinese Consulate-General in Houston issued a statement on Sunday, saying, \"We are deeply shocked by the erroneous comments on Hong Kong made by Mr. Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets. We have lodged representations and expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Houston Rockets, and urged the latter to correct the error and take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact.\"\n\nThe CBA also issued a statement, saying, \"The Chinese basketball association has expressed strong opposition to the remarks, and will suspend communication and cooperation with the Houston Rockets club.\" The current chairman of the CBA is Yao Ming, who previously played for the Houston Rockets.\n\nRockets owner Tilman Fertitta publicly rebuked Morey for the tweet, stating on Twitter that Morey \"does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets\" and that they are \"NOT a political organization.\"\n\nThe NBA released a statement in English on Sunday, saying, \"We recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have offended so many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable. While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals' educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them.\"\n\nThe NBA's statement in Chinese, posted on popular social network Weibo, varied slightly from the English version, according to a translation. It reads, \"We are extremely disappointed by the inappropriate remarks made by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, who has undoubtedly seriously hurt the feelings of our Chinese fans. Morey has now clarified that his comments do not represent the position of the Rockets or the NBA.\"\n\nThe NBA was not immediately available for a follow-up request for comment. The NBA is China's most popular sports league and has formed partnerships with some of the country's biggest tech companies. It also operates NBA retail stores in China. The current situation remains fluid, and it remains to be seen how this controversy will unfold.",
    " Title: Attorney General Barr to Skip House Judiciary Committee Hearing, Tensions Escalate Between House Democrats and Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a developing turn of events, Attorney General William Barr will reportedly not attend a highly anticipated hearing before the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee on Thursday, as negotiations over his appearance continue. The decision comes after Barr has faced intense scrutiny from congressional Democrats, who have accused him of compromising his integrity to appease President Donald Trump.\n\nThe latest dispute arises from a disagreement over who should question Barr regarding his handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report. According to a source on the committee, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) wants Judiciary Committee staff to question Barr, while DOJ officials insist that members of Congress should conduct the inquiry.\n\nThis development comes as tensions between House Democrats and the Trump administration have escalated over full access to Mueller's report and government witnesses who have defied congressional subpoenas to testify. Democrats have been eager to build on Mueller's findings with their own investigations into the president.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for House Judiciary Committee Republicans said, \"Attorney General Barr wasn\u2019t asked to testify before the committee\u2014he offered. He provided the Mueller report voluntarily. He invited Democrat leaders to view the less redacted report in person. Yet the only thing, apparently, that will satisfy Democrats, who refuse to read the less redacted report, is to have staff pinch hit when a cabinet-level official appears before us.\"\n\nThe spokesperson further added, \"What actual precedent is there for our committee making such demands of a sitting attorney general as part of our oversight duties? The attorney general isn\u2019t a fact witness, and this committee\u2019s investigations\u2014as Democrat leadership reminds us daily\u2014don\u2019t constitute impeachment, so Democrats have yet to prove their demands anything but abusive and illogical in light of the transparency and good faith the attorney general has shown our committee.\"\n\nThe dispute over Barr's testimony is just one of several ongoing conflicts between the House Democrats and the Trump administration. House Democrats have subpoenaed the Justice Department for the unredacted version of the Mueller report and underlying material gathered from the investigation. In response, the Justice Department has offered to make the full report, minus grand jury material (which legally must be withheld), available to a limited group of members\u2014an offer that Democrats have so far refused.\n\nThe standoff could potentially end up in court. Meanwhile, the House Oversight Committee has scheduled an interview for Wednesday with Carl Kline, a former White House staffer who was at risk of being held in contempt of Congress. The panel subpoenaed Kline after a former subordinate told the panel that dozens of Trump administration officials were granted security clearances despite \"disqualifying issues\" in their backgrounds. Kline defied a subpoena to appear, prompting Democrats to threaten contempt action against him. However, Kline has now agreed to testify, potentially averting a separate showdown between Democrats and the White House.",
    " Title: Obama and Romney Clash on Economic Policies in Ohio, Highlighting Differences Ahead of Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech delivered in Ohio on Thursday, President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney highlighted their contrasting economic visions, with the president emphasizing the need to revive the economy and create jobs, while Romney focused on the role of private enterprise in economic growth.\n\n\"There is one place I stand in complete agreement with Mr. Romney,\" Mr. Obama said. \"This election is about our economic future.\" The president offered no new policy prescriptions in his speech, instead using the opportunity to contrast his agenda with Romney's detailed account of the Republican alternative.\n\nMr. Obama argued that the nation was slowly \"digging out of a hole that is nine million jobs deep,\" and he blamed Republican policies over the previous decade for driving up the deficit and benefiting the rich at the expense of the middle class. He said a Republican victory in November would mean a return to the \"theory that the best way to grow the economy is from the top down,\" and he called the election \"the make-or-break moment for America's middle class.\"\n\nPoint by point, the president listed the Bush-era economic and policy choices\u2014embraced by Romney and Congressional Republicans\u2014that he said had led to the recession of 2008 and 2009: tax cuts for the wealthy, deregulation, spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that was added to the deficit. \"I don't believe that the government is the answer to all of our problems,\" Mr. Obama said. \"But, he said, \"what is holding us back is not a lack of big ideas, not a matter of finding the right technical solution.\"\n\n\"What is holding us back is a stalemate in Washington between two fundamentally different views of what direction America should take,\" Mr. Obama said.\n\nRomney, who spoke earlier in the day in Ohio, said that private enterprise, not government, was the key to expanding the economy, and that the Obama administration's policies on financial regulation, health care, and energy had stifled that growth and had held back the recovery.\n\n\"I think he's made it harder for the American enterprise system to work,\" Mr. Romney said. \"And I want to change that. I want to make it once again, America once again the most attractive place in the world for job creators.\"\n\nThe simultaneous visits to Ohio by both candidates underscored the state's importance in the fall election. Polls show that the men are in a virtual dead heat in the state. Ohio tends to be a predictor of the presidential race, but the state is an outlier in some ways. The unemployment rate in Ohio, at 7.4 percent, is almost a point below the national rate.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Senators Call for Open and Inclusive Tax Reform Process\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint op-ed, U.S. Senators \u2588\u2588\u2588 (D-VA) and Angus King (I-ME) have urged for a more open and inclusive approach to the ongoing major tax reform process. The senators emphasize the significant impact that the tax reform will have on every American, business, and the economy as a whole, and call for a more collaborative and deliberate approach to ensure a well-informed and balanced outcome.\n\nThe senators express concern over the current process, which they believe is being rushed without proper input from Democrats, Independents, outside experts, affected communities, and ordinary citizens. They argue that a more measured approach would allow for hearings, expert input, and compromise, leading to a more targeted and less costly alternative.\n\nOne of the primary concerns raised by the senators is the long-term implications of the substantial revenue cuts in the current Senate and House bills, which they believe will exacerbate the growing deficit and debt. They argue that the deficit spending, undertaken during relatively good economic times, is unnecessary and counterproductive, as any rational business would be paying down debt rather than adding to it.\n\nThe senators also highlight the potential for overlooked ideas that could promote economic growth without ballooning the debt or favoring one class of taxpayers over another. For instance, they reference the proposal by their Republican Senate colleague, Ron Johnson, to treat all businesses equally by attributing the income of Subchapter C corporations to their owners and taxing that income at personal rates.\n\nThe senators argue that the current tax reform proposals disproportionately benefit the largest companies and wealthiest individuals, offering little to small businesses and burdening millions of middle-class families. They also point out that these proposals could increase the number of uninsured Americans and exacerbate the deficit by at least $1.5 trillion.\n\nThe senators conclude by emphasizing the importance of a bipartisan approach to tax reform, citing the bipartisan Senate legislation they have worked on in the past to stabilize the health insurance markets and regulate community banks and credit unions. They warn that missing the opportunity to get tax reform right could lead to long-term regret for the country as a whole.",
    " Title: Clarification Needed: Treasury Department's Move Regarding Russia Sanctions Not a Sanctions Easing as Initially Reported\n\nThe recent news that the U.S. Treasury Department was allowing U.S. companies to make limited transactions with Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the country's intelligence agency, was met with widespread speculation that President Donald Trump was easing or even lifting sanctions against Russia. However, this interpretation has been refuted by the White House and various experts, with the move being described as a \"technical fix\" rather than a sanctions easing.\n\nThe Treasury Department's decision was a response to a problem identified by the Obama administration, which prevented U.S. exporters of non-sanctioned electronic devices from complying with both U.S. and Russian law. The move was not a start of sanctions easing, but rather a rule change to address this issue.\n\nIan Bremmer, president of the consulting firm Eurasia Group, stated that the move was \"largely a technical fix.\" Even Senator John McCain, who has called for tougher sanctions on Russia, agreed with this assessment.\n\nThe media has been criticized for its handling of the situation, with numerous headlines and reports emerging quickly, only to be contradicted by subsequent information. This is not the first time the media has been accused of misinterpreting or misrepresenting news related to the Trump administration.\n\nIn a similar vein, there have been reports of miscommunication and confusion within the administration, with questions being raised about the review and approval process for executive orders and other policy decisions.\n\nThe White House has yet to comment on the media's handling of the Russia sanctions story, but it is clear that the situation has caused confusion and uncertainty, and has led to calls for greater accuracy and transparency in news reporting.",
    " Title: Revised Racial Profiling Rules for Border Patrol Agents Announced by Obama Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration has announced revised rules for racial profiling by Border Patrol agents, following the president's decision to grant legal status to millions of immigrants who entered the country illegally. The new rules, which are likely to stir controversy among some advocacy groups, will include new training requirements and will mandate federal agents to keep records on complaints they receive about profiling, according to several officials.\n\nThe revisions come as the nation's first black attorney general, Eric Holder, has spoken forcefully against racial profiling. However, he faced objections on the issues of national security and border protection. F.B.I. agents opposed a wholesale ban on considering race and nationality in terrorism investigations, arguing that an agent investigating a militant group must be able to identify areas with large populations of the relevant ethnicity.\n\nThe Justice Department initially planned to announce the revisions to the racial profiling rules earlier this year, but the White House intervened and ordered a broad review that included the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of the Border Patrol. The broad exemptions for national security and immigration were eliminated, but several provisions remain.\n\nThe rules, both the current version and the revisions, offer more protection against discrimination than the Supreme Court has said the Constitution requires. The court has ruled that border agents may not conduct roving traffic stops based on a motorist's apparent Mexican descent, but agents at checkpoints may single out drivers for interviews based on their apparent Mexican ancestry.\n\nRepresentative Beto O'Rourke, a Texas Democrat who represents the border city of El Paso, expressed concern that such policies unnecessarily expose millions of people to being stopped. \"How can race help a Border Patrol agent or customs officer do a better job in a city like El Paso, where 85 percent of the people are Hispanic?\" Mr. O'Rourke said.\n\nLast year, the Border Patrol settled a racial-profiling lawsuit in which Washington State residents accused border agents of racial profiling while making traffic stops near the Canadian border. The government admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to retrain its agents on the profiling rules.\n\nThe new rules prohibit federal agents from relying on broad stereotypes, but they can consider race when responding to specific leads, such as when a witness describes a suspect as tall, white, and blond. The revised rules are expected to have a significant impact on the way Border Patrol agents operate, particularly in diverse areas along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
    " Title: Gun Manufacturers Face Legal Challenges Amid Allegations of Negligence in Firearm Distribution\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of ongoing lawsuits, gun manufacturers are facing accusations of negligence in their distribution practices, with claims that they have failed to take adequate steps to prevent illegal firearm sales. The manufacturers, however, argue that these lawsuits are a frivolous misuse of the court system, intended to financially burden them.\n\nThe Times reached out to several gun manufacturers for comment, with most declining or not responding. Timothy A. Bumann, a lawyer for Taurus International Manufacturing, reiterated arguments made by gun executives in their depositions, stating that Taurus is not a law enforcement agency and has no legal duty to police its dealers and distributors. However, he emphasized that the company is \"proactive in all the things it reasonably can do vis-\u00e0-vis the safe and lawful use of its product.\"\n\nLawrence G. Keane, senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the industry's trade association, stated in an email that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \"does not want manufacturers to play Jr. G-man.\" He also highlighted various collaborative efforts between the association and the A.T.F., such as an education program to prevent illegal gun purchases, as evidence of the industry's commitment.\n\nThe lawsuits are bolstered by testimony from several former industry insiders. Notable among them is Robert Ricker, a former lawyer for the National Rifle Association and executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council, the main gun industry trade association before its disbandment. In a 2003 affidavit on behalf of the City of San Diego, Mr. Ricker wrote, \"Leaders in the industry have consistently resisted taking constructive voluntary action to prevent firearms from ending up in the illegal gun market and have sought to silence others within the industry who have advocated reform.\"\n\nMr. Ricker detailed the backlash he faced for his calls for reform, including being forced to resign as the head of the trade group due to industry pressure. Another insider, Robert Hass, a former Smith & Wesson executive, testified that \"the nature of the product demands that its distribution be handled in such a way as to minimize illegal and unintended use.\" When Smith & Wesson voluntarily adopted a set of safeguards, including requirements that its dealers limit multiple sales of firearms, it was ostracized and boycotted, forcing it to abandon the changes.",
    " Title: The Unprecedented Disruption of Charles Murray's Speech at Middlebury College: A Call for Dialogue and Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent disruption of political scientist Charles Murray's speech at Middlebury College has sparked a heated debate over free speech, civil discourse, and the role of higher education in fostering open dialogue. Murray, best known for his controversial book \"The Bell Curve,\" was invited to speak by a conservative student group, but his talk was met with protests that escalated to the point of violence and disrupted the event.\n\nThe story follows a familiar pattern: Murray was invited to speak, protesters assembled to prevent him from speaking, they disrupted the speech, and it was ultimately canceled. Murray then recorded his speech for those who wished to hear it, but protesters continued to disrupt the proceedings, and Murray was physically threatened as he attempted to leave the building. One of the professors who accompanied him was injured by the mob.\n\nWhat sets this incident apart is Murray's account of the events, which highlights a shift in the nature of protests he has experienced in the past. In his experience, negotiations with protesters, free speech norms, and the college's efforts to ensure a civil and orderly event were usually sufficient to prevent disruptions. This time, those measures were not enough.\n\nMurray's work, particularly \"The Bell Curve,\" has been the subject of much controversy, with critics taking issue with his views on race and IQ. However, the larger point about class stratification and its impact on society has only become more evident over time, and is the focus of Murray's most recent book, \"Coming Apart.\"\n\nThe events at Middlebury College raise important questions about the role of higher education in fostering open dialogue and promoting the exchange of ideas. Murray's work challenges the left, which historically stands against the concentration of economic and political power, to engage in a meaningful discussion about the root causes of social stratification and the potential solutions.\n\nThe left should be particularly interested in Murray's work, as it raises questions about the effectiveness of meritocracy and equality of opportunity in reducing class stratification. If meritocracy and equality of opportunity do not lead to increased social mobility and reduced class stratification, as Murray's work suggests, then it may be time to reconsider old-school left-wing solutions like strong labor unions and the redistribution of wealth.\n\nThe protests at Middlebury College have been criticized for not only violating free speech norms but also for undermining the very institution that the protesters attend and its place in society. By ruling Murray unworthy of consideration, the radical protesters have not only traduced important norms related to free speech and civil respect, but they have also denied themselves the opportunity to engage in a meaningful discussion about the role of higher education in society and the root causes of social stratification.\n\nIn conclusion, the events at Middlebury College highlight the importance of open dialogue and the exchange of ideas, particularly in the context of higher education. Murray's work raises vital questions that the left, in particular, should be eager to engage with, as it challenges the left's traditional solutions to social stratification. The protests at Middlebury College have done a disservice to the ideals of free speech and civil discourse, and have denied the left the opportunity to demonstrate that they have better answers.",
    " Title: Grand Jury Decision in Michael Brown Shooting: A Comprehensive Look at the Evidence and Witness Testimony\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a grand jury's decision not to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown, violent protests have erupted in Ferguson, Missouri. The grand jury, after reviewing thousands of pages of evidence and witness testimonies, determined that Wilson acted within the limits of the lethal-force law.\n\nThe grand jury's decision, like the shooting that led to the unrest, has sparked intense debate, with the symbol of this story being protesters raising their hands, symbolically telling police, \"Hands up, don't shoot.\"\n\nThe grand jury's decision hinged on the interpretation of witness accounts, particularly that of Witness 14, who claimed Brown was surrendering with his hands up when he was shot. However, further investigation by federal authorities has cast doubt on this account, with the witness's assumptions becoming less clear regarding Brown's actions and the position of his hands.\n\nOfficer Wilson's testimony to the grand jury paints a picture of a scared officer who felt his life was in danger during the confrontation with the larger Brown, who was physically assaulting him. Wilson described the altercation, stating that Brown and a companion were walking in the middle of the street, preventing normal traffic, and that he ordered them to move to the sidewalk. After a brief exchange, Brown used a vulgarity and slammed the door of the police car shut.\n\nWilson said he feared for his life and, after considering using Mace, a baton, and his flashlight, drew his gun and ordered Brown to stop. Brown allegedly grabbed Wilson's gun, and the officer fired twice. When the gun jammed, Brown hit him again. Wilson then chased Brown, who stopped and Wilson did as well. Wilson ordered Brown to get on the ground, but Brown did not comply, instead making an \"aggressive sound\" and running toward Wilson. Wilson fired a series of shots, claiming he did not know how many he shot.\n\nPhysical evidence, such as the autopsy results and the presence of Brown's blood inside the police car and on Wilson's gun, supports Wilson's account of close-range contact. Photographs taken of Wilson on the day of the confrontation also cast doubt on Wilson's testimony about the intensity of the confrontation, as doctors diagnosed him with a bruise.\n\nThe grand jury's decision and the evidence presented to them have sparked intense debate and protests. The full evidence, including witness testimonies and physical evidence, has been made available to the public, and we invite readers to review the documents and share any interesting findings in the comments.",
    " Title: House Impeachment Inquiry: Former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch Testifies in Second Public Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nThe second public hearing in the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry takes place on Friday at 9 am ET, featuring the testimony of former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. The hearing can be watched on CSPAN or other major networks, and a live stream is embedded above.\n\nFriday's hearing will delve into the ouster of Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who was removed from her ambassador post in April, just days after Volodymyr Zelensky was elected as Ukraine's president. The hearing will provide a chronological step back from the alleged quid pro quo efforts that unfolded after her departure from Kyiv.\n\nYovanovitch, a respected career diplomat with over three decades of service, was reportedly pressured to leave her post due to her perceived disfavor with two powerful individuals: Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Ukraine's prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko.\n\nThe pressure on Yovanovitch began with ominous rumors that Giuliani and Lutsenko were planning to \"do things\" to her. In the months that followed, Giuliani, Fox News hosts, and even the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., publicly criticized or called for her ouster. Yovanovitch was eventually told to leave Kyiv and return to the US on the next plane.\n\nMonths after Yovanovitch's exit, President Trump made a menacing-sounding remark about her to Zelensky on the phone: \"She's going to go through some things.\"\n\nYovanovitch told her side of the story to House impeachment investigators last month. \"I couldn't imagine all the things that have happened over the last six or seven months,\" she said. \"I just couldn't imagine it.\"\n\nYovanovitch was sworn in as ambassador to Ukraine in August of 2016 and held the post until her abrupt removal in the spring of this year. She is currently a teaching fellow at Georgetown University.\n\nAccording to the accounts of other witnesses who have testified in the impeachment inquiry, Yovanovitch was highly respected among her colleagues. However, she ran afoul of two powerful individuals: Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Ukraine's prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko.\n\nIn an apparent effort to win President Trump's favor, Lutsenko and Giuliani began discussing the possibility that the Ukrainian prosecutor general could launch investigations into Trump's enemies. They would investigate Burisma (the Ukrainian natural gas company whose board included Hunter Biden) as well as purported Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nYovanovitch objected when Lutsenko asked the US embassy to set up meetings with FBI or Justice Department officials, stating that such meetings were not the typical way these things are handled. Instead, she encouraged him to meet with the FBI's legal attach\u00e9 in Kyiv. \"I don't think he really appreciated it,\" she told investigators.\n\nIn response, Yovanovitch claimed, Lutsenko began spreading what Yovanovitch says was a completely fabricated story about her: that she gave him a list of people she didn't want him to prosecute. (Lutsenko has since recanted that story.) Rumors also spread that Yovanovitch was a Trump critic who was bad-mouthing the president in private. The purpose of these rumors seems to have been to push her out of the ambassadorship.\n\nThe smear campaign exploded into public view in March of this year, when Lutsenko gave an interview to conservative journalist John Solomon of The Hill repeating the unsubstantiated allegation that Yovanovitch had given him a \"do not prosecute\" list.\n\nSoon, top Trump allies like Giuliani and Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity were openly attacking Yovanovitch. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., also tweeted an article about calls to remove her, writing that the US needs \"less of these jokers as ambassadors.\"\n\nThen, in late April, just three days after Zelensky's election meant a new administration would come in, Yovanovitch received a call from a State Department official who told her to leave Ukraine on the next plane. The Deputy Secretary of State later explained to her that Trump had decided she had to go\u2014and the haste was due to fear Trump would attack her in a public tweet.\n\nYovanovitch was out. But when Trump spoke to Zelensky during their now-infamous phone call on July 25, her name came up. \"The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news, and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news, so I just wanted to let you know that,\" Trump said, according to a quasi-transcript released by the NSC. Later, he added: \"Well, she's going to go through some things.\"\n\nFor more of an idea of what Yovanovitch will say, read the transcript of her closed-door deposition at this link.\n\nFriday's hearing will close out this first week of impeachment inquiry hearings, but Democrats have set up a full slate of events for next week. On Tuesday, November 19, the morning will feature Jennifer Williams (a State Department official advising the vice president's office) and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (a National Security Council staffer). The afternoon will feature Kurt Volker (the former US special representative to Ukraine) and Tim Morrison (a National Security Council staffer).\n\nOn Wednesday, November 20, US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland will testify in the morning. Defense Department official Laura Cooper and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale will testify in the afternoon.\n\nThen, on Thursday, November 21, former National Security Council staffer Fiona Hill is scheduled to testify. It is unclear whether that will be the end of the public hearings or whether there will be more to come. But Democrats had hoped to complete this phase of their inquiry before Thanksgiving.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking Joy Reid's Tweet on Donald Trump's Wives and Their Countries of Origin\n\nArticle:\n\nMSNBC host Joy Reid's tweet on Friday, attempting to link President Donald Trump to Russia, has come under scrutiny for factual inaccuracies. Reid, who hosts a weekend show on MSNBC, stated that two of Trump's three wives are from nations formerly part of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn her tweet, Reid wrote, \"Donald Trump married one American (his second wife) and two women from what used to be Soviet Yugoslavia: Ivana-Slovakia, Melania-Slovenia.\"\n\nHowever, there are several errors in this statement. Reid is correct that one of the three women Trump has married is an American, Marla Maples, who was born in Georgia, the southern U.S. state, not the former Soviet republic.\n\nShe is also correct that Melania Trump, who Trump married in 2005, is from Slovenia. However, Trump's first wife, Ivana, is not from Slovakia. Nor was Slovakia part of Yugoslavia. Ivana Trump, the mother of Trump's first three children, was born in what is now the Czech Republic, formerly known as Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia became a part of the Soviet bloc in 1948, a year before Ivana was born.\n\nReid was correct in one regard: Slovenia, where Melania was born, is one of the five nations that once made up Yugoslavia. But as noted above, Yugoslavia was not a part of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn response to the fact-checking, Reid acknowledged and corrected one of the errors in her tweet, stating, \"Right- correction. Ivana is from Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic). Good catch.\" She also noted, \"Melania is from Slovenia (which, plus Slovakia, used to be Yugoslavia).\"\n\nIn conclusion, while Joy Reid's tweet aimed to make a political point, it contained several factual errors regarding the countries of origin of Donald Trump's wives.",
    " Title: House Progressives Call for Urgent Vote on Iran War Powers Legislation, Seek to Block Funding for Military Action\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse progressives on Tuesday called for immediate votes on legislation to block funding for military action against Iran and to repeal the 2002 authorization of military force, following the airstrike last week that killed top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani.\n\nFreshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), a former CIA and Pentagon analyst who served multiple tours in Iraq and represents a competitive district, is expected to lead a resolution that demands the Trump administration's military hostilities with Iran cease within 30 days if no further congressional action is taken.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Progressive Caucus are expected to back the resolution, but are also pushing for votes on additional bills to restrict the Trump administration's actions against Iran.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) has proposed a bill that would prohibit funds for offensive military force in or against Iran without prior authorization from Congress. Another bill, previously introduced by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) last year, would repeal the 2002 authorization of military force against Iraq, which the administration used as legal justification for the Soleimani strike.\n\n\"In addition to the War Powers Resolution, we believe it is imperative to simultaneously pursue all avenues to prevent a disastrous war with Iran,\" Lee and Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-Chairmen Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) and Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said in a joint statement. \"Given the lack of any coherent strategy by the White House to de-escalate tensions and protect U.S. troops, regional partners, and innocent civilians, Congress must act swiftly to prevent another endless war.\"\n\nThe House passed an annual defense authorization bill last summer that included the proposals from Khanna and Lee, but both of their measures were ultimately left out of the final version that Trump signed into law last month.\n\nThe War Powers Resolution to be unveiled by Slotkin and Democratic leaders this week to limit the Trump administration's actions against Iran is expected to pass easily with widespread support from Democrats. A House vote on the resolution has not yet been scheduled but is expected later in the week.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) wrote in a letter to her colleagues on Sunday that \"As Members of Congress, our first responsibility is to keep the American people safe. For this reason, we are concerned that the Administration took this action without the consultation of Congress and without respect for Congress\u2019s war powers granted to it by the Constitution.\"\n\nYet, it's unlikely that Senate Republicans, who have largely backed Trump for ordering the strike that killed Soleimani, will support the measure to restrict his powers. Congress did pass a resolution last year to force the Trump administration to end U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, but Trump vetoed it.

Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, on the other hand, was widely perceived as having lost the debate, with his attempts to attack Rubio's Senate attendance record backfiring.\n\nThe survey, conducted by the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus, a weekly poll of top operatives, activists, and strategists in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, found that Bush's performance was lackluster and desperate. An Iowa GOP insider described Bush as \"opportunistic and desperate\" when he went after Rubio, while a South Carolina Republican stated that the debate would not halt the downward spiral of Bush's campaign.\n\nRubio, however, was praised for his composure and preparedness. An Iowa Republican noted that Rubio \"obliterated\" Bush when the former governor attempted to criticize his Senate attendance record. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Texas Senator Ted Cruz finished second and third, respectively, in the insiders' assessment.\n\nBush's sharpest attack of the campaign, a well-rehearsed line about Rubio's missed votes, was met with a calm response from the Florida senator. Rubio countered Bush's criticism by stating, \"Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.\" Bush was largely invisible for the rest of the debate, finishing last in terms of speaking time.\n\nDonald Trump, the Republican front-runner, was not rated as the victor by any GOP insider, but few said he lost. The debate saw a more subdued Trump, with fewer memorable or incendiary exchanges compared to his previous performances. He did, however, tangle briefly with Ohio Governor John Kasich, dismissing Kasich's stewardship of Ohio's economy as luck due to a fracking boom.\n\nBen Carson, who recently surpassed Trump in a national poll, also failed to leave a significant mark, with just 6 percent of insiders deeming him the winner and 10 percent saying he lost. A South Carolina Republican described Carson as \"naive\" and \"with no answers.\"\n\nThe debate was criticized for its choppy nature, with moderators struggling to control the dialogue and facing criticism for their tough questions. Some insiders even suggested that the moderators were the real losers of the debate. Notably, the debate was held by CNBC, and Trump used his closing statements to tout his skill at negotiating, claiming he helped convince the network to limit the debate to two hours.",
    " Title: House Republicans Scramble to Limit Defections on Trump's Emergency Declaration Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to avoid a potential humiliating defeat for President Donald Trump, House Republicans are working to limit the number of defections on a vote to block his emergency declaration to fund the border wall. The White House and GOP leaders have launched a last-minute push to minimize losses in the House vote scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nSo far, only one Republican, libertarian Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), has publicly backed a Democratic measure to overturn Trump's national emergency declaration. However, House Democrats believe they could win support from between five to 10 Republicans in Tuesday's much-anticipated floor vote.\n\nThe question is whether at least four GOP senators will create a bipartisan majority and help deliver the biggest rebuke of the president since Democrats regained the House last fall. The House's vote on Tuesday could set the tone in the Senate by offering political cover to Republican senators who have publicly fretted about Trump's move to secure billions of dollars without Congress's approval.\n\nIn an attempt to drum up GOP support, Democrats have circulated a spreadsheet of hundreds of military construction projects that the White House could potentially take money from for its border project. The document shows billions of dollars are at stake in red states from Alaska to Georgia to Texas.\n\nPressure has been building, with Pentagon officials visiting Capitol Hill on Friday to brief top defense spending leaders of both parties on where the administration could divert $3.6 billion from military projects to the border.\n\nRep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) and four other House Republicans sent a letter to Trump earlier this month urging him to look elsewhere for the money. Turner, a defense hawk whose state could lose as much as $90 million in military construction funds, has said Trump's move would be a \"dangerous precedent.\" However, he hasn't specifically said if he would support the Democratic resolution.\n\nRep. Roger Williams (R-Texas) initially feared that Trump's move could take money from Fort Hood, which is in his district. But last week, he got a personal assurance from Pentagon officials that no existing funding would be used. \"That's a big deal to me,\" Williams said Monday night, confirming that he would vote against the resolution.\n\nTrump began applying public pressure to his own party Monday, warning Republicans not to fall into the Democratic \"trap.\" The White House legislative affairs team has also been making the case privately to Republican lawmakers over the weekend and on Monday. Officials have been doing outreach to provide \"as much information as possible,\" and plan to take a more targeted approach after they learn which GOP members are considering voting for the measure.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise sent talking points to the GOP caucus on Monday that say there are already 31 national emergencies in effect, and that Trump is specifically working to address a \"humanitarian and security crisis.\" The White House is eyeing a total of $8 billion in border cash, which would also include $2.5 billion from a Pentagon drug interdiction program as well as $600 million from a Treasury Department forfeiture fund.\n\nSince Trump's announcement earlier this month, groups of former national security officials and former GOP members of Congress have also expressed opposition to the move. The vote on Tuesday will offer insight into the level of support for Trump's emergency declaration among House Republicans.",
    " Title: Scarlett Johansson Clarifies Controversial Comments on Casting and Art\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with As If magazine, actress Scarlett Johansson, who faced backlash for her role in the live-action Ghost in the Shell remake and the controversial casting in the upcoming biopic Rub & Tug, has expressed her thoughts on the political correctness in art and casting.\n\nJohansson's comments, which were picked up by the Daily Mail, have caused an uproar, leading the actress to release a statement saying the article was \"edited for clickbait and is widely taken out of context.\" The interview, it seems, was not a standard profile but a collaboration between Johansson and contemporary painter David Salle, who asked her to \"play with the idea of living within a tree\" during a photoshoot featuring his work.\n\nIn the interview, Johansson discussed her acting role models of the 1950s, such as James Dean, Natalie Wood, and Marlon Brando, describing them as exhibiting a kind of liberation and unapologetic showcase of emotions. She also shared her thoughts on the current state of acting and casting, stating, \"Today there's a lot of emphasis and conversation about what acting is and who we want to see represent ourselves on screen. The question now is, what is acting anyway? Right. Who gets to play what roles... You know, as an actor, I should be allowed to play any person, or any tree, or any animal because that is my job and the requirements of my job.\"\n\nJohansson's statement seems to contradict her recent clarification that \"in an ideal world, any actor should be able to play anybody and Art, in all forms, should be immune to political correctness.\" However, she also acknowledged the widespread discrepancy in the industry that favors Caucasian, cis-gendered actors and the need for diversity in all industries.\n\nMeanwhile, Johansson's co-star, screenwriter, and director for her upcoming movie, Jojo Rabbit, Taika Waititi, has a different approach to casting. In a tweet from June 2018, Waititi discussed his role in the movie, an adaptation of Christine Leunens' novel Caging Skies, and his general theory of casting, stating, \"Week one down of our anti-fuckface satire, Jojo Rabbit. Can't wait to share it with the world. Also, what better way to insult Hitler than having him portrayed by a Polynesian Jew?\"\n\nThe debate on casting and representation in the entertainment industry continues to evolve, with Johansson's comments adding fuel to the fire. As the release of her next movie, Jojo Rabbit, approaches in October, the conversation about casting is likely to remain a hot topic.",
    " Title: Boston Residents Celebrate Capture of Marathon Bombing Suspect, Mourn Loss of MIT Police Officer\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing a tense and emotional week, Boston residents have expressed feelings of joy and relief after the capture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the suspected bomber of the Boston Marathon. The 19-year-old immigrant, who authorities believe set off two bombs near the race's finish line, was apprehended on Friday night.\n\nThe Boston Police Department announced the capture with a Twitter post that read, \"CAPTURED!! The hunt is over. The search is done. The terror is over. And justice has won. Suspect in custody.\" The city's residents, who had been on edge since the Monday explosions, lined some streets to cheer for each passing police car and made their way to pay respects or share hugs at a makeshift memorial near the scene of the bombings.\n\nThe day-long manhunt had disrupted the lives of some residents, who were initially barred from their homes and kept many more locked inside due to the man initially labeled \"Suspect #2\" by the FBI being on the loose in the area. He was last seen after a Friday shootout that killed his brother, \"Suspect #1\" Tamerlan Tsarnaev, in the Boston suburb of Watertown. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was eventually captured in Watertown.\n\nUnfortunately, another person was killed during the manhunt - Sean Collier, a campus police officer at MIT. Transit officer Richard Donahue was severely injured.\n\nThe lifting of the lockdown, early Friday evening, aided in the apprehension of Suspect #2, as one Watertown resident emerged from his home to notice a trail of blood leading to the boat parked on his property. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found inside. The arrest took some time, as police took precautions against possible explosives on the scene.\n\nResidents were able to rest easy by bedtime, and to go about life as usual on Saturday. The FBI continues to investigate, preparing for a high-profile prosecution, while Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is being treated for wounds in a local hospital.",
    " Title: New York Times Report Suggests Frequent Contact Between Trump Campaign Aides and Russian Intelligence Officials\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing Russian influence scandal surrounding the White House has taken a dramatic turn as reports suggest that some of Donald Trump's campaign aides had regular contact with Russian intelligence officials during the 2016 election campaign.\n\nThe New York Times published a report on Tuesday night, citing four current and former US intelligence officials who remain unnamed. The officials stated that, while they had not found evidence of cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence in Moscow's efforts to sway the election in Trump's favor, they did not clarify the purpose of these contacts.\n\nA separate report by CNN claimed that \"high-level advisers close to then-presidential nominee Donald Trump were in constant communication during the campaign with Russians known to US intelligence.\"\n\nThese reports contradict White House spokesman Sean Spicer, who, on Tuesday, reiterated his previous assertions that there were no pre-election contacts between the Trump team and Russian officials. Last month, Trump himself also denied any such contacts.\n\nThe reports add pressure on the Republican congressional leadership to launch committee hearings on Russian election interference, which were promised but have yet to materialize. They also indicate that intelligence officials are willing to leak extensively against the Trump administration, making it risky for the White House to try to shut down investigations into collusion with Moscow that are reportedly being carried out by several intelligence agencies.\n\nThe reports add circumstantial weight to the reports on the Trump campaign's Kremlin links compiled last year and passed to the FBI by a former MI6 officer, Christopher Steele. His reports alleged active, sustained, and covert collusion to subvert the election, which, if confirmed, could constitute treason.\n\nTrump responded with a series of angry tweets on Wednesday morning, claiming that the Russian connection allegations were merely an attempt to cover up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign. He also accused the intelligence community of \"unAmerican\" leaks to newspapers and referred to the reports as \"fake news.\"\n\nThe only Trump associate named in the New York Times report as having participated in the contacts was Paul Manafort, who was the Trump campaign manager for several months last summer. Manafort has repeatedly denied any contacts with Russian officials.\n\nManafort left the Trump campaign in August, after allegations about his activities in Ukraine first surfaced. At about the same time, the campaign also distanced itself from a US businessman, Carter Page, whom Trump had previously described as an adviser, after Page was reported to have had contacts with Vladimir Putin's top lieutenants.\n\nThe new reports of the Trump campaign's contacts with Moscow rekindled bitterness among former campaign aides to Hillary Clinton, over a pre-election announcement by the FBI director, James Comey, that new material was being studied in an investigation of her use of a private internet server for her emails. That investigation came to nothing, but Clinton officials were convinced the bad publicity, just 11 days before the election, cost her crucial votes. By contrast, they point out, the Republican Comey said nothing about investigations underway at the same time into Trump's Russian links.\n\n\"I'd like the FBI to explain why they sent a letter about Clinton but not this,\" Clinton's former campaign manager, Robby Mook, said in a tweet on Tuesday night. Her former spokesman, Brian Fallon, tweeted, \"Everything we suspected during the campaign is proving true. This is a colossal scandal.\"",

He acknowledges the challenges in today's job market but argues that even minimum-wage jobs can provide valuable skills and opportunities for growth.\n\nCarson recalls his experiences in finding summer jobs during his college years, emphasizing the importance of persistence and initiative. He suggests that young people, especially those seeking their first jobs, should not be discouraged by the job market and should actively seek out opportunities, even if they may not be initially glamorous or well-paying.\n\nThe article concludes with Carson's call to action for those with resources to support and encourage young people in their job-seeking endeavors. He emphasizes that even part-time jobs can lead to the acquisition of important skills and that the more we groom our youth for success, the more we secure the future of our nation and the pursuit of happiness for all.",
    " Title: World War II Memorial Closure and Obamacare Debacle Highlight Government Inefficiency\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a week marked by government inefficiency, two significant events have highlighted the challenges of big government and its impact on American citizens. The first, the closure of the World War II Memorial, saw veterans barred from visiting their own memorial during the ongoing government shutdown. The second, the rollout of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), has left millions grappling with a malfunctioning healthcare.gov website and a myriad of other issues.\n\nThis week, the nation witnessed the poignant spectacle of World War II veterans being denied access to their memorial due to the government shutdown. These veterans, who bravely faced the Japanese and the Nazis, were met with barricades and told they could not visit their memorial. Some speculate that the cost of erecting these barricades may have exceeded the cost of leaving them unattended.\n\nDespite the barriers, these WWII heroes refused to be deterred, gathering at the memorial in defiance. Their determination serves as a testament to their unwavering spirit and a stark reminder of the sacrifices they made for their country.\n\nMeanwhile, the rollout of Obamacare has left millions of Americans grappling with the new healthcare system. The healthcare.gov website has been plagued with issues, with President Barack Obama comparing the problems to the glitches that occur when Apple launches a new product. However, unlike Apple products, Americans are being forced to purchase health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges, and are met with a lack of response from the government when they voice their concerns.\n\nIn Kentucky, for example, residents now have a choice between just two insurance companies, a significant decrease from the more than 30 options previously available. While these issues may seem minor compared to the problems faced by most Americans, they are just a small part of the larger concerns surrounding Obamacare.\n\nAmericans are worried about keeping their current plans, understanding the new law, potential fines, personal privacy, and even keeping their jobs. The government shutdown was not desired by anyone, and Republicans have continued to offer compromises to keep the government open. However, these proposals have been rejected by Democrats.\n\nSenator Rand Paul offered an amendment to keep the government open for an additional week while negotiations continued. His proposal, like all others, was rejected. The inability to find common ground has led to a standoff that has left the government shut down and millions of Americans struggling with the implementation of Obamacare.\n\nAs the budget battle continues, it is clear that Washington is dysfunctional, taking on too many functions and failing to deliver on even the most basic of tasks. The government's handling of the World War II Memorial and the rollout of Obamacare serve as a stark reminder of the inefficiencies and incompetencies that plague big government.\n\nAnnual trillion-dollar deficits and a $17 trillion debt that continues to climb are the unfortunate results of a largely dysfunctional government. The shutdown and the Obamacare debacle serve as a reminder that big government does not work, and that Washington must respond to the people and address the failings of Obamacare.\n\nThe determination of the WWII veterans and the struggles of Americans navigating Obamacare serve as a call to action for Washington to address the issues that matter most to the American people. The government must learn from these events and work towards a more efficient, effective, and responsive system that serves the needs of its citizens.",
    " Title: Justice Ginsburg Denies Temporary Block on Depositions for Trump Administration Officials in Census Lawsuit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development in the ongoing legal battle over the Trump administration's plan to include a question about citizenship status in the 2020 census, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has denied the administration's request for the Supreme Court to temporarily block lower court-ordered document requests and depositions of two key officials involved in the decision-making process.\n\nThe Trump administration, in its latest move, has escalated the legal fight to the U.S. Supreme Court. This week, they filed a petition seeking to overturn lower court rulings that have allowed plaintiffs' attorneys to question Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Justice Department official John Gore under oath.\n\nJustice Ginsburg's decision leaves open the possibility for the administration to reapply for a permanent block on the depositions, a move the administration has signaled it intends to do. The administration could either request the Supreme Court to order lower courts to halt the depositions or ask the high court to hear the case.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs in the two lead cases have been preparing for the final weeks of evidence-gathering, which is scheduled to end on Oct. 12. A potential trial for these lawsuits is set to start on Nov. 5 at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nLast month, a judge on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put Ross' deposition on hold while the request was under review. In a filing on Wednesday, Solicitor General Noel Francisco, representing the administration in the six lawsuits around the country over the controversial question, wrote that he was preemptively asking the Supreme Court to consider blocking Ross' Oct. 11 deposition in case the 2nd Circuit refuses to do so.\n\nA three-judge panel is set to review the administration's earlier request for the 2nd Circuit to stop Ross' deposition on Oct. 9.\n\nThe Trump administration has been arguing that deposing Ross and Gore is not necessary to resolve these lawsuits and that the judges should instead rely on the record of internal memos, emails, and other documents already released by the administration.\n\nIn their earlier request for the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to block Ross' deposition, Justice Department attorneys wrote, \"The validity of the Secretary's decision is properly judged on that objective record, without inquiry into Secretary Ross's deliberative process and any subjective reasons he might have had for favoring the reinstatement of a citizenship question.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly tried to block discovery in the lawsuits, a move that has been rejected by the courts. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman, who has allowed the plaintiffs' attorneys to question Ross, has previously stated, \"You have to wonder what they're trying to hide.\"\n\nIn response to the administration's request to the high court on Wednesday, Amy Spitalnick, a spokesperson for the New York state attorney general's office, which filed one of the lawsuits over the citizenship question, said they are determined to \"get to the bottom of how the decision to demand citizenship status was made.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs, which include dozens of states, cities, and other groups that want the question removed, claim that Ross misused his authority and discriminated against immigrant communities of color by ordering the 2020 census to inquire about U.S. citizenship status. Critics of the question point to Census Bureau research suggesting that asking about citizenship status could discourage households with noncitizens, including unauthorized immigrants, from participating in the once-a-decade head count of every person living in the U.S., as required under the Constitution.\n\nHowever, Furman has ruled, in part, that the officials should be deposed because of documents suggesting that better enforcement of the Voting Rights Act was not the main driver behind the push for a citizenship question. \"Secretary Ross must sit for a deposition because, among other things, his intent and credibility are directly at issue in these cases,\" Furman wrote in an opinion filed last month.\n\nAs NPR has reported, an internal email exchange released as part of the lawsuits provided an early indication that the Trump administration was preparing to defend the citizenship question at the Supreme Court months before the Justice Department formally submitted its request for the question in December 2017.",
    " Title: Trump Urges Apple to Shift Production to U.S. Amidst Proposed Tariffs on Chinese Imports\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent tweet, President Donald Trump has suggested that Apple Inc., a major tech company based in Cupertino, California, could avoid potential increased costs due to proposed tariffs on Chinese imports by moving its production to the United States.\n\nThe tweet, posted on Saturday, comes after Apple announced this week that a proposed new round of $200 billion in additional tariffs on Chinese imports could lead to price increases for some of its products, including the Apple Watch and the Mac mini.\n\nThe company, which manufactures many of its products for the U.S. market in China, is highly exposed to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. It also sells gadgets, including the iPhone, in China, making them potential targets for Chinese retaliation against the Trump tariffs.\n\nIn the tweet, Trump suggested, \"Apple prices may increase because of the massive Tariffs we may be imposing on China \u2014 but there is an easy solution where there would be ZERO tax, and indeed a tax incentive, if the company made its products in the U.S. instead of China.\"\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has not announced plans to move manufacturing from China to the U.S.\n\nIn a letter this week to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Apple stated, \"because all tariffs ultimately show up as a tax on US consumers, they will increase the cost of Apple products that our customers have come to rely on in their daily lives.\" The company added that tariffs would hit \"a wide range of Apple products,\" including computers, watches, adapters, chargers, and tools used in its U.S. manufacturing, repair, and data centers.\n\nThe tariffs, according to Apple, would raise the cost of its U.S. operations and put it at a disadvantage to foreign rivals. The company also expressed doubt about how tariffs would advance the government's goal, stating, \"it is difficult to see\" how tariffs would advance the government's goal.\n\nThe White House has accused China of stealing U.S. intellectual property and forcing American companies to share their technology with Chinese companies. The tariffs are intended to pressure China to stop this behavior, the administration has said.\n\nThe presidential tweet is the latest in a series of exchanges between the Trump administration and companies that fear tariffs will negatively impact their business. The Trump administration has already imposed tariffs of $50 billion on imports from China, primarily equipment and materials used by manufacturers. In July, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that these measures had no effect on Apple. However, the company is concerned about the Trump administration's proposal to add 25 percent duties on another $200 billion in Chinese goods, including a wider assortment of consumer-related items.",
    " Title: U.S. and Allies Navigate Tense UN Resolution Demanding Israeli Withdrawal from West Bank and East Jerusalem\n\nArticle:\n\nA diplomatic standoff is unfolding at the United Nations as Palestinian officials, in conjunction with their allies, push for a resolution demanding Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank and East Jerusalem within two years. This move has left the Obama administration in a delicate position, attempting to ease tensions and establish a peaceful resolution to the ongoing conflict.\n\nInitially, the resolution was set to be presented for a potential vote this Wednesday, but with the U.S.'s likely veto, the vote may be delayed. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged against any actions that could be perceived as interfering in Israeli elections, scheduled for March. Kerry emphasized the importance of halting the escalating Israeli-Palestinian violence and creating conditions for a resumption of peace talks.\n\n\"We all know the risk of escalation. It's constant and it's real. And that is why it is imperative to lower the temperature, end the tension, so that we have an opportunity to find a path that Israelis and Palestinians both want so desperately,\" Kerry stated.\n\nKerry declined to categorize the U.S.'s position on suggestions for the U.N. Security Council to set a framework for negotiations, a proposal that Israel strongly opposes. \"Right now we're trying to have a constructive conversation with everybody,\" Kerry told reporters in London, the final stop on a three-nation European trip focused on Mideast diplomacy.\n\n\"In the end, though, this is not up to the international community or others. This has to be decided by the parties,\" Kerry said.\n\nKerry's meetings included discussions with chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and foreign ministers from Britain, France, and Germany. The Obama administration finds itself in a precarious position, as it has expressed objections to certain settlement expansions in territory the Palestinians desire for a future state, but has not considered sanctions on Israel.\n\nThe most hard-line, pro-Palestinian U.N. resolution is being drafted by Jordan, on behalf of the Palestinians. This resolution would demand a full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank within two years and full recognition of Palestine as a state, with no mention of land swaps or security measures.\n\nThe U.S. and France have also drafted versions of a Security Council resolution, though they have not been submitted. Council diplomats, who requested anonymity, told Fox News that the French draft of the resolution is less hostile toward Israel than the one being put forward by Jordan, but it does parallel concepts in that text, most notably calls for an Israeli withdrawal by a determined deadline. The U.S. Mission is not disclosing details of its draft, but its existence signals the Obama administration may feel a U.N. resolution of some kind is necessary.\n\nFrance's resolution reportedly bases the division of the land on the 1967 Mideast borders, a position publicly supported by President Obama, but it does not include key Israeli and U.S. conditions such as Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state. In Paris on Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius made his case to Elaraby, Egyptian and Palestinian ministers, and former Israeli President Shimon Peres.\n\nFabius emphasized the need to resume peace talks, but Peres expressed a preference for a Palestinian state to be established \"through an agreement rather than through an imposition.\" Support for France within Europe is uncertain, despite mounting pressure for legislators across the continent to hold votes recognizing a Palestinian state. Countries are divided over the idea of setting a 2016 deadline, with Germany particularly reluctant, diplomats said.\n\nKerry highlighted several examples of the downward security trend in Israel and the West Bank, including Israelis being stabbed, axed, and subjected to acid attacks, as well as the recent loss of a senior Palestinian official during protests, the burning of a mosque near Ramallah, and \"price tag\" attacks by Jewish extremists.\n\n\"We want to find the most constructive way of doing something that therefore will not have unintended consequences, that also stems the violence,\" Kerry said. \"It's a particularly sensitive moment because we understand the frustrations of Palestinians. They do not see another course at this moment.\"\n\nThe key, Kerry said, is to \"try to find whether or not there are other options, other ways, other courses...to respect the process that Israelis are about to undergo.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Proposed Deportation of Illegal Aliens in Sanctuary Cities Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked heated debates and controversy, President Donald Trump announced on Twitter last Monday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would be deployed to various American sanctuary cities to detain and deport millions of illegal aliens. The announcement has been met with a wave of criticism from the left, illegal alien rights groups, and the media, but supporters of the move argue that it is a necessary step in addressing the issue of illegal immigration.\n\nIllegal immigration is a contentious issue that has been a topic of debate for many years. Current estimates put the total number of illegal aliens in the United States at over 12 million, although exact numbers are difficult to determine due to citizenship questions on the national census.\n\nThe Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) conducted a comprehensive study regarding the financial impact of illegal immigration. Services provided to these some 12 million illegals and their families are estimated to cost over $135 billion annually. This figure is significant, and some argue that it could have been used to address other pressing issues, such as the Ebola outbreak in 2014 or funding for the Veterans' Administration.\n\nThe financial burden of illegal immigration is not the only concern. The safety and security of American citizens is also at stake. In 2018, the federal government reported 2,028 murders by illegal aliens who were arrested. This, along with high-profile cases such as the 2015 murder of Kate Steinle and the 2018 brutal killing of Mollie Tibbetts, has led some to question why the government allows such crimes to persist through inaction.\n\nCritics argue that America already has crime and that importing more is not the solution. However, proponents of stricter immigration policies argue that it is important to address the root causes of crime, rather than simply accepting it as an inevitable part of society.\n\nSanctuary cities, which refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, have come under fire for exacerbating the issue of illegal immigration. Cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, which are both sanctuary cities, are struggling with crises of homelessness and crime. In San Francisco, a new app allows people to track human feces in the street, while in Los Angeles, even liberal icon Cher has spoken out about the homeless problem and the insanity of inviting more.\n\nThe Left has attempted to frame the issue of illegal immigration as one of race, but proponents of stricter immigration policies argue that this is a logical fallacy. They argue that the focus should be on the issue itself, rather than race or identity politics.\n\nAs of today, Trump has placed a two-week hold on his plan to detain and deport, hoping that Democrats in Congress can address the issue. Critics argue that the move is politically motivated, while supporters argue that it is a necessary step in addressing the issue of illegal immigration.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of illegal immigration is a complex and contentious one, with many on both sides of the debate. The financial burden, the safety and security of American citizens, and the role of sanctuary cities are all important factors to consider. As the debate continues, it is important to approach the issue with a clear understanding of the facts and to avoid making assumptions based on race or identity politics.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Immigration Legislation Proposed by Senators McCain and Coons Aims to Address DACA, Border Security, and Government Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to avert a potential government shutdown, Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) will introduce a comprehensive immigration bill on Monday. The legislation, which aims to provide a path to citizenship for Dreamers and address border security concerns, is set to include a study on necessary border security measures.\n\nThe proposed bill offers legal status and a path to citizenship for individuals who have lived in the U.S. since December 31, 2013. This group is expected to be larger than the 1.8 million people covered by President Trump's proposed plan. The bill calls for the Department of Homeland Security to develop a strategy for border control by 2020, and provides $110 million annually for five years to improve coordination between border-patrol agents and state and local law-enforcement officials.\n\nHowever, the bill does not allocate funds for border technology, controversial barriers, or the border wall, a key demand of the White House. The bill also includes provisions to clear a backlog in the immigration court system by hiring 55 new judges per year, as well as dozens of staff attorneys, for three years. Additionally, the bill directs the State Department to submit a three-year strategy to address the root causes of immigration from Central America.\n\nPresident Trump, in a statement on Monday, deemed any proposed solution without border wall funding as a \"total waste of time.\" The White House had previously called for $25 billion for the border wall, as well as other measures such as limiting chain migration and ending the visa lottery program.\n\nSenator McCain, in a statement on Sunday, expressed the need for bipartisan cooperation to address the impending expiration of the DACA program and secure the southern border.

    " Title: Trump to Declare National Emergency to Fund Border Wall, Sparking Constitutional Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he will declare a national emergency in an effort to secure funding for his long-promised U.S.-Mexico border wall without congressional approval, a move that is likely to ignite a constitutional showdown with Congress.\n\nConceding defeat in his earlier demand for $5.7 billion in wall funding, Trump agreed to sign a government-funding bill that lacks money for the wall but prevents another damaging government shutdown. The bill, which was passed by both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives on Thursday, contains funding for fencing and other forms of border security, but it does not include the wall, which Trump had promised during his 2016 campaign that Mexico would pay for.\n\nThe bill is expected to reach the White House on Friday for the president's signature before he departs for his private Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida for a holiday weekend break.\n\n\"President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action - including a national emergency,\" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.\n\nThe top Democrat in Congress, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, denounced the president's move. Asked by reporters if she would file a legal challenge to an emergency declaration, Pelosi said, \"I may, that's an option.\"\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of a \"gross abuse of the power of the presidency.\"\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would support Trump on the emergency declaration. Earlier this month, McConnell had cautioned Trump that declaring an emergency could divide Senate Republicans, according to the Washington Post.\n\nAn emergency declaration could infringe on Congress' authority to make major decisions about taxpayer funds, a fundamental check and balance spelled out in the Constitution.\n\nFor weeks, as the president's wall-funding demand to Congress went nowhere, even after a historic 35-day partial government shutdown, the White House explored whether an emergency declaration could be invoked to redirect taxpayer funds committed by Congress for other purposes toward the wall.\n\nThe national emergency strategy, expected to be declared by Trump on Friday, is already dividing Republicans.\n\nSenator Susan Collins, a Republican moderate, said in a statement, \"Declaring a national emergency for this purpose would be a mistake on the part of the president.\"\n\nBut Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of a right-wing Republican faction in the House, said, \"At this point, President Trump must look at taking executive action - and I will stand with him to protect our sovereign borders.\"\n\nCongressional aides said House Democrats would take various steps to try to block Trump's emergency, possibly including a lawsuit. The short-term result of that could be a court injunction blocking any diversion of funds while judges weigh the matter, possibly leading to a Supreme Court decision.\n\nA senior White House official said the administration had found nearly $7 billion to reallocate to the wall, including $600 million from a Treasury Department forfeiture fund, $2.5 billion from a Defense Department drug interdiction fund, and $3.5 billion from a military construction budget.\n\nThe funds would cover just part of the estimated $23 billion cost of the wall promised by Trump along the 2,000-mile (3,200-km) border with Mexico.\n\nA source said lawyers from the White House and other agencies had vetted the figures and believed they would withstand a legal challenge.\n\nThe Republican-led Senate passed the government funding bill by a vote of 83-16, and the Democratic-led House by a vote of 300-128, with 86 House Republicans voting in favor. The measure would provide more than $300 billion to fund the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies through Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year.\n\nIt also includes $1.37 billion in new money to help build 55 miles (88.5 km) of new physical border barriers. That is the same level of funding Congress appropriated for border security measures last year, including barriers, but not concrete walls.\n\nFunding for those agencies was due to expire on Friday, which would trigger another partial federal shutdown on Saturday morning if Trump unexpectedly refuses to sign the bill.\n\nSome of Trump's fellow Republicans have warned him that declaring a national emergency could set a dangerous precedent, opening the door for a future Democratic president to circumvent Congress and declare emergencies on perhaps climate change, gun control, or healthcare insurance.\n\nPelosi said, \"If the president can declare an emergency on something that he has created as an emergency - an illusion that he wants to convey - just think of what a president with different values can present to the American people.\"\n\nDemocratic Senator Ron Wyden said, \"I will pull out all the stops to stop this horrendous, bizarre idea. As people get a chance to sort through what the implications really are, we will have strong bipartisan support for opposing this.\"",
    " Title: White House Celebrates President Obama's 2015 Policy Victories Despite Congressional Opposition\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his final press briefing of the year, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest highlighted President Obama's achievements in 2015, despite Republican majorities in Congress. The list of accomplishments included the restoration of diplomatic ties with Cuba, the Paris climate change agreement, and the halt of the Keystone pipeline.\n\nAt the briefing, Earnest pointed out that many of these achievements were made possible by the administration's determination and forceful effort to advance its agenda, despite Republican opposition. He specifically called out Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for his unsuccessful attempts to scuttle the climate change agreement.\n\nThe White House spokesman also noted that the administration's halting of the Keystone pipeline was a result of the president's announcement earlier this year, which was followed by the State Department's rejection of the project in the fall.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan countered that the budget deal reached this week shows the GOP as an \"effective opposition party.\" He stated that the deal reins in the IRS, stops EPA overreach, and blocks several Obamacare provisions and the taxpayer bailout of the \"risk corridor\" program for health insurance companies that lose money under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNearly all of the priorities cited by the White House were accomplished through executive action or treaty-like agreements that Mr. Obama purposely crafted to avoid the need for congressional approval. The administration's immigration plan, economic sanctions on Russia, and efforts to address the Islamic State and the Syrian civil war were not mentioned in the list of accomplishments.\n\nThe White House spokesman also did not discuss the president's repeated call for raising the federal minimum wage, which has not been achieved this year. Instead, the administration has worked with states and employers to raise their own wage rates.\n\nWhen asked about the president's low job-approval rating, Earnest attributed it to the public's concern about the Dec. 2 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California. Earnest also claimed that the president does not worry about polls or news cycles.\n\nOne of the few legislative initiatives that Mr. Obama won in Congress this year was the measure that granted him trade promotion authority, which helped him to conclude the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement in October with 11 other nations. The White House anticipates working closely with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill next year to secure congressional approval of the agreement. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that the Senate will likely postpone consideration of TPP until after the presidential election in November or until after Mr. Obama leaves office in January 2017.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Overturns Texas Abortion Law: Implications for Women's Health and Future Legal Battles\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has ruled 5-3 against a Texas pro-life law that imposed strict regulations on abortion clinics and physicians. The law, which was signed by former Governor Rick Perry in 2013, required abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and mandated that clinics meet hospital-like standards for outpatient surgery.\n\nMatthew Clark, with the American Center for Law and Justice, has criticized the Supreme Court's decision as another example of \"abortion distortion.\" In an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 News, Clark argued that the surgical requirements, including the admitting privileges requirement, provide minimal, if any, health benefits for women and pose a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions. He further stated that these requirements constitute an \"undue burden\" on women's constitutional right to abortion.\n\nJustices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined in agreement with Justice Stephen Breyer. Chief Justice John Roberts, and justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas disagreed with the ruling. Thomas stated that the court's decision \"exemplifies the court's troubling tendency to bend the rules when any effort to limit abortion, or even speak in opposition to abortion, is at issue.\"\n\nThe law, when first signed, reduced the number of clinics in Texas from 40 to 20. Had it taken full effect, the 20 clinics would have been cut in half. Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Women's Health, led the challenge against the law. \"Every day Whole Women's Health treats our patients with compassion, respect, and dignity \u2013 and today the Supreme Court did the same,\" she said. \"We're thrilled that today justice was served and our clinics stay open.\"\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also commented on the ruling on Twitter, stating it was a \"victory for women in Texas and across America.\" Clinton added, \"The fight is not over. The next president has to protect women's health. Women won't be 'punished' for exercising their basic rights.\"\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights says the decision could have \"far-reaching implications.\" It represents \"a clear statement by the court about what the standard should be in these types of cases,\" Julie Rikelman, director of the litigation group, said. Twenty-two states currently have facility requirements that are similar or the exact same as the requirements for ambulatory surgical centers.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the ruling will cast a \"long shadow\" among states with similar laws. The decision could potentially impact the future of abortion access in the United States, as the Supreme Court has set a precedent for the interpretation of \"undue burden\" in abortion cases.",
    " Title: Study by Pew Research Center Reveals Conservatives More Tolerant Than Liberals on Social Media, According to Unfriending Rates\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by The Pew Research Center has found that political conservatives are more tolerant than liberals when it comes to social media interactions, as determined by the likelihood of unfriending or blocking individuals with opposing political views.\n\nAccording to the study, roughly 44% of consistent liberals on Facebook have blocked or defriended someone due to political disagreements, compared to 31% of consistent conservatives and 26% of all Facebook users.\n\nThe study also revealed that liberals are more tightly clustered around a single news source, with a higher degree of distrust towards 24 out of 36 news sources measured. In contrast, 88% of consistent conservatives trust Fox News.\n\nLiberals, when on Facebook, are more likely to encounter political opinions that align with their views, and are more likely to have friends who share their political perspectives. Two-thirds (66%) of consistent liberals report that most of their close friends share their views on government and politics.\n\nHowever, liberals are less unified in their media loyalty, relying on a broader range of news outlets, including those like NPR and the New York Times that are used less by other groups. They also express more trust than distrust towards 28 out of 36 news outlets in the survey.\n\nIn addition, liberals are more likely to block or \"defriend\" someone on a social network, as well as to end a personal friendship, due to political differences. They are also more likely to follow issue-based groups, rather than political parties or candidates, in their Facebook feeds.\n\nThe study aims to gauge political polarization in the country and provides insights into the media consumption habits and social media behavior of different ideological groups.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this study?

    " Title: White House Communications Director Hope Hicks Resigns Amidst Ongoing Congressional Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - Hope Hicks, a long-standing and trusted aide to U.S. President Donald Trump, has announced her resignation from her position as White House Communications Director. This departure marks another significant change in the president's inner circle, following a series of dismissals and scandals.\n\nThe White House confirmed Hicks' decision to leave on Wednesday, a day after she testified for nine hours before the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee as part of their ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders stated that Hicks' decision to leave was not related to her testimony before the panel.\n\nPresident Trump praised Hicks, calling her \"a truly great person\" whom he would miss having at his side. Hicks, who served as Trump's spokesperson during the 2016 election campaign, reportedly answered questions on Tuesday about her time with the campaign and the transition period between the election and the inauguration.\n\nHicks, who is 29, has been a constant presence in Trump's orbit, often steering press-related policy and maintaining a low-profile despite her behind-the-scenes role. Her departure is expected to occur over the next few weeks.\n\nHicks was embroiled in a controversy surrounding former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, another close Trump aide whom Hicks was dating. She worked to defend Porter when allegations of domestic abuse against his two former wives emerged. Porter ultimately resigned.\n\nA lawyer for Hicks, who has represented her in the Russia investigation, declined comment. Among the issues Hicks declined to discuss with the House panel was her part in drafting a statement in July 2017 that misrepresented a July 2016 meeting at Trump Tower that included the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., other Trump associates, and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia ran a program of hacking and disinformation to interfere in the elections, and this later developed into an attempt to help Republican candidate Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. On Feb. 16, a U.S. special counsel indicted 13 Russians and three companies on charges of tampering in the campaign. Russia denies interfering in the U.S. election, and Trump denies any collusion between his campaign and Moscow officials.\n\nHicks took over as communications director in September, following the 11-day tenure of Anthony Scaramucci, who was fired. She is credited with stabilizing the communications operation. President Trump praised Hicks, stating, \"Hope is outstanding and has done great work for the last three years. She is as smart and thoughtful as they come, a truly great person.\" Hicks expressed her gratitude to President Trump in her own statement, wishing him and his administration the best as they continue to lead the country.",
    " Title: Jacksonville Beach Reopening Sparks Debate Over Risky Activities and COVID-19 Restrictions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Florida, the city of Jacksonville partially reopened its beaches on April 18, 2020, sparking a national debate over the distinction between risky and non-risky activities during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The scene at Jacksonville Beach was far from one of caution, as crowds gathered, cheering and engaging in various physical activities such as swimming, biking, surfing, running, and fishing.\n\nWhile these activities have not been identified as vectors for the spread of COVID-19, the reopening of the beach became a subject of controversy, with CNN running a disapproving segment and the hashtag #FloridaMorons trending on Twitter. The reopening of outdoor spaces, however, has not been shown to be dangerous, and no outdoor activities have been linked to the spread of the disease.\n\nThe debate over the reopening of outdoor spaces is not unique to Jacksonville. Early in the crisis, CNN anchors spent 20 minutes criticizing people who were walking, running, biking, and Rollerblading along San Francisco's Embarcadero. Despite there being no indication that outdoor spaces contribute to the spread of the disease, parks have been shut down throughout the United States, with some closures enforced with rigor.\n\nThe inability to make distinctions between risky and non-risky activities and between hard-hit areas and less affected regions has been a recurring theme in the coronavirus debate. For instance, it is one thing to hold a day-long, 100-person family reunion in a public park, quite another to jog through one. It is one thing to begin opening up in New York City, where there have been more than 10,000 deaths, and another to begin opening in Montana, where there have been 14.\n\nJacksonville, Florida, is the seat of Duval County, with a population of nearly a million people. The county has had 17 COVID-19 deaths, making it hardly a hot spot. The lockdown zealotry that has led to the closure of parks and other outdoor spaces, as well as the criticism of people engaging in physical activities, has been met with criticism for its lack of flexibility and its failure to acknowledge the vast differences in ways of life across the United States.\n\nAnti-lockdown protests at the Michigan state capitol last week received a lot of attention, with some protesters criticized for lack of social distancing. One argument of the demonstrators is that Michigan shouldn't be uniformly locked down if conditions around the state aren't uniform. Sparsely populated Alcona County in northern Michigan has four cases and no deaths, according to the latest state data, while Wayne County, encompassing the city of Detroit, has 6,677 cases and 597 deaths.\n\nThe lockdown zealotry that has led to the closure of parks and other outdoor spaces, as well as the criticism of people engaging in physical activities, has been met with criticism for its lack of flexibility and its failure to acknowledge the vast differences in ways of life across the United States. A more nuanced and flexible approach to reopening the country is necessary to balance the need to slow the spread of the disease with the need to minimize the economic cost of the lockdowns.",
    " Title: Unforeseen Turn of Events: House Speakership Race Temporarily Halted as Kevin McCarthy Withdraws\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, the House of Representatives found itself in a state of flux on Thursday as front-runner Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) withdrew his name from the House speakership election. The closed-door House Republican meeting, which was expected to conclude with a speaker nominee, spilled out into the hallway outside the House Ways and Means Room in the Longworth Office Building.\n\nReporters rushed to the scene to gather insights from lawmakers regarding the sudden development and the direction the conference might take moving forward.\n\nRep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), a more conservative alternative running against McCarthy, described the announcement as \"absolutely stunning.\"\n\n\"Look, it was totally, it was just absolutely stunning what happened. Nobody anticipated that that was going to happen. I love Kevin McCarthy; he's a good man, and that was a tough thing to do, but God bless him,\" Chaffetz said.\n\nRep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.) offered his own account of McCarthy's decision:\n\n\"'I am not the one' is what he said. 'I am not the one to get to 218.' I don't know if that was possible or not, he apparently decided he'd much rather stay as majority leader,\" Huelskamp recounted.\n\nThe House GOP announced the postponement of the speakership election, and speculation quickly arose about potential new candidates entering the race.\n\nSome called for a \"caretaker\" speaker\u2014someone who could temporarily hold the position until new elections can be held in January 2017. This would likely be a senior member who would not run in '17.\n\nRep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) suggested that a caretaker would help the party \"stay unified in our basic principles\":\n\n\"I think it'd be better to have a caretaker so we can stay unified in our basic principles rather than focus around a personality,\" Rohrabacher said.\n\nOne of Rohrabacher's suggestions for a caretaker was Rep. Hal Rogers of Kentucky. However, Rogers himself was not on board with the idea.\n\nRep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) addressed an elephant in the hallway\u2014a compromise he said \"may not want to talk about,\" but he said could be a \"very real possibility\":\n\n\"We may need a bipartisan coalition to elect the next speaker, that's a very real possibility right now, and I think everybody who's honest about this knows it,\" Dent said.\n\nRep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.)\u2014another candidate running for speaker who was endorsed by the House Freedom Caucus\u2014did not call for bipartisanship but instead for Republicans to \"come together and be a group\":\n\n\"I think there's this real desire for us to come together and be a group. A group that's coalesced around the idea of moving forward,\" Webster said.\n\nDespite the chaos, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) remained optimistic, expressing confidence that the Republican Party will find its way:\n\n\"Again, we're in kind of, somewhat, chaotic territory, but we will find a way through this and it's going to be a way that serves our party and the American people the best,\" Kinzinger said.",
    " Title: Senate Report Accuses Obama Administration of Misleading Public Over Iran's Access to U.S. Financial System\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a draft report released by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, it has been alleged that the Obama administration granted a license allowing Iran access to the United States financial system, contradicting previous assertions that such access would be prohibited.\n\nAccording to the report, on February 24, 2016, the Treasury Department issued a specific license to Bank Muscat, authorizing the conversion of Iran's rials to euros through \"any United States depository institution.\" Despite this license, U.S. government officials continued to testify in Congress that Iran would not be granted access to the U.S. financial system.\n\nSenator Rob Portman (R-Ohio), subcommittee chairman, stated, \"The Obama administration during the negotiation of the Iran deal misled the American people. I think they did so because they were desperate to get a deal.\"\n\nAt the time the Iran nuclear agreement was implemented, Iran had $5.7 billion in assets at Bank Muscat in Muscat, Oman, held as Omani rials. Iran sought to access this money, and using the U.S. financial system for conversion was the most efficient method, despite U.S. sanctions prohibiting it, according to the report.\n\nTwo U.S. banks were approached to execute the conversion, but both declined, citing the complexity and the unwanted appearance involved in processing an Iranian transaction, according to the report. Without a compliant American bank, a senior State Department official believed Bank Muscat and Iran eventually used European banks to convert the funds, the committee reported.\n\nThe subcommittee began investigating the transaction last summer. In an interview with an unnamed senior State Department official, the panel said, the official acknowledged that the administration \"exceeded our JCPOA commitments\" because there was nothing in the JCPOA that required the issuance of the specific license (JCPOA is the acronym for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran).\n\nA former administration official disputes the subcommittee's conclusion, stating that the Treasury Department never authorized Iran to access U.S. investments or markets, conduct commercial transactions in U.S. dollars, or open correspondent accounts at U.S. banks.\n\n\"This specific license can not be described as 'granting access to the U.S. financial system,'\" the former official said. \"This specific license was in fulfillment of JCPOA commitments to give Iran access to pools of its money held overseas. It was aimed solely to allow the movement of Iran's own funds stranded at an Omani bank into euros at a European bank, where Iran could then make use of them.\"",

However, this dream ended this week with Ted Cruz's and John Kasich's withdrawals from the race.\n\nRomney expressed his dismay at the current political landscape, stating, \"I wish we had better choices, and I keep hoping that somehow things will get better, and I just don't see an easy answer from where we are.\"\n\nRomney also praised House Speaker Paul Ryan, his former running mate, who recently criticized Trump. He expressed his admiration for Ryan's ability to unite the fractious House GOP and his leadership capacity, hinting at his hope for Ryan to remain Speaker.\n\nRomney's public disavowal of Trump follows Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse's, who had earlier argued for an adult to run for president on a third-party ticket. Romney's stance, however, marks a more prominent rejection of Trump, as other high-profile Republicans, including the Bush family and Senator John McCain, have also expressed their reluctance to support Trump or have refused to comment on his nomination.\n\nThe anti-Trump sentiment is not limited to high-profile Republicans, with dozens of other GOP congressional representatives, governors, and major political figures also distancing themselves from Trump or remaining silent on the issue.",

The autopsy revealed that Brooks suffered two gunshot wounds to the back, which caused organ failure due to blood loss.\n\nThe autopsy was performed on Sunday, and the details were released by the medical examiner's office. The encounter between Brooks and the officers, which took place late Friday outside a Wendy's restaurant, was initially a routine sobriety check. However, it quickly escalated, resulting in a struggle over a Taser, during which Brooks took the weapon and pointed it at the officers. The shooting occurred shortly thereafter.\n\nAtlanta police released a video of the incident on Sunday, showing the seemingly routine sobriety check that spiraled out of control, ending in gunfire. The department has terminated Officer Garrett Rolfe, who fired the fatal shots, and Officer Devin Brosnan has been placed on administrative duty. Rolfe had been with the department since October 2013, and Brosnan since September 2018.\n\nThe shooting has sparked protests in Atlanta and led to the resignation of Atlanta Police Chief Erella Foster. The incident has also been compared to the death of George Floyd, another black man who died in police custody, but Atlanta police and the city's mayor have emphasized that the two cases are \"completely different.\"\n\nIn other news, China has reportedly locked down 10 more neighborhoods and fired officials amid a resurgence of the coronavirus.

    " Title: Supreme Court Allows Enforcement of Arkansas Medication Abortion Restrictions, Legal Battle Continues\n\nIn a recent development, the Supreme Court has allowed Arkansas to enforce a law restricting medication abortions, overturning a lower court order that had previously blocked the rules from taking effect. The decision comes after an appeal from the Planned Parenthood affiliate in the state.\n\nPlanned Parenthood had sought to review the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling on the abortion pill rules, aiming to reinstate the lower court order that had initially blocked the enforcement of the law. The law in question requires doctors who provide abortion pills to hold a contract with another physician who has admitting privileges at a hospital and would agree to handle and treat complications.\n\nThe 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had previously reversed a court order blocking the enforcement of the law, but put that ruling on hold as Planned Parenthood appealed to the Supreme Court. The legal battle continues, but at this point, Arkansas is permitted to enforce the law.\n\nPlanned Parenthood argues that if the law stands, Arkansas would be the only state where women would not have access to a pair of drugs that end pregnancies\u2014mifepristone, which makes it difficult for the fetus to attach to the uterine wall, and misoprostol, which causes the body to expel the pregnancy, similar to a miscarriage. Planned Parenthood offers these abortion medications at clinics in Fayetteville and Little Rock, but has been unable to find an obstetrician in the state willing to handle hospital admissions.\n\nThe organization also argues that the law prevents women from obtaining medication abortions and would infringe on their right to an abortion, otherwise known as an undue burden. Undue burden is the standard set by the Supreme Court when measuring whether restrictions go too far in limiting women who seek to have an abortion.\n\nCritics of the law argue that it could end medication abortions in the state. The law is similar to a provision in a Texas law, which the Supreme Court struck down in 2016. The ongoing legal battle continues to unfold, with Planned Parenthood and supporters vowing to challenge the law in court.",
    " Title: The Logic of Zero Tolerance: A Balanced Perspective on Sexual Misconduct Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the current cultural climate, there is a growing consensus that zero tolerance for sexual harassment, exploitation, and violence is necessary. However, the application of this principle has sparked a heated debate, with some viewing it as a feminist or moral awakening, while others see it as an era of witch hunts, prudery, and weaponized politics.\n\nAs a neutral observer, it is clear that every significant cultural, political, and religious movement has its downsides. The abolition movement brought about John Brown, Prohibition had positive effects on public health but was hotly debated, and the temperance movement paved the way for women's suffrage. Anti-communism was a good thing, but it also had its unfortunate excesses.\n\nWhen popular passion swamps politics, true-believing zealots and opportunistic demagogues will exploit that passion. The zealots will overreach, and the demagogues will demagogue\u2014using a good cause to destroy political enemies and defend unworthy allies.\n\nRecent allegations of sexual misconduct have been made against high-profile figures such as Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, and Democratic Senator Al Franken. These allegations range from inappropriate advances to rape.\n\nWhile it is crucial to stand against any form of sexual misconduct, the severity of our intolerance should run on a spectrum. Rape should result in legal consequences, and making a pass at a subordinate in the workplace should have professional repercussions. However, making a pass at an adult woman is different than molesting a 14-year-old girl, and groping a woman's backside is not the same as raping a woman.\n\nThe problem lies in the logic of zero tolerance, which often treats every bad act as equally unacceptable. This can lead to journalistic laziness and partisan demagoguery and opportunism. Partisanship also leads to what can be called anti-leveling: people who ignore wrongdoing on \"their side\" even as they attack their enemies.\n\nThe White House's argument that denials should inoculate individuals from condemnation or practical consequences is problematic. Denials should matter, and accusations should invite skepticism. However, alleged miscreants should admit wrongdoing and apologize rather than simply deny.\n\nThe most dangerous and corrupting force in this situation is not the weaponization of bad behavior, but the weaponization of hypocrisy. The obsession with hypocrisy leads to a repugnant immorality, as partisans end up defending the underlying behavior itself in an effort to defend their team.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, it is essential to maintain a balanced perspective, considering the gravity of the allegations and the context in which they were made. The goal should be to create a society where sexual misconduct is not tolerated, but where due process and fairness are still upheld.",
    " Title: Judge Rules Paul Manafort Breached Plea Deal by Lying About Dealings with Alleged Russian Operative\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a ruling on Wednesday, a federal court judge in Washington found that Paul Manafort, former campaign chairman for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, breached his plea deal by making false statements to investigators about his dealings with Konstantin Kilimnik, an alleged Russian intelligence operative.\n\nAccording to the ruling by Judge Amy Berman Jackson, Manafort, 69, lied about three disputed issues, including his interactions with Kilimnik, a payment he received from a pro-Trump campaign group, and another investigation that has not been identified. The judge, however, failed to establish that Manafort lied on two other subjects, his recent contacts with Trump administration officials, and Kilimnik's role in a conspiracy to obstruct justice for which they were both indicted.\n\nThe ruling means that Robert Mueller's team is no longer obliged to endorse the lighter punishment that Manafort was promised for his crimes when he agreed to cooperate with investigators and tell the truth. Manafort, who has denied lying, could now face additional charges.\n\nMueller is investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, which US intelligence agencies concluded was aimed at boosting Trump's bid for the White House, and any coordination between Russian operatives and Trump's team. Manafort was accused by Mueller of lying about the fact he had shared polling data on the 2016 election with Kilimnik, a former colleague on election campaigns for pro-Kremlin politicians in eastern Europe.\n\nKilimnik, 48, trained at a university connected to Russia's military intelligence agency, formerly known as the GRU, which allegedly spearheaded the Kremlin's effort to disrupt the US election in 2016. Mueller has also previously said that Rick Gates, Manafort's deputy on the Trump campaign, described Kilimnik as \"a former Russian intelligence officer with the GRU.\" Kilimnik denies that characterization.\n\nThe special counsel moved to tear up Manafort's plea deal in November, alleging that the former campaign chairman had breached the agreement by continuing to lie. Mueller said the lies amounted to new crimes. Manafort was known to have met Kilimnik twice during 2016. He passed the polling data to Kilimnik during an August meeting in New York, according to investigators. Mueller's team also found Manafort met Kilimnik in Spain during 2017.\n\nManafort's attorneys strenuously denied that he had intentionally misled the investigators. They said he could not remember some details and worked to promptly clarify any misstatements. His attorneys did not deny that Manafort gave Kilimnik the polling data, instead stating that he had not lied about it but was merely \"unable to recall specific details prior to having his recollection refreshed.\"\n\nAs part of the plea deal struck last September, Manafort pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the US and conspiring to obstruct justice, in relation to unregistered lobbying work for pro-Russian politicians. Other charges against him were dropped. By then, Manafort had been convicted of eight criminal counts in a separate fraud case brought against him by Mueller in Virginia.",
    " Title: California Chrome Cleared to Wear Nasal Strip in Upcoming Belmont Stakes\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia Chrome, the current favorite for the Triple Crown, has been given the green light to wear a nasal strip during the Belmont Stakes on June 7, according to track officials. The decision comes after concerns were raised about the horse's ability to wear the nasal strip, which he has been using in previous races.\n\nThe nasal strip, a small adhesive strip placed on the horse's nose, is used to help the horse breathe more easily, particularly during long races. California Chrome has won six consecutive races with the nasal strip, and its removal could have potentially impacted the horse's performance.\n\nThe nasal strip controversy arose after California Chrome's impressive victory at the Preakness Stakes on May 18. Some speculated that the horse might be withdrawn from the Belmont Stakes if it was not allowed to wear the nasal strip.\n\nThe decision to allow the nasal strip was made by the New York Racing Association, which has the final say on such matters. The association's decision is in line with the practice in California and other racing jurisdictions, where nasal strips are commonly used.\n\nCalifornia Chrome's trainer, 77-year-old Art Sherman, expressed relief at the decision. \"I'm glad it's all sorted out now,\" he said. \"California Chrome has been doing well with the nasal strip, and it's important for his performance.\"\n\nThe Belmont Stakes is the final leg of the Triple Crown, a series of three races that includes the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes. California Chrome's victory at the Preakness Stakes has put him in a strong position to become the first horse to win the Triple Crown since Affirmed in 1978.\n\nThe Triple Crown winners thus far are Sir Barton (1919), Gallant Fox (1930), Omaha (1935), War Admiral (1937), Whirlaway (1941), Count Fleet (1943), Assault (1946), Citation (1948), Secretariat (1973), Seattle Slew (1977), and Affirmed (1978). California Chrome will have the opportunity to join this elite group of horses on June 7.",
    " Title: Deadly Assault at Pearl Continental Hotel in Gwadar: Security Guard and Attackers Killed in Ongoing Gunfight\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, at least three armed militants have stormed the Pearl Continental hotel in the port city of Gwadar, Balochistan province, Pakistan, leading to a violent standoff with government forces. The incident occurred around 5 pm local time on Saturday, and as of 8 pm, the gunfight was still ongoing, according to the assistant superintendent of police in the city.\n\nThe attackers stormed the luxury hotel, and security personnel immediately cordoned off the area around the hotel. A hotel security guard was reportedly killed in the initial attack, according to a spokesperson for Pakistan's military.\n\nIn a statement, a senior security official confirmed that all four attackers had been killed during the hours-long gunfight. The security forces managed to corner the attackers in a staircase during the standoff, as per the military's statement.\n\nThe responsibility for the attack was claimed on Twitter by members of the Majeed Brigade of the Balochistan Liberation Organisation, a separatist group active in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The group asserted that their fighters carried out the attack targeting Chinese and other foreign investors in the region.\n\nThe Majeed Brigade has previously claimed responsibility for attacks on the Chinese embassy in Karachi in November last year and another assault on Chinese engineers in the Baloch district of Chagai.\n\nGwadar, a small city in Balochistan province, is the site of a large port under construction by a Chinese company as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a significant project of China's Belt and Road infrastructure-building spree. Beijing has invested approximately $50bn (\u00a338bn) in the port and in road links between Gwadar and China's western Xinjiang province.\n\nThe city of Gwadar, including its major hotels, is heavily guarded by the Pakistan army and paramilitary forces due to its strategic importance. Balochistan province is Pakistan's poorest and most restive, with a history of separatist violence. In April, Baloch separatists killed at least 11 members of the military in an attack.\n\nThe Majeed Brigade was formed to carry out attacks against Chinese targets. Its founder, Aslam Baloch, was killed in a blast in Kandahar, Afghanistan, in December last year along with five other members of the militant group.",
    " Title: Former FBI Director James Comey to Testify on Alleged Pressure from Trump over Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey is set to testify this week on Capitol Hill regarding allegations that President Donald Trump attempted to influence an investigation into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Key U.S. senators have expressed anticipation for Comey's testimony, which could shed light on the nature and extent of any pressure exerted by the president on the former FBI chief.\n\nComey, who was leading the Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, was dismissed by Trump last month, four years into his 10-year term. The move has sparked accusations that Trump dismissed Comey to hinder the investigation and stifle questions about possible collusion between his campaign and Russia.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has expressed interest in understanding the nature of the conversations between Trump and Comey regarding this topic. Warner stated on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" program that he wants to know about \"appropriate or inappropriate pressure\" and the number of conversations the president had with Comey about the investigation.\n\nComey is due to testify on Thursday before the intelligence committee as part of its own Russia-related investigation. After Comey's dismissal, news reports emerged that Trump asked Comey to end the probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn during a February meeting in the Oval Office, the day after Flynn was fired for misrepresenting his contacts with the Russian ambassador. The account, first reported by the New York Times, was based on a memo Comey wrote after the meeting.\n\nThe Comey memo caused alarm on Capitol Hill and raised questions about whether Trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation. The potential for explosive testimony from Comey that could impact a sitting president makes Thursday's hearing a highly anticipated event, akin to the hearings in the 1970s examining the Watergate scandal.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to sway the November vote in Trump's favor. Russia has denied involvement, and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview that he does not have any relationship with Flynn and only spoke briefly with Flynn at a 2015 dinner for Russian TV network RT.\n\nRepublican Senator Susan Collins, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has expressed eagerness to question Comey to find out more about Trump's allegation that Comey told him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. Collins stated that she is eager to hear directly from Comey on these important issues.\n\nTrump has called the investigation into alleged ties between his campaign and Russia a \"witch hunt\" designed to undermine the legitimacy of his electoral win. After reports that Trump asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein hired former FBI chief Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead the FBI's Russia probe.",

Troops were sent to attack a compound in northern Syria where al-Baghdadi was located, according to a U.S. defense official.\n\nNo U.S. Special Operations forces were harmed or killed during the mission, and President Trump claimed the operation had been in the works for several weeks.\n\nIn response to al-Baghdadi's death, Hannity called him an \"evil SOB,\" whom the might of the American military finally defeated. He wrote that The Washington Post needed to be \"educated\" about the horrors he perpetrated upon innocent people.\n\n\"An 'austere religious scholar'? 'Dead at 48'? No \u2014 he was cornered by the greatest, toughest, best military heroes on earth!! How about we killed the evil SOB. This is exactly why America will never trust these mainstream corrupt fake news outlets ever again,\" Hannity tweeted.\n\nCNN and Jake Tapper \"applauded\" President Trump for his performance during the press conference following al-Baghdadi's death.\n\nHannity also claimed ISIS forces took pleasure in torturing their victims and shamed The Washington Post for trying to paint al-Baghdadi as anything other than a terrorist.\n\n\"ISIS terrorists take pleasure in beheadings and burning people alive in cages. They use cars and trucks to mow down innocent people. To describe Al-Baghdadi as an 'austere religious scholar' is sick and repulsive,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Regarding our al-Baghdadi obituary, the headline should never have read that way and we changed it quickly,\" Washington Post Vice President of Communications Kristine Coratti Kelly told Fox News earlier.",
    " Title: Janet Napolitano Resigns as Homeland Security Chief, Accepts Position as President of University of California\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement released on Friday, Janet Napolitano, the long-serving head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), announced her resignation to take up a new role as president of the University of California. Napolitano, a former Arizona governor, has led the DHS since the start of the Obama administration.\n\nNapolitano, who has been with the DHS for more than four years, stated that her tenure at the department had been a highlight of her professional career. She praised the dedication of the department's employees and their efforts to protect the American public from harm.\n\nNapolitano's departure from the DHS is not immediate, with officials telling Fox News that she does not plan to leave until September. However, the move was announced earlier after it began to be reported in the media, with Napolitano revealing that she had been nominated to lead the California university system.\n\nNapolitano's tenure at the DHS has been marked by controversy, with complaints from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents regarding the department's alleged failure to properly enforce immigration law. The agents' complaints center on the practice of using \"prosecutorial discretion\" - a policy that allows department lawyers to selectively determine which immigrants to pursue for deportation and which to let go.\n\nNapolitano's department later enacted a Dream Act-style policy, giving young illegal immigrants a reprieve. The news of her departure reportedly caught Napolitano's staff by surprise.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), one of Napolitano's chief critics, described her tenure at the DHS as \"defined by a consistent disrespect for the rule of law.\" The California university system announced Napolitano's nomination for president on Friday morning, with the Board of Regents set to vote next Thursday. If confirmed, Napolitano will be the first female president of the university.\n\nPresident Obama praised Napolitano's service in a written statement, highlighting her work in responding to natural disasters and securing the nation's borders. Obama also commended Napolitano for her efforts to make the immigration system fairer and more consistent with American values.",
    " Title: U.S. Surpasses Pre-Recession Jobs Total, but Recovery Remains Sluggish, Analysts Warn\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States reached a significant milestone on Friday, as the latest monthly jobs report from the government revealed that the country has surpassed the number of jobs it held before the recession began. The gain of 217,000 jobs brought the total U.S. payroll number to nearly 138.5 million jobs.\n\nHowever, analysts caution that the recovery has taken more than six years and has left many workers behind. The labor-force participation rate, a key indicator of labor market activity, remained steady at 62.8% in May, near its lowest levels since the late 1970s.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 217,000 in May, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.3%. May marked the fourth consecutive month of payroll gains of at least 200,000, a feat not achieved since September 1999 to January 2000.\n\nEconomists had expected an increase in payrolls of around 210,000 jobs, according to a Dow Jones survey, and a slight rise in the unemployment rate to 6.4%.\n\nDespite the milestone, analysts tell NPR's John Ydstie that the jobs recovery is not a cause for celebration. They note that the recovery has been the longest since before World War II, and while job growth has been steady, it has been too slow to absorb young workers who have come of age since 2007 and to help millions of other people who were laid off.\n\nHeidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute told John in his report on Morning Edition that the U.S. should have added around 7 million jobs in the time since the recession began. \"So, just getting back to where we were before the recession began nearly 6 1/2 years ago leaves us in a really big hole,\" she said.\n\nEconomists say some of the problems that are still holding the economy back include weak consumer demand that has crimped hiring plans, as well as employers who cannot find workers with the right skills for their job openings.\n\nThe picture has been bleak in California's San Joaquin Valley, where NPR's Kelly McEvers reports that the dominant farm economy is blamed for low wages that leave workers unable to contribute to new growth in an area where unemployment rates are double the national average.",
    " Title: Gulf States' Inaction on Syrian Refugee Crisis Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nFive of the wealthiest Muslim countries on the Arabian Peninsula, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain, have not accepted a single refugee from Syria, citing the risk of terrorism as their reason. This contrasts sharply with the United Kingdom, which has donated more than Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar combined, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).\n\nThe Syrian civil war has displaced between 10 and 12 million people, with most remaining within Syria's borders, but around four million fleeing to neighboring countries, primarily Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon, and beyond. Lebanon, which hosts 1.1 million Syrian refugees, closed its borders to Syrians in June of last year, followed by Jordan, which hosts another 630,000, in August.\n\nAs Europe grapples with the influx of Syrian refugees, it has been noted that the aforementioned Gulf States have not taken in a single refugee. Instead, they have opted to donate aid to those affected by the crisis. The UAE, for instance, has funded a refugee camp in Jordan housing tens of thousands of Syrians, while Saudi Arabia and Qatar have donated funds, food, shelter, and clothing to Syrians in Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan.\n\nHowever, the total donations from the Gulf States are estimated to be less than a quarter of America's $2.8 billion and a fraction of the $65 billion they spent on defense in 2012 alone. The UK has handed over \u00a3920 million so far, but the Prime Minister pledged to increase that figure to \u00a31 billion and take in thousands more refugees.\n\nThe inaction of the Gulf States has been met with criticism, with Sherif Elsayid-Ali, Amnesty International's Head of Refugee and Migrants' Rights, calling it \"shameful.\" He stated, \"The records of Gulf countries are absolutely appalling, in terms of actually showing compassion and sharing the responsibility of this crisis... It is a disgrace.\"\n\nTwenty-five years ago, hundreds of thousands of Kuwaitis fleeing Saddam Hussein's invasion were given refuge. Arabian expert Sultan Sooud al-Qassemi noted, \"In Abu Dhabi, the government rented out entire apartment blocks and gave them to families for free.\"\n\nThe Gulf States' stance has sparked criticism on social media, with tweets calling for them to open their borders to Syrian refugees. Arabian expert Sultan Sooud al-Qassemi tweeted, \"Damn it, open the door to # Syria refugees you apathetic bums\" Rich Arab countries to European Union.\n\nThe Gulf States' inaction has been defended by some who argue that they are fulfilling their humanitarian obligations through aid donations. However, others, like al-Qassemi, argue that their wealth and influence confer on them a moral obligation to accept refugees. Al-Qassemi stated, \"The Gulf States have emerged as the nerve centres of Arab diplomacy, culture, media production, commerce, and tourism, amassing an unprecedented degree of soft power unrivalled in the region and beyond.\"\n\nHe further argued, \"But with great power comes great responsibility. The Gulf must realize that now is the time to change their policy regarding accepting refugees from the Syria crisis. It is the moral, ethical, and responsible step to take.\"",
    " Title: US, UK, and France Prepare for Potential Military Strike on Syria Amidst Alleged Chemical Attack; Russia Warns of Response\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions between the United States, Russia, and Syria escalated this week as President Donald Trump threatened to fire missiles at Syria in response to an alleged chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Douma near Damascus on Saturday. In a series of tweets, Mr. Trump referred to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as a \"gas killing animal\" and warned Russia to \"get ready\" for the missiles. Senior Russian figures have threatened to respond to any US strikes.\n\nThe Syrian government denies mounting a chemical attack, but the US, UK, and France have agreed to work together and are believed to be preparing for a military strike in response to the alleged chemical attack. President Trump cancelled his first official trip to Latin America to focus on Syria, suggesting a larger military operation may be imminent.\n\nHowever, following President Trump's early morning tweets on Wednesday, other administration figures struck a more circumspect note. Defense Secretary James Mattis said the US was still assessing the chemical attack and that the US military stood ready to provide military options if they are appropriate as the president determines. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said a final decision had not been made, and \"all options remain on the table.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said any strikes would target \"the regime's chemical capabilities.\" In the UK, Prime Minister Theresa May is reportedly prepared to join military action in Syria without seeking parliamentary consent first. A US Navy guided-missile destroyer, the USS Donald Cook, is in the Mediterranean Sea, and there are reports that Russian battleships have left the country's naval base in the Syrian port city of Tartus.\n\nOpposition activists and rescuers claim government aircraft dropped bombs filled with toxic chemicals on Douma, the last major rebel stronghold near the capital Damascus. The Syrian-American Medical Society (SAMS), which operates in rebel-held areas, and local aid workers say more than 500 people have been treated for symptoms \"indicative of exposure to a chemical agent.\"\n\nThe UN's World Health Organization has demanded access to verify reports from its partners that 70 people have died, including 43 who showed \"symptoms consistent with exposure to highly toxic chemicals.\" A team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is due to deploy to Syria \"shortly\" to determine whether banned weapons were used.\n\nDouma was under renewed assault from Syrian and Russian forces last week. Rebels have now been evacuating the town under an agreement involving the Russian military. The Syrian government has described the reports of the chemical attack as a \"provocation\" designed to justify Western intervention against its ally. It said on Wednesday that samples taken from the site had not revealed any chemical substances.\n\nSenior Russian figures have warned of a Russian response to a US attack. On Wednesday, Alexander Zasypkin, Moscow's ambassador to Lebanon, repeated a warning by the head of the military that missiles would be shot down and their launch sites targeted if they threatened the lives of Russian personnel. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova asked whether the aim of Western strikes might be \"to quickly remove the traces of the provocation... so international inspectors will have nothing to look for in terms of evidence.\"\n\nAddressing new ambassadors in Moscow, President Vladimir Putin said he hoped common sense would prevail and that the situation would stabilize. Mr. Putin said Russia would \"keep all its international obligations in full.\"",
    " Title: China's Economic Slowdown: A Closer Look at the World's Second-Largest Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent months, economic growth in China has experienced a significant slowdown, surprising many experts and prompting concerns about the future of the world's second-largest economy. Last week, for the first time since the depths of the global financial crisis, the government reduced lending rates in an attempt to stimulate growth.\n\nThe economic outlook has been grim, with analysts describing a \"cloud\" hanging over China's previously booming economy. In May, consumer prices fell below government targets, and this week, the head of a Chinese government think tank predicted growth from April through June could drop below 7 percent.\n\nWeakness has been evident in various sectors, including air travel. Brian Pearce, the chief economist at the International Air Transport Association, reported that air travel in China has been significantly impacted. \"For a number of years, we were seeing growth rates of 15, 20 percent,\" he said in Beijing, where he was attending the association's annual conference. \"That seems to have slowed down quite sharply over the last year, and we're seeing growth rates down to single figures, which is quite strong for most markets, but for China, that's a pretty weak outcome.\"\n\nMost travel in China is for business, and many businesspeople are anxious. \"Confidence has been weaker, particularly among smaller businesses,\" Pearce said. \"Also, export business has weakened.\" China has seen exports to Europe fall sharply due to problems in Europe.\n\nThe government has tightened its grip in two key areas: the housing market and public infrastructure construction. When discussing China's economy, people often focus on exports. However, most of the factors contributing to the current decline are domestic.\n\nAndy Rothman, China macro-strategist for CLSA, an independent brokerage and investment group, believes the slowdown predicted by the Communist Party is underway. Rothman explains that China's blistering growth is no longer sustainable. The government has been trying to slow it down and improve its quality, but the problem, he says, is that the Communist Party overdid it.\n\nThe government's restrictions on real estate sales to curb sky-high prices also affected demand for goods like steel and concrete, hurting factories. The government is now taking steps to encourage home buying and approving new public projects to help stabilize the economy. Last month, home sales picked up in major cities.\n\nIf the government does not implement reforms, China's economy will remain in a structural downshift for an extended period. Ren Xianfeng, a senior analyst with IHS Global Insight in Beijing, is optimistic about the next six months but pessimistic about the medium and long term. She believes China needs to build a more innovative economy, one that favors private firms and provides more financing for them, as they create most of the jobs in China.\n\nAfter decades of remarkable growth, a prolonged structural downshift would be a significant shock\u2014one that no one wants to see.",
    " Title: Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr Sells Off Significant Portion of Stocks Amidst Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has raised eyebrows, the powerful chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard Burr, sold off a substantial portion of his stocks on February 13, unloading between $628,000 and $1.72 million of his holdings in 33 separate transactions.\n\nAs the head of the intelligence committee, Burr, a North Carolina Republican, has access to the government's most highly classified information about threats to America's security. His committee was receiving daily coronavirus briefings around this time, according to a Reuters story.\n\nA week after Burr's sales, the stock market began a sharp decline and has lost about 30% since. On Thursday, Burr came under fire after NPR obtained a secret recording from February 27, in which the lawmaker gave a VIP group at an exclusive social club a much more dire preview of the economic impact of the coronavirus than what he had told the public.\n\nBurr's spokesperson stated, \"Senator Burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak.\" The spokesperson added, \"As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy.\"\n\nBurr is not a particularly wealthy member of the Senate, with a net worth estimated at $1.7 million in 2018, indicating that the February sales significantly shaped his financial fortunes and spared him from some of the pain that many Americans are now facing.\n\nBurr was one of the authors of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, which shapes the nation's response to public health threats like the coronavirus. Burr's office did not respond to requests for comment about what sort of briefing materials, if any, on the coronavirus threat Burr may have seen as chair of the intelligence committee before his selling spree.\n\nAccording to the NPR report, Burr told attendees of the luncheon held at the Capitol Hill Club, \"There's one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history... It is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.\"\n\nHe warned that companies might have to curtail their employees' travel, that schools could close, and that the military might be mobilized to compensate for overwhelmed hospitals. The luncheon was organized by the Tar Heel Circle, a club for businesses and organizations in North Carolina that are charged up to $10,000 for membership and are promised \"interaction with top leaders and staff from Congress, the administration, and the private sector.\"\n\nBurr's public comments had been considerably less dire. In a February 7 op-ed that he co-authored with another senator, he assured the public that \"the United States today is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats, like the coronavirus.\" He wrote, \"No matter the outbreak or threat, Congress and the federal government have been vigilant in identifying gaps in its readiness efforts and improving its response capabilities.\"\n\nMembers of Congress are required by law to disclose their securities transactions. Burr was one of just three senators who in 2012 opposed the bill that explicitly barred lawmakers and their staff from using nonpublic information for trades and required regular disclosure of those trades. In opposing the bill, Burr argued at the time that insider trading laws already applied to members of Congress. President Barack Obama signed the bill, known as the STOCK Act, that year.\n\nStock transactions of lawmakers are reported in ranges. Burr's February 13 selling spree was his largest stock selling day of at least the past 14 months, according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 review of Senate records. Unlike his typical disclosure reports, which are a mix of sales and purchases, all of the transactions were sales.\n\nHis biggest sales included companies that are among the most vulnerable to an economic slowdown. He dumped up to $150,000 worth of shares of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, a chain based in the United States that has lost two-thirds of its value. And he sold up to $100,000 of shares of Extended Stay America, an economy hospitality chain. Shares of that company are now worth less than half of what they did at the time Burr sold.\n\nThe assets come from accounts that are held by Burr, belong to his spouse, or are jointly held.",
    " Title: \"David Horowitz's Battle Plan for Defeating the Left: A Neutral Analysis of Political Strategies in the 2016 Election\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the midterm elections are expected to favor the Republican party, but the 2016 presidential race is a different story, according to political commentator David Horowitz. Horowitz argues that the Democratic party, now identified as a party of the left, is driven by ideology rather than pragmatism, which could lead to their downfall in the midterms. However, during the upswing, ideological passion can win over gullible majorities, as demonstrated by Barack Obama's 2008 presidential victory.\n\nHorowitz criticizes Obama's presidency, stating that his promises of change and transformation were baseless and deceptive. He accuses Obama of being a lifelong anti-American radical and a world-class liar, and argues that his policies have led to economic stagnation, a struggling healthcare system, border issues, and a power vacuum on the global stage.\n\nLooking ahead to the 2016 election, Horowitz predicts that Republicans will focus on policy and avoid attacking Democrats on personal grounds, while Democrats will likely do the opposite. He suggests that Democrats will use moral indictments to attack Republicans, portraying them as racists, sexists, homophobes, and enemies of the poor. In response, Horowitz argues that Republicans must counter with equally potent moral indictments of the Democratic party's moral character.\n\nHorowitz, the author of \"Take No Prisoners: The Battle Plan for Defeating the Left,\" emphasizes the importance of attacking opponents before they attack you, and of using a moral indictment to win the day. He warns that even if Republicans fail to do this, Democrats will certainly do it to them.\n\nIn conclusion, Horowitz's analysis suggests that the 2016 election will be a battle of moral indictments, with both parties using their respective ideologies to attack the other. It is a call for Republicans to be prepared to fight fire with fire, and to understand that politics is a street war with no referees to maintain the rules.",
    " Title: Russia Increases Military Presence in Syria, Raises Questions Over Objectives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant escalation of its military involvement in Syria, Russia launched a naval bombardment on Wednesday, targeting ISIS positions, according to a senior Russian official. The strikes, which originated from the Caspian Sea, were carried out using long-range missiles that traveled over 930 miles to their targets.\n\nThe strikes, if confirmed, could mark a new phase in Russia's military cooperation with the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Coordinated attacks were reported on Wednesday in Hama and Idlib provinces in western Syria, with Russian airstrikes seemingly coordinated with Syrian shelling, according to an opposition group.\n\nRussia's actions have raised questions about the true objectives of its military intervention in Syria. While Russia claims its primary goal is to fight terrorism, the focus on Syrian targets rather than ISIS positions could suggest a more significant role in propping up the Assad regime.\n\nDespite the ongoing strikes, Russia has expressed a willingness to cooperate with the United States in Syria, a proposition met with skepticism by U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, who described the Russian campaign in Syria as a \"fundamental mistake.\" The U.S. is not currently prepared to cooperate with Russia on operations in Syria, Carter said.\n\nRussian Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov, however, indicated that cooperation was a possibility. He suggested that Russia could use intelligence obtained by the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS, and called for all sides to share targeting reconnaissance.\n\nTensions between Russian and U.S. forces in Syrian airspace have also risen, with the U.S. military recently diverting one aircraft to maintain a safe distance from a Russian fighter. Until mutual flight safety rules are agreed upon, U.S. pilots are ordered to change their flight path if a Russian plane is within 20 nautical miles.\n\nReports from the ground suggest that Wednesday's clashes were the fiercest in the last month, with Russian warplanes conducting heavy airstrikes accompanied by government forces, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The head of the observatory reported that there were no ISIS positions in the targeted areas, and that fierce clashes were taking place between regime forces and armed Islamist rebel factions.\n\nSyria's ambassador to Russia, Riad Haddad, claimed that around 40% of ISIS infrastructure had been destroyed since Moscow's military operation began. However, Turkey, Syria's neighbor to the north, has cast doubt on Russia's focus on ISIS, with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu stating that only 3.5% of Russia's airstrikes in Syria so far have targeted the terror group.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg condemned Russia's incursion into Turkish airspace, and expressed concern that Russia is not primarily targeting ISIS but instead attacking the Syrian opposition and civilians. The latest U.S. assessment indicates that Russia has moved ground combat weapons and troops to areas of western Syria where anti-regime forces are, according to two American defense officials.\n\nThe developments come a day after NATO's secretary general expressed alarm over Russia's growing military presence in Syria, including ground troops, combat planes, air defense systems, and naval assets.

The interview took place on Friday, following a rapid COVID-19 test for the reporter, which came back negative.\n\nDuring the interview, Pence expressed optimism about the nation's future, stating, \"We're seeing real progress.\" He suggested that if Americans continue to adhere to social distancing guidelines, the country could be in a \"very different place\" by the end of April, allowing for recommendations to be made for a return to normalcy.\n\nPence acknowledged that the federal government initially struggled with testing due to bureaucratic red tape, but he emphasized that the administration is now working closely with the private sector to improve testing capabilities. He highlighted the development of a new, rapid 15-minute test by Abbott Laboratories, which the administration aims to make available nationwide.\n\nRegarding religious services, Pence acknowledged that most places of worship have complied with social distancing guidelines, keeping their doors closed. He commended the faith community for their resilience, stating, \"Our churches and synagogues and communities of faith across America have risen to the challenge.\" However, he also addressed the small number of churches that have continued to hold in-person services, citing a biblical perspective.\n\nPence encouraged continued financial support for places of worship during this critical time, emphasizing the importance of their ongoing ministry. He also highlighted the government's efforts to provide financial aid to families and small businesses, with direct payments to families of four expected by next week and thousands of small businesses enrolled in the paycheck protection program.\n\nDespite ongoing debates in Congress, Pence praised the bipartisan cooperation he has seen so far. He acknowledged that there would be further debates in the days ahead, particularly on the issue of nationwide mail-in balloting. However, he did not reveal the administration's specific plans on this matter.\n\nAs the leader of the Coronavirus Task Force, Pence expressed confidence that the country would eventually overcome the pandemic, stating, \"There will indeed be light at the end of this very dark and tumultuous tunnel.\"",
    " Title: Alaska Lawmakers Approve $55 Million Fund to Prevent Obamacare Collapse in State\n\nAlaska, a state known for its conservative political leanings, is taking unprecedented steps to prevent the collapse of its Obamacare insurance marketplace. The state legislature, predominantly Republican, has passed a bill to establish a $55 million fund to subsidize enrollees' costs as the state grapples with Obamacare price spikes and the departure of all but one insurance company.\n\nThe bill, originally proposed by Governor Bill Walker, is awaiting his signature. The legislation, which sets up the fund from an existing tax on all insurance companies, aims to ensure that the 23,000 Alaskans enrolled in exchange plans will not lose their insurance.\n\nThe remaining insurer, Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield, was left as the sole company planning to sell coverage next year after Moda Health announced its withdrawal from the Alaska exchange. The $55 million fund, which will help cover medical expenses for high-cost enrollees, is a response to the state's urgent need to prevent premiums from spiraling out of control and to avoid thousands of people losing their coverage.\n\nThe fund's creation has sparked criticism from some lawmakers due to Alaska's massive budget deficit, as the money currently goes into the state's general fund. However, Republican state lawmakers argue they were left with little choice but to approve the fund as insurers pulled out of the state.\n\nState Senator Cathy Giessel stated, \"Rather than leaving these folks out hanging, we had to do something.\" State Representative Lance Pruitt added, \"It really came down to: There's not much really I think we could do because it's the law of the land right now.\"\n\nThe Medicaid expansion lawsuit, initially filed by Republican state lawmakers, was dismissed by one court earlier this year, and lawmakers are considering whether to appeal. The state's efforts reflect a pragmatic approach to the political conundrum facing Obamacare critics: how to address the issue of people losing benefits or constituents crying foul as insurers flee a failing marketplace.\n\nAlaska's unique demographic realities, including a relatively small population with some of the highest health care costs in the nation, have contributed to the state's struggles with Obamacare. Just a few especially sick patients have put a strain on insurers, with nearly 500 enrollees with severe medical conditions costing Alaska insurers about $59 million in less than two years, according to state documents.\n\nIf approved by the governor, the insurance fund will go into effect on June 30. The legislation also authorizes Alaska to apply for an Obamacare waiver that allows states to change pieces of the federal law starting in 2017 as long as those reforms meet certain requirements.\n\nIn conclusion, Alaska's efforts to prevent the collapse of its Obamacare insurance marketplace reflect a pragmatic approach to addressing the challenges posed by the Affordable Care Act in a state with some of the highest health care costs in the nation. The $55 million fund, if approved, will help ensure that the state's residents continue to have access to health insurance.",
    " Title: Op-Ed: A Case for Bernie Sanders as the Preferred Democratic Presidential Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing race for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, I endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders. While I respect Joe Biden, his opponent, as a decent individual, my allegiance lies with Sanders. This endorsement is not a mere political preference but a strategic decision aimed at ensuring the removal of President Donald Trump from office in November.\n\nPolls consistently show that Sanders leads Trump, often with a more significant margin than other contenders. Sanders boasts the highest popular approval rating among any public official in America. This is not due to his warm and fuzzy persona but rather his reputation for honesty and credibility, two essential attributes in countering a constant liar like Trump.\n\nSanders' history, vision, and platform make him the most capable of defeating Trump. He can expose Trump's false populism, challenge his broken promises on trade, and reveal the reality that the economy, despite Trump's claims, does not work for most Americans.\n\nSanders champions an agenda that addresses the fundamental challenges facing working people. This includes Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, tuition-free college, a $15 minimum wage, and comprehensive immigration reform, among other progressive policies.\n\nIn the face of Trump, inspiring young people to vote in large numbers is crucial. Sanders is the only candidate who has inspired a new generation and earned their overwhelming support. The Democratic Party cannot defeat Trump without this youthful energy.\n\nHistorically, moderate, establishment candidates have not fared well. Candidates like Walter Mondale, Mike Dukakis, and Hillary Clinton have fallen short. The Democrats triumph when they unite the working class and the middle class, stand for diversity against division, and fight for the poor against greed. No candidate has forged this coalition better than Bernie Sanders.\n\nIn the context of the 2020 campaign, African American voters are often referred to as the \"black firewall.\" Dr. Martin Luther King would ask a simple question: What will be the return on the firewall's investment? With the exception of Native Americans, African Americans are the most economically and socially distressed demographic in the United States. Sanders' progressive policies offer the best chance for African Americans to catch up.\n\nBiden is a decent man, but his record differs significantly from Sanders'. While Sanders champions progressive policies, Biden has a more moderate stance, supporting figures like Clarence Thomas, the Crime Bill, and the Iraq War, among other conservative stances.\n\nIn conclusion, Sanders, often labeled a radical, represents the moral center. Health care for all, tuition-free college, and a Middle East policy that recognizes both Israel and Palestine are the moral center. I stand with Sanders not only because he stood with me in 1988 but because he stands with working people across this country.",
    " Title: Pope Francis' Irish Visit Marred by Abuse Scandals and Vatican Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nPope Francis' two-day visit to Ireland, aimed at addressing family issues and strengthening Catholic ties, has been overshadowed by the ongoing sexual abuse scandals within the Church and a controversial letter from a former Vatican official accusing the Pope of ignoring abuse allegations against a senior U.S. cardinal.\n\nIn front of 45,000 supporters at the rain-soaked Knock shrine in the west of Ireland, the Pope sought forgiveness for the \"open wound\" of the church's sexual abuse scandal and demanded \"firm and decisive\" measures to find \"truth and justice.\" At a later Mass to tens of thousands of flag-waving worshippers at Dublin's Phoenix Park, the showpiece event of the visit, he also confessed to other abuses by the Irish church, including at its so-called \"mother and baby\" homes.\n\nHowever, around 5,000 abuse victims and their supporters braved the weather to attend the \"Stand for Truth\" rally in the city centre. A woman dressed as a nun, with fake blood on her hands, and a man handing out homemade placards reading \"the church protects pederasts\" were among those protesting.\n\n\"I think it's obviously causing quite a lot of distress,\" said abuse victim and campaigner William Gorry. \"Healing is something that's going to take a long, long time if it's going to happen at all.\"\n\nThe scandal has intensified overnight with a former Vatican envoy to the US, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, accusing Francis of personally ignoring sexual abuse claims against prominent US cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who was forced to resign last month. Vigano wrote in a letter published in the National Catholic Register that he had told Francis of the allegations in 2013, but that he had responded by lifting sanctions imposed on McCarrick by his predecessor, Pope Benedict.\n\n\"He (Pope Francis) knew from at least June 23, 2013 that McCarrick was a serial predator,\" wrote Vigano, adding \"he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end.\" The Vatican has not commented on the claims.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Saturday directly urged the Pope to take action against abuses and ensure justice for victims worldwide. \"Holy Father, I ask that you use your office and influence to ensure that this is done here in Ireland and across the world,\" he said, calling the scandals a \"stain\" on the church and state.\n\nThe Pope met eight abuse victims on Saturday, including a woman assaulted by a priest when she was in hospital aged 13. Paul Jude Redmond, who was illegally adopted from a Church-run \"mother and baby\" home because his mother was unmarried, also met the Pope. He said the pontiff appeared \"genuinely shocked\" by the stories of abuse.\n\nHowever, at a news conference in Dublin by the group Ending Clergy Abuse (ECA), victim Mark Vincent Healey said the Pope's speech in Dublin was a \"total missed opportunity.\" \"We're still waiting. We're left with uncertain silence. When is he going to act? What is he going to do?\"\n\nThe pontiff is in Ireland to close the 2018 World Meeting of Families (WMOF) - a global Catholic gathering that addressed issues including the treatment of gay people in the Church. It is the first papal visit to Ireland since John Paul II spoke in front of 1.5 million people during a visit in 1979.\n\nThe Church's role and standing has been badly dented by the abuse scandals, and the Irish have shed traditional Catholic mores, voting earlier this year to legalise abortion after approving same-sex marriage in 2015. In Tuam, a town in western Ireland not far from Knock, hundreds joined in a silent vigil on Sunday in solidarity with victims of the \"mother and baby\" homes - institutions accused of being punishment hostels for unwed pregnant women.\n\nMultiple probes in Ireland have found Church leaders protected hundreds of predatory priests and former Irish president Mary McAleese revealed this month that the Vatican had sought to keep Church documents inaccessible to government investigators. The abuse scandals in Ireland are part of a worldwide crisis for the Vatican. A devastating report earlier this month accused more than 300 priests in the US state of Pennsylvania of abusing more than 1,000 children since the 1950s. The Pope is due to head back to Rome late Sunday.",
    " Title: Obama and Boehner Face Impasse Over Fiscal Cliff Deal as Tax Increases Loom\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the deadline for averting the fiscal cliff approaches, President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House John Boehner find themselves at an impasse in their efforts to reach a compromise on tax rates and spending cuts. The standoff could result in tax increases for all taxpayers beginning January 1, with most Americans blaming the Republican party if no deal is reached.\n\nThe situation is such that a fallback measure proposed by Mr. Obama could only pass in the House with strong support from Democrats, as conservative Republicans have signaled their opposition to any legislation that raises tax rates for more than 1% of Americans. The intense pressure on Mr. Boehner to allow a vote on a compromise is mounting, but doing so could threaten his already weakened speakership among conservatives.\n\nPresident Obama, backed by Congressional Democrats, is proposing to extend the Bush tax rates permanently for all income below $250,000 per year. In negotiations with Mr. Boehner, he had tentatively agreed to raise that threshold to $400,000, and Congressional Democrats have indicated they would go as high as $500,000 if it would seal a deal with Republicans. However, the rejection of Mr. Boehner's bill by Republicans on Thursday indicates that such a concession by Democrats would not sway the antitax absolutists among them.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has given no public indication whether he would support the stripped-down bill, and it remains unclear when or whether Mr. Boehner will call the House back into session. A spokesman for Mr. Boehner said late Friday that the speaker would return to Washington after the holiday \"ready to find a solution that can pass both houses of Congress.\"\n\nThe possible fallback plan, as described by Democrats on Capitol Hill, would extend the Bush-era tax rates for income below $250,000, increase the tax rate for capital gains and dividend income to 20% from 15%, and extend some other tax breaks. The new bill would also delay the so-called sequester in January - across-the-board spending cuts in military and domestic programs that were scheduled as an incentive for the two sides to approve an alternative, more deliberate deficit-reduction compromise. Additionally, it would extend federal unemployment benefits for the estimated two million Americans who have been out of a job for long enough to exhaust their initial state aid.\n\nWhile the measure would not put efforts in motion to achieve additional deficit reduction through overhauls of the tax code and spending for fast-growing entitlement programs, such as Medicare, the upshot is that, for a second year, Mr. Obama has been unable to reach agreement with Mr. Boehner on a debt-reduction framework that would stabilize the nation's debt, which is growing unsustainably as the population ages and medical costs rise. Nor would the measure extend the nation's borrowing limit, which the Treasury will hit early in 2013.\n\nBy his resort to the stripped-down legislative option, Mr. Obama demonstrated that his and his party's priority is to prevent the Bush tax cuts from expiring for most Americans. However, he might be forfeiting some leverage in the coming fiscal battles early next year over extending the debt limit. Many Republicans are threatening to withhold support for increasing that limit without Mr. Obama's agreement to deep reductions in spending for Medicare and Social Security. By both sides' reckoning, Mr. Obama would have a strong hand in the debt limit debate if it remained tied to the tax issue, given Republicans' zeal to avoid tax increases.\n\n\"With their votes, the American people have determined that governing is a shared responsibility between both parties,\" Mr. Obama said. \"In this Congress, laws can only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans. And that means nobody gets 100% of what they want.\"",
    " Title: U.S.-China Trade Deal: Skepticism Surrounds \"Phase One\" Agreement Amidst Lack of Specifics and Verification Mechanisms\n\nArticle:\n\nThe much-anticipated U.S.-China \"Phase One\" trade deal, announced by the White House last week, has been met with skepticism due to the lack of specifics and clear verification mechanisms. The agreement, which is yet to be officially translated into English, has raised questions about the common understanding of key terms in both languages, and the reliability of China's commitment to its promises, given its history of flouting previous agreements.\n\nWhile the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office has provided details about U.S. tariff reductions, there is a conspicuous absence of specifics regarding China's own pledges. The agreement does not specify what China will purchase from the United States, the timeline for these purchases, or the amount of U.S. agriculture imports China is expected to increase, leaving these terms vague and open to interpretation.\n\nThe deal also lacks details about structural reforms and changes to China's economic and trade regime in areas such as intellectual property, technology transfer, agriculture, financial services, and currency and foreign exchange. These issues are considered challenging to address diplomatically, and the administration's focus on a shorter-term, interim agreement suggests that genuine breakthroughs may be difficult to achieve.\n\nFurthermore, the agreement does not provide any indication of a \"strong dispute resolution system that ensures prompt implementation and enforcement.\" The absence of a clear mechanism for judging Chinese compliance and meting out punishment for broken agreements raises concerns that the deal may not be beneficial for U.S.-based producers, particularly in the areas of employment and intellectual property.\n\nThe political implications of the U.S.-China trade deal are also puzzling. China's economy has been more significantly impacted by the trade war than the U.S., and the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will help offset some of the China-related losses for agriculture-heavy states crucial to President Trump's re-election hopes. Additionally, the impeachment battle and the weak Democratic presidential candidates have made this an inopportune time for Trump to reach any deal with China.\n\nIn light of these factors, it is suggested that the U.S. should maintain pressure on China, keep tariffs in place, and signal to American businesses that major tariffs on China are likely to remain for the foreseeable future. The only reasons for optimism on the U.S.-China trade front are the likelihood of the deal's collapse due to its tentative nature and the ongoing process of U.S.-China decoupling in technology and national security sectors.",
    " Title: Tense Relations Between U.S. and Russia Over Edward Snowden's Asylum Request May Affect G-20 Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing standoff between the United States and Russia over the asylum request of former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden has created a potential roadblock for a scheduled meeting between President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin. With Snowden currently residing at a Moscow airport, Obama is reportedly considering cancelling the meeting, which was set for June, according to The New York Times.\n\nTensions between the two leaders remain high as Obama seeks a return of Snowden, while Putin contemplates allowing the government security whistleblower to stay in Russia. This escalating situation adds to the growing tension between the U.S. and Russia, amid broader concerns over arms negotiations, missile defense programs, and strategies regarding Syria and Iran, as reported by The New York Times.\n\nInitially, Obama had planned to visit Russia as part of a trip to St. Petersburg for the Group of 20 (G-20) nations. White House spokesman Jay Carney, when asked about the proposed trip, stated, \"I can say that the president intends to travel to Russia for the G-20 summit. I don\u2019t have anything to add to what we\u2019ve said in the past about that trip.\"\n\nPutin, who has criticized the U.S. over the spying disclosures, said Wednesday that he does not wish to impede dialogue. \"Bilateral relations, in my opinion, are far more important than squabbles about the activities of the secret services,\" Putin said.\n\nCritics of the White House's handling of the Snowden affair have urged Obama to take a firmer stance in bringing him back, suggesting that he might even relocate the summit out of Russia altogether. Senator Lindsey Graham, speaking with CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday, encouraged Obama to be more assertive with Russia. He also suggested that Obama should boycott the 2014 Olympic Games set for Sochi. \"President Obama, should you go to St. Petersburg, Russia, for the G-20 summit if they give Snowden asylum and they don\u2019t change their policy toward Syria and continue to help Iran?\" Graham said on CNN. \"Should you go? My advice to you is I wouldn\u2019t go to St. Petersburg. I would ask for a change of venue.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Announces Executive Order for Paid Sick Leave for Federal Contractors, Expands Worker Protections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move towards expanding worker protections, President Barack Obama announced on Labor Day a new executive order requiring paid sick leave for federal contractors. The new regulation is expected to benefit approximately 300,000 workers who work on federal contracts, offering them up to seven days of paid sick leave annually.\n\nSpeaking at a Greater Boston Labor Council breakfast, Mr. Obama outlined the details of the new regulation, stating that the paid time off could be used for self-care, family care, or to address absences resulting from domestic violence or sexual assault. The provision is set to take effect in 2017, after Obama leaves office.\n\nIn addition to the paid sick leave announcement, the President also revealed that the Labor Department would publish a final rule this week prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against employees and job applicants who discuss their salaries. This move aims to promote pay transparency and make it easier for workers to recognize pay discrimination and seek appropriate remedies.\n\nThe President's pro-labor actions are part of a broader second-term push to address income inequality and declining economic mobility, a commitment he first made in a December 2011 speech in Osawatomie, Kan. Since his reelection, the pace of pro-labor action has increased significantly.\n\nOther recent pro-worker actions include new overtime regulations, a federal worker pay raise for 2016, and the upcoming Oct. 7 White House summit on worker voice. Last month, a federal court upheld Labor Department regulations that extend minimum-wage and overtime pay rules to most home-health workers. In June, the administration proposed to more than double the weekly salary threshold for overtime pay, a move that could make 5 million more workers entitled to overtime pay.\n\nThe President's steps to aid workers can be attributed to three motivating factors. First, after his first term, Obama became convinced that the Republican-controlled Congress would not approve the legislation he requested. As a result, the President began using executive orders to help federal workers and lay the groundwork for wider adoption in the future.\n\nSecond, in his 2014 State of the Union address, the President called for a \"year of action\" to build new ladders of economic opportunity. Third, improving conditions for workers also helps build a legacy for a President nearing the end of his term. Obama's early career was spent as a community organizer in Chicago with a special interest in helping those on the economic margins, so labor issues have a special resonance for him.\n\nThe spate of pro-worker actions also comes in the context of the labor movement being an important Democratic Party constituency in the 2016 presidential election. It would clearly help protect Obama's legacy if a Democratic president followed him. However, White House relations with labor could use some attention. Labor leaders are unhappy with the 12-nation Asia-Pacific trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that the White House has negotiated. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka is sharply critical of the pace at which the White House has acted on workplace safety regulations.\n\nAt the recent breakfast, Trumka also criticized Hillary Clinton's strategy of not being specific about her views on the TPP trade deal. \"Candidates that try to skirt the issues, not talking about where you are on TPP, hurt you when it comes to activating the membership and the general populace,\" he said. \"They want to know where people are even if they disagree with you.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Pressures Senate Republicans on Supreme Court Nominee as Democrats Shift Focus to Senate Control\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a strategic move, President Barack Obama conducted a series of interviews with television stations from six states with Republican senators running for re-election, as he seeks to pressure the Senate Republican leadership to schedule a confirmation hearing for his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. The interviews, which took place on Monday, were aimed at compelling the Senate to act on Judge Garland's nomination, which has been stalled for seven weeks.\n\nThe states in question are Arizona, Iowa, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Wisconsin, all of which have incumbent Republican senators. The president's media blitz is intended to force the Senate Republican leadership to hold a confirmation hearing and vote on Judge Garland.\n\nMeanwhile, a government watchdog group, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, has requested Judge Garland to authorize the release of his office of professional responsibility records from his tenure at the Justice Department during the Clinton administration. In a letter to Judge Garland, foundation director Matthew G. Whitaker stated that Americans \"need to know whether any such records exist and to examine existing records in order to evaluate your qualifications to serve as a Supreme Court Justice.\"\n\nDuring the George W. Bush administration, Senate Democrats used a similar issue as justification for blocking the nomination of conservative lawyer Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Democrats insisted on withholding a final vote until the White House released Mr. Estrada's working papers from his time at the Clinton Justice Department. The Bush administration refused to release those memos, and Mr. Estrada was also part of the legal team for Mr. Bush that fought the Florida recount in the contested 2000 presidential election.\n\nDemocrats point to polling that shows Republicans such as Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa losing support in their home states for supporting the blockade of Judge Garland's nomination. In a conference call organized by White House allies, pollster Geoff Garin of Hart Research stated that Mr. Grassley's favorability ratings have fallen from 60 percent in 2014 to 42 percent in late April. His negative ratings have risen over the same period from 19 percent to 30 percent, Mr. Garin said, attributing the fall to Mr. Grassley's refusal to hold a confirmation hearing for the nominee.\n\nIn the survey, 44 percent of respondents said they are less likely to support Mr. Grassley in November because he is blocking the Garland nomination. The polling, funded by the Constitutional Responsibility Project and the League of Conservation Voters, found that 60 percent of Iowa voters, including 63 percent of independents, agree with the conclusion that Mr. Grassley is allowing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to dictate the Senate Republican position on the nomination, \"rather than acting as a leader as chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, said he is \"terribly disappointed\" in Mr. Grassley. Mr. Grassley has defended his stance against the Garland nomination as a principled move that will give voters in November a voice in choosing the direction of the court. Only two of the 54 Senate Republicans say Judge Garland should receive a confirmation hearing.\n\nConservative activists have expressed skepticism about Democrats' efforts to push for Judge Garland, with Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network, stating, \"The so-called 9-9-9 plan is really a desperate 9-1-1 call by liberals who will say and do anything to create the most liberal Supreme Court majority in decades.\" The Judicial Crisis Network is airing a $500,000 ad campaign over the Senate's recess in key states to call attention to Judge Garland's record.\n\nPresident Obama nominated Judge Garland, 63, in March to fill the vacancy created by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. He is chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and has received bipartisan praise for his qualifications. Conservatives worry that replacing the conservative justice with Judge Garland would shift the balance of power on the evenly divided court in favor of progressives for years to come.",
    " Title: Study Suggests Fake News May Have Influenced 2016 Presidential Election Outcome\n\nArticle:\n\nA team of researchers at Ohio State University has concluded in a new study that \"fake news\" stories may have had a significant impact on voters in the 2016 presidential election, potentially altering the final result. The study, first reported by The Washington Post on Tuesday, aimed to measure the degree to which false news stories may have dissuaded voters who cast ballots for President Obama in 2012 from voting for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe researchers, led by Richard Gunther, Paul A. Beck, and Erik C. Nisbet, emphasized that they could not definitively say that fake news \"caused\" Obama voters to defect from Clinton in 2016. However, they concluded that these stories had a \"substantial impact\" on voters that may have been sufficient to swing the election to Donald Trump.\n\nThe study found a significant correlation between belief in fake news statements and vote choice. Specifically, a much larger percentage of those Obama voters who did not believe any of the fake news statements voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 (89%) than those who believed one of the statements (61%) and those who believed two or three of them (17%).\n\nThe researchers conducted a YouGov survey in late 2016 and early 2017 of 585 voters who supported Obama in 2012 out of a total sample of 1,600. They asked voters questions that included fake news statements, two of which were negative about Clinton and one positive about Trump, and all of which were propagated by traditional and social media.\n\nUsing \"multivariate regression analysis,\" the researchers found that belief in the fake news statements still accounted for a significant portion of the defections when other factors were considered, including the extent to which voters disliked Clinton or liked Trump.\n\n\"Former Obama voters who believed one or more of these fake news stories were 3.9 times more likely to defect from the Democratic ticket in 2016 than those who did not believe any of the false claims, after taking into account all of these other factors,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThe study also noted that it is possible a voter first decided not to vote for Clinton, and then in turn cited false stories in order to rationalize their vote. The researchers said making a judgment about whether the fake stories determined the outcome of the election would have required a larger survey sample.\n\nThe study has not been published in an academic journal yet, but is expected to be published in the coming months. The extent to which Russia's activity influenced the outcome of the election has been a source of debate, with the U.S. intelligence community making no such judgment in its unclassified report on Russia's influence operation. Trump and members of his administration have insisted that Russia's efforts did not have any impact on the outcome of the election, while Clinton has blamed Russia, in part, for her loss.",
    " Title: High-Profile Feminism: A New Era of Gender Equality Advocacy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move towards gender equality, Emma Watson, the beloved actress and UN Women's Goodwill Ambassador, delivered a powerful speech at the United Nations, urging for a rebranding of the term \"feminism\" and inviting men to join the conversation. The speech, which received a standing ovation and has since gone viral, highlighted the importance of gender equality and the role of men in achieving it.\n\nWatson's speech, delivered in support of the UN's HeForShe campaign, focused on the need to stop violence against women and the importance of men taking an active role in promoting gender equality. The speech has sparked a renewed interest in the term \"feminism,\" with cultural icons such as Beyonc\u00e9 using their platforms to advocate for gender equality.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9, in a piece written last year, argued that \"equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect.\" The rebranding of feminism by these cultural luminaries is a positive step, but the question now is how to translate this high-profile advocacy into tangible gains for ordinary women and men.\n\nOne area where progress is sorely needed is in the media. Women are still underrepresented in editorial pages, with women's voices appearing a fraction of the time. Women are also depicted less frequently and less prominently than men, with fewer quotes and less prominent placement in news stories.\n\nIn entertainment, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media found that there are 2.24 male characters for every female character in recently released films, and only 30.9% of speaking characters are female.\n\nOn the economic front, the women's-to-men's earnings ratio peaked at 81% in 2005 and 2006, after a gradual rise in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe talk about access to opportunity for everyone is terrific, but now comes the hard part: the action to make the change and in the process create a world that is fairer for everyone. One that does justice to the ambition of girls in any and every corner of the world, and to our own hopes for a more stable, secure, and prosperous future.\n\nIt will take a village, one boosted by a lot of high-wattage celebrities helping to light the way. The rebranding of feminism by these cultural icons is a positive step, but it is up to all of us to ensure that this momentum translates into real, tangible gains for women and men everywhere.",
    " Title: U.S.-Iran Tensions Escalate: A Look at the Tanker Incidents and the Implications of Trump's Foreign Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent incidents involving oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman and Iran's alleged violations of the Iran nuclear pact have raised concerns about the escalating tensions between the United States and Iran. These events underscore the potential dangers of President Trump's retreat from diplomacy and the increasing volatility in global politics.\n\nThe damage to the tankers, described by Trump as \"very minor,\" has prompted discussions about potential escalation. The U.S. has deployed an additional 2,500 troops to the region, and there have been calls for military action against Iran. However, it is widely understood that any U.S. strike on Iran would likely provoke a response from Iran.\n\nBrett McGurk, a national security expert and former presidential envoy, has expressed concern that the administration's Iran policy may be leading Trump into a corner. With the failure of the current policy, McGurk suggests that Trump may soon be left with two options: either backing down or resorting to military action.\n\nThe administration's approach to Iran has also been criticized for conflating Shiite Iran with the Sunni Taliban. This conflation has raised concerns among members of Congress, who fear that this association is being used to provide Trump with legal cover to attack Iran under the 2001 authorization for the use of military force against Al Qaeda and its offshoots.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo's 12-point plan for Iran, which essentially calls for Iran to surrender, has been met with skepticism and ridicule. The plan, according to critics, is unrealistic and further strains relations between the U.S. and Iran.\n\nThe international community's perception of the U.S. has also been affected by the administration's approach to Iran. Allies have become increasingly distrustful of America, with Washington's incompetent bullying of Europe and Asia to join Iran sanctions antagonizing longstanding friends. This has pushed Iran closer to a nuclear path and increased the risk of war.\n\nAs the situation remains precarious, there are few good options. An international force to protect tankers might help, along with secret diplomacy to explore the possibility of patching up the nuclear deal in a way that both sides can accept. However, given the current state of relations, such a resolution seems unlikely.",
    " Title: Israeli Intelligence Minister Denies Knowledge of Trump's Alleged Assassination Order on Assad\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Israel's Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz has stated that he has no knowledge of U.S. President Donald Trump ever ordering the assassination of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, contradicting claims made in a new book by Watergate reporter Bob Woodward, \"Fear: Trump in the White House.\"\n\nAccording to the book, Trump reportedly told his Defense Secretary, James Mattis, that he wanted to have Assad assassinated in response to a chemical attack on Syrian civilians in April 2017. The book further states that Mattis, in response, told Trump he would \"get right on it\" but instead developed a plan for a limited air strike that did not threaten Assad personally.\n\nTrump, in response to the book's claims, tweeted that the quotes attributed to Mattis were \"made up frauds, a con on the public.\" Mattis himself dismissed the book as \"a uniquely Washington brand of literature.\"\n\nIn an interview with Tel Aviv radio station 103 FM, Katz said, \"I do not know of any such instruction. He (Trump) is also denying it, by the way.\" Katz further clarified that while there is coordination between the United States and Israel regarding the Syrian regime, Israel has not made a decision to topple Assad.\n\nIsrael, while neutral in the seven-year Syrian civil war, has carried out numerous air strikes against suspected attempts by Assad's Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah allies to establish permanent posts or advanced arms. Under decades of Assad family rule, Syria has maintained a Cold War-style hostility towards Israel. Katz stated that Israel does not see a better alternative to Assad among the Syrian rebel groups.\n\n\"Of course, his (Assad's) actions are terrible actions, and something that we abhor and condemn. Those opposing him, ISIS and others, are not a side that we think are better. We took care to preserve our interests,\" Katz said.\n\nWoodward gained national fame for his reporting on the Watergate scandal in the 1970s and has since written a number of books that provide behind-the-scenes glimpses of presidential administrations and other Washington institutions. For this book, Woodward spoke to top aides and other insiders with the understanding that he would not reveal how he got his information, said The Washington Post, which published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.",
    " Title: Israel Clarifies Airstrikes in Syria as Targeting Hezbollah, Not Assad Regime\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to de-escalate tensions with Syria following a series of airstrikes last week, Israel has reportedly made soothing overtures to the war-torn nation. The strikes, which took place on Friday and Sunday, were initially perceived as an attack on President Bashar al-Assad's regime, but Israel has since clarified that the target was primarily Hezbollah, not the Syrian government.\n\nIsraeli officials, including a confidante of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Tzachi Hanegbi, have emphasized that the attacks were aimed at Hezbollah, not the Syrian regime. Hanegbi stated that Netanyahu aimed to avoid an increase in tension with Syria by making clear that if there is activity, it is only against Hezbollah, not against the Syrian regime.\n\nHezbollah, an Iran-backed Shiite militant group that seeks Israel's elimination, has long relied on the Assad regime to transfer weapons from Iran into its own hands. The relationship between Damascus and Hezbollah appears to have grown closer as a result of Syria's civil war, with Hezbollah fighters battling the Syrian opposition from within the country.\n\nIsrael's diplomatic efforts to reassure Assad were further evident when Prime Minister Netanyahu embarked on a planned diplomatic trip to China on Sunday, a move that Yedioth Ahronoth, Israel's biggest-selling newspaper, described as part of Jerusalem's effort to send a calming message to Assad.\n\nIsrael will continue to maintain official silence about the two air strikes, a senior Israeli official said, with the goal being to make clear to Assad that Israel's sole interest is in preventing advanced weaponry from reaching Hezbollah. The Israeli government has not confirmed the report, but an unnamed official told Reuters that such indirect contacts were not required.\n\nThe Sunday airstrike hit a military facility near the presidential palace in Damascus, resulting in the deaths of dozens of elite troops, according to a Syrian official. At least 100 were dead, with scores more injured, according to a military hospital doctor. Although Israel did not comment on the attacks, Israeli analysts suggest that they were likely targeting weapons meant to be transferred from the Syrian military to Hezbollah.\n\nSyria and Israel have not directly come to blows for almost four decades, with the exception of a brief conflict in Lebanon in 1982. Israel has staged military moves inside Syria on several occasions in the past decade, including assassinating militants in Damascus, bombing a Palestinian training camp, and most notably, destroying a suspected nuclear reactor in northeast Syria in 2007. In each instance, the Syrian regime either ignored the incident or vowed a retaliation that was never fulfilled.\n\nNeither Hezbollah nor Israel appear to desire a fresh conflict, mindful that the next encounter promises to be much more destructive than the 2006 war. Israeli security analyst Reuven Pedhazur told The Monitor that Syria and Hezbollah are not likely to be willing to retaliate, even symbolically, as Israel will respond in kind. \"Israel will not back off,\" he said. \"If they respond, Israel will respond on the other side.\"",
    " Title: Former U.S. State Department and Pentagon Officials Sign Statement in Support of John Brennan's Security Clearance\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of more than 175 former U.S. State Department and Pentagon officials, including individuals from both Democratic and Republican administrations, have added their names to a statement criticizing President Donald Trump's decision to revoke the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan. The statement, initially issued last week by 15 former directors and deputy chiefs of the Central Intelligence Agency and Office of Director of National Intelligence, has now been expanded to include prominent figures such as former NATO Commander Admiral James Stavridis, former Deputy Secretaries of State Anthony Blinken and William Burns, and former Undersecretaries of State Nicholas Burns, Wendy Sherman, and Thomas Pickering.\n\nThe signatories, while not necessarily agreeing with all of Brennan's public criticisms of Trump, believe that \"the country will be weakened if there is a political litmus test applied\" before former officials are allowed to voice their views. The statement also expresses concern over the potential politicization of the security clearance process.\n\nSeparately, U.S. Senator Mark Warner, the Democratic vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has filed legislation that would limit the president's ability to revoke an individual's security clearance. Trump has previously stated that he is considering revoking the clearances of other former high-ranking officials, including Bruce Ohr, a current Justice Department official.\n\nBrennan, who has publicly characterized Trump's comments at a recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin as \"treasonous,\" has stated that he may sue the Trump administration over the revocation of his clearance.\n\nIn a separate development, Representatives Elijah Cummings and Stephen Lynch, top Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, have written a letter to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, questioning the security clearance of National Security Advisor John Bolton. The letter requests documents related to whether Bolton, in security clearance forms or \"other White House vetting materials,\" reported that in 2013 he participated by video in a roundtable discussion on gun rights organized by Maria Butina. Butina was arrested in July and accused of acting as a Russian agent while developing ties with U.S. citizens and infiltrating political groups.\n\nThe Washington Post has reported that Bolton recorded the video promoting an expansion of gun rights in Russia for a group Butina formed. The White House National Security Council had no immediate comment on the letter, and White House aides declined to comment.\n\nRussia has denied any interference in the 2016 U.S. election, and Trump has said there was no collusion with his campaign. In response to the criticism, Trump tweeted, \"Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance, it's worth great prestige and big dollars, even board seats, and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan.\"",
    " Title: Joe Biden Outlines Comprehensive Plan to Address Racial Inequality and Systemic Racism in the U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent address, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, outlined a comprehensive plan to address racial inequality and systemic racism in the United States. The plan, which focuses on various aspects of American society, aims to deliver on the current moment of racial justice protests and achieve fundamental changes that address racial inequalities and white supremacy in the country.\n\nBiden emphasized the need to root out systemic racism across U.S. laws and institutions, and to ensure black Americans have a real opportunity to succeed. He criticized President Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric, stating that addressing the way the president talks is not enough; instead, systemic racism must be addressed.\n\nBiden supports the proposal pending in New York to enhance penalties for making false 911 calls based on race, gender, or religion. He also advocates for prioritizing support for mission-driven lenders in low-income communities, doubling the State Small Business Credit Initiative, expanding the New Markets Tax Credit Program, and expanding programs at the Small Business Administration that are effective in helping launch black-owned businesses.\n\nHousing disparities are another area of focus for Biden's plan. He aims to combat gentrification, end discriminatory lending practices, and eliminate exclusionary zoning laws designed to keep low-income people and people of color out of certain communities. Biden also criticized President Trump for suspending the Obama-Biden administration's rule on Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, which required communities to proactively examine housing patterns and address discriminatory policies.\n\nBiden's plan also includes proposals for education, with a focus on improving teacher diversity, solving the student debt crisis, and investing in historically underfunded institutions like historically black colleges and universities, tribal colleges and universities, and minority-serving institutions.\n\nRegarding police reform, Biden supports banning chokeholds, ensuring independent prosecutors in police-involved killings, collecting data on police use of force and violations of use of force standards, and requiring training for officers regarding racial and religious bias and their duty to intervene if another officer is abusing power. He also proposes an additional $300 million to reinvigorate community policing in the U.S.\n\nBiden also emphasized the need for investments in mental health services, drug treatment, and prevention programs, as well as services for people experiencing homelessness. He does not support defunding the police but instead advocates for giving police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms.\n\nBiden concluded his address by stating that the fight against racial injustice will not be easy, but it is necessary. He expressed his readiness to do the work starting on Day One, emphasizing the need for leadership at the highest levels of government and sustained grassroots pressure from communities who will no longer stand by silently when injustices are inflicted on people of color.",
    " Title: Minnesota Senator Al Franken Remains Unchallenged as Republicans Struggle to Recruit Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Minnesota Senator Al Franken, the former \"Saturday Night Live\" star and liberal talk show host, has yet to draw a Republican opponent for the 2014 elections. The GOP, who initially targeted Franken as a top pick-off target in 2009 following a seven-month recount and legal battle, now faces a recruitment challenge in their bid to overcome the Democrats' 10-seat Senate advantage.\n\nThe race for Franken's seat, which was initially considered competitive, now appears to be in the Democrats' favor. The Republican Party is reportedly considering relatively unknown state legislators, inexperienced businessmen, or a conservative radio host with a history of controversial statements.\n\nThe lack of a serious challenger for Franken speaks to the broader recruitment challenge Republicans face in 2014. To have a shot at overcoming the Democrats' advantage, the GOP needs to expand the map by putting seats like Franken's in play. However, the party has struggled to find top-flight candidates in several states that, on paper, should be competitive.\n\nIncumbents Mark Udall in Colorado and Tom Udall in New Mexico, elected in 2008, are considered safe. No top-tier GOP candidate has announced yet in Michigan, New Hampshire, or Iowa.\n\nDemocrats are defending seats in seven red states carried by Mitt Romney last year, but Republicans are highly unlikely to run the table in those places.\n\nFranken's success in fending off a serious challenger is attributed to his strategic approach to politics. He has followed the Hillary Clinton Senate playbook, keeping a low profile, avoiding national press, and focusing on populist issues like privacy and consumer protection. Franken has cultivated a reputation as a serious lawmaker and amassed a formidable war chest.\n\nMinnesota, which was genuinely purple a decade ago, has taken on a more bluish hue. The state Republican Party is reeling, debt-ridden, and seeking to find its way after its Ron Paul-affiliated Senate nominee lost to Sen. Amy Klobuchar by 34 points in November.\n\nPolling released last week shows Franken's approval rating just above the 50 percent threshold, a key advantage for an incumbent. The Democratic firm Public Policy Polling showed him starting with a double-digit lead over six potential Republican candidates.\n\nUniversity of Minnesota political scientist Larry Jacobs commented, \"It's shocking to me that Franken is as safe as he is at this point.\"\n\nRepublicans hope national atmospherics, specifically the growing unpopularity of Obamacare and the scandals enveloping President Obama, will help put Minnesota in play. They believe 2014 will be a bad year for incumbents in general, and that while Franken is no doubt the favorite at the moment, the race is not lost for the GOP.\n\nKnowing he would have a tough race, Franken hired a campaign manager early and started fundraising aggressively. He brought in $2 million in the first quarter and has about that much cash on hand. Franken's campaign manager, Matt Burgess, stated, \"My mantra is to be prepared and ready for anything.\"",
    " Title: Meg Whitman Reportedly Suggests Endorsement of Hillary Clinton Over Donald Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman, a significant financial backer of the Republican Party, has reportedly expressed reservations about supporting Donald Trump's presidential bid, potentially hinting at an endorsement of Hillary Clinton instead.\n\nThe revelation came following a closed-door summit held by former presidential hopeful Mitt Romney in Park City, Utah. According to attendees, Whitman posed the question, \"Is it not reasonable to support Hillary Clinton?\" given Trump's controversial statements, as reported by ABC News.\n\nFurther discussions about Trump allegedly led Whitman to compare the presumptive GOP nominee to historical figures such as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, according to anonymous attendees speaking to Politico.\n\nHowever, Whitman did not explicitly endorse Clinton in her conversation with ABC News after the event, stating, \"I haven't made that decision. We'll see, get to the conventions, see who the vice presidential picks are. And then I will make that decision.\"\n\nWhitman, 59, has served as CEO of eBay for a decade starting in 1998 before taking on the same role at HP in 2011. She unsuccessfully ran for governor of California against Democratic incumbent Jerry Brown in 2010, setting a record for the most money ever spent by a political candidate on a single election, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nShe advised Mitt Romney during his 2012 campaign and supported New Jersey Governor Chris Christie before he dropped out of the GOP race earlier in the election season. As of last June, Forbes estimated Whitman's net worth to be approximately $2.1 billion.\n\nIn response to the news, Trump, in a statement provided by campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks, stated, \"I never met Meg Whitman, but the job she is doing at Hewlett-Packard is not a very good one. Based on the disastrous campaign she ran in California, and the tens of millions of dollars she wasted, I have learned a lot from her. I do not want her support.\"\n\nThis report corrects an earlier one that erroneously stated Romney's meeting was in Washington, D.C.",
    " Title: Republican Presidential Debate Focuses on Trump's Remarks on Islam\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican presidential debate, hosted by CNN on Thursday, took a contentious turn when the topic of Donald Trump's remarks on Islam was brought up. The debate, which was marked by a bombastic presentation and questionable moderation, focused on Trump's statement that \"Islam hates us.\"\n\nDuring the debate, Trump was given an opportunity to clarify his statement, suggesting that he was referring to a radical interpretation of Islam. However, Trump declined and reiterated his stance, stating that there is a \"tremendous hatred\" within Islam.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio offered a tepid critique, stating that presidents cannot say anything they want and that there were pragmatic reasons not to dehumanize 1.6 billion people. The Intercept's Murtaza Hussain tweeted that this moment was significant because it was not just about Trump, but about the entire Republican Party and the millions of Americans who continue to support it.\n\nThe debate's focus on Trump's remarks on Islam highlights the party's stance on religious bigotry and political cynicism, which President Obama has previously identified as the source of destructive acts. The debate's portrayal of the United States may influence the perception of the country by millions of people worldwide, potentially leading to a negative impact on the country's image.",
    " Title: China's Economic Slowdown: Navigating the Storm and the Road Ahead\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Chinese economy is currently experiencing a period of significant change, with stock prices plunging and concerns of a potential \"hard landing\" looming. This economic downturn has had a ripple effect on global markets, with the United States stock markets also experiencing sharp declines. However, a closer look at the situation reveals a more nuanced picture.\n\nFor one, the hard landing scenario may not materialize as some prominent forecasters predict a cooling of the economy rather than a steep decline. The slowdown in China's growth was necessary and inevitable, as the economy was rooted in unsustainable investment in factories, property, and other fixed assets. The market turbulence is a byproduct of the curbing of financial excesses.\n\nMoreover, the popular view of China as an unstoppable economic giant was never entirely accurate. The market plunge may prompt people inside and outside China to take a more realistic view that incorporates China's weaknesses and the transition from its high-growth era to the likelihood of slower growth in the future.\n\nThis new dose of realism about China is potentially healthy but complicated. It carries the risk of economic challenges leading to political unrest, with reported signs of tension within the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). President Xi Jinping's blend of centralized personal control and reformist zeal has led to an avowed crackdown on official corruption and the pursuit of sweeping economic changes.\n\nDespite the short-term turmoil, many China watchers argue that a success story would be if the economic bumps become steps along Xi's route to an economy that emphasizes freer markets and more domestic consumption, rather than growth fueled by exports and government-led investment.\n\nWhat is clearest to all is that China is in a period of significant change. Along with the silver linings, there are risks for the rest of the world as well as for China's government and people. The risk of a struggling China turning to foreign adventurism to placate a public frustrated by slower economic growth and an absence of political freedom is a concern.\n\nChina's policymakers have financial firepower at their disposal to do substantially more in the way of stimulus as needed. The road ahead won't necessarily be smooth, and the current turbulence can be viewed as an early reminder of that. The Chinese economy will not, and should not, grow as fast as it used to, with the ultimate goal being to achieve a balanced, more sustained growth level.",
    " Title: Trump and Kim Jong-un Exchange Barbs as Tensions Remain High Over North Korea's Nuclear Program\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the United States and North Korea continue to face off over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, the latest round of verbal exchanges between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has raised concerns about the potential for escalation.\n\nDuring his Asia trip, President Trump took to Twitter to respond to Kim Jong-un's characterization of him as \"old\" in a speech. Trump tweeted, \"Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me 'old,' when I would NEVER call him'short and fat?'\" This came after the Asian dictator called Trump an \"old lunatic\" in response to his address to the South Korean National Assembly this week.\n\nIn his speech, Trump warned North Korea that the weapons it is acquiring are not making it safer, but rather putting its regime in grave danger. North Korea's Foreign Ministry responded with a statement, saying that Trump's remarks would not scare them or stop their advance. The ministry also stated that the escalating tensions have only made them more determined to complete their nuclear force.\n\nAt a news conference in Vietnam on Sunday, Trump said it was possible he could be friends with Kim one day and that it would be \"very, very nice\" but he was not sure that it would happen. When asked if he could see himself being friends with Kim, Trump said, \"That might be a strange thing to happen but it's a possibility. If it did happen, it could be a good thing, I can tell you, for North Korea, but it could also be good for a lot of other places and be good for the rest of the world.\"\n\nTrump and Kim have a history of trading insults and threats amid escalating tensions over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb test on September 3, prompting another round of UN sanctions.\n\nAs the world watches the ongoing standoff between the two leaders, it remains to be seen what the future holds for the relationship between the United States and North Korea. However, it is clear that the stakes are high, and any misstep could have serious consequences.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Break from Obama on Key Issues, Including Trade Deals and Iran Sanctions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from the usual partisan lines, Senate Democrats have been publicly criticizing President Barack Obama on a range of key issues, from trade to Iran sanctions, the Keystone XL pipeline, Obamacare, the National Security Agency, and energy policy. This break from the president, who is counting on Senate Democrats to help approve his legislative agenda during his final years in office, has been described as unusual, with many Democratic senators expressing their disagreement with the president with minimal concerns about repercussions from the White House.\n\nLast week, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada rejected a bill to fast-track trade deals that is strongly backed by the White House, working against Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus of Montana, who has been tapped to be the president's ambassador to China. The rejection of the bill was a clear sign of the growing discontent among Senate Democrats.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) noted that discontented Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia have made statements that could have been written by the Republican Senatorial Committee, referring to the Senate GOP campaign arm's aggressive anti-Obama messaging. Manchin has criticized Obama's statements during his State of the Union speech regarding his willingness to work with lawmakers when he can and go around them if he can't.\n\nThe criticism is not limited to energy-producing states or red-state Democrats up for reelection in 2014. Liberal Democrats have decried NSA surveillance programs, and Democrats not up for reelection for years seem perfectly at ease clashing with the White House.\n\nFreshman Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) has been a persistent critic of the White House on NSA policy. \"I think the framers did an incredible job of finding the right balance,\" said Heinrich. \"When we get back to that, my outspokenness will diminish.\"\n\nThe rifts between Senate Democrats and the White House might represent nothing more than bad message coordination and a White House that doesn't do enough to keep Capitol Hill in the loop. President Barack Obama does not have terribly close personal relationships with most Democratic lawmakers, and his legislative affairs shop was riddled with Capitol Hill criticism until the recent addition of longtime Hill staffer Katie Beirne Fallon.\n\nSen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) of Obama's outreach to Democratic senators, who is up for reelection this year, was angered recently by a surprise Statement of Administration Policy ripping her flood insurance bill, which would ease rate increases that would disproportionately hit flood-prone Louisiana. Obama's aides indicated the bill is not sound fiscal policy, though they notably did not threaten a veto of her bill.\n\n\"I believe in many of the principles of the Democratic Party,\" Landrieu said. \"But I stay focused on the issues that are important to Louisiana. And when the president is for Louisiana, I'm for the president. When he's not, I'm not.\"\n\nThe contrasts between vulnerable Senate Democrats and the White House appear to be orchestrated to counter Obama's low approval rates in red states where incumbents will face voters this fall, congressional aides in both parties suggest. However, not all the criticism is coming from expected quarters, with liberal Democrats also decrying the president's policies.",
    " Title: Media Bias in Political Scandals: A Comparative Analysis of Governor Scandals Involving Bob McDonnell and Elliot Spitzer\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of political scandals, the media's role in shaping public perception is paramount. A recent comparison of less than 24-hours after the indictment of former Governor Bob McDonnell (R-VA) and the Elliot Spitzer (D-NY) scandal in 2008 reveals a striking disparity in the way the media identifies the political affiliation of the two governors.\n\nLess than 24-hours after McDonnell was indicted on 14 charges including conspiracy and fraud, all three network morning shows immediately identified McDonnell as a Republican. NBC led their January 22 coverage of the McDonnell scandal with Today host Savannah Guthrie introducing the segment by saying, \"And now to that bombshell indictment of the former governor of Virginia, Bob McDonnell, a one-time rising star in the Republican Party.\" ABC provided an on-screen graphic identifying McDonnell as a Republican, and CBS This Morning's Nancy Cordes said that \"McDonnell was once considered a possible presidential contender for the GOP.\"\n\nIn contrast, in March 2008, Democratic Governor Elliot Spitzer of New York was identified as \"Client Number 9\" in a prostitution ring, but for two straight days, ABC and NBC failed to label Spitzer as a Democrat. At the time, my colleague Brent Baker noted how \"in lead stories Monday night about New York Governor Eliot Spitzer being linked to a prostitution ring, neither ABC's World News nor the NBC Nightly News verbally identified Spitzer's political party.\"\n\nIn total, NBC and CBS referenced McDonnell's Republican affiliation three times by name, whereas it took ABC three days to identify Spitzer as a Democrat in 2008, and even longer for NBC to do so. In fact, in 2008, both ABC and NBC found time to \"applaud his [Elliot Spitzer] reputation and effectiveness as the Empire State's Attorney General before becoming Governor.\" In contrast, both CBS and NBC noted how McDonnell is \"the first Virginia governor ever to be charged with a crime and the charges he's facing carry the possibility of decades behind bars.\"\n\nThis practice by ABC, NBC, and CBS is nothing new and they will likely continue to rush to identify Republicans plagued in scandal while giving Democrats a pass. Unsurprisingly, this discrepancy in reporting has raised questions about media bias in political scandals.",
    " Title: Michigan Barber Compares Governor's Lockdown to Holocaust, Defies Shutdown Orders\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a controversial move, Michigan barber Karl Manke, who has gained national attention for defying Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer's coronavirus shutdown orders, compared the lockdown to the Holocaust during a protest at the state Capitol.\n\nManke, who had his license suspended for keeping his barbershop open, spoke to demonstrators during \"Operation Haircut,\" a protest he inspired that featured barbers and stylists giving free haircuts in defiance of Whitmer's social distancing requirements. State police cited a number of barbers and stylists for their actions.\n\nDuring his speech, Manke referenced a novel he wrote about the Holocaust, which included factual accounts of Jews being tricked by Nazis to enter cattle cars that took them to death camps. He stated, \"I refuse to get into a cattle car!\"\n\nManke also declared, \"I will not stand down. I will continue my work with or without a license.\" He added, \"I feel I have been denied my livelihood by this governor... this is not a police state. I refuse to live in a police state.\"\n\nA Court of Appeals panel has ruled that a hearing should be held to decide on the state's motion to temporarily close Manke's barbershop in Owosso. The decision is expected by the end of the day Thursday.\n\nIt is unclear if Manke was among those who received citations during the protest. \"They were warned that if they continue to cut hair they will be cited; and then finally they were cited as a disorderly person,\" MSP spokeswoman Shannon Banner told MLive.\n\nGovernor Whitmer stated earlier this week that it is \"unlikely\" that barbers, salons, and personal care services would reopen when the stay-at-home order expires on May 28. She noted, \"The nature of that personal service is such that it is intimate, it is close, you can't social distance and get your hair cut.\"\n\nRepublican state Sen. Kevin Daley received a haircut from barber Suzanne Dodoro during the demonstration, stating, \"We need to support the people making a living. We need to save life, but we need to save livelihood, too.\"",
    " Title: The Tight Race for Congress: A Tale of Two Parties in a Sea of Despondency\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final stretch of the midterm elections, both the Democratic and Republican parties find themselves in a state of gloom, each grappling with the financial might of the other in a race that is proving to be extremely close. As of now, unless something drastic changes before midnight, Democrats are facing crushing defeats under a wave of Republican big money. However, the Republicans are also struggling to defend themselves against Democrats who are outraising them.\n\nThe political landscape is marked by a sense of despair, but the potential to raise money is bright. In this election year, where America's political mood is dark, both parties are embracing a simple truth: pessimism sells.\n\nHistorically, gloominess has been associated with the Democratic party, which this weekend alone sent out fundraising emails declaring \"Kiss any hope goodbye\" and \"If you've given up on this election, then we should just quit now.\" Even Karl Rove, the GOP's preeminent mega-donor schmoozer, has changed his approach this time around.\n\nIn an email Sunday to National Republican Senatorial Committee donors, Rove wrote, \"The midterm environment is toxic for Democrats, yet there's a chance Republicans may not take the Senate. The Democrats have a huge money advantage.\" This statement came just a few days after Rove penned a Wall Street Journal column urging his side's activists to \"open their wallets to candidates whom they may have never met\" and also help get out the vote.\n\nThe despondency arms race is not without irony for both sides. For Republicans, the desperate rhetoric comes as forecasts show they're likely to win major victories that would leave them in control of the Senate for the first time since 2007 and with an even wider majority in the House of Representatives. For Democrats, the surge of despair comes as the party's big donors have, by some metrics, caught up to\u2014and even surpassed\u2014Republicans for the first time since the dawn of the modern big-money era in 2010.\n\nThe GOP had moved more aggressively into the new Wild West-like campaign cash environment created by federal court decisions striking down spending and fundraising restrictions as unconstitutional infringements on free speech. However, among the groups reporting the biggest political ad spending in 2014, the 15 top Democrat-aligned committees that disclose their donors have outraised the 15 top Republican ones $453 million to $289 million in the 2014 cycle, according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis of the most recent FEC reports, including those filed this month.\n\nOne would think the numbers were reversed judging by recent Democratic Party fundraising emails. A Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee email last week, signed by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, read, \"Right now, Democrats are facing Republican opposition unlike anything we've seen. Right-wing billionaires are going all out to buy Republicans this election.\" The email continued, \"The only way we can withstand this barrage of corporate interest attacks is with your support. And right now, we're still coming up short.\"\n\nTwo days later, a missive from the Democratic Governors Association ticked off more reasons for chagrin: \"Poll after poll shows Dems slipping. Republicans are hammering us with brutal attacks. We don't have enough money to fight back. If you don't give\u2014like, 30 seconds ago\u2014this election is over.\"\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the elections, both parties are urging their supporters to open their wallets in a desperate bid to level the playing field. The race for Congress is indeed a tale of two parties in a sea of despondency.",
    " Title: Multiple Police Officers Shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Three Officers Confirmed Dead\n\nA series of shootings in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Sunday left three police officers dead and several others wounded, according to the city's mayor, Kip Holden. The incident occurred around 9 a.m. local time, and the shooting scene is still active, with authorities urging residents to stay away from the area.\n\nThe Baton Rouge Police Department issued a statement that they do not believe the shooting was race-related. Baton Rouge Police spokesman L'Jean Mckneely stated that one suspect is dead, and police are checking the shooting scene with a robot to ensure there are no explosives. Authorities are seeking more than one suspect and have asked the public to be on the lookout for people dressed in black and carrying long guns.\n\nThe East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office also confirmed that police and sheriff's deputies were involved in the shooting incident. Multiple officers from both agencies sustained injuries and were transported to local hospitals, but there are no firm numbers on the number hurt or the extent of injuries.\n\nThe scene of the shootings is near Airline Highway, which is a mile from the Baton Rouge Police Department headquarters, where dozens of protesters were arrested earlier this month. Two nearby hospitals were on lockdown, but efforts to confirm the report were not immediately successful.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether there is a link between Sunday's shootings and the recent unrest over police killings of black men in Baton Rouge and Minnesota. A wave of protests against police violence in Baton Rouge and other cities erupted after Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old African-American father of five, was shot and killed by law enforcement officers on July 5.\n\nThe Justice Department, which has opened a federal probe into Sterling's death, declined to comment on Sunday's shootings. President Barack Obama has been briefed on the shooting of police officers in Baton Rouge and will be updated throughout the day. The White House has also been in contact with local officials and has offered assistance.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter civil rights movement has called for police to end racial profiling, bringing the issue to national attention ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. The shooting in Baton Rouge comes just days after a gunman opened fire on white officers in Dallas, killing five of them.\n\nThe Baton Rouge Police Department and the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office have not yet released further details about the shootings, and the investigation is ongoing. The community is urged to stay informed and follow updates from local authorities.",
    " Title: Major Corporations Pledge Carbon Neutrality: A Shift in Corporate Climate Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in corporate climate strategy, major companies such as Delta Air Lines, BP, Microsoft, and Ikea have pledged to go carbon neutral, with some companies aiming to actively reduce carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Financial giant Blackrock has also promised to prioritize climate considerations in its decision-making process.\n\nAccording to the global nonprofit CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), this is not an isolated trend. More companies are disclosing their carbon emissions, and a growing number of these companies have emissions reduction targets. Furthermore, these targets are becoming more ambitious, as evidenced by the analysis of CDP data by Engie Impact, a sustainability company tied to a French energy group.\n\nCompanies are not only promising faster action but also setting more specific, measurable carbon reduction goals that align with the Paris Agreement. Coca-Cola, Nike, Best Buy, Walmart, and Hilton Hotels are among the hundreds of companies with such targets.\n\nThe increase in corporate climate action comes after decades of pressure from environmental advocates and despite a lack of action from the U.S. government. The effects of climate change are becoming increasingly apparent, with wildfires, rising sea levels, droughts, and other symptoms of the crisis making headlines and affecting business operations.\n\nSolar and wind energy have also become significantly cheaper, making it easier for some companies to transition away from fossil fuels. Additionally, pressure from investors, customers, and the general public is mounting, with traditional and mainstream investors, as well as city and state governments, taking action.\n\nIn some cases, children and employees are also driving change. Tech workers, for example, are increasingly discussing climate change on platforms like Blind, and half of these users say a company's climate policy affects their desire to work there.\n\nMicrosoft's chief sustainability officer, Lucas Joppa, suggests that framing climate action as an accounting problem, by quantifying carbon emissions and setting clear reduction targets, can help flip executives' mindsets.\n\nWhile these corporate commitments are a step in the right direction, there are concerns about follow-through and accountability. Some climate announcements in the past, such as BP's previous rebranding as \"Beyond Petroleum,\" have been more about public relations than actual shifts in strategy.\n\nMoreover, some experts argue that relying on big corporations to drive the fight against climate change may not be sufficient. Shalanda Baker, a professor at Northeastern University, emphasizes the need for vulnerable and marginalized communities to have a voice in the transition to green energy and to feel the benefits of this shift.\n\nCorporate action can be powerful, but government policy can ensure that vulnerable populations are protected. Baker and others call for additional voluntary emissions cuts, as well as engagement with policymakers to advocate for government action and support for market-based policies, such as a carbon tax.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Actions on Election Rules in 2014: A Closer Look at the High Court's Emergency Stays\n\nThe Supreme Court appears to be fine-tuning the rules for the 2014 election, with a series of recent decisions that have garnered attention and debate. Over the past three weeks, the justices have allowed Ohio to cut early voting by a week, let North Carolina end same-day voter registration, and blocked Wisconsin from implementing a new voter ID law. The court could soon face another request to block a Texas voter ID law from being enforced in the upcoming elections.\n\nIn each of the cases where the justices acted, lower federal courts had issued orders that would have changed the rules for elections just weeks away, potentially causing confusion among voters and election officials. The high court justices who joined in the court's actions on such emergency stays don't typically explain the reasoning behind the moves.\n\nLegal analysts and some judges suggest that the Supreme Court's actions are less about broad voting rights principles and more about telling federal judges to stay out, particularly so close to Election Day. As 5th U.S. Circuit Judge Edith Clement wrote Tuesday, the common thread in the stayed decisions is that the decision of the Court of Appeals would change the rules of the election too soon before the election date.\n\nThe high court justices who joined in the court's actions on such emergency stays don't typically explain the reasoning behind the moves. Sometimes the justices who disagree share their reasons, but that's only moderately helpful in figuring out why the other justices came to the opposite conclusion.\n\nThe tightening of election laws in all the states in question was pursued by Republican-led legislatures and objected to by Democratic and civil rights groups, who insisted it would disenfranchise minorities. The Ohio case produced a clearly partisan split on the Supreme Court, with the five GOP appointees voting to allow the state to cut back early voting by a week and the four Democratic appointees preferring to leave in place an appeals court order barring the change.\n\nThe North Carolina case, focusing on same-day registration and out-of-precinct voting, resulted in seven justices overturning an appeals court's ban on eliminating those accommodations. Two Democratic appointees, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, dissented, noting that the appeals court found that ending those two voting practices \"risked significantly reducing opportunities for black voters to exercise the franchise.\"\n\nOn the Wisconsin voter ID case, the high court split 6-3, producing the first result this cycle in which the justices essentially blessed a lower court order barring enforcement of one of the new election laws. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy, both GOP appointees, joined with the court's liberals to restore the district court's ban on enforcement of the new voter ID requirements in the coming election.\n\nEven the three justices who dissented from the high court's decision to re-block the Wisconsin voter ID law said they were disturbed by the fact that some absentee ballots were mailed without informing recipients that they needed to submit photo ID in order to make their votes count.\n\nThe Supreme Court's actions in the 2014 election have sparked debate and concern, with many questioning the timing and potential impact on voters. As the election approaches, the court could face more requests to intervene, adding to the ongoing discussion about the role of the Supreme Court in election law and the balance between voter access and election security.",
    " Title: Republicans Face Internal Struggles Amidst Dominant Political Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unprecedented political landscape, the Republican Party currently holds the White House, the Senate, the House, 34 governorships, and absolute control in 26 state legislatures. However, despite this apparent dominance, the New York Times reports that the Republican leadership is facing internal challenges from various factions within their own party.\n\nThe Republican Party's dominance is not without controversy, with the use of gerrymandering and vote suppression tactics contributing to their apparent security. The year 2018, initially perceived as a stronghold for the Republicans, has seen unexpected internal strife.\n\nThe party, which has adopted a \"radicalism for the win\" policy since 1980, has been shaped by Reagan's supply-side economics, Newt Gingrich's constant system attacks, the Tea Party's war on compromise, and now President Trump's divisive rhetoric. This has led to a party that embraces divisive candidates and promotes disunity.\n\nRecent events have highlighted this disarray. Last week, Roy S. Moore, a former Alabama state judge and a controversial Republican, defeated Senator Luther Strange in a Senate runoff. The retirement of Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee has sparked a potential intraparty fight for his seat, with Governor Bill Haslam, the establishment's preferred successor, declining to run.\n\nAdditionally, a House Republican, Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, was forced to resign this week following the public disclosure of a text from his mistress in which she mocked his pro-life stance while he pressured her to terminate a pregnancy.\n\nWhile the media often portrays Democrats as disunited, the current Republican Party is grappling with its own internal struggles. The party seems to have created a breeding ground for bomb-throwers, with many Republicans willing to attack their own party members.\n\nAs Democrats search for unity in policy and leadership, the Republican Party is currently embroiled in its own internal strife, a stark contrast to their seemingly unassailable political position.",
    " Title: Republican Viewership Trends: Jimmy Kimmel Nearly Doubles Stephen Colbert's Ratings in New Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll has revealed that Stephen Colbert's CBS audience tends to align more closely with his former Comedy Central viewers, as more Democrats, Atheists, and men tune into \"The Late Show,\" while Republican viewers have largely abandoned the satirist in a significant exodus.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter's survey of the broadcast late-night landscape indicates that Colbert's frequent comedic critiques of the 2016 GOP presidential candidates may have contributed to the decline in Republican viewership. The poll shows that only 17% of \"The Late Show\" viewers identify as Republican, the smallest margin among the big three. In contrast, ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" boasts a 33% Republican viewership, a 16-point gap between the two comedians.\n\nFurthermore, among his own viewership, Colbert finds a 30-point gap between self-identified Republican viewers and self-identified Democrats. Forty-seven percent of Colbert's viewers are Democrats, the highest margin of all three. Kimmel's ideological split is virtually nonexistent, with 34% Democrats and 33% Republicans. NBC's \"Tonight Show\" host, Jimmy Fallon, has a 36% Republican to 31% Democratic viewership split.\n\nPollster Jon Penn explained, \"Colbert Nation is filled with wealthy, socially liberal men who overwhelmingly support legalizing marijuana and want Bernie Sanders to be president.\" Penn described Kimmel viewers as \"conservative-leaning\" and Colbert viewers as \"liberal-leaning,\" while Fallon's fan base was described as \"swing.\"\n\nInterestingly, Fallon attracts the most female viewers, 55%, while 30% of Colbert's viewers describe themselves as atheist, the top \"religion category\" choice for \"The Late Show\" viewers.\n\nIn the overall poll, Fallon outperforms both Colbert and Kimmel by a 2-to-1 margin when viewers were asked which of the hosts is an \"unpredictable, cool dude you want to be friends with.\" However, Colbert's liberal appeal may be limiting his wider audience growth. According to Mediaite, \"over the first six weeks since launching, Colbert beat Kimmel by an impressive 40% in the demo, but by the first week of November, there was a dramatic 45% swing in Kimmel's favor.\"",
    " Title: Federal Judge Rules NSA Bulk Phone Data Collection Likely Unconstitutional\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant legal victory for privacy advocates, a U.S. District Court Judge has ruled that the National Security Agency's (NSA) bulk collection of phone records likely violates the Constitution, marking a major setback for the controversial intelligence agency.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon granted a preliminary injunction sought by plaintiffs Larry Klayman and Charles Strange. However, he also stayed his decision \"pending appeal,\" giving the U.S. government time to contest the decision over the next several months.\n\nThe judge wrote that he expects the government to \"prepare itself to comply with this order when, and if, it is upheld.\" The ruling is expected to reach the Supreme Court after the appeals court rules.\n\nThe ruling comes after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden began exposing secrets about the NSA's data collection over the summer. Snowden himself released a statement late Monday, saying, \"I acted on my belief that the NSA's mass surveillance programs would not withstand a constitutional challenge, and that the American public deserved a chance to see these issues determined by open courts.\"\n\nLeon granted the injunction sought by plaintiffs Larry Klayman and Charles Strange, concluding they were likely to prevail in their constitutional challenge. Leon, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, ruled that the two men are likely to be able to show that their privacy interests outweigh the government's interest in collecting the data.\n\nIn his 68-page, heavily footnoted opinion, Leon concluded that the government did not cite a single instance in which the program \"actually stopped an imminent terrorist attack.\" He added, \"I have serious doubts about the efficacy of the metadata collection program as a means of conducting time-sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats of terrorism.\"\n\nThe Obama administration has defended the program as a crucial tool against terrorism. However, in his opinion, Leon entered an order to bar the government from collecting \"any telephony metadata associated with their personal Verizon accounts\" and requiring the government to \"destroy any such metadata in its possession\" collected through the program.\n\nLeon stayed his ruling pending appeal \"in light of the significant national security interests at stake in this case and the novelty of the constitutional issues.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Bills Introduced to Strengthen U.S. Cybersecurity and Election Security\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of increasing cyber threats from foreign adversaries, the United States is taking steps to strengthen its cybersecurity and election security. Bipartisan bills have been introduced in an attempt to address the growing concerns over foreign interference in U.S. elections and the vulnerabilities in the country's digital infrastructure.\n\nThe Secure Elections Act, championed by Sens. James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), aims to strengthen voting systems while clarifying each individual state's role in administering federal elections. The bill recognizes the unique election infrastructure of each state and the importance of local election officials in modernizing those systems.\n\nAnother bill, the Defending Elections from Threats by Establishing Redlines (DETER) Act, has been proposed by Klobuchar and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). The DETER Act would impose sanctions on foreign countries that interfere in U.S. elections. To be most effective, the bill's proponents argue that democratic allies, especially those in Europe, should join in imposing these sanctions.\n\nThe Honest Ads Act, re-introduced by Klobuchar and Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), would subject online political ads to rules modeled on those in place for television and radio, in an attempt to safeguard U.S. politics from foreign disinformation campaigns.\n\nWhile these bills represent a strong first step toward ensuring that foreign adversaries will no longer attempt to influence the elections that represent the very heart of our democracy, they are not the only measures being considered. More bills continue to be introduced as the nation grapples with the complex issue of cybersecurity and election security.\n\nThe urgency of the issue is not limited to elections, however. Cyberattacks on cities such as Atlanta and Baltimore have crippled their digital infrastructure this year. Members of Congress have recognized the pervasive issue, but have expressed concerns over the limits of federal intervention.\n\nThe need for a bold, comprehensive plan that both parties can get behind is clear. The integrity of our elections, the security of our nation, and the well-being of our citizens depend on it. As in our past, history will judge the leaders who rise above the current political quagmire to defend, honor, and protect America for all of us today and for future generations.",
    " Title: Former President Jimmy Carter Urges Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp to Resign Over Election Oversight Amidst Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a personal plea, former President Jimmy Carter has called for the resignation of Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who is also a candidate in the upcoming gubernatorial election. Carter's appeal, made in a letter dated last Monday, was obtained by The Associated Press and later confirmed by a spokesperson for The Carter Center.\n\nThe letter, penned by Carter, emphasizes his extensive experience in assisting elections abroad, which led him to intervene in the ongoing dispute surrounding the Georgia gubernatorial race. Kemp has faced criticism for his decision to purge tens of thousands of voters from the voter rolls, a move made months after declaring his intent to run for governor.\n\nIn the letter, Carter expressed concerns about the integrity of the upcoming election, stating, \"In Georgia's upcoming gubernatorial election, popular confidence is threatened not only by the undeniable racial discrimination of the past and the serious questions that the federal courts have raised about the security of Georgia's voting machines, but also because you are now overseeing the election in which you are a candidate.\"\n\nCarter further argued that Kemp's role as both a candidate and the election authority runs counter to the fundamental principle of democratic elections, which requires an independent and impartial election authority.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Kemp's tenure as secretary of state is not limited to the voter purge. An APM Reports investigation found that removals have spiked during Kemp's time overseeing Georgia's election process, with more than 1.6 million names removed from the state's rolls in the past decade.\n\nFurthermore, a half-dozen civil rights groups recently sued the secretary of state over the delay of some 53,000 voter registration applications. Kemp's office has placed these applications on hold, citing questions about the applicants' citizenship status. According to the AP, nearly 70 percent of those pending registrations came from African-Americans.\n\nKemp's Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, is seeking to become the first black female governor in U.S. history. The civil rights groups suing Kemp allege that the protocol will have a discriminatory impact on African-American, Latino, and Asian-American applicants and will impose severe burdens on voting-eligible Georgians' fundamental right to vote.\n\nKemp has denied wrongdoing and has dismissed previous calls for him to step down as secretary of state. In response to Carter's letter, Kemp's campaign Communications Director Ryan Mahoney stated, \"It's sad that she's using the former president to do her dirty work.\"\n\nA federal district judge held an emergency hearing on the matter Monday. The civil rights groups suing want the judge to order more election workers eligible to check those documents to ensure a smoother election process.\n\nCarter's letter to Kemp was a broad plea to ensure the stability of Georgia's electoral process. He urged Kemp to step aside and hand over the responsibility of overseeing the governor's election to a neutral authority to foster voter confidence in the outcome. Carter acknowledged that this would not address every concern but would demonstrate a commitment to the importance of this key democratic principle.",
    " Title: Acting Homeland Security Secretary McAleenan Reports Significant Drop in Border Apprehensions for June\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan announced on Friday that the government anticipates a substantial decrease in illegal immigrant border apprehensions by up to 25 percent in June compared to May. McAleenan attributed this drop to a recent agreement between the U.S. and Mexico, as well as a new policy requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico until their U.S. court hearings.\n\nAt a news conference, McAleenan stated, \"It's become clear that over the past three weeks, since the administration reached a new agreement with Mexico, we've seen a substantial increase in the number of interdictions on the Mexican southern border and a sincere effort to address the transportation networks coming through Mexico.\"\n\nMcAleenan further explained, \"In terms of when we're going to know if these efforts in Mexico are making an impact, I think these three weeks have demonstrated that they are already. That 25 percent decrease in June is more than we've seen in past years.\"\n\nIn May, immigration authorities apprehended 144,000 illegal immigrants, the highest single-month number since 2006. NBC News reported that the projected decrease in border apprehensions could be attributed to summer conditions, as it is typical for border crossings to decrease during the summer months. However, McAleenan rejected this claim, stating that this year's May to June decrease is more significant than in previous years.\n\nDespite the positive news, McAleenan cautioned that officials will not know until the end of July whether their efforts \"are sustained and having a significant impact.\" During the press conference, McAleenan also addressed allegations in the mainstream media regarding the care of migrant children at detainment centers.\n\n\"Contrary to the reporting, children in CBP custody at the border are receiving access to key supplies, including toothbrushes, appropriate meals, blankets, showers as soon as they can be provided, and medical screening,\" he claimed.",
    " Title: \"2016 Presidential Election: Anxiety, Anger, and the American Voter\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, a wave of anxiety, fear, and anger is sweeping across the United States. This week, NPR and several member stations will be taking the pulse of the electorate in communities nationwide, providing insights into the mood of the voters.\n\nThe economic climate, terrorism, demographic change, and a gridlocked political system are some of the key factors fueling this voter discontent.\n\nEconomic Growth and Income Stagnation\n\nOne of the primary sources of voter frustration is the absence of broad-based economic growth that enables the American dream. According to Bill Galston, a former Clinton White House aide, \"people have gone a long time without making a lot of progress. They know it, they're feeling it, and they're not very happy about it.\"\n\nTerrorism and the War on Terror\n\nThe war on terrorism, following the December attack in San Bernardino, California, has brought the threat of terrorism home, causing widespread fear and anxiety. Despite differing opinions on the existential threat posed by ISIS, the reality of terrorism reaching U.S. soil is undeniable and unsettling.\n\nDemographic Change\n\nIn 2014, for the first time, the majority of American kindergarteners were minorities. Harvard political scientist Danielle Allen points out that in just a dozen years, majority-minority voting cohorts will enter the voting ranks. This demographic transition is causing tension, particularly in areas with a long-standing tradition of white political and social control, as the question of what happens next becomes increasingly pressing.\n\nImmigration and Anxiety\n\nImmigration has become a flashpoint, particularly in the Republican primaries. According to immigration expert Roberto Suro of the University of Southern California, it's not specific immigrants or immigration itself that voters are angry about. Instead, immigration serves as a vehicle to address a multitude of other concerns, such as jobs, terrorism, and the failure of government to perform basic functions, like policing the border.\n\nPolitical Gridlock\n\nExacerbating these anxiety-producing factors is a gridlocked political system that seems unable to solve significant problems, regardless of which party is in control. This gridlock has left voters frustrated and angry, particularly among Republicans, who feel betrayed by their own party's leaders in Washington.\n\nAnti-Elitism\n\nBoth Democratic and Republican populists are channeling this anti-elite sentiment, but in different directions. For Republicans, the focus is on government and professional experts, while for Democrats, and more left-leaning Democrats, the focus is on economic and financial elites.\n\nThe impact of this anti-elitism on the 2016 elections remains to be seen. As the primary season approaches, the elections will serve as a mirror, reflecting the feelings and desires of the American electorate.",

The meeting, which was not anticipated by the family, was arranged by the President himself, according to Radd Seiger, a spokesperson for the Dunn family.\n\nThe family, who were hoping to pressure the President to waive diplomatic immunity for the American woman suspected in the crash, found themselves in an unexpected encounter, with cameras poised to capture the encounter. The suspect, widely named as Anne Sacoolas by British media and politicians, has claimed diplomatic immunity and fled the UK earlier this October, despite initial claims of cooperation with the investigation.\n\nHarry Dunn was 19 when he was killed in the August accident. He was riding his motorcycle on the correct side of the road when the 42-year-old diplomat's wife, who has not been identified by authorities, drove out of the RAF Croughton US Air Force base onto the wrong side of the road and hit the teen head-on, according to Sky News.\n\nThe meeting between the Dunn family and President Trump was held at the request of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, according to White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. The purpose of the meeting, as stated by Grisham, was for the President to offer his condolences for the loss of Harry Dunn.\n\nHowever, the meeting did not go as planned. Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Charlotte Charles, Dunn's mother, revealed that they were not aware that Sacoolas was in the building and willing to meet with them. The family refused the meeting, stating that any potential encounter must take place on UK soil.\n\nThe incident has sparked outrage in the UK, with many calling for Sacoolas to return to the UK so the investigation can continue. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also expressed his hope that Sacoolas will return and engage with the UK's legal processes. As of now, Sacoolas has not spoken publicly about the incident and could not be immediately reached.\n\nThe Dunn family continues to plead for justice for their son, directly asking for Trump to send Sacoolas back to the UK. In an interview with Sky News, Charles said, \"President Trump, please listen. We're a family in ruin. We're broken. We can't grieve. Please, please, let her get back on a plane. Come back to the UK.\"\n\nThe incident has brought attention to the issue of diplomatic immunity and the challenges it poses in cross-border incidents. President Trump, in his comments to reporters, acknowledged the common occurrence of such accidents for visiting Americans due to the opposite direction of European roads. However, the meeting between the Dunn family and the President has added a new layer of complexity to the already sensitive issue.",
    " Title: California Files Lawsuit Against Trump Administration Over New Visa Rule Affecting International Students\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia has become the first state to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration over a new visa rule that requires international students to leave the United States if all their classes are online. The lawsuit, supported by the California State University system (CSU) and California Community Colleges officials, claims the rule unfairly harms international students and puts them, teachers, other students, and the community at large at risk of getting and spreading the coronavirus or being subject to deportation.\n\nIn a statement, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra expressed his disapproval of the policy, stating, \"Shame on the Trump Administration for risking not only the education opportunities for students who earned the chance to go to college, but now their health and well-being as well.\" He added, \"Not on our watch... Today's lawsuit rests on America's enduring principle that everyone who works hard and plays by the rules can earn a chance to get ahead. We'll see the Trump Administration in court.\"\n\nThe California State University (CSU) schools plan to mainly hold online classes in the fall due to the virus. CSU Chancellor Timothy White called the policy \"callous and inflexible,\" adding it places thousands of international students into an \"extremely difficult position.\"\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, has also urged the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to \"immediately rescind\" the new policy, warning of \"long-lasting harm.\" In a letter to Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, Collins called for the extension of an exemption adopted by ICE in March, which allowed international students with F-1 visas to attend classes online while retaining their visa status.\n\nThe new rule states that F-1 and M-1 visa holders \"must depart the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status,\" according to NBC News. The rule would also hurt colleges already struggling financially amid the outbreak since many colleges rely on international student tuition. California has more students on international visas than any other state, NBC reported.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks an injunction to block the policy and separately, the University of California plans to seek a restraining order as well. Becerra stated that this is the 86th lawsuit he has filed against the administration.",

The race has been marked by a series of secretly recorded tapes, eye-catching advertisements, and an unexpected endorsement from President Donald Trump.\n\nBoth Kemp and Cagle have emerged from a crowded field of candidates, neither of whom won more than 50% of the vote in the initial election to avoid a runoff. Kemp, who has branded himself as a \"politically incorrect conservative,\" made headlines in May for running an advertisement that boasted about his pick-up truck \"in case I need to round up criminal illegals.\"\n\nLast week, Trump endorsed Kemp, surprising the candidate who was in a press conference at the time. Kemp described Trump's endorsement as \"huge\" and compared it to \"pouring gasoline on a fire.\"\n\nCagle's candidacy has been marred by the release of several furtively-recorded audio tapes, including one in which Cagle allegedly offered to help pay off former gubernatorial candidate Clay Tippins' $300,000 in campaign debt in exchange for an endorsement. Cagle has denied the allegations, stating he never offered a bribe for any reason and that he was tired of \"antics\" in the race.\n\nIn another secretly recorded tape, Cagle seemed to disparage some of his constituents, saying the race was about \"who had the biggest gun, who had the biggest truck, and who would be the craziest.\"\n\nVice President Mike Pence made his presence felt in the race, headlining a rally for Kemp, whom he called \"tough on crime\" and \"strong on borders.\" Pence's appearance in Georgia followed a stop earlier in the day in Tennessee, where Pence touted Republican tax cuts and campaigned with two GOP congresswomen waging tough campaigns for statewide offices.\n\nThe winner of Tuesday's Republican contest will face Democrat Stacey Abrams in the general election in November. Abrams is seeking to become the first black female governor in the U.S.\n\nCagle, for his part, was making the rounds in northern Georgia on Saturday, attending events in Cleveland and Hiawassee, near the North Carolina border. Cagle tweeted, \"It's always good to be back... in Cleveland. This is our third time during this election cycle & I know we'll be back soon. Especially with the great advertising on the sign!\"\n\nThe race between Kemp and Cagle underscores the importance of the conservative base in Georgia and the influence of President Trump in shaping the political landscape of the state. Both candidates have frequently evoked Trump's name in their television ads, stump speeches, and debates. Trump has also endorsed Kemp, stating \"He will be a GREAT governor!\" on Saturday.",
    " Title: Democrats Focus on Presidential Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress in Impeachment Articles\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement last week that the Judiciary Committee would draft articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, the question on many minds was the nature of the charges to be levied. Would the articles be a broad, sweeping indictment of the president's alleged misdeeds spanning his three-year tenure, or would they focus primarily on the Ukraine controversy?\n\nDemocrats, it seems, have opted for a more straightforward approach, as encapsulated in the adage, \"keep it simple, stupid.\" They are presenting a clear-cut case of presidential abuse of power, alleging that Trump used the foreign policy apparatus for personal political gain. As a safeguard for these charges, they are accusing the president of obstructing Congress's investigation by withholding relevant documents and witness testimony.\n\nThe stakes, according to the Democrats, are high. They argue that the integrity of the 2020 presidential election and the protection of Congress as a co-equal branch of government are at risk. The anticipated course of action appears to be a swift vote in the Judiciary Committee, followed by a vote on the House floor, leading to presidential impeachment and a Senate trial.\n\nHowever, amidst this seemingly clear-cut path, a whirlwind of allegations and accusations continues to swirl, threatening to disrupt the process at any moment. These include claims of intelligence agency misconduct in the investigation of 2016 Trump-Russia ties, presidential Twitter barbs at the FBI director, criminal investigations of the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and more.\n\nWhile the main script may be clear, the underlying unpredictability is the only predictable outcome. The impeachment process promises to be a tumultuous journey, with the potential for further revelations and disruptions along the way.",

It doesn\u2019t work that way,\" Trump told reporters, referring to Iran.\n\nIran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded in his own tweet, warning that such strikes would violate international law. \"Having committed grave breaches of int'l law in Friday's cowardly assassinations, @realDonaldTrump threatens to commit again new breaches of JUS COGENS,\" Zarif tweeted. \"Targeting cultural sites is a WAR CRIME.\"\n\nThe president's remarks were also criticized by officials at Human Rights Watch, a leading international rights group, which warned that Trump was threatening \"war crimes\" by insinuating that cultural sites could be targeted. \"President Trump should publicly reverse his threats against Iran\u2019s cultural property and make clear that he will not authorize nor order war crimes,\" Andrea Prasow, acting Washington director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cThe US Defense Department should publicly reaffirm its commitment to abide by the laws of war and comply only with lawful military orders.\"\n\nTrump's comments come as tensions between the U.S. and Iran escalate following the death of Soleimani, a powerful military commander who was seen as a key architect of Iran's regional policy. The U.S. has accused Iran of planning attacks on American forces in the region, and Soleimani's death has been met with widespread condemnation from Iranian leaders.",
    " Title: Former Aides of Senator Max Baucus Raise Funds for His Re-election Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an effort to maintain an active network of support for his political career, Senator Max Baucus (D-MT) relies on the assistance of his former aides, who regularly contribute to his re-election campaign through fundraising events. These events, which include weekend retreats in Big Sky, Montana, and intimate gatherings in Washington D.C., have become a regular occurrence in the senator's political calendar.\n\nOne of the top contributors, Jeffrey A. Forbes, a former Finance Committee staff director for Senator Baucus, has donated at least $25,000 to the senator, his political action committee, or the Montana Democratic Party. Forbes, who attended the February retreat at the Big Sky resort, which included activities such as skiing, snowmobiling, and a family dinner at Buck \u2019s T-4 Lodge, has donated significantly more when contributions from his clients, including Verizon and Altria, and other partners at his lobbying firm, are taken into account.\n\nAccording to Paul Wilkins, Senator Baucus' chief of staff, the donations and fundraising efforts have been crucial to the senator's campaign, with an expected $4.6 million in hand by the end of this month, placing his campaign chest among the top 10 in the Senate. At a private event in a Capitol Hill townhouse owned by Federal Express, Wilkins thanked the former Baucus aides turned lobbyists for their support, stating, \"It is the basis of everything that we do.\"\n\nWhen asked about his comments later, Wilkins clarified that there is no expectation that former staffers do anything related to the office. He emphasized that the former aides who are now tax lobbyists are a small fraction of those who have worked for Senator Baucus over the years.\n\nComparatively, Senator Baucus' colleagues who have served more than two decades on the finance panel, such as Orrin G. Hatch (R-UT) and Charles E. Grassley (R-IA), have much smaller networks of former aides who are tax lobbyists, according to data collected by LegiStorm and the Center for Responsive Politics.",
    " Title: White House Accuses Senate Republicans of Political Obstruction in Delay of Loretta Lynch's Confirmation\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama has accused Senate Republicans of playing politics with law enforcement and national security by delaying the confirmation of Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch. In his weekly address to the nation on Sunday, Mr. Obama criticized the GOP for preventing the female federal prosecutor from New York from succeeding Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nThe nomination of Ms. Lynch has been stalled for more than 130 days due to concerns surrounding President Obama's executive action on immigration, which aims to provide temporary legal status to millions of illegal immigrants and reprieve from deportation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, is now using the nomination as leverage to pass the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, a bill containing language that would prohibit the use of restitution funds for abortions.\n\nPresident Obama nominated Ms. Lynch to replace Mr. Holder in November, and has become more vocal about the roadblocks that Republicans have set up for his nominee in recent weeks. Republicans control both the House and the Senate.\n\n\"No one can claim she's unqualified,\" Mr. Obama said during his weekly address. \"No one's saying she can't do the job. Senators from both parties say they support her. This is purely about politics.\"\n\nThe White House has criticized the delay of Ms. Lynch's confirmation vote on the Senate floor as \"an unconscionable delay.\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest described the obstruction as \"not speaking well of Republicans' efforts to run the Senate in an effective fashion and certainly not in a way that's in the best interest of the country.\"\n\nPresident Obama reiterated this point during an interview with Huffington Post, stating that it was wrong for Congress to hold the attorney general nominee hostage \"for other issues.\"\n\n\"Republicans promised that Congress would function smoothly with them in charge,\" Mr. Obama said during his weekend address. \"Here's a small chance for them to prove it.\"",
    " Title: U.S. House Judiciary Committee Intensifies Trump Investigation, Adopts Resolution for Impeachment Proceedings\n\nThe Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee has voted to intensify its investigation of President Donald Trump, moving closer to deciding whether to recommend impeachment. The 41-member panel adopted a resolution that allows it to designate hearings as impeachment proceedings, subject witnesses to more aggressive questioning, and quicken the pace of an investigation that is expanding into areas that could prove politically explosive for both Trump and Congress.\n\nIn a 24-17 vote along party lines, the committee adopted the resolution, which will initiate an aggressive series of hearings investigating allegations of corruption, obstruction, and abuse of power against the president. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler told reporters after the vote that the new procedures will lead to a series of hearings starting next week.\n\nThe more aggressive probe could increase pressure on House Democratic leaders, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted impeachment of Trump as a politically risky step for moderate Democratic freshmen from swing districts where ousting the president is an unpopular idea.\n\nIn response to the vote, Trump said in a statement posted to his Facebook page that if Democrats pursue impeachment, they will be dividing the nation. He also claimed that all the crimes were committed by the other side and that the investigation is a \"fantasy\" intended to distract from Democrats' unwillingness to have the full House authorize a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies charge that former U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign's possible collusion stemmed from an earlier effort to sink his candidacy and later his presidency by former officials at the Justice Department.\n\nRepublican lawmakers rejected the notion that the panel was pursuing an impeachment inquiry and dismissed the resolution as a \"fantasy\" intended to distract from Democrats' unwillingness to have the full House authorize a formal impeachment inquiry. They also denounced Thursday's action as a show intended to pander to Democratic voters who want Trump removed from office.\n\nCommittee Democrats plan to use the new tactics that allow an hour of questioning by committee lawyers of Corey Lewandowski, a close Trump confidant and one of his campaign managers in 2016. Lewandowski is due to appear before the panel next Tuesday for what may be a contentious hearing. Democrats expect his testimony to help lay out a charge of obstruction of justice. They are also pursuing allegations of campaign finance violations, witness tampering, and unlawful self-enrichment through his business ventures.\n\nDemocrats aim to decide by the end of the year whether to recommend articles of impeachment against Trump to the full House. If approved by the chamber, the Republican-controlled Senate would be left to hold a trial and consider the president's ouster.\n\nA recent head count shows that 135 House Democrats back an impeachment inquiry. While that is a majority of the caucus, the number is well short of the 218 votes needed to pass a resolution. Only two American presidents have been impeached by the House: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Clinton in 1999. Neither was convicted by the Senate. Nixon resigned in 1974 after the House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment against him, but before the full House voted on the matter.",
    " Title: Federal Court Hears Arguments in Halbig v. Sebelius Case Challenging ACA Subsidy Eligibility\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a federal court hearing on Tuesday, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) faced another legal challenge as a group of business owners and individuals argued against an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulation they deem unlawful and potentially burdensome. The contested regulation, stemming from the ACA, defines eligibility for subsidies in connection with obtaining health care coverage.\n\nThe plaintiffs in Halbig v. Sebelius argue that the plain text of the ACA, also known as ObamaCare, limits subsidies to applicants in states that have set up their own exchanges. The administration, which lost its bid to have the case dismissed, counters that the plaintiffs are misinterpreting the statute.\n\nSam Kazman, general counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, stated, \"Congress figured because it was loading up the state exchanges with a lot of goodies that just about every state would make the choice to participate.\" However, he noted, dozens of states \"said thanks, but no thanks.\" Kazman believes the IRS is collaborating with the administration to extend these attractive subsidies to all states, including those that opted out, a move that triggers both employer and individual mandates and penalties, crucial to funding the ACA.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paul Friedman posed tough questions to both sides during the hearing, inquiring about the extent and location of information needed to discern Congress's true intention. The plaintiffs maintain that the text of the law is clear, while the government argues that a literal and context-free reading would be nonsensical.\n\nJudge Friedman pledged to deliver a swift ruling, but did not provide a timeline. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for the ACA's implementation and funding.",
    " Title: The Federal Reserve: A Closer Look at the Power and Influence of the U.S. Central Bank\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a world where the Federal Reserve (Fed) often takes a backseat in media coverage, its influence and power cannot be underestimated. The Fed, created to prevent bank runs and provide stability, has become a subject of controversy and debate, with some arguing that it has the potential to destroy savings and shape the future.\n\nThe current Fed leadership, including outgoing Chairman Jerome Powell and his potential successor, Janet Yellen, have been criticized for their perceived lack of clarity and, at times, their role in increasing government control of the economy. The Fed's balance sheet currently stands at a staggering $4 trillion, a figure that has raised concerns among economists and politicians alike.\n\nRon Paul, the father of Senator Rand Paul, has been a vocal critic of the Fed for decades, stating that \"no secret cabal of government officials should have the authority to create money out of thin air.\" In the early 20th century, the Fed's monetary policies were blamed for fueling the Roaring Twenties and the subsequent Great Depression.\n\nDespite the Fed's initial purpose of preventing bank runs, its actions have been criticized for creating economic bubbles rather than fostering stability. The Fed's dual mandate of preserving a stable currency and reducing unemployment has been a subject of debate, with some arguing that it creates pressure to make politically-motivated decisions that may not always align with economic stability.\n\nThe Fed's role in economic management has been compared to a socialist planning board, with a small group of powerful individuals attempting to fine-tune the entire economy. This approach, some argue, has led to a series of economic bubbles rather than long-term stability.\n\nThe post-recession recovery, for instance, has been among the weakest on record, a fact that has led some to question the effectiveness of the Fed's policies. Comparisons have been drawn to Japan's economic struggles, where the central bank's stimulus efforts have failed to yield significant results over the past 15 years.\n\nIn contrast, countries like Canada, which had no central bank during the Great Depression, have been held up as examples of an alternative approach. During the 1930s, not a single Canadian bank failed, a stark contrast to the thousands of U.S. banks that did.\n\nThe massive bank bailouts of the past few years, which saw taxpayer money poured into the richest institutions, have been a subject of controversy. Critics argue that these institutions, and the Fed that dominates them, are too big and too powerful, risking a potential collapse that could drag the entire economy down.\n\nIn conclusion, the Federal Reserve, despite its initial purpose of preventing bank runs and providing stability, has become a subject of debate and controversy. Its role in economic management, and the potential impact of its policies on savings, the economy, and the future, cannot be ignored. As we move forward, it is crucial to consider alternative approaches, such as those seen in countries like Canada during the Great Depression, to ensure a more stable and sustainable economic future.",
    " Title: Democrats Plan to Counteract Trump's First Congressional Address with Diverse Guest List\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an effort to challenge President Donald Trump's policies and highlight the diversity of the United States, House Democrats are inviting guests to his first address to Congress who they believe will be affected by his administration's policies. The strategy aims to create an uncomfortable atmosphere for the President, as he is expected to face a crowd comprising ethnic minorities, LGBT individuals, undocumented immigrants, the disabled, and others.\n\nThis approach represents a shift in tactics for some Democrats, who boycotted Trump's inauguration last month in protest. However, there are no plans for a similar boycott of Trump's speech. Instead, the Democrats aim to bring attention to individuals who have made a positive impact on their communities despite facing discrimination or marginalization.\n\nIn a letter circulating on Capitol Hill, a group of liberal Democrats is urging their colleagues to bring guests who have been affected by discrimination or marginalization. The letter states, \"It is our hope that their presence in the House Gallery will remind President Trump that he is not the arbiter of patriotism. This country belongs to all of us, and his rhetoric of intolerance will not stand.\"\n\nThe authors of the letter include Reps. Jim Langevin (R.I.), who was shot accidentally as a teen and became the first quadriplegic to serve in Congress; Michelle Lujan Grisham (N.M.), head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus; Cedric Richmond (La.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus; Judy Chu (Calif.), head of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus; and David Cicilline (R.I.) and Jared Polis (Colo.), the co-chairman of the LGBT Equality Caucus.\n\nIn addition to the guest list, some Democrats are considering another form of protest during the speech: refusing to shake hands with Trump as he walks down the center aisle of the House chamber on his way to the dais. Rep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez (D-Ill.) stated, \"We have to have a higher standard.\" Rep. Filemon Vela (D-Texas) echoed, \"For sure I will not be nearby.\"\n\nTrump's campaign rhetoric was combative from the start, and he has continued this approach in the White House. Most recently, he temporarily banned all refugees from entering the U.S.\u2014 and Syrian refugees indefinitely\u2014as well as immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. This move sparked an outcry from Democrats and human rights groups, and drew thousands of protestors to airports and streets across the country.\n\nThe Democrats' strategy for Trump's speech to Congress is a response to this spirit of protest, as they aim to sustain the message of diversity, inclusion, and equality that they believe Trump has sought to undermine. The Democrats wrote in their letter, \"Instead of celebrating the very diversity that makes our country a beacon of inclusion and equality, he has chosen to vilify, bully, and alienate women, immigrants, people of color, people with disabilities, and people of differing faiths.\" They added, \"His rhetoric emboldens those who seek a scapegoat for the challenges this country faces.\"",
    " Title: GOP Senators Urge Trump to Invoke 'Snapback' Mechanism in Response to Iran's Nuclear Violations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint letter this week, three Republican senators have called on President Trump to reject what they term as Iran's \"nuclear blackmail\" in response to the Middle Eastern nation's violation of the 2015 nuclear agreement. The senators, Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), have urged Trump to invoke the \"snapback\" mechanism in a United Nations resolution that enshrines the deal, which could lead to the reinstatement of sanctions on Iran's uranium enrichment and missile development.\n\nIran has recently exceeded the agreed limits on low-enriched uranium, violating the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The senators' letter comes as Iran has signaled its intent to move towards a nuclear weapon while demanding concessions and promising to reverse its violations if its demands are met.\n\nThe senators argue that the U.S. should invoke the snapback mechanism in United Nations Security Council resolution 2231, which endorsed the Obama-era deal. The mechanism would allow for the reinstatement of sanctions on Iran's uranium enrichment and missile development. The senators also call on Trump to cease the use of \"civil-nuclear waivers\" that they claim allows Iran to maintain a nuclear status quo.\n\nThe preferred mechanism for disputes in the JCPOA is a joint commission of eight members to decide if it goes to the Security Council. However, Iran's threats to enrich uranium mean the process of bringing the snapback mechanism into effect will soon be tested.\n\nFrom 2006 onwards, the Security Council passed six resolutions that imposed severe sanctions on Iran in an attempt to halt its nuclear ambitions by banning Iran from conducting nuclear research and developing ballistic missiles.\n\nThe senators argue that the deal was designed to enable Iranian cheating and allowed hundreds of billions of dollars to flow into the Iranian regime's coffers, which was used to boost its military and terrorist activities regionally and globally, even as it maintained nuclear weapons infrastructure and periodically exceeded restrictions on nuclear materials.\n\nIt remains unclear how such a move would be received by America's European allies at the Security Council, who opposed the U.S. departure from the deal and have fought to keep the compact intact. However, ongoing interagency talks are happening now about using the snapback mechanism, and some officials want to move forward with the process now that Iran has violated the deal and the Europeans have failed to keep Iran in check.",
    " Title: Grand Jury Impaneled in Mueller's Russia Probe Signals Expansion of Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe impaneling of a grand jury by special counsel Robert Mueller has sent shockwaves through Washington, fueling speculation that the investigation into Russian election meddling is broadening in scope and intensity. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Mueller, whose team of prosecutors has grown to 16 in recent weeks, now has a dedicated pool of 23 grand jurors tasked with examining subpoenaed documents, listening to witness testimony, and ultimately deciding whether criminal charges are warranted.\n\nA spokesman for the special counsel declined to confirm or deny the existence of the grand jury. Legal experts suggest that the development is not unexpected, given that a special investigator with such a broad mandate from the Justice Department to probe allegations with proximity to the White House would be expected to convene a select grand jury.\n\nHowever, the Washington, D.C.-based grand jury is significant because Mueller reportedly already had a grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, for an investigation into the business dealings and campaign contacts of Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. If Mueller felt the investigation did not extend beyond Flynn, he would not have needed to impanel a new grand jury in the nation's capital, some say.\n\nThe existence of a grand jury indicates that Mueller will be pursuing criminal charges, even if the target of his investigation and the channels he might take remain a mystery. Mueller has subpoena powers and can compel witnesses to testify before his grand jury, which would also vote on whether to indict any of the subjects of his investigations.\n\nThe top-level legal talent that Mueller continues to accumulate, most recently Greg Andres of the New York law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, who left his partnership to join the team, is a sign to some that the special counsel is digging in for a months-long or even years-long investigation.\n\n\"This is going well into 2018, and whether it lasts beyond that is anyone's guess,\" said Robert Ray, the special counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton's Whitewater dealings. \"This is an indication that it will not be wrapped up in 30, 60, or 90 days.\"\n\nExperts cautioned against reading too much into the formation of a grand jury, which is an expected step for a seasoned prosecutor like Mueller. Plus, grand juries do not always return indictments. Ray's Whitewater grand jury did not result in criminal charges against the president.\n\n\"If I'm in Trump World, I don't know that this rattles me because it's not a surprise, but it's certainly not good news for the president,\" said John Wood, a former U.S. attorney. \"It's newsworthy because there was always the possibility the investigation would wrap up soon, and this is an indication it won't.\"\n\nHowever, it doesn't mean for certain that charges are coming. Grand juries are used for the investigation portion as well as for charges, so there may be no charges. It only tells us that Mueller is looking into more than Michael Flynn.\n\nThe pool of 23 ordinary citizens is expected to be called on weekly to examine Mueller's findings and hear from witnesses who will be compelled to testify under penalty of contempt. Grand juries typically last for 12 to 18 months but can last for years. It would require a majority of jurors\u201412\u2014to issue an indictment. Most grand juries are shared by multiple prosecutors, but it is expected that Mueller's will be his alone.\n\nThe investigation could go in any number of directions. CNN reported that subpoenas had been issued in relation to a meeting Donald Trump Jr. had with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower last year. A representative for the lawyer had claimed the lawyer had damaging information on then-Democratic presidential nominee, but all of the parties who attended the meeting claim the lawyer instead pushed for changes to a U.S. law that sanctioned Russia for human rights violations.\n\nSeveral media outlets have reported that Mueller's investigation could extend to Trump's business empire, which would be a controversial line of inquiry. \"If they're truly looking into potential financial crimes unrelated to Russia and the 2016 election, I'd say they're stepping outside of their delegated authority, and that would be very concerning,\" said former U.S. Attorney Matthew Whitaker. \"This shouldn't be a fishing expedition.\"\n\nBarring leaks, which have become commonplace in the Trump era, the grand jury and special counsel will operate largely in secrecy. It will likely not be known for some time who the targets of the investigation are or what paths the investigation takes.\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired, has testified that the president was never the target of an investigation when he was in charge of the bureau, in contrast to media reports that suggested otherwise. \"Comey said three times the president is not under investigation, and we have no reason to believe that has changed,\" said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has ratcheted up his attacks against Mueller in recent weeks. He has called the investigation a \"witch hunt\" and drawn attention to alleged conflicts of interest with members of Mueller's team. Trump's allies have described Mueller and Comey as close friends and have drawn attention to Democratic donations from some of the lawyers on the special counsel.\n\nThere has long been speculation that the president would fire Mueller or seek to have him removed, but Trump attorney Jay Sekulow swatted away that speculation in an interview on Fox News' \"Your World with Neil Cavuto.\"\n\n\"The president is not thinking about firing Robert Mueller, so the speculation that's out there is just incorrect,\" he said. Sekulow also downplayed the impaneling of the grand jury, saying it was expected. \"This is not a surprise because the impaneling of a grand jury in situations like this, when you've got an investigation, is typically how you move forward,\" Sekulow said. \"It is really much a standard operating procedure when you've got a situation like this, but with respect to the impaneling of the grand jury, we have no reason to believe that the president is under investigation here.\"\n\nWhite House special counsel Ty Cobb said he only learned of the grand jury through media reports. \"Grand jury matters are typically secret,\" Cobb said in a statement. \"The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly. The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Campaign Rally in Pensacola: A Mirror of Previous Criticisms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a campaign rally in Pensacola, Florida, Donald Trump appeared to employ a strategy reminiscent of a playground adage, as he seemed to deflect criticisms aimed at him by projecting them onto his opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump criticized Clinton for her lack of policy details, a point he often raises about her. However, Clinton had released a detailed 288-page book outlining her proposed policies the same day, as reported by NPR's Tamara Keith.\n\nTrump's assertion that Clinton could shoot someone in the middle of a crowd and not be prosecuted mirrors a statement he made about himself nearly nine months ago, during a campaign event in Sioux Center, Iowa. In that statement, he had said, \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I would not lose any voters.\"\n\nLater in the speech, Trump echoed another criticism that has been aimed at him, stating, \"She's trigger happy. Personally, I think she's an unstable person.\" Clinton has made similar arguments about Trump, stating that he is \"temperamentally unfit\" to be president and that his ideas are \"dangerously incoherent.\"\n\nThis pattern of projecting criticism onto others has been observed in Trump's recent speeches. Last week, Trump criticized Clinton for not providing specific policy details, despite her releasing a detailed policy book the same day. This was a criticism Clinton often brings up about Trump.\n\nIn a tweet on August 25, Trump accused Clinton of \"pandering to the worst instincts in our society.\" This was in response to a speech Clinton gave that day, in which she criticized Trump for \"building his campaign on prejudice and paranoia\" and \"reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.\"\n\nFor the rest of the night in Florida, Trump mostly stayed on his standard messages, including his promise to build a wall (with Mexico paying) and his friendly stance towards Russia. However, he did veer off course twice, suggesting that he would shoot Iranians circling U.S. destroyers and that they would be \"shot out of the water.\" This remark, along with the earlier comment about Clinton shooting someone, were both instances when Trump went off teleprompter, according to Bloomberg reporter Jennifer Jacobs.",
    " Title: The Impact of Political Leadership on the Severity of the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has taken a devastating toll on the global population, with over half a million deaths in the last four months. This rapid spread and high death toll are unprecedented, with the last time such a large number of people perished in such a short time being during the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nAs the world grapples with this viral onslaught, there is a growing concern that the lack of effective leadership is exacerbating the situation. The pandemic is not just a health crisis, but a political one as well, with leaders adopting extreme positions that leave citizens confused and directionless.\n\nIn the United States, for instance, the Lt. Governor of Texas disregarded state and federal medical authorities' guidance, leading to a surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations. This is a stark reminder that political goals should not take precedence over public health during a mass casualty event.\n\nThe current lack of leadership, combined with political negligence, has led to mass casualties among the nation's own citizens. The call for citizens to \"learn to live with the pandemic\" is concerning, as it implies accepting a high number of deaths and downplaying the severity of the crisis.\n\nAs a physician, it is disheartening to see science and collective knowledge being cast in doubt, while politically driven messaging takes center stage. Instead of politicizing protective behaviors such as mask-wearing, leaders should promote truth and scientific evidence.\n\nThe pandemic is a battle, and it requires a unified front to win. The ethical and moral questions surrounding the pandemic, such as the number of acceptable deaths, testing, and treatment, need to be addressed openly and honestly.\n\nHistory has shown us that true leadership emerges in times of crisis, and it is time for our leaders to step up and take charge. As President Harry S. Truman once said, \"It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.\" Let us hope for the emergence of such leadership in these trying times.\n\nThe pandemic affects everyone, regardless of political affiliation or socio-economic standing. It does not discriminate, and if left unchecked, it will continue to take lives indiscriminately. The best thing our politicians can do is to stop disseminating information based on political expediency and listen to science.\n\nIn conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic is a mass casualty event that requires effective leadership and a unified front to combat. The past is a reminder of things we may have forgotten, and it is crucial that we learn from history to ensure a better future for all.",
    " Title: GOP Veepstakes: Navigating the Fine Line Between Safe and Boring\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the race for the White House heats up, the Republican Party is carefully considering their vice presidential nominee, with names like Rob Portman, Tim Pawlenty, and Bobby Jindal being tossed around as potential running mates for Mitt Romney. The choice, however, seems to be leaning towards the \"safe\" and \"boring\" candidates, as the party aims to avoid any unscripted drama or controversy in the tight election race.\n\nSenator Rob Portman of Ohio, a top contender for the position, has been criticized for being too dull, with comedian Stephen Colbert jokingly referring to a potential Romney-Portman union as \"the bland leading the bland.\" However, Portman's friends argue that there is a hidden character beneath the wonk, with former New York congressman Rick Lazio stating, \"If you define exciting as a celebrity who invites controversy\u2014he\u2019s not that guy. But he\u2019s an interesting and fun-loving guy.\"\n\nDespite the recent buzz surrounding the addition of Condoleezza Rice, a concert pianist, figure skater, and fashion icon, to the ticket, the general consensus among party members is that this year's election calls for a \"tortoise\" rather than a \"hare.\" Republican strategist John Weaver stated, \"Boring is the most logical choice for Romney. Given the way the base so hates this president, they are going to be motivated regardless of who the vice president nominee is. So it makes more sense for him to go with [the] safer choice.\"\n\nTerry Holt, a Republican presidential campaign veteran and strategist, added, \"Just because someone seems interesting or flashy, that doesn\u2019t qualify them to be vice president. It\u2019s common for activists to try to and reach for the brass ring, to hope for someone who will somehow end up being the silver bullet to victory. Ultimately, for Romney, it\u2019s his leadership attributes that will determine whether or not people vote for him\u2014not who he picks for a running mate.\"\n\nAs the veepstakes race continues, the Republican Party is carefully weighing the importance of a safe and steady running mate against the need for excitement and charisma. The choice will undoubtedly play a crucial role in the outcome of the election.",
    " Title: \"Pence Tapped as Trump's 'Stability' Factor in 2020 Campaign Amid Suburban Voter Concerns\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, Vice President Mike Pence is being positioned as a key player in President Donald Trump's campaign, with a focus on appealing to suburban voters who may have reservations about the President's personality. According to a person close to Trump, Pence provides a sense of stability and helps reassure voters who may be uncomfortable with Trump's style.\n\nThe strategy is based on internal data and public polling that has shown wider gaps in Trump's favorability compared to Pence's among registered voters, suburban residents, and women. For instance, the latest \u2588\u2588\u2588/Morning Consult poll found that Trump's favorability was -15 among registered voters, -14 among suburban residents, and -25 among women, while Pence's was -6, -7, -16, respectively.\n\nPence's folksy Midwestern charm is seen as particularly effective in disarming suburban women who may be put off by Trump's behavior. He has also been successful in winning over white evangelical Christians, a demographic that quickly coalesced behind Trump when he chose Pence as his vice president.\n\nTrump himself has praised Pence, dismissing the idea of replacing him with a woman on the ticket. \"Mike Pence has done a phenomenal job as our vice president. He is our guy. He is my friend,\" Trump said last month on Fox News.\n\nCampaign officials describe Pence's role as one of \"reassuring and reinforcing\" the President's message. He is expected to focus on Rust Belt states that Trump narrowly won in 2016, while the President will handle larger rallies in more metropolitan areas. Pence will also get involved in second- and third-tier states, such as Minnesota, New Mexico, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and Ohio.\n\nThe strategy is rooted in the understanding that Trump's personality may be a liability with the exact voters the campaign needs to win over. Trump's personal style has been criticized for being abrasive and divisive, while Pence is seen as more measured and diplomatic. This dynamic was evident in their responses to the impeachment investigation, with Trump referring to the process as \"bullshit\" and Pence calling for those who do not support the President to resign.\n\nIn essence, the Trump campaign is leveraging the strengths of both men to appeal to a broader electorate. While Trump provides the star power and the broad strokes, Pence is tasked with the retail politicking and connecting with voters on a more personal level. This approach is not unlike past presidential tickets where vice presidents were chosen for their electoral potency rather than their policy expertise.",

The debate, which followed a vice-presidential debate on October 4, marked the third debate in the series.\n\nDuring the debate, both candidates discussed each other's treatment of women, with neither emerging unscathed. Hillary Clinton questioned Donald Trump's fitness to be president, while Trump countered by naming the victims of Bill Clinton's sexual advances and stating that Clinton should be ashamed of herself regarding their treatment.\n\nThe debate was met with criticism from various quarters, with left-leaning Politico describing it as \"brutal\" and former political reporter Ron Fournier calling it \"depressing.\" CNN's senior media correspondent Brian Stelter questioned, \"Where have I seen this version of Trump before? Oh, just remembered,\" as he tweeted out images of Trump from his pro wrestling days. CBS's Bob Schieffer labeled it \"WrestleMania.\"\n\nHowever, the liberal media's attempts to \"smack Trump around\" seemed to backfire, as moderators interrupted, talked over, and even debated Trump. Cooper and Raddatz were particularly criticized for their actions.\n\nOne of the most notable moments came when Raddatz lost her composure around the 68-minute mark, frustrated that Trump had not answered a question about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo as she desired. This led to an embarrassing exchange for Raddatz, which was widely criticized on Twitter.\n\nTwitter exploded with Raddatz criticism, with Trump adviser and former House speaker Newt Gingrich stating, \"Why is Raddatz debating Trump? Isn't that Hillary's job?\" At one point, Trump even promised to call a special prosecutor for Clinton's email scandal.\n\nReaction to the debate was predictably polarized, with media research center president Brent Bozell (Hint: My boss) criticizing the obvious debate bias when the issue of Russia trying to influence the election came up. Clinton foreign policy spokesman Jesse Lehrich took to Twitter to tell Trump to \"go f--k himself,\" while Politico reporter Louis Nelson took the pro-Raddatz media line.\n\nDebate panels were mixed about the result, with pollster Frank Luntz giving the win to Trump, while CNN's poll showed a narrow lead for Clinton. The debate involved questions from 40 \"uncommitted\" voters selected by Gallup.\n\nThe presence of four Clinton accusers in the front row of the debate audience served as a testament to how they had been treated by both Bill and Hillary Clinton. The debate dynamics were not exactly as the media planned, and this might have limited both the moderators and Clinton.",
    " Title: Senate Immigration Bill Clears Key Hurdle, Awaits Final Vote Amidst Tensions and Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nA Senate immigration proposal has cleared a significant hurdle, with at least 66 votes in favor, though the final tally is still pending as late-arriving lawmakers continue to vote. The measure requires 60 votes to pass. The vote, held on Monday, is on an amendment to the main bill, serving as a crucial test of the bill's overall support within the chamber.\n\nThe amendment, a bipartisan compromise on border security, has been met with criticism from some conservative Republicans, who argue that the Senate is rushing to vote on a bill that has not been thoroughly vetted. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) has been a vocal opponent of the bill, accusing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of cramming the amendment into the rest of the 1,200-page bill in an attempt to advance the legislation late Monday afternoon.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has stated that the bill is \"dead on arrival\" in the House, while Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a member of the bipartisan group that crafted the legislation, predicts the bill will receive 70 votes and will \"change the dynamic\" in the House.\n\nThe bill, if passed, would provide a years-long path to citizenship for the approximately 11 million illegal immigrants currently residing in the U.S. The amendment, championed by Sens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and John Hoeven (R-N.D.), would require an \"unprecedented surge of security\" on the border, according to Corker's office.\n\nPresident Obama is also hosting a meeting at the White House with business leaders to discuss immigration reform and push for support from the business community. The Congressional Budget Office has reported that the bill would increase the real GDP by up to 3.3 percent in 2023 and by 5.4 percent in 2033.\n\nThe Senate is aiming to gather at least 70 votes to demonstrate the bill's widespread bipartisan support and to give it momentum as it moves into the Republican-controlled House, where its future is uncertain. The bill's passage in the Senate could put pressure on House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to allow a full floor vote on the legislation.",
    " Title: Facebook Removes 1.5 Million Videos of New Zealand Mosque Shooting, Emphasizes Ongoing Efforts to Combat Violent Content\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting at two New Zealand mosques that left 50 people dead and dozens more injured, Facebook has announced the removal of 1.5 million videos related to the incident. Mia Garlick, spokeswoman for Facebook New Zealand, stated that approximately 300,000 videos were removed within the first 24 hours of the attack, with over 1.2 million being blocked at upload.\n\nGarlick, in a tweet, expressed, \"Out of respect for the people affected by this tragedy and the concerns of local authorities, we're also removing all edited versions of the video that do not show graphic content.\" Facebook is utilizing technology and personnel around the clock to remove content that violates its violence policy.\n\nMinutes before the attack, the alleged shooter posted a 74-page manifesto on Twitter and sent it to numerous officials and media outlets in New Zealand. The gunman also livestreamed the rampage via helmet cam on Facebook and Twitter. The footage of the massacre circulated for hours after the shooting, despite efforts by Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Reddit to take it down as quickly as possible.\n\nYouTube and Twitter issued statements, expressing their condolences and commitment to removing any violent footage. Twitter cited its \"rigorous processes and a dedicated team\" that activates in such emergencies, while YouTube emphasized its vigilant efforts to remove any violent content.\n\nChurch services and candlelight vigils were held across the nation of fewer than 5 million people on Sunday. Dozens of those wounded in the assault on the Al Noor and Linwood mosques remained hospitalized.\n\nNew Zealand Police, on Sunday, released some details of the initial response to the attack. New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush stated, \"Police received its first 111 call at 1.41pm. The first armed police unit was on scene at 1.47pm. That's six minutes to respond.\" The department's highly trained Armed Offenders Squad arrived within 10 minutes, and the 28-year-old suspect was in custody within 36 minutes, Bush said.\n\n\"I am very proud of the police response to this terrible attack,\" he added.",
    " Title: Court Rules Against Homeowner in Police Raid Destruction Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a ruling this week, a federal appeals court determined that a Colorado homeowner, Leo Lech, is not entitled to compensation for the destruction of his home during a police raid in 2015. The ruling comes after a two-day operation in which local police responded to a burglary with a display of force typically reserved for high-risk situations, resulting in the complete demolition of Lech's home.\n\nThe raid, which left Lech and his family homeless, had no connection to any of the family members. They were not even home when an armed shoplifter broke into their house on South Alton Street in Greenwood Village. The police response, as detailed by Jay Stooksberry in the December 2017 issue of \u2588\u2588\u2588, involved high-caliber rifles, chemical agents, flash-bang grenades, remote-controlled robots, armored vehicles, and breaching rams. At one point during the operation, an armored vehicle was driven through the home's front door.\n\nThe house was deemed unlivable, and Greenwood Village condemned the structure, forcing Lech to have it torn down. The city offered a mere $5,000 to cover the damage, prompting Lech to file a lawsuit. Lech claimed the city was liable under the Constitution's takings clause, which forbids governments from taking private property for public use without \"just compensation.\"\n\nIn 2016, a federal district court ruled in favor of the city, a decision that was upheld by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in this week's ruling. The three judges ruled that police cannot be held liable for damage caused while trying to apprehend a suspect.\n\nLech received a $345,000 payout from his homeowner's insurance, but this was not enough to cover the full value of the home, which was appraised for $580,000. The payout did not cover the costs of demolition or the loss of other property inside the home. As a result, Lech had to take out a $390,000 loan to cover the costs of rebuilding, as reported by Stooksberry in 2017.\n\nLech and his attorneys have indicated plans to appeal the decision to a full panel on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and potentially take the case to the Supreme Court.",
    " Title: \"Gallery Owners Settle Discrimination Lawsuit Over Same-Sex Wedding Refusal\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a turn of events that marked a significant shift in the dynamics of a small town, a local gallery owner, Mr. Odgaard, found himself on the opposite side of a discrimination lawsuit in 2013. The lawsuit was filed by a same-sex couple, Lee Stafford and Jared Ellars, who were denied service at Mr. Odgaard's gallery, G\u00f6rtz Haus, for their wedding.\n\nThe incident occurred on August 3, 2013, when the couple, who had already sent out their wedding invitations, approached Mr. Odgaard for assistance due to their original venue going bankrupt. After a 45-minute meeting, during which seating arrangements, flowers, and gluten-free meals were discussed, the couple was abruptly rejected.\n\nMr. Ellars, 35, a database administrator, recalls the moment vividly, \"I'll remember these words for the rest of my life.\" He continued, \"He looked at us and he said, 'I can't take your money, and we don't do anything for free.'\"\n\nThe couple, who have been together for 13 years, never intended to put the Odgaards out of business. Instead, they hoped the gallery would cease discriminating against same-sex couples and refrain from subjecting future couples to the rejection they experienced. The case was settled in arbitration, with the Odgaards paying $5,000 to Mr. Stafford and Mr. Ellars, a sum they donated to an anti-bullying program for gay students.\n\nThe couple's wedding was held in a barn, officiated by a minister from the Disciples of Christ church, which Mr. Stafford attends. To this day, Mr. Stafford, who is 43 and a business systems analyst, remains troubled by the ongoing debate over religious liberty, stating, \"Their religious beliefs say they don't approve of gay marriage, but my religious beliefs say that we can. Why does their religion trump mine?\"\n\nThis incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by same-sex couples in areas where religious beliefs and civil rights intersect, sparking discussions about equality, religious freedom, and the balance between the two.",
    " Title: '2020 Democratic Primary: A Shift in Progressive Allegiances as Sanders Consideration Looms'\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2020 Democratic primary race heats up, the question of whether Senator Bernie Sanders will join the fray is causing a split among progressive voters in New Hampshire. In 2016, Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, created a powerful progressive movement in a thin primary field. However, with nearly every other Democratic presidential contender adopting his positions on issues like health care and minimum wage, progressive voters in 2020 have a plethora of choices.\n\nElizabeth Ropp, an acupuncturist who made homemade signs for Sanders in 2015, expressed her desire for Sanders to run again in 2020. \"I want to see Bernie run, even if the field is crowded,\" she said. \"We need Bernie to run.\"\n\nArnie Arnesen, a radio show host and former New Hampshire politician, is one of many who question whether Sanders is the right candidate for the White House. \"My question is, does he provide added value in this campaign for 2020? Or are there a lot of people who sort of carry very similar messages?\" she asked. \"Does it have to be him? I don't think it does, and I admire him. I admire him to pieces.\"\n\nThe change in the political landscape is evident in the emergence of candidates like Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who resigned as vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee to endorse Sanders in the 2016 primary. Gabbard recently launched her own presidential bid.\n\nSanders' first decisive victory in 2016 came in the New Hampshire primary, where he crushed Hillary Clinton by 22 percentage points. And activists like Andru Volinsky were part of the reason he did so well. Volinsky, Sanders' New Hampshire campaign lawyer during the 2016 primary, said that if the Vermont senator were to run for president again, he would be his top choice.\n\nHowever, it's unclear whether Volinsky personally wants Sanders to run. \"I want a strong advocate for addressing issues like income inequality and health care access and climate action,\" said Volinsky. \"Sen. Sanders could be that strong voice. There are some others that could as well.\"\n\nMany voters who strongly backed Sanders in 2016 say they realize Sanders is not necessarily the only progressive option in 2020. For some, that's confusing, but for others, it's appealing.\n\nArnesen is excited by many of the candidates considering a run for the presidency; many of them, she believes, carry elements of Sanders' message. For example, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, she says, has a lot of the same \"authenticity\" as Sanders \"without being 80 years old\" when he's elected (Sanders turns 79 in 2020).\n\nSome Sanders supporters also say the political environment has changed since 2016, and they want a candidate who can win. \"Electability has leaped to the forefront for me,\" said Ron Abramson, an immigration lawyer who served as a Sanders delegate to the DNC. \"I am prepared to support anyone who can help restore some measure of sanity [and] humanity.\"\n\nHowever, not all Sanders supporters are convinced he is the right person for the job. Bill Stelling, an activist who runs an art gallery in Manchester, is impressed with California Sen. Kamala Harris; he thinks she's \"fearless.\" He's also intrigued by Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman who tried to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz last year. This week, Stelling is going to a \"Draft Beto\" house party.\n\nThe divide among progressive voters in New Hampshire is a testament to the impact Sanders had in the 2016 primary and the evolution of the Democratic Party. As the primary race progresses, it will be interesting to see whether Sanders decides to run and, if he does, how progressive voters will respond.",
    " Title: Republican Divide on Abortion Laws: Trump, Romney, and McCarthy Question Recent Pro-Life Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - From Alabama to Missouri, pro-life laws are sweeping across the country, but there is a growing divide among Republicans over just how far these laws should go. President Trump recently took to Twitter to tout his pro-life victories, but there's something about the tweets that made abortion opponents take a second look.\n\n\"I am strongly pro-life, with the three exceptions of rape, incest, and protecting the life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan,\" Trump tweeted. He is not alone, as other leading conservatives question if recent laws go too far.\n\n\"I do not support the Alabama law. I believe there ought to be exceptions. I am pro-life but there ought to be exceptions,\" Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) told CNN's State of the Union.\n\n\"In my whole political career, I also believed in (exceptions for) rape, incest, or life of the mother. There were exceptions, that's exactly what Republicans have voted on in this House,\" said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).\n\nFor some pro-life advocates, the recent laws are merely an opening battle for a war at the Supreme Court. \"Actually, for the future of our country, Roe is destined to become a historical footnote,\" said Kristan Hawkins of Students for Life of America. \"No law is constitutional until the Supreme Court actually revisits Roe v Wade,\" said Alabama state Rep. Terri Collins.\n\nWhen it comes to the life issue, the Trump administration says nobody has worked harder to fight abortion, appointing conservative judges from the lower courts on the federal level all the way to the US Supreme Court. \"We stand without apology for the sanctity of human life,\" Vice President Mike Pence recently told graduates of Liberty University.\n\nIt's a battle they vow to continue, and one that Democratic presidential candidates welcome. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) hope to codify Roe v Wade into federal law.\n\n\"President Trump has started a war on America's women. If it's a fight he wants to have, it's a fight he's going to have,\" Gillibrand told CBS' Face the Nation. \"If you are asking me would I ever appoint a Supreme Court justice who does not believe in defending Roe v Wade, who does not believe a woman has a right to control her own body, I will never do that,\" vowed 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in an interview with NBC's Meet the Press.\n\nThis week, the justices will decide whether to hear a case out of Indiana requiring women to get an ultrasound 18 hours before an abortion.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Senators Express Optimism for Immigration Reform Amidst Shifting Republican Stance\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan group of senators expressed optimism on Monday regarding their proposal for major immigration reform, following the failure of a previous congressional push in 2007. However, with the memory of the last attempt still fresh, many are questioning the likelihood of success this time around.\n\nIn a press conference, Republican Sen. John McCain, when asked by CNN's Dana Bash about the optimism, attributed it to the changing political landscape, particularly the Republican Party's dwindling support among Hispanic voters. \"Elections,\" McCain said, \"have played a significant role.\"\n\nThe Republican Party has seen a decline in support from the Latino community over the past three presidential elections. In 2012, President Obama won the support of 71% of Latinos, compared to 27% for Mitt Romney. In 2008, 31% of the Latino vote went to John McCain, while 44% turned out for then-President George W. Bush in 2004.\n\nSince the election, leading Republicans have taken a more conciliatory tone on immigration, with many acknowledging the need to adjust their messaging to appeal to a broader electorate. Speaking later on CNN's \"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,\" McCain suggested that the shift might not be entirely politically motivated, but rather a recognition of the changing demographics and the need to avoid further polarizing the Latino/Hispanic vote.\n\nPolls during the election indicated that the economy, not immigration, was the top issue for Latino voters. A CNN poll conducted a little over a month before the election showed that 44% of Latino adults rated the economy as their top issue, while immigration policy came in a distant second at 14%. When asked to choose between the economy and immigration, nearly three-quarters of Latinos \u2013 74% \u2013 said the economy was more important.\n\nHowever, more than three-quarters of Latino voters in exit polls said that undocumented immigrants should be offered the chance to apply for legal status.\n\nSen. McCain acknowledged other reasons for the renewed drive on illegal immigration legislation, such as the humanitarian and economic challenges posed by the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. He also predicted a challenging road ahead, stating, \"Let me emphasize, there will still be fights. There will still be battles. But I am more confident now that I have ever been that we can reach an agreement and have a bill signed by the president.\"",
    " Title: \"The Roots of American Pro-Israeli Attitudes: A Deep Dive Beyond the Jewish Lobby\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the latest political controversy, Representative Ilhan Omar's comments on the influence of the Jewish lobby have sparked a heated debate, with critics accusing her of perpetuating age-old stereotypes and aiding Republican efforts to paint any criticism of Israeli policies as a slippery slope to anti-Semitism. However, a closer examination of the factors influencing American pro-Israeli attitudes reveals a more complex picture.\n\nOmar's recent remarks, in response to a tweet by journalist Glenn Greenwald, have ignited a firestorm of criticism from both parties. The exchange with a writer for The Forward led to accusations that Omar is consciously promoting the ancient smear of wealthy Jews buying influence, while some defenders suggest she is accurately describing the power of AIPAC, the influential pro-Israel lobbying group.\n\nWhile Omar's remarks do not necessarily indicate anti-Semitic sentiments, they do tap into stereotypes that aid Republican efforts to portray any criticism of Israeli policies as a slippery slope leading to the propagation of the \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\" It is crucial for Omar to avoid such characterizations, as they oversimplify the complexities of American pro-Israel attitudes.\n\nAmericans' pro-Israel sentiments are rooted in a deep understanding of the Holocaust and Jewish statelessness as primary reasons for the atrocity. Compared to the average American's limited awareness of Palestinian history, this awareness of the Holocaust and Jewish statelessness is widespread and acute.\n\nBeyond this, there is a specific set of religious perspectives that make America more pro-Israel than similar but more secular countries. Many Christians from various traditions have a bad conscience over centuries of Christian anti-Semitism. A particularly large and politically active group of conservative American Evangelical Christians not only identify with Jews due to a common scriptural legacy but also place the State of Israel at the very center of their vision of global salvation.\n\nMany conservative Evangelicals believe that in consolidating their hold over a Greater Israel, the Jewish State is unwittingly setting the stage for the end of the world and the second coming of Jesus Christ. These conservative Evangelicals, who are not fond of Muslims, have become the single most important constituency in the Republican Party's base, and their influence has more to do with the GOP's solidarity with a particular strain of Zionism than all the AIPACs and Sheldon Adelsons combined.\n\nThis phenomenon, where conservative Evangelicals drive American policy toward Israel and the Palestinians, has alarmed many strong supporters of Israel. In 2018, a piece in The Forward noted that Vice President Mike Pence's on-again, off-again visit to Israel was never the real thing. The actual timing was never the real issue. Pence and other deeply conservative white Christian evangelicals are playing a very long game that extends far beyond one news cycle.\n\nThey are turning public support for Israel\u2014which had been bipartisan and religiously pluralistic\u2014into an effort propelled by members of one political party and one religious worldview. Their belief that Jews, and only Jews, must rule over Jerusalem to herald the return of Jesus Christ influenced President Trump's decision last December to reverse nearly seven decades of American foreign policy and recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Their absolute fealty toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and their antipathy toward the Palestinians are reflected in the itinerary for next week's trip: Pence is not scheduled to meet with any Palestinian leader, the first time in decades for a top American official.\n\nThe idea that it's \"Jewish money\" or \"the Jewish lobby\" or AIPAC that's the main reason Republicans have moved in this direction is an absolute distraction from the real reasons, and one that furthers the argument that you have to choose between Netanyahu, settlements, and Greater Israel on the one hand, or anti-Semitism on the other. To the very limited degree that AIPAC really matters, it does not do so by deliberately alienating Democrats or insisting that any criticism of the current government of Israel or of the United States is rooted in anti-Semitism. This Republican party line, which I'd argue is as perilous for Israel as it is for Palestinians, comes from other sources.\n\nIf Ilhan Omar understands that, she should make it clear before she inadvertently becomes a casualty in the war of anti-Muslim extremists against anyone seeking peace and justice in the Middle East.",
    " Title: Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren Officially Announces Exploratory Committee for 2020 Presidential Race\n\nIn a move that marks the beginning of a potentially crowded Democratic primary field, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has announced the formation of an exploratory committee, signaling her intention to seek the Democratic nomination for president in 2020. The announcement was accompanied by a pitch to voters, delivered in a 4 1/2 minute video emailed to supporters on New Year's Eve.\n\nIn the video, Warren, a populist political figure, recounted her middle-class background and her work on consumer financial protections. She emphasized the middle class's vulnerability in the face of corporate and right-wing attacks, including President Trump, whom she vowed to defeat in 2020.\n\nWarren's potential strengths in the upcoming contest include her track record of addressing economic concerns and her demonstrated willingness to challenge President Trump. However, she is a polarizing figure who may face challenges in crafting her own narrative, given her portrayal as a liberal elitist by conservatives, who point to her background as a Harvard law professor.\n\nBefore her 2012 election to the Senate, Warren had never held elected office. Nevertheless, she has been a liberal icon since before her Senate tenure. As a professor turned consumer advocate, she played a significant role in the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a watchdog agency created in response to the 2008 financial crisis. Her outspoken criticism of the banking industry has also earned her the ire of some conservatives.\n\nDuring her Senate years, Warren is best known for her sharp interrogations of financial executives. In 2016, she famously told the then-CEO of Wells Fargo to resign for overseeing the bank during a period when it created fake accounts.\n\nSpeculation about Warren running for president began shortly after her Senate election in 2012. In 2016, many progressive groups urged her to run for president, and her hometown newspaper, the Boston Globe, even ran an editorial arguing that \"Democrats need Elizabeth Warren's voice in the 2016 presidential race.\" Warren declined the opportunity, but four years later, she is now ready to enter the race, albeit facing a larger field, including potential progressive favorites like Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and several other senators expected to join the fray.\n\nIn a statement, Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, expressed enthusiasm for Warren's entry into the race, stating, \"Senator Elizabeth Warren's formal entrance into the 2020 race for President today helps launch what we believe will be a vibrant discussion of bold, inclusive populist ideas in the Democratic Primary.\"\n\nTrump, who has frequently mocked Warren, referring to her as \"Pocahontas,\" is likely to relish Warren's entry into the contest. In October 2018, Warren released the results of a DNA test showing Native American ancestry, a move intended to quiet critics but which became a cultural faux pas. The Cherokee Nation called the DNA testing \"useless.\"\n\nWarren's campaign pitch appears to target voters of diverse cultural, geographic, and economic backgrounds with an anti-corporate, pro-worker message. One of the criticisms of Hillary Clinton's 2016 bid was a focus on appealing to specific demographic groups, which some argue alienated white, working-class voters who supported Trump. In her launch video, Warren touched on her working-class childhood in Oklahoma, discussing how her mother got a minimum wage job at Sears when her father got sick to keep the family in their home.",
    " Title: President Obama Pushes for Global Climate Pact at Paris Summit, Faces Domestic Opposition\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama embarked on a mission to secure a global climate accord at the onset of a significant summit in Paris on Monday, despite facing resistance from domestic Republican opposition and states concerned that the president's proposals could lead to job losses.\n\nThe president joined over 150 world leaders for the two-week conference, where countries are attempting to negotiate an agreement aimed at curbing an increase in global temperatures. In his opening remarks, Obama described the meeting as a potential \"turning point\" in the fight against climate change.\n\n\"What should give us hope that this is a turning point, that this is the moment we finally determined we would save our planet, is the fact that our nations share a sense of urgency about this challenge and a growing realization that it is within our power to do something about it,\" Obama said.\n\nThe Paris summit takes place in the aftermath of the devastating terrorist attacks in the city, and some Republicans have questioned whether Obama is prioritizing global warming over security. However, Obama on Monday characterized the negotiations as an \"act of defiance\" towards the attackers.\n\n\"What greater rejection of those who would tear down our world than marshaling our best efforts to save it?\" Obama said. The president emphasized that, as the leader of the world's largest economy and second-largest emitter (after China), \"we embrace our responsibility to do something about it.\"\n\nIn addition to the climate negotiations, Obama held one-on-one meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the summit. He also met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss security matters, including the civil war in Syria and the recent downing of a Russian jet by Turkey.\n\nWhile Obama is actively advocating for a climate deal, he faces practical challenges at home. The president has pledged that the U.S. will cut its overall emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent by 2030, with a focus on reducing emissions from U.S. power plants. However, half the states are suing to block the power plant rules, claiming Obama has exceeded his authority under the Clean Air Act.\n\nFurthermore, Republicans in Congress are threatening to block funding for the U.N. Green Climate Fund, a mechanism designed to aid poorer countries in combating climate change. In the days leading up to the Paris summit, Republicans warned that any Paris deal with legally binding provisions must be submitted to the Senate for a vote. Without Senate approval, they warned, lawmakers will not authorize Green Climate Fund funding.\n\nThe Paris conference aims to establish the most comprehensive agreement ever to address global warming. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol required only rich countries to cut emissions, and the U.S. did not sign on. Among the key issues under discussion is financing, including how much rich countries should invest to help poor countries cope with climate change, how much should be invested in renewable energy, and how much traditional oil and gas producers stand to lose if countries agree to reduce emissions.\n\nIn an effort to address these issues, at least 19 governments and 28 leading world investors have announced billions of dollars in investments for clean energy technology research and development, with the goal of making it more affordable. Backers include Obama, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, billionaires George Soros and Saudi Prince Alaweed bin Talal, and Jack Ma of China's Alibaba.\n\nIn addition to the climate discussions, Obama also met with Putin to discuss the Syrian conflict and the recent downing of a Russian jet by Turkey. According to a White House official, Obama \"expressed his regret for the recent loss of a Russian pilot and crew member and reiterated the United States' support for de-escalation between Russia and Turkey.\" Obama also reiterated that Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad must leave power as part of any political transition.",
    " Title: House Freedom Caucus Members Call for Removal of Rep. Adam Schiff as Impeachment Inquiry Leader\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a letter sent Wednesday, 19 members of the House Freedom Caucus, including new Chairman Andy Biggs, have demanded House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to remove Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat and intelligence committee chairman, from leading the impeachment investigation.\n\nThe Caucus members argue that Mr. Schiff's interactions with the whistleblower who filed the initial complaint before the complaint over President Trump's call with the Ukrainian president was filed, make him a potential fact witness and unfit to lead the investigation.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the whistleblower, who accused the president of trying to pressure Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter, first approached an intelligence committee staffer who then relayed some \"vague\" information to Mr. Schiff. The committee aide then directed the whistleblower, per standard protocol, to Michael Atkinson, the inspector-general for the intelligence community.\n\nIn a statement last month, Mr. Schiff said his team has not spoken directly with the whistleblower. \"We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower,\" he told MSNBC last month. \"We would like to, but I'm sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the inspector general or the director of national intelligence just how he is supposed to communicate with Congress, and so the risk to the whistleblower is retaliation.\"\n\nHowever, media reports this week have surfaced contradicting that account, with The New York Times and others reporting the whistleblower had reached out to a House Intelligence Committee aide before filing the complaint.\n\nMr. Biggs stated that the Ukraine allegations are just the latest \"fairy tale\" Mr. Schiff is using to try to impeach the president. \"Mr. Schiff is hardly an unbiased arbiter of this unauthorized impeachment process, and we call for his immediate recusal,\" he said.\n\nIn the letter, the Republicans argue that Mr. Schiff should be questioned himself regarding his interactions with the whistleblower. \"The public knows little else about Chairman Schiff's dealing with the whistleblower because Chairman Schiff has failed to disclose the interaction,\" they wrote.\n\nThey also argue that Democrats demanded Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and the previous head of the intelligence panel, recuse himself from the Russia investigation because of his private meetings with a source.\n\nLast week, Mr. Schiff accused Republicans of merely trying to protect the president. \"Republicans continued the president's strategy of deflection by making the absurd claim that because a whistleblower contacted the committee seeking guidance, the committee can not conduct an investigation into the complaint,\" Mr. Schiff said.\n\n\"If that were true, no whistleblower could contact Congress and no committee could conduct an investigation,\" he continued. \"What the Republicans fear most is the truth. To avoid the facts, they stage confusion, undermine the Constitution, and attack the person the President fears most, Adam Schiff,\" she tweeted.",
    " Title: White House Aides Struggle to Control President Trump's Media Engagements\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, White House aides this week claimed that President Donald Trump has \"sworn off\" his regular viewing of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" and many of his favorite CNN programs. However, last Tuesday, the morning of his well-received speech to a joint session of Congress, Trump reportedly spent 15 minutes chatting with Joe Scarborough, the host of \"Morning Joe,\" in the Oval Office, an MSNBC spokesperson confirmed.\n\nThe apparent disconnect between some aides' insistence that Trump is taking his feud with the media seriously enough to turn off the TV, and his tendency to grant access to hosts of his favorite shows, suggests that aides have not yet figured out how to curb their boss's habits.\n\nTrump's relationship with Scarborough is not the only one of the president's old ties that his aides have tried to downplay. Trump's aides and advisers have declared that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is not that close to the president and has lost clout since he was unceremoniously ousted from leading the transition team shortly after the Nov. 8 election. However, Trump frequently calls Christie to ask his opinion on the administration's performance, and to kibbitz about New York or whatever is happening that day, according to several people close to Trump with knowledge of the conversations.\n\nThe president also sought to appoint Christie as labor secretary after Trump's first nominee, Andrew Puzder, dropped out, even though some of his top advisers disapproved of the move. Christie declined the offer.\n\nAides have also tried to de-emphasize the president's friendship with Chris Ruddy, the CEO of Newsmax Television, who, in a CNN appearance last month, criticized Chief of Staff Reince Priebus as ineffective. \"Don't listen to Ruddy,\" one senior administration official said after Ruddy's appearance. \"He's trying to get attention. Trying to be important.\"\n\nRuddy, who has known Trump for more than a decade, talks to the president frequently\u2014including a 30-minute meeting in the Oval Office on Wednesday. And some of Trump's aides feared that Ruddy was speaking on the president's behalf when he criticized Priebus on television, because the two men had seen each other for 30 minutes the night before at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nRuddy told The New York Times that he was speaking only for himself, and that Priebus had called him after the interview to ask him to keep an \u201copen mind.\u201d A week later, Priebus and Steve Bannon had a long dinner with Ruddy, according to a person familiar with the event.\n\nSome in the White House have balked at Anthony Scaramucci, the New York financier who is disliked by some of the president's aides. But Scaramucci has the president's cellphone number and continues to speak to him, according to people familiar with their calls.\n\nCorey Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager, who was purged last summer, still occasionally talks to the president and came in for a meeting last week with Trump, several people familiar with the calls and the meeting say.\n\nSome people familiar with the meeting said Lewandowski's continued relationship with Trump is frustrating for West Wing aides. Lewandowski declined to comment.\n\nOne senior White House official disclaimed any knowledge of Trump's calls with Christie and Scaramucci, but did not deny that they occurred.\n\nTrump keeps his own cellphone and is often alone in the West Wing at night, where he answers calls and dials people. He will sometimes ask his secretary to set up a meeting or put him on the phone with someone after seeing that person on TV.\n\n\"He talks to people in New York that his aides in the White House have no clue who they even are,\" said a person who regularly talks to Trump. \"They've never even met some of these people, but the president listens to them.\"\n\nThe White House official confirmed Trump often calls people after seeing them on television, either to thank them for their comments or to engage further about the topic of discussion.\n\n\"That\u2019s true, he\u2019s done that for 40 years,\" the White House official said, adding that it\u2019s \u201ca great thing that he communicates with a lot of different people.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Signs Defense Bill, Issues Veto Threat on Select Provisions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that signifies a shift from his previous stance, President Barack Obama has signed into law a $633.3 billion defense bill, while simultaneously issuing a \"signing statement\" that outlines his intention to interpret the law as he sees fit on several contentious issues. The 680-page bill, which the president agrees with \"the vast majority\" of its provisions, contains provisions that he finds objectionable, particularly those related to the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees and the rights of military chaplains.\n\nThe president's objection to Section 1027 of the law renews the prohibition against transferring detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba to the United States. He argues that this provision violates constitutional separation of powers principles and could lead to constitutional conflicts. The president also objects to a provision that gives service members and military chaplains the legal right to oppose homosexuality and the gay lifestyle, stating that the military already provides freedom of conscience to its chaplains and service members.\n\nIn addition, President Obama objects to a provision that blocks proposed increases in health insurance fees for service members, stating that it could result in deeper cuts to military personnel. The Defense Department had proposed significant increases in Tricare fees for working-age retirees and their families, but the new law blocked that effort, limiting fee increases to the increase in the cost of living.\n\nThe bill also tightens penalties on Iran and beefs up security at U.S. diplomatic posts after the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya, last September. Despite his veto threat, Mr. Obama signed the law because \"the need to renew critical defense authorities and funding was too great to ignore.\" The measure also contains cuts in defense spending to which the president and congressional Republicans agreed in August 2011.",
    " Title: Gun Control Debate Intensifies Following Colorado Shooting as Lawmakers and Advocates Clash Over Assault Weapons\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting in Colorado that left 12 people dead and 58 others injured, the debate over gun control has resurfaced, with lawmakers and advocates on both sides of the issue voicing their opinions.\n\nColorado Governor John Hickenlooper, in an interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" declined to comment on whether Colorado should revisit its gun laws, stating that the shooting suspect, James Holmes, would have found a way to create \"horror\" even if he hadn't been able to acquire guns.\n\n\"This wasn't a Colorado problem. This is a human problem,\" said Mr. Hickenlooper, a Democrat. \"Even if he didn't have access to guns, this guy was diabolical. He would have found explosives, he would have found something else, some kind of poisonous gas. He would have done something to create this horror.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney said that President Obama's views on gun-control laws have not changed. \"The president's view is that we can take steps to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them under existing law,\" Mr. Carney told reporters traveling with the president to Colorado. \"And that's his focus right now.\"\n\nGun-control advocates, however, pointed to the types of weapons allegedly used by Mr. Holmes, a 24-year-old doctoral student at the University of Colorado, when the gunman opened fire at a Thursday midnight showing of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" in an Aurora theater. He was armed with a 100-round rifle magazine, along with other weapons.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called for a \"sane\" debate about banning military-style assault weapons on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"Weapons of war don't belong on the streets,\" she said. \"This is a powerful weapon. It had a 100-round drum. This is a man who planned, who went in, and his purpose was to kill as many people as he could in a sold-out theater.\"\n\nRep. Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.), who became a leading gun-control advocate after her husband was killed and son injured in the 1993 Long Island Rail Road shooting, said mass shooters have one thing in common: a gun that can be loaded with lots of ammunition.\n\n\"Police responded in 90 seconds and yet he was able to take down 70 people,\" Ms. McCarthy said.\n\nHowever, like Mr. Hickenlooper, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) insisted the issue wasn't about guns, but about an individual who would have found a way to carry out acts of violence no matter what tools were available to him.\n\n\"This isn't an issue about guns, this is an issue about sick, demented individuals,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"I wish I could wave the magic wand and pass a law to prevent something like this in the future, but I don't think there's a solution in Washington.\"\n\nWhile the Colorado shooting has reinserted gun control into the political debate, little is known about what motivated the suspect, described by authorities as seemingly normal. Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan said on ABC's \"This Week\" that Mr. Holmes hadn't given any hint of the rampage he is suspected of embarking on.\n\n\"He just by every standard appeared normal,\" Mr. Hogan said. \"He did have friends. He had made connections. He had people he went drinking with on Friday nights.\"\n\nCalling his state \"heartbroken,\" Mr. Hickenlooper called Mr. Holmes \"clearly deranged, twisted, demonic in some way,\" saying his goal was to create terror.",
    " Title: Obama Mandates Paid Sick Leave for Government Contractors, Criticizes Republican Candidates on Union Policies\n\nIn a move aimed at bolstering worker benefits, President Barack Obama on Monday signed an executive order mandating that government contractors offer their employees seven days of paid sick leave per year. The order, which affects approximately 300,000 workers, was announced during a flight to Boston, where the president spoke at a union event.\n\nStarting in 2017, workers on government contracts will earn a minimum of one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. Contractors have the discretion to offer more generous amounts.\n\nDuring his speech, President Obama emphasized the benefits of such policies for employers and advocated for additional worker-friendly measures, such as paid maternity leave. He drew laughter and applause from the crowd when he humorously noted, \"We wouldn't even go to work if we had to carry around somebody for nine months. The human race would evaporate.\"\n\nThe president's remarks were interpreted as thinly-veiled criticisms of Republican presidential candidates, particularly Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who have been vocal in their opposition to unions. However, Obama did not name these candidates directly.\n\nThe executive order is part of a series of measures by the White House to expand access to paid leave. In January, Obama issued a presidential memorandum directing the government to advance up to six weeks of paid sick leave for the birth or adoption of a child, or for other sick leave-eligible uses. The president is also pressing Congress to pass legislation giving government employees six additional weeks of paid parental leave.\n\nLabor Secretary Thomas Perez could not provide an estimate of the cost of implementing the seven-day paid leave rule for contractors, stating that the cost would be offset by reduced attrition and increased loyalty, as documented in numerous studies of state laws that have been enacted.\n\nPresident Obama also used the trip to Boston to renew his call for Congress to pass the Healthy Families Act, which would require all businesses with 15 or more employees to offer up to seven paid sick days each year. According to the White House, an estimated 44 million private-sector workers, about 40% of the total private-sector workforce, do not have access to paid sick leave.",
    " Title: IRS Scandal: New Evidence Suggests Wide-Spread Involvement of Senior IRS Officials in Targeting of Conservative Groups\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, evidence has emerged that suggests the targeting of conservative Tea Party groups by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was not the work of a few low-level agents in the Cincinnati office, as previously claimed. Instead, the scrutiny of conservative organizations' activities appears to have involved senior-level IRS officials, including the signature of IRS Tax Exempt Organizations Director Lois Lerner.\n\nAccording to attorneys representing some of the targeted groups, additional requests for information about these organizations came from various IRS offices, with some bearing the signatures of higher-ups at the agency. A letter requesting information about one of the groups, for instance, bears the signature of Lois Lerner, the suspended director of the IRS Exempt Organizations department in Washington.\n\nJay Sekulow, an attorney representing 27 conservative political advocacy organizations that applied to the Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt status, provided some of the letters to NBC News. He stated that the groups' contacts with the IRS prove that the practices went beyond a few \"front line\" employees in the Cincinnati office, as the IRS has maintained.\n\nThe letters, some of which bore return IRS addresses other than Cincinnati, included \"Department of the Treasury / Internal Revenue Service / Washington, D.C.\" and the signatures of IRS officials higher up the chain. Two letters with \"Department of the Treasury / Internal Revenue Service / Washington, D.C.\" letterhead were signed by \"Tax Law Specialist(s)\" from Exempt Organizations Technical Group 1 and Technical Group 2. Lerner's signature, which appeared to be a stamp rather than an actual signature, appeared on a letter requesting additional information from the Ohio Liberty Council Corp.\n\nLerner has been on administrative leave after refusing to testify before the House Oversight Committee about the scandal last week. Despite being on leave, she continues to receive a taxpayer-funded paycheck of $180,000 per year. Lerner was the first to publicly admit IRS targeting of conservatives was in fact taking place.\n\nThis new evidence suggests a wider involvement of IRS officials in the targeting of conservative groups than previously thought, casting doubt on the IRS's initial claims that the issue was limited to a few employees in the Cincinnati office. The ongoing investigation into this matter is expected to provide further clarity on the extent of the IRS's actions and any potential misconduct.",
    " Title: Trump Nominates Kathy Kraninger, OMB Official, to Lead Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has announced his intention to appoint Kathy Kraninger, an official from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), as the head of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The decision, which is subject to Senate approval, has drawn criticism from consumer advocates and divided conservatives.\n\nKraninger, who is set to succeed interim CFPB head Mick Mulvaney, has a law degree and previously worked at the Department of Homeland Security and as a Congressional staffer. The White House has stated that Kraninger will bring a fresh perspective and management experience to the bureau, which has been marked by excessive spending, dysfunctional operations, and politicized agendas.\n\nMulvaney, who also serves as the director of the OMB, was appointed as the temporary head of the CFPB in November, replacing Richard Cordray, an appointee of former President Barack Obama. During his six-month tenure, Mulvaney has overhauled the agency, restructuring departments, shelving new regulations, and dropping cases against payday lenders.\n\nAt the OMB, Kraninger has worked on financial policy issues for the CFPB, Treasury, and other regulators. She has extensive experience managing large teams in government, according to a person with direct knowledge of her role.\n\nThe announcement has been met with criticism from both consumer groups and conservatives, with both sides questioning Kraninger's qualifications and expressing concerns about her ability to gain Senate approval. Allied Progress, a left-leaning consumer group, described her nomination as an attempt by Mulvaney to maintain control over the agency, adding that she has \"no relevant experience.\"\n\nJ.W. Verret, an associate professor at the George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School and financial regulation expert, noted that Kraninger is regarded as \"very smart\" in conservative Republican circles, but also pointed to her lack of consumer finance experience.\n\nOther conservatives argued that Mulvaney has a strong track record of picking good managers, and that he would not have backed Kraninger if he doubted her capability. \"Whether you agree with Mulvaney politically, there is no doubt he has been a highly effective manager in government, and since he's worked closely with her, he must know she is qualified,\" said Dina Ellis Rochkind, a lawyer at Paul Hastings and former Congressional staffer who worked for Republican lawmakers. \"But the big test will be how she performs in her Senate confirmation hearing.\"\n\nKraninger did not immediately respond to a LinkedIn message seeking comment on Saturday.",
    " Title: U.S. Education Department Cancels $150 Million in Student Loans, Affecting Over 15,000 Borrowers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, the U.S. Department of Education announced on Thursday that it will cancel $150 million in federal student loan debt, despite the efforts of Secretary Betsy DeVos to overhaul the Obama-era policy.\n\nThe department's decision comes after a federal judge ruled three months ago that DeVos' attempts to abolish the 2016 regulations were illegal. The judge also rejected for-profit colleges' bid to stop the policy in October.\n\nThe department will forgive loans for approximately 15,000 borrowers whose schools closed, preventing them from completing their programs. About half of those borrowers attended Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit educational chain that closed its campuses in 2015. They will account for $80 million of the automatically discharged loans, while borrowers whose schools closed between Nov. 1, 2013, and Dec. 4, 2018, will account for the other $70 million.\n\nAffected borrowers will begin receiving email notifications from the department on Friday, according to the department's press release. However, the department noted that discharges may take longer than 90 days to complete, and loan holders will inform borrowers about the specific loans that were forgiven.\n\nPreviously, DeVos argued that the debt forgiveness was too lenient, lacking sufficient borrower proof requirements. The department proposed changes that it claimed would reduce frivolous claims and allow colleges to respond to borrower allegations.\n\nMeanwhile, Citibank has been ordered to pay $6.5 million for allegedly harming borrowers with student loan servicing failures, as reported separately.\n\nRelated:\n- Student loans: Borrowers could face tighter federal standard for debt forgiveness\n- As financial burden rises, college students question the value of education",
    " Title: House Democrats Initiate Investigation into Border-Crossing Deaths of Two Guatemalan Children\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move signaling the beginning of an investigation next year, House Democrats have ordered Homeland Security officials to preserve all evidence related to the recent deaths of two Guatemalan children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border with their parents. The request comes as Democrats prepare to take control of the House and gain powers to oversee investigations.\n\nThe Democrats have asked for medical records, surveillance videos, and logs of interactions between Border Patrol agents and the children to be kept for future handover. The order was signed by the top Democrats on the House Judiciary, Oversight, and Homeland Security committees.\n\nIn a joint statement, the lawmakers announced that after the new Congress begins next week, their committees will hold hearings and conduct oversight of the two deaths that occurred earlier this month, as well as the conditions under which thousands of children are being held in DHS custody.\n\nThe first incident involved an 8-year-old boy who died on Christmas Eve after six days in Border Patrol custody. Felipe Gomez Alonzo had been treated for a cold and fever at a hospital and was released, only to be readmitted hours later and later died. His mother, still in Guatemala, stated that the boy's father brought the youngster on the trip because they believed he would have an easier chance of gaming the American immigration system to gain an illegal foothold in the U.S.\n\nThe second incident involved a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl who fell ill hours after being arrested crossing the border illegally with her father. Border Patrol agents managed to revive her twice, but she later suffered a heart attack and liver and respiratory failure at a hospital and died.\n\nThe mother of the deceased girl, in an interview with Reuters, said neighbors had told the family that taking a child along would provide a way in. \"Lots of them have gone with children and managed to cross, even if they're held for a month or two. But they always manage to get across easily,\" she told Reuters.\n\nThe investigation will focus on the circumstances surrounding the children's deaths and the conditions in which thousands of children are being held in DHS custody. The results of the investigation are expected to be made public after the new Congress begins its session.",
    " Title: Rand Paul's Strategy of Revisiting Clinton Scandals: A Look at the Impact and Reactions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the strategy of revisiting decades-old scandals has become a winning formula for some, and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul seems to have mastered this approach, particularly when it comes to the Clinton family. By subtly referencing the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Oval Office sex, Paul has managed to keep himself in the headlines this winter, attracting media attention and sparking discussions.\n\nThis week, Paul's attacks were amplified by the revelation of personal, decades-old correspondences between Hillary Clinton and Diane Blair, a close friend and confidant to the former First Lady. The newly uncovered archives, which addressed the Lewinsky scandal and other trials from Bill Clinton's two terms, were presented as significant political news. They also provided the media with an opportunity to delve deeper into the Clinton family's tumultuous past.\n\nFor Clinton critics, there appears to be no downside to this strategy. The media's response to Paul's tactics has been largely positive, with CNN's Candy Crowley describing him as being \"on a roll lately\" and praising his \"smart politics.\" CNN political reporter Peter Hamby also claimed that Paul's attack on Clinton's personal life represents \"a potent message for Republicans at the moment.\"\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of this strategy in boosting Paul's political aspirations is questionable. In a national poll released on Tuesday, a McClatchy-Marist survey found that just 9% of Republican voters consider Rand Paul their pick for the GOP's 2016 nominee. The poll also shows Rand Paul losing to Clinton by double digits in a hypothetical 2016 match-up.\n\nMoreover, some Republican leaders believe that Paul's strategy is an electoral loser. The strategy may be potent among Republicans, but its effectiveness in boosting Paul's political aspirations remains uncertain.\n\nThe media's coverage of the Clintons has been a subject of debate, with some pundits portraying Clinton's potential campaign as a \"predestined\" \"train wreck,\" while others argue that she is taking a \"wrong turn\" and repeating mistakes from 2008. For instance, on Monday alone, Time published a piece titled \"6 Ways Hillary Clinton Is Her Own Worst Enemy,\" and the Wall Street Journal posted an examination of how a popular, deep-pocketed candidate like Clinton might actually be a bad thing for Democrats.\n\nIn this context, Paul's revisiting of the Clintons' private life and events from decades ago has been met with eagerness by the Beltway press. The same theme drove coverage of the Blair archives, with the media straining to present the material as \"bringing fresh insight into the private history of the Clintons.\" The New York Times echoed this sentiment, insisting that the correspondence reveals \"new\" insights into how Clinton dealt with White House setbacks.\n\nVeteran columnist Joe Klein, who has been writing about the Clintons for 30 years, criticized the notion that the Blair letters were big news or that the previously adjudicated sex scandals still matter today. \"If Hillary Clinton does run for President, she should be examined carefully-as a public servant, not as a demonic caricature,\" wrote Klein. \"She's far better than that; I hope we are, too.\"",
    " Title: FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe Steps Down Amidst Ongoing Political Pressure and Allegations of Conflict of Interest\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has stepped down from his post on Monday, following weeks of criticism from President Donald Trump and other Republicans, according to people familiar with the matter. McCabe will take the remainder of his vacation time until he is eligible to retire from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in March.\n\nMcCabe has faced a series of attacks over an alleged conflict of interest stemming from his wife's previous run for Virginia state Senate as a Democrat before he became deputy director. He has denied any conflict.\n\nPresident Trump and other Republicans have cited the alleged conflict as part of a broader assertion of bias on the part of the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the special counsel's office as they investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any links between the Trump campaign and Moscow in that effort. Trump has specifically called for McCabe's ouster.\n\nDemocrats argue these assertions are an attempt to distract from the investigations and discredit them.\n\nIn an email to employees, FBI Director Chris Wray addressed McCabe's departure, stating that he \"will not be swayed by political or other pressure\" in making decisions. Wray thanked McCabe for his service, adding that McCabe said he would take leave immediately following a conversation between the two.\n\nThe email was earlier reported by the New York Times.\n\nIn the message, Wray also said he would not comment on a pending report from the Justice Department's inspector general, an in-house watchdog, which is expected to criticize the FBI's handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email arrangement when she was secretary of state. The report is expected to prompt some personnel changes.\n\nMcCabe's decision to step down on Monday surprised many inside the FBI and the Department of Justice. Officials abruptly canceled a press conference to discuss an unrelated criminal operation as news of McCabe's resignation became public minutes before the conference was to begin.\n\nMcCabe, 49 years old, will be temporarily succeeded by the No. 3 official at the bureau, David Bowdich, according to one person.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller has obtained two guilty pleas from Trump campaign aides and charged two other Trump campaign officials with tax-related and other offenses related to private work predating the campaign.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community in January 2017 said it believed Russia had conducted an influence operation with the goal of hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMcCabe's abrupt departure is the latest event in a highly unusual back-and-forth between the Trump administration and a federal law-enforcement establishment that is both investigating him as it works for him, and cherishes its independence.\n\nThe dueling narratives about the Russia investigation have engulfed multiple senior law-enforcement officials and spilled into a fight in Congress.\n\nHouse Republicans produced a memo earlier this month describing what they say were abuses by U.S. intelligence agencies in the Russia probe. Democrats dismissed the memo as a partisan document.\n\nA House panel voted Monday to make the memo public, a move the Justice Department has said would be \"extraordinarily reckless\" because its officials had not reviewed it.\n\nMcCabe's resignation comes as the FBI faces fallout from thousands of text messages between an FBI agent and a lawyer who were involved in the Russia investigation, including some texts harshly critical of Trump. The lawyer worked for McCabe.\n\nAfter reports circulated in December that McCabe might soon leave the bureau, Trump took to Twitter to criticize him for remaining in the job.\n\n\"FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits,\" Trump wrote. \"90 days to go?!!!\"\n\nThe White House said Trump played no role in McCabe's decision to step down. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president was not part of the \"decision-making process\" on McCabe's departure.\n\nMcCabe, a career official at the FBI who spent nearly 20 years with the agency, was the acting FBI director after Trump fired the previous director, James Comey, in May. Days later, Mueller was appointed to probe the Russian conduct.\n\nMcCabe first worked on organized crime cases in the FBI's New York field office, then advanced to a series of leadership positions, including in counterterrorism and at the Bureau's Washington field office.\n\nBeyond McCabe, Trump has criticized or raised questions about a variety of figures related to the Russia investigation, from Attorney General Jeff Sessions to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to Comey, who hired McCabe as his deputy in January 2016.\n\nThose close to McCabe expected him to leave the FBI around March when he was eligible to receive his full retirement benefits after 20 years of service. Many agents in such a position choose to retire and start second, generally more lucrative, careers outside of government.\n\nMcCabe first attracted notice from Republicans in 2016 as a result of his supervisory role in the FBI investigation into Clinton's email server. Republicans raised conflict-of-interest questions because his wife, Dr. Jill McCabe, ran for Virginia state senate in 2015 with financial support from the political organization of then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat and longtime ally of Bill and Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe FBI has said McCabe played no role in his wife's campaign, and McAuliffe has said it is typical for governors to support candidates of the same party. McCabe received clearance from the FBI's ethics office to oversee the Clinton investigation, but Republicans have argued he should have stepped aside.",
    " Title: The Controversial Mortgage-Interest Tax Deduction: A Policy Perspective and the Power of Lobbying\n\nIn a recent development, a policy adviser to a U.S. senator has questioned the rationale behind the mortgage-interest tax deduction, a long-standing policy that allows homeowners to deduct the interest from their mortgage from their taxable income. The adviser, who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the issue, stated that the mortgage-interest tax deduction, from a policy perspective, makes no sense.\n\nThis view is supported by a significant body of academic research, which suggests that the mortgage-interest tax deduction disproportionately benefits the wealthy and has minimal impact on homeownership rates. Furthermore, it is argued that the deduction does not necessarily benefit homeowners, as it contributes to higher home prices.\n\nDespite these findings, the mortgage-interest tax deduction remains a contentious issue in Washington, D.C., with powerful lobbying groups such as the National Association of Realtors (NAR) actively opposing any attempts to abolish or reform the deduction. Jimmy Williams, a former lobbyist for the NAR, stated that if he were still working for the organization, he would declare war on anyone advocating for the elimination of the deduction.\n\nWilliams explained that he would employ various tactics, including running ads, encouraging Realtors across the country to make phone calls, and donating to influential legislators. His goal would be to deter policymakers from pursuing such a path, arguing that it would not be a smart move for re-election campaigns.\n\nJamie Gregory, who currently lobbies for the NAR, asserted that eliminating or limiting the mortgage-interest tax deduction would lead to a nationwide drop in home prices, potentially destabilizing the economy. Furthermore, he argued that the majority of support for the deduction comes from homeowners themselves, who rely on the tax break to afford their homes.\n\nWhile the future of the mortgage-interest tax deduction remains uncertain, it is clear that the issue is a complex one, with significant implications for homeowners, the economy, and the political landscape in Washington, D.C. As policy advisers and legislators continue to debate the merits of the mortgage-interest tax deduction, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of any changes to this long-standing policy.",
    " Title: Disillusionment Among Campaign Finance Reformers as Obama Embraces Super PACs in 2012 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2012 election, a significant shift in campaign finance practices has led to a growing disillusionment among campaign finance reformers towards President Barack Obama. The president, who has historically positioned himself as a crusader against the influence of big money in politics, is now being criticized for willfully neglecting his reformist agenda and embracing elements of a new, laissez-faire election system he once denounced.\n\nThe president's endorsement of Priorities USA Action, a super PAC run by two of his former staffers, to raise and spend unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, or individuals, has raised eyebrows. This move could potentially make Obama the first chief executive not to successfully appoint someone to the Federal Election Commission (FEC).\n\nThe White House has also faced criticism for its inaction on several campaign finance-related issues. It declined to issue an executive order restricting federal contractors from interfering in elections, and it abandoned a full-time \"ethics czar\" position. The administration has not responded to a plea for FEC overhaul submitted in February by good-government types, and it has not pressed the Internal Revenue Service to go after nonprofits like the Karl Rove-inspired Crossroads GPS operation.\n\nMoreover, Obama has made no proposal to replace the nation's presidential public funding system, a system he effectively rendered obsolete four years ago by reneging on a promise to accept public campaign funds. In the 2008 election, Obama raised about $750 million, more than any other presidential candidate in U.S. history.\n\nRobert Weissman, President of Public Citizen, expressed his concerns, stating, \"We're seeing daily things get worse, and his failure of action will result in things growing even more worse.\"\n\nDavid Bossie, president of the conservative Citizens United organization, expressed his satisfaction with Obama's inaction, stating, \"Obama hasn't been addressing these issues in any way, shape or form. It's great for us.\"\n\nIn response, the Obama campaign and White House defend the president, noting he signed an executive order on his first day in office strictly limiting lobbyists' access to the administration. The White House spokesman Eric Schultz stated, \"Obama's White House has done more than any administration in history to reduce the impact of special interests in Washington.\"\n\nHowever, campaign finance reformers argue that the president's actions speak louder than his words. On the campaign trail, few bold reform proposals are being advocated, with the economy, education, and job creation dominating the reelection agenda.",
    " Title: A Hundred Days In: The Elusive Nature of Trumpism in the Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Trump administration approaches its 100th day, the term 'Trumpism' remains elusive, with its true definition yet to be clearly defined. The President's unconventional approach, dubbed 'America First', was expected to reshape the Republican Party into a populist 'Workers Party'. However, a hundred days into his presidency, it is still unclear how this transformation is being executed.\n\n1. The Early Debate about Trumpism\n\nDuring the campaign, there were two main theories about Trumpism. One theory suggested that Trumpism was a combination of economic populism, social conservatism, and isolationism, a modernized version of the Republican Party's ideology from the 1920s. The second theory posited that defining a coherent ideology that could be called Trumpism was a futile endeavor. Trump, according to this theory, did not adhere to any ideology, other than his own self-confidence.\n\n2. The Shift in Foreign Policy\n\nOn foreign policy, Trump is evolving into a more conventional Republican. His policy choices on China, NATO, Iran, the European Union, and Syria have earned praise from the bipartisan foreign-policy establishment he once derided as'stupid'.\n\n3. The Evolution on Domestic Policy\n\nOn domestic policy, Trump is distancing himself from his populist campaign rhetoric. He has stocked his Cabinet with billionaires and CEOs, tilted toward the Wall Street wing of his White House staff, and signed executive orders beneficial to the big banks. His healthcare replacement plan, for instance, would have increased the cost of health insurance for older, low-income voters and cut entitlements, a stark contrast to his campaign promises.\n\n4. Trumpism: More of an Attitude than a Movement\n\nOne of the challenges President Trump faces in turning his nationalist, populist, anti-establishment instincts into a coherent governing agenda is the lack of a significant number of Trumpists in Congress. Trumpism was more of an attitude than a movement.\n\n5. The Base and the Attitude\n\nWhile Trump may not have a significant number of Trumpist congressmen, he does have a base. These white, working-class voters may not care about his abandonment of his populist promises on the Export-Import Bank or Chinese currency manipulation, but they are closely watching his actions on trade and immigration.\n\n6. The Test Ahead: Tax Reform\n\nIssues such as tax reform will soon test Trumpism. On Wednesday, the president has vowed to announce his plan for massive tax cuts. Every tax bill has winners and losers. Trump's tax bill will reveal much about what Trumpism is. If, at the end of the day, the average American feels they have been disadvantaged while the wealthy benefit, Trump could lose support from his base.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's base has remained loyal to him so far, a positive sign for the President. However, his approval ratings remain historically low for a new president, and Trumpism remains a mystery. Is Trumpism just a nativist version of what a Mitt Romney administration would look like? Or is it a work in progress, waiting for the next impulsive decision of a president who prides himself on being transactional, flexible, and unpredictable?",
    " Title: Small Business Owners Cautiously Expanding Amid Economic Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a robust 275,000 job growth in January, the pace of job creation appears to be slowing, with the economy adding only 69,000 jobs in May, according to the Labor Department. Despite the ongoing economic downturn, small business owners across the country are persistently working to expand and hire more employees.\n\nOne such entrepreneur is Srinivas Konanki, who, along with his wife, Manjula, runs Pipette Calibration Services, a laboratory equipment company based outside Boston. The company specializes in calibrating precise lab tools called pipettes, which measure and dispense liquids with great accuracy.\n\n\"We, as a small business, have been very careful as to how we spend our money,\" Srinivas Konanki says. For any business, job growth is closely tied to confidence. To hire new workers, an entrepreneur needs to be optimistic that business will continue to improve.\n\nThe economic climate has given business owners ample reason for caution. One concern for Srinivas is the ongoing economic instability in Europe. Many European countries operate research labs in the Boston area, and when they make cuts, they make them across the board. \"When they make cuts, we see our business cut down,\" he says.\n\nHis other significant worry is potential cutbacks in U.S. government spending, particularly potential cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The end of the year could see an 8% funding cut to the NIH as part of what's known as \"sequestration,\" if Congress fails to meet budget-cutting targets it imposed on itself through legislation last year.\n\n\"Even a couple of percentage points funding [cuts] to the NIH \u2014 it definitely makes a big difference to all the labs out here,\" Srinivas says. \"That will definitely affect our business.\"\n\nBetsey Stevenson, a labor economist with the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, agrees with Srinivas' concerns. She notes that Europe could be a hindrance to hiring in the U.S., and many businesses are worried about Congress' decisions later this year regarding the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, unemployment benefits, and required spending cuts.\n\nThese decisions facing Congress at year's end have been collectively dubbed the \"fiscal cliff.\"\n\n\"Congress is saying, 'We're going to make this difficult,'\" Stevenson says. \"That sends a signal to all the actors in the economy that 'there is potential for real damage to our economy coming in the future, and you should prepare for it today.'\"\n\nDespite these uncertainties, the U.S. is still managing to add new jobs each month. David Kotok, chief economist at Cumberland Advisors, a Florida-based investment advisory firm, acknowledges that job growth has slowed since the start of the year but also sees reasons to be optimistic.\n\n\"The manufacturing sector is growing in the United States,\" Kotok says. As it does, he continues, it creates higher-paying jobs. The energy sector is also doing well, with rapid growth in natural gas exploration promising to create many more well-paid work opportunities.\n\n\"And the third piece,\" Kotok says, \"is the gradual stabilization of housing. It's happening slowly\u2014but it's happening.\"\n\nIf this trend continues, it eventually means more jobs for carpenters, electricians, and many other people who work in related industries. Kotok, the chief investment officer for a firm that manages billions of dollars, has to put his money where his mouth is when it comes to reading the economic tea leaves. And he says he's placing his chips on a slow but continued recovery for the U.S. economy and for employment.",
    " Title: New York Primary: Clinton and Trump Aim for Victory, but Challengers Remain Determined\n\nArticle:\n\nThe primary day in New York has arrived, and the two leading candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, are making a strong push to secure a significant victory in the Empire State. The race for the White House is heating up as both Clinton and Trump aim to regain momentum following recent losses in other contests.\n\nTrump has vowed to win enough delegates in New York to secure the Republican nomination and avoid a contested convention. However, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.), and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are not conceding defeat just yet. A victory in New York could be the decisive factor for both the Republican and Democratic front-runners.\n\nClinton and Trump are expected to win in New York, but the margins of their victories are crucial. Trump needs to capture more than 50 percent of the vote statewide to secure all 95 GOP delegates and move closer to avoiding a contested convention.\n\nTrump has been urging his supporters to vote, emphasizing Cruz's low poll numbers. Meanwhile, Sanders is hoping for a close race in New York. A loss by 10 points would mean he would need to win 80 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination.\n\nDespite a predicted loss in New York, Cruz has not lost momentum. He is focusing on winning more delegates this weekend while emphasizing his ability to win in November. \"Because if I'm the nominee, we win the General Election,\" Cruz told his supporters. \"We're beating Hillary in the key swing states, we're beating Hillary with Independents, we're beating Hillary with young people.\"\n\nCruz, Kasich, and Sanders have already moved on from New York to other states, while Trump and Clinton remain in their home state to watch the results come in. The race for the White House is far from over, and the stakes are high as the candidates continue to battle it out in the remaining primaries and caucuses.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's China-Blaming Amidst Covid-19 Pandemic: A Reckless and Dangerous Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has asserted that there is significant evidence suggesting the Covid-19 pandemic originated from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. This claim, echoed by President Trump and other right-wing allies, is being criticized as reckless and dangerous, with comparisons being drawn to the McCarthy era and the Bush Administration's lies about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\n\nThe Trump administration's accusations against China are being scrutinized as they lack logical support and contradict scientific evidence. The virus, a zoonotic disease, is believed to have originated in bats, with an intermediate mammal host possibly being the Wuhan live animal market. The market was shut down on January 1 after the initial outbreak, making it implausible that the virus was accidentally released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology several weeks earlier, as the right-wing claims suggest.\n\nMoreover, the timeline provided by the Chinese authorities, while not perfect, is relatively rapid. Chinese health officials notified the World Health Organization office in China on December 31, and the genome was fully sequenced and published online on January 11. Wuhan was locked down on January 23. Given the new and unknown nature of the virus, this timeline is not unreasonable.\n\nThe Trump administration's approach to China, however, has been marked by consistent criticism and baseless accusations. For instance, the administration has repeatedly claimed that Huawei and other high-tech Chinese companies pose a direct threat to US security, without providing any direct evidence. This has led America's closest allies, such as the United Kingdom and Germany, to continue doing business with Huawei and to cooperate more generally with China.\n\nThe bottom line is this: on December 31, 2019, China notified the WHO. On January 23, China locked down Wuhan. On January 30, the WHO declared a global public health emergency. As of January 30, there was not yet one single Covid-19 death in the United States. The first is now thought to have occurred on February 6. There was plenty of warning, Messrs. Trump and Pompeo. To this moment, Americans have not fully gauged your recklessness. You have done enough. Have you no shame?",
    " Title: Lobbying and Collusion Allegations Surface in EPA-NRDC Relationship\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, led by Rep. Darrell E. Issa of California, and Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana, have demanded documents and emails from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding the agency's alleged close association with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). The legislators have expressed concern that the NRDC's influence over EPA policy decisions may have allowed it to advance its own agenda.\n\nThe Energy & Environment Legal Institute, in a report of its investigation, has uncovered a trail of emails revealing a potential revolving door between senior EPA officials and radical environmentalists. One batch of messages suggests that Sierra Club lobbyists provided biased research, which eager EPA officials accepted as justification to shut down coal plants.\n\nTo avoid scrutiny and evade the agency's visitors log, outside activists and government employees reportedly met at the J.W. Marriott Hotel, located across the street from EPA headquarters, to discuss regulatory actions and the planning of EPA hearings. Emails obtained through a year-long legal battle describe this alleged shady business, with Lisa P. Jackson, the former administrator of the EPA, using the email pseudonym \"Richard Windsor\" to conceal her participation.\n\nSenator Vitter suggests that this collusion is orchestrated by a group of left-wing foundations that pull the strings of environmentalist groups, influencing Washington's policies. The exact activities of these foundations remain unclear, but the classic rent-seeking model, where opposing projects like the Keystone XL Pipeline creates opportunities for competing projects, is a plausible guess.\n\nThis revelation sheds light on a complex web of lobbying and potential collusion between environmental groups and the EPA, raising questions about the transparency and integrity of policy decisions made by the agency. The full extent of this relationship and its impact on EPA policy remains to be seen as the investigation continues.",
    " Title: The Search for a New Maggie Thatcher in the Republican Party\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a reflection on the legacy of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Chris Stirewalt, digital politics editor for Fox News, posits that the Republican Party in the United States could benefit from a political figure akin to Thatcher, who, like her, could bring about significant change and reform.\n\nStirewalt notes that Thatcher, who famously quipped, \"The trouble with you, John, is that your spine does not reach your brain,\" was a woman of iron will and boundless energy, whose life was devoted to the struggle for change. He compares Thatcher to Ronald Reagan, another conservative icon, but emphasizes that Reagan's policies without his person are pointless in practice.\n\nThe Republican Party, according to Stirewalt, is currently in a state of flux, with a shortage of top talent following two successive electoral defeats. However, he argues that this period of upheaval has allowed new blood to flow in and opened minds to new thinking.\n\nStirewalt suggests that the Republican Party, like the Conservative Party in the UK when Thatcher took control in 1975, is in need of a strong leader who can bring about change and reset the trajectory of the nation. He posits that out of the chaos on the right, a Thatcher or two may be rising even now, thoughtful, urgent, and eloquent with a biography that defies conventional thinking about the party.\n\nStirewalt concludes by stating that if America is ready for change in 2016, one of these potential leaders may have the chance to do what Thatcher did and reset the trajectory of their nation.",
    " Title: The Unconventional Approach of Carly Fiorina: A Look at Her Presidential Ambitions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of 2016, the notion that Carly Fiorina is solely aiming for the vice presidency is a topic of widespread discussion among political insiders, devotees, and media personnel. This assumption, particularly when voiced by female advocates of feminism, is both intriguing and perplexing.\n\nWhile it is acknowledged that the author has a personal affinity for Carly Fiorina, having worked with her in the past, it is essential to note that this article is written from a perspective that is not entirely unbiased. The reality is that Carly Fiorina may not ultimately secure the Republican Party's nomination in 2016, but the same cannot be said for many of her male counterparts.\n\nIn contrast to the numerous male candidates, there seems to be a tendency not to take Carly Fiorina's presidential aspirations as seriously. This is despite the fact that she is the only Republican candidate consistently engaging with the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, in a manner that demonstrates her ability to challenge Clinton effectively, even with fewer resources and less media attention.\n\nThe assumption that Carly Fiorina is only running for the vice presidency is peculiar, given that she is the only female Republican woman in the 2016 race, despite the party's history of boasting numerous female governors, senators, and high-ranking officials. America's political landscape is not accustomed to seeing women rise to the top in politics, as evidenced by the Democratic Party's rejection of the first female potential nominee in 2008 and the GOP's rejection of high-profile women as unqualified, lightweight, or not up to the task.\n\nCarly Fiorina's presidential campaign is a testament to her determination and ambition, and it is crucial to recognize that she is running for the presidency, not as a potential vice president. The American political class may not be ready for Carly Fiorina's presidential run, but she is, and her candidacy serves as a powerful reminder of the potential for women in politics.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Criticism and Support Surrounding Trump's Decision to Strike Iranian General Soleimani\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the White House's strike on Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, a divisive political landscape has emerged, with Democrats expressing criticism towards President Trump, while Republicans have defended the decision.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democrat, labeled the attack as \"provocative and disproportionate\" last week. This criticism has been met with pushback from the White House, with White House counsel Kellyanne Conway accusing congressional Democrats of ignoring the danger posed by Soleimani, who was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. soldiers in the Middle East.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey have demanded the White House to produce the intelligence leading up to the attack, a demand that Conway dismissed as unnecessary, as Congress was to receive a briefing.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell criticized the Democratic response, stating that some colleagues have rushed to blame the U.S. government before knowing the facts, and have downplayed Soleimani's evil while presenting Trump as the villain.\n\nEven former Vice President Joe Lieberman, a Democrat, criticized his fellow Democrats for their skeptical or negative reactions to Soleimani's death. Lieberman argued that the decision deserves bipartisan support, as Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans.\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of putting the nation on the path for another Middle East war, questioning the legality of the attack and insisting that he should have sought congressional authorization. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff called for Congress to engage with hearings and constraints, blasting Trump's \"dangerous and provocative decision.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the leading presidential candidates have been critical of Trump. Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted that the president was \"dangerous,\" while Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for legislation that \"reasserts Congress's constitutional authority over war.\"\n\nConservatives have criticized the coverage from mainstream media outlets, accusing them of being more friendly towards Soleimani than Trump. The media's coverage has been criticized for focusing on Soleimani's popularity in Iran, rather than his role as a terrorist responsible for hundreds of American deaths.\n\nIn a Twitter exchange, Washington Post reporter Missy Ryan was criticized for retweeting a photo comparing the crowds at Soleimani's funeral to those at Trump's 2016 inauguration. The media's coverage has been criticized as biased and inaccurate, with some accusing the media of wanting to help the Democrats beat Trump.",
    " Title: Biden's New York Visit Stirs Anticipation Among New York Democrats Amidst Speculations of Presidential Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nJoe Biden's recent visit to New York, a state that once represented Hillary Clinton and is home to her campaign headquarters, has sparked a flurry of activity and anticipation among New York Democrats. This visit, which some view as the most aggressive stop of Biden's pre-campaign, is seen as a potential challenge to Clinton's front-runner status.\n\nBiden's itinerary includes a rape kit backlog event, where he will appear alongside Attorney General Loretta Lynch, whose Justice Department is currently investigating Clinton's email server use. He will also make an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to showcase his unscripted style, a trait many see as a significant asset in a potential challenge to Clinton.\n\nIn a move that could potentially hurt Clinton among liberal Democrats, Biden will join New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a staunch Clinton supporter, to headline an event supporting a new $15 minimum wage for fast-food workers, a cause close to the hearts of progressives.\n\nBiden's office maintains that these events are official and would have been attended regardless of his exploration of a presidential run. However, the growing consensus is that these actions are indicative of a burgeoning campaign, much to the excitement of many of Clinton's old constituents.\n\nRepresentative Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat, expressed his support for Clinton but noted his intention to endorse Biden if he runs. Neal Kwatra, a New York-based consultant with deep ties to labor and progressives, believes Biden's long history with labor could be a significant advantage in a city with the highest union membership in the state.\n\nWhile many high-profile New York Democrats have already endorsed Clinton, the backing of traditional power brokers only carries so much weight in the dynamic world of New York politics. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is yet to endorse, holding out hope of using his progressive seal of approval to boost his national profile.\n\nGustavo Rivera, a state senator who represents the Bronx and identifies as progressive, has endorsed Clinton but acknowledges that he, like many others, is eager for Biden to enter the race. Rivera believes Biden's entry would force Clinton to address more progressive issues and move further to the left, potentially challenging Senator Bernie Sanders' progressive stance.\n\nClinton's campaign declined to comment on Biden's visit or her standing with New York progressives. Meanwhile, Biden is expected to continue expanding on the economic fairness message he began in Pittsburgh, where he attacked \"trust fund babies\" and came close to John Edwards' \"two Americas\" line.\n\nDan Morris, a consultant for New York groups involved with the Fight for 15 and other progressive causes, expressed reservations about Biden's record on progressive issues. However, he believes a Biden campaign would be beneficial for Democrats, as it would force Clinton to engage more with progressive issues and potentially make Sanders a more significant factor in the race.\n\nAs Biden positions himself as the progressive candidate in the 2016 race, Morris remains skeptical. \"He's more of a question mark,\" Morris said, \"than an exclamation point.\"",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Critiques Obama's Foreign Policy Strategy in Interview, Blaming It for Rise of ISIS\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with The Atlantic's national correspondent, Jeffrey Goldberg, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has criticized President Barack Obama's foreign policy strategy, particularly in relation to the rise of ISIS in Iraq and the subsequent humanitarian crisis in the region. Clinton attributed the ascent of ISIS to Obama's refusal to \"build up a credible fighting force,\" which she believes left a vacuum that jihadists have since filled.\n\nClinton stated, \"The failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against [Syrian leader Bashar] Assad \u2014 there were Islamists, there were secularists, there was everything in the middle \u2014 the failure to do that left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.\"\n\nThis criticism appears to be an attempt by Clinton to distance herself from Obama in anticipation of a potential 2016 presidential bid. Clinton also criticized Obama's broader approach to foreign policy, stating, \"Great nations need organizing principles, and 'Don't do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle.\"\n\nThe interview marks Clinton's first major criticism of the president's foreign policy since she stepped down from the administration last year. A source close to Clinton told Business Insider that her comments were more related to the thoughts she set out in her new book, \"Hard Choices,\" and that she was \"merely commenting on world events.\"\n\nHowever, according to Politico, a source familiar with the interview said Clinton's staff gave the White House a heads-up that it had taken place.\n\nMeanwhile, hostility towards a Clinton run seems to be building from the president's quarters. Veteran journalist and New York Times best-selling author, Ed Klein, whose latest book, \"Blood Feud,\" focuses on the rift between the Obamas and the Clintons, has reported that Obama authorized senior adviser Valerie Jarrett to have secret meetings with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The aim, he said, is to encourage Warren to mount a challenge to a Clinton 2016 White House bid.",
    " Title: \"Religious Gatherings and Stay-at-Home Orders: A Balancing Act Between Public Health and Religious Freedom\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the issue of whether places of worship should be allowed to remain open has sparked heated debates across the United States. While stay-at-home orders have been implemented in nearly all states, the question of whether religious gatherings should be exempted has proven to be a contentious topic.\n\nMore than a dozen governors have included exemptions in their orders for religious services, although some of these exemptions come with limitations on attendance and social distancing requirements. However, some religious leaders have chosen to defy these restrictions, continuing to hold regular services with large crowds.\n\nRecent incidents have seen law enforcement officials intervening, with an evangelical Christian pastor in Florida being arrested for holding large services last week. This prompted the state's governor to issue a stay-at-home order that included an exemption for religious gatherings with no limitations on crowd size.\n\nThe argument for closing places of worship during the pandemic is that public health takes precedence over First Amendment freedoms at this time. Large crowds, regardless of the gathering, should be banned, proponents say, citing evidence that religious gatherings can contribute to the spread of the virus. Coronavirus clusters in several states have been traced back to religious gatherings.\n\nOn the other hand, religious leaders argue that physical attendance is not necessary to practice one's faith, and that online services provide a high-quality alternative. Legal analysts concur, stating that closing places of worship does not violate freedom of religion as outlined in the First Amendment, given the unique circumstances of the pandemic.\n\nA vocal group of faith leaders and congregants argue that religion is an essential part of their lives, and the freedom to practice as they see fit, even if it puts them at risk, supersedes public health orders. Others support allowing small religious gatherings that adhere to social distancing, rather than complete bans. Places of worship serve an important role in many communities, providing support for people with health or economic needs.\n\nThere are also concerns that forcing religious institutions to close completely may backfire, creating an adversarial stance between religion and government that stokes fears of persecution. Rev. Leslie Hague, of the South Florida Sun Sentinel, stated, \"When our diocese and our church made the difficult decision to close our church building, we began living into a truth we have long proclaimed: the church is not a building. It is a community of people.\"\n\nEugenia C. South and M. Kit Delgado, writing for the Philadelphia Inquirer, argue, \"In this time of chaos, uncertainty, and gloom, faith and religious gatherings can provide peace, purpose, and fellowship. However, it is for these reasons that church, and religious gatherings in general, are among the highest risk venues, as otherwise isolated older adults come into close contact with socially active younger adults and children who may carry the coronavirus asymptomatically.\"\n\nDaniel Harrell, writing for Christianity Today, adds, \"Even if we do practice stringent hygiene and social distancing, coming together as congregations in the face of this pandemic actually mars our witness. Rather than looking courageous and faithful, we come off looking callous and even foolish.\"\n\nThe Sacramento Bee editorial board states, \"Good pastors protect their flocks. Pastors who willfully expose their congregations to this deadly virus do not deserve the title. Church leaders who insist on putting lives at risk should be jailed.\"\n\nAs the nation grapples with this complex issue, the balance between public health and religious freedom remains a challenging and evolving debate.",
    " Title: George Soros' Role in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Political Ascension Revealed\n\nArticle:\n\nNew details have emerged regarding the ascent of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic socialist who stunned political circles by defeating incumbent Joseph Crowley in the Democratic primary for New York's 14th congressional district. The New York Times reports that Ocasio-Cortez's underdog victory was aided by online actors, and in an interview with progressive digital media outlet \"The Young Turks,\" Ocasio-Cortez admitted that coverage from a Soros-funded network of far-left publications played a significant role in her win.\n\nAccording to the report, members linked to Soros-funded digital media asked Ocasio-Cortez, a former organizer for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, to run for office. This media network, which reaches almost 300 million people monthly, includes outlets such as Mother Jones, Democracy Now!, and The Young Turks.\n\nCenk Uygur, a member of the Soros-funded media and founder of one of the two political groups responsible for asking Ocasio-Cortez to run, Justice Democrats, was eventually forced out of the organization after old articles revealed some of his previous sexist comments. Uygur, who also founded The Young Turks, is a former Armenian genocide denier and often referred to women in a derogatory manner.\n\nIncumbent Joseph Crowley, whose footprint in the Democratic establishment led to speculation that he would succeed Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader of the House, greatly outspent Ocasio-Cortez. However, her strong online presence, thanks to the coverage of the Soros-linked digital media, helped her gain traction and defeat Crowley in the primary on June 26.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's website, Ocasio2018.com, was first registered on May 3, 2017, and redirected to her page on BrandNewCongress.Org, according to an Internet archive captured on June 29, 2017. Brand New Congress is another organization with close ties to Justice Democrats, aiming to get socialists elected to Congress in the 2018 mid-terms.\n\nIn a June 27 interview with Uygur on his YouTube channel \"The Young Turks,\" Ocasio-Cortez thanked Uygur and other media platforms for covering her before the primaries, stating that this coverage \"in no small part\" helped her win. Ocasio-Cortez also credited Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress for asking her to run in the first place.\n\nThe Media Consortium, a network of far-left media publications funded by Soros, is a significant part of this media empire, reaching nearly 300 million people a month, according to the Media Research Center (MRC). The MRC report details the progressive echo chamber Soros intentionally created with the Media Consortium with the intention of shaping public opinion.",
    " Title: Obama Appoints Ron Klain as Ebola Response Coordinator for Federal Response Coordination\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) -- President Barack Obama has appointed Ron Klain as the Ebola Response Coordinator, knowledgeable sources tell CNN. The president signaled his openness to the idea of having one individual coordinating the entire federal response to any threat of an outbreak in the United States.\n\n\"It may make sense for us to have one person...so that after this initial surge of activity, we can have a more regular process just to make sure that we're crossing all the T's and dotting all the I's going forward,\" Obama said on Thursday.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest provided more details to reporters after the announcement was made on Friday. \"I think what you can assume Mr. Klain's role will be is an important, high-level implementation role,\" said Earnest. \"Ultimately, it will be his responsibility to make sure that all the government agencies who are responsible for aspects of this response, that their efforts are carefully integrated. He will also be playing a role in making sure the decisions get made.\"\n\nThe administration has faced criticism for its response to the incidents of Ebola in the United States, in terms of how prepared hospitals have been for potential Ebola patients and also how prepared health care workers were in terms of their personal protective gear. Some lawmakers have called for a travel ban on individuals coming from West Africa, where the outbreak is most serious, but the administration has so far not embraced that idea.\n\nKlain is highly regarded at the White House as a good manager with excellent relationships both in the administration and on Capitol Hill. His supervision of the allocation of funds in the stimulus act, at the time an incredible and complicated government undertaking, is respected in Washington. He does not have any extensive background in health care, but the job is regarded as a managerial challenge.\n\n\"He's strong. He's very tough,\" said CNN political analyst David Gergen. \"It's important in this job to be a coordinator; you have to knock heads together. He's tough enough to do that.\"\n\nGergen said that while Klain does not have a health care background, he does have both domestic policy and foreign policy assignments on his portfolio, and both will come into play as the administration deals with Ebola.\n\nKlain will report to both White House homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco and National Security Adviser Susan Rice, according to a White House official. A former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden and also to then-Vice President Al Gore, Klain is currently president of Case Holdings and general counsel of Revolution, an investment group. He has clerked for the U.S. Supreme Court and headed up Gore's effort during the 2000 Florida recount and was portrayed in the HBO movie \"Recount\" by Kevin Spacey. He could not be reached for comment on Friday.\n\nEven though some Republicans who had called for a more coordinated response seized on his lack of a health care background as a disqualifier. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce said Obama should have tapped someone with medical experience. \"Given the mounting failings in the Obama administration's response to the Ebola outbreak, it is right that the President has sought to task a single individual to coordinate its response,\" the California Republican said. \"But I have to ask why the president didn't pick an individual with a noteworthy infectious disease or public health background.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida had called for an Ebola czar to coordinate the government's response to the deadly virus, but said Friday that \"already, concerns have been raised about the president's choice.\" \"I hope Mr. Klain will come forward quickly with a set of concrete actions to reassure Americans that this administration is taking this situation seriously, including but not limited to common sense travel restrictions on individuals from the affected countries in West Africa,\" he said.\n\nAnd as for the term \"Ebola czar,\" it is not officially endorsed by the White House. \"As far as I'm concerned, you can call him anything you want,\" Earnest told reporters. \"We call him the Ebola Response Coordinator.\"",
    " Title: Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner's Executive Order 16-13 Aims to Reduce Business Regulations and Occupational Licensing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an effort to attract businesses and promote economic growth, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner has issued Executive Order 16-13, aiming to reduce business regulations and administrative burdens by at least 25% over the next two years. The order, which was issued on October 17, 2015, aims to save Illinois residents $250 million in government fees.\n\nThe executive order outlines seven guidelines for regulatory reform, including ensuring regulations are up-to-date, understandable, consistent, necessary, and not unduly burdensome. Each state agency must review its administrative rules to ensure they meet these new standards, with regulations that fail to meet the new standards being subject to repeal or reform.\n\nTo oversee these efforts, the Illinois Competitiveness Council has been established. The council, chaired by U-Jung Choe, includes representatives from the governor's office and several regulatory agencies. One of the council's key focuses will be the reform of occupational licensing.\n\nOccupational licensing requires individuals to obtain government permission to work in certain professions. These requirements often come with significant time and financial burdens that act as disincentives to work. According to the Institute for Justice's comprehensive report on state licensing, Illinois ranked 30th in terms of overall requirements and burdens. Out of the 102 low- and middle-income occupations evaluated in IJ's report, 40 required a license in Illinois.\n\nThe number of licenses issued by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulations has increased 184% over the last 20 years. This follows a national upward trend in licensing that has occurred since the 1950s. University of Minnesota economist Morris Kleiner estimates that 25% of Illinois workers now require government permission to work, compared to Indiana, which licenses only 15% of its overall workforce.\n\nMany Illinois licenses do little to ensure public safety, as demonstrated by less-burdensome standards in other states. For example, Illinois is one of few states that licenses pharmacy technicians, while 39 states do not license the occupation at all. Similarly, if California requires only 365 days of training and no tests to become a preschool teacher, there is no reason for Illinois to mandate five times more training (1,825 days) and three more tests to teach young children.\n\nIllinois makes cosmetologists complete 350 days of education and training, while Emergency Medical Technicians need to complete only 26 days of training. While cutting, styling, and dying hair could warrant some level of government-approved competency, it is difficult to believe that cosmetology poses more of a safety risk than an occupation that literally requires professionals to hold lives in their hands.\n\nOne of the roadblocks to reforming overbearing licensing schemes is that those who are kept out of work have few ways to organize and make their voices heard. To remedy this problem, Governor Rauner's program created a Red Tape Reduction Portal where Illinoisans can flag state regulations that hold their businesses back.\n\nRestoring sanity to licensing follows Rauner's overall message that government should stand in the way of someone's ability to earn a living only if doing so is necessary. The current licensing system in Illinois creates substantial time and financial barriers to work that often do little or nothing to ensure public safety. These barriers make it difficult for people to support themselves and those who rely on them.\n\nWhile cutting back regulation is never easy, there is reason to be optimistic about Illinois' reform efforts. Other states such as Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, and Wisconsin all recently reformed their business regulations. Perhaps the most significant takeaway from Executive Order 16-13 is that even if state legislatures refuse to make necessary reforms, governors can singlehandedly follow through on their promises to open more work opportunities.",
    " Title: Lame-Duck Session in December Expected to be Quietest in Decades\n\nArticle:\n\nDecember's lame-duck session in the U.S. Congress is anticipated to be the quietest in a long time, with Senate Democrats and House Republicans privately predicting a minimal legislative agenda. Unlike the past two lame-duck sessions, which resulted in significant fiscal deals, this year's session is expected to focus primarily on renewing government funding at the beginning of the month.\n\nAccording to Republican and Democratic sources, major issues such as immigration, tax, or entitlement reform will not be addressed during the lame-duck period. Both parties are not pretending a significant legislative push is imminent.\n\nThe most recent effort to ensure a productive lame-duck session came on Tuesday when House Republicans announced they would extend the Export-Import Bank's charter until 2015, avoiding a December fight over the controversial issue. Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) stated, \"Rather than [have it] be until the CR expires in December, it will be June 30 for Ex-Im reauthorization.\"\n\nThe lack of legislative activity in Washington is likely due to the uncertainty about the power structure in the next Congress. If Republicans take the Senate, they are unlikely to cooperate in December. If Democrats maintain control of the chamber, political gridlock will persist. The only deadline is at the beginning of the month. The incentives are not in place to make December big and bold.\n\nIntricate political calculations are being made behind the scenes. For instance, House Republicans are being cautious not to place any legislative fights in the opening months of 2015, as they do not want Republicans to have a rocky start if they capture the Senate majority. There is little discussion about the post-election period in closed House Republican Conference strategy sessions.\n\nIn fact, House Republicans, who know they will remain in power come January, are so optimistic about their party controlling the Senate, most of their internal planning is predicated on Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) becoming the majority leader in January. There have even been private conversations about a closed-door Senate-House policy retreat to develop an agenda if the party seizes control from Harry Reid (D-Nev.). They are privately worried that Reid will push through a number of nominations if he loses the Senate.\n\nThe lame-duck plans, or lack thereof, were outlined by several top-level sources in both parties, and preview a December very different than in 2012 and 2010. In 2010, after Republicans took control of the House, President Barack Obama and congressional leaders cut a deal to extend the Bush-era tax rates for all Americans. In 2012, shortly after Mitt Romney and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) lost the presidency, Congress narrowly averted the so-called fiscal cliff of steep tax increases and a government shutdown. Republicans agreed to raise taxes on wealthy Americans just before midnight on New Year's Eve.\n\nThis year, the main item to address in December is averting another government shutdown. The government-funding bill, which the House is likely to pass this week, will run until Dec. 11. Congress will return to D.C. at some point in late November\u2014the House will hold its leadership elections then. Senior aides see two options to extend government funding: Rogers and Senate Appropriations Chairman Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) want to begin crafting a long-term omnibus spending bill, but some in GOP leadership think it's more likely Congress will pass another stop-gap spending measure.\n\nHouse Republicans are eager to avoid another fiscal cliff scenario\u2014piling a number of deadlines close to each other. The debt ceiling must be raised some time in March, April, or May 2015, and the GOP wants to try to avoid placing the government-funding deadline in that range.\n\nThere are a few wild cards, however. A prolonged military conflict could force Congress to pass a supplemental spending bill. Several targeted tax provisions\u2014known on Capitol Hill as \"extenders\"\u2014need to be renewed. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act expires at year's end\u2014and Republicans want to squeeze that through. And there's fear that if Obama takes any executive action on immigration, they will use the post-election period to try to cut off the White House's authority.",
    " Title: Obama Administration's Appointments: A Look at the Gender Balance in the Executive Branch\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the early stages of President Barack Obama's second term, criticism arose regarding the gender balance in his administration, particularly after the departures of high-profile figures like Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis. The positions at the Departments of State, Defense, and the Treasury, which some liberals had anticipated would be filled by female candidates, were instead taken by men.\n\nIn response to the criticism, President Obama stated during a January news conference, \"I would just suggest that everybody kind of wait until they've seen all my appointments, who is in the White House staff and who is in my cabinet, before they rush to judgment. Until you've seen what my overall team looks like, it's premature to assume that somehow we're going backwards. We're not going backwards, we're going forward.\"\n\nSince those remarks, the President has appointed several women to top posts, including for Interior Secretary, Commerce Secretary, Budget Director, and Director of the Environmental Protection Agency. Despite the initial criticism, some administration officials have privately expressed that the perceived imbalance has been noted within the building, leading to a priority on considering female candidates this year.\n\nAs of June 2012, 43 percent of President Obama's appointees were women, according to a New York Times analysis of federal employment data. This proportion is comparable to that of the Clinton administration and represents an increase from the roughly one-third appointed by George W. Bush.\n\nThe Clinton administration saw the largest gains in the number of women in the executive branch. In no administration before his did women hold more than 18 percent of cabinet-level jobs; in his second term, the share exceeded 40 percent. At that level, women held a substantially larger share of senior roles in the executive branch than they did in Congress or in corporate America. During President Clinton's presidency, no more than nine women were ever serving in the Senate, whereas 20 do today.\n\nThe share of women holding board seats on Fortune 500 companies has also risen over the last two decades, to 16.6 percent last year from 9.6 percent in 1995, according to Catalyst. The executive branch continues to have a larger share of women in senior roles than Congress or corporate America, but it has also changed less since the 1990s.",
    " Title: President Trump's Controversial Social Media Activity Amid Charlottesville Aftermath\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Tuesday, President Donald Trump shared a number of controversial images and sources, including content from known conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec and an altered image depicting violence against media outlet CNN. The retweets came as critics questioned the timing and adequacy of Trump's initial response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville.\n\nTrump retweeted Posobiec, an alt-right figure who has previously promoted the Pizzagate and Seth Rich conspiracy theories, who questioned the lack of outrage over the violence in Chicago. The retweet, as of Tuesday morning, remained on the president's account.\n\nThe president also shared an image from the account @slandinsocal, which depicted a person holding a CNN sign being hit by a train, with the commentary, \"Nothing can stop the #TrumpTrain!!\" The image was an altered version of an IndyStar editorial cartoon, which depicted a Democratic donkey trying to hold back the Trump train.\n\nThe altered image bore a striking resemblance to another controversial tweet, where the president posted a gif that depicted him body-slamming and punching CNN. The retweet also followed a day after the president called a CNN reporter \"fake news\" during an exchange at the White House.\n\nThe timing of the retweet was met with criticism by many social media users, coming just days after a 20-year-old alleged white nationalist drove a car into a crowd of people protesting the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, resulting in one death and 19 injuries. Attorney General Jeff Sessions described the incident as appearing to fit the legal definition of domestic terrorism.\n\nThe retweet was deleted Tuesday morning, though the reason for its removal remains unclear. The president has deleted tweets and retweets in the past.\n\nWalter Shaub, the former head of the Office of Government Ethics, called on Congress to condemn the president in light of the recent events in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nTrump also retweeted Mike Holden, who labeled the president a \"fascist\" in response to news that the president was \"seriously considering\" a pardon for former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio. Arpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt related to a racial profiling case, a controversial move in the immediate aftermath of Charlottesville.\n\nTrump deleted his retweet of the accusation of fascism on Tuesday morning, but Holden's Twitter bio reads, \"Officially Endorsed by the President of the United States. I wish that were a good thing.\"",
    " Title: Marine Corps Delays Implementation of Pullup Test for Female Recruits, Raising Questions About Ground Combat Capabilities\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Marine Corps has postponed the implementation of a new physical standard for female recruits, requiring them to perform three pullups, until next year. The decision was announced quietly, with no press conference, and was communicated through social media and the Corps' own TV show, The Corps Report.\n\nLance Cpl. Ally Beiswanger, a Marine, explained that the delay was to gather more data and ensure all female Marines are given the best opportunity to succeed. However, the delay has sparked questions about whether women have the physical strength to handle ground combat, a role they will be allowed to assume beginning in 2016.\n\nAccording to data from the end of boot camp, 55% of female recruits were unable to perform three pullups, while only 1% of male recruits failed the test. The three pullups is already the minimum requirement for all male Marines.\n\nThe Marine Corps has been using the pullup test to measure upper body strength for men for over 40 years. This strength, they argue, is necessary for ground combat, as it enables Marines to perform tasks such as pulling themselves out of a canal, climbing over mud walls, and carrying ammunition.\n\nFor years, female Marines have had to meet a different standard, an exercise called the \"flexed arm hang.\" However, beginning in 2016, women in the Marine Corps and Army will be allowed to serve in infantry, armor, and artillery units. To perform these roles, they will need to be strong enough to carry ammunition and climb mud walls.\n\nRobert Maginnis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, suggests that the delay indicates that women are unable to meet the same standards. \"Young women, in spite of all the training and all the best intentions, are not going to be the equal of young men in terms of upper body strength,\" Maginnis says. \"You've got to have a lot of upper body strength to lift the stuff. Been there, done that.\"\n\nMaginnis, who has written a book titled Deadly Consequences: How Cowards are Pushing Women into Combat, argues that the issue has more to do with politics than protecting the nation.\n\nHowever, Greg Jacob, a former Marine, disagrees. Jacob, who now works for the Service Women's Action Network, a group that advocates for military women, argues that women can build the strength they need for pullups, and he has seen it done. He served as a Marine infantry officer in the Balkans and Africa, and he required his female instructors to perform pullups just like the men.\n\nWithin six months, all of the women in his company were doing eight to 12 pullups, Jacob says. He argues that the Marine Corps must do a better job of training women to reach the same standard as men. A small number of female Marines have already demonstrated their ability to meet the standard, with 13 women having passed advanced combat training, one of the requirements of which is three pullups.\n\n\"It's a squad-sized unit that's ready to go, and they're not sending them to their infantry unit simply because they're women,\" Jacob says.\n\nSome Marine officers privately suggest that only a handful of Marine women will show interest in combat or be able to pass the course. Meanwhile, Corps Report TV anchor Lance Cpl. Ally Beiswanger is working to improve her own pullup performance, having increased her number from one to eight. She expressed her determination to reach her goal of 12 pullups during a recent episode of The Corps Report. The larger goal of women in ground combat remains two years away.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Clarifies Scope of Speedy Trial Clause: Speedy Trial Guarantee Does Not Apply to Sentencing Phase of Criminal Prosecution\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court has clarified that the \"speedy\" part of the Sixth Amendment's \"right to a speedy and public trial\" no longer applies once a defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to a crime. The case, Betterman v. Montana, specifically addressed the question of whether the speedy trial guarantee protects the accused during the sentencing phase of a criminal prosecution.\n\nThe Court, in its opinion delivered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, held that the guarantee protects the accused from arrest or indictment through trial but does not apply once a defendant has been found guilty at trial or has pleaded guilty to criminal charges. The Court ruled that the language in all three stages of criminal proceedings\u2014arrest or indictment, trial, and sentencing\u2014have distinctly separate protections.\n\nBrandon Thomas Betterman, the defendant in question, was given a seven-year prison sentence 14 months after he initially pleaded guilty to felony bail jumping in a Montana state court. Betterman took the case to Montana's Supreme Court, which ruled that sentencing was not part of the \"speedy trial\" \u2013 a ruling the Supreme Court upheld on Thursday.\n\nThe Court's opinion stated, \"The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Speedy Trial Clause homes in on the second period: from arrest or indictment through conviction. The constitutional right, our precedent holds, does not attach until this phase begins, that is, when a defendant is arrested or formally accused. Today we hold that the right detaches upon conviction, when this second stage ends.\"\n\nWhile the Sixth Amendment does not protect the accused during sentencing, the Court's opinion left open the possibility that the defendant may have other protections under the due process clauses of the Fifth and 14th Amendments. These amendments require a \"due process of law\" in any proceeding that could deny a citizen \"life, liberty, or property.\"\n\nIn concurring with the Court's decision, Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that Betterman was not wrong to question inordinately long sentencing times; he just argued the wrong case. \"I write separately to emphasize that the question is an open one,\" Sotomayor wrote.\n\nIn constitutional cases like these, as Rory Little wrote for SCOTUSblog, it is in the high court's benefit to provide as much specificity as possible. The Supreme Court takes cases on discrete constitutional topics so infrequently, and in so few cases, that an essential part of its role is to provide as much guidance as possible to assist lower state and federal courts in deciding, and thousands of lawyers in litigating, the thousands of cases they collectively confront on the topic every year.",

Zuckerberg further stated, \"Private companies probably should not be, especially these platform companies, should not be in the position of doing that.\"\n\nIn response, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey stated, \"We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make.\" Dorsey added, \"Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Twitter slapped a fact-check notification on one of Trump's tweets for the first time, cautioning users that the president's claims about mail-in voting lack evidence of increased fraud risks.\n\nFacebook has faced criticism in the past for failing to address controversial content on the platform, but it appears Zuckerberg has no plans to change the company's policy. Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg expressed a similar sentiment during a 2017 CNBC interview, asserting that the tech giant does not intend \"to be the publisher and we definitely don't want to be the arbiter of the truth.\"\n\n\"We don't think that's appropriate for us,\" Sandberg said at the time. The ongoing debate between the two tech giants highlights the challenges of balancing free speech and fact-checking in the digital age.",

He noted that Cuba, a country with a population of 11 million, has sent 165 health professionals and plans to send nearly 300 more.\n\nThe United Nations has called for $1 billion in funding for the Ebola response effort over the next six months. So far, only about a third of that need has been met, Kerry said.\n\n\"We live in a world of a lot of close calls, tough decisions on a daily basis -- difficult and contentious issues where you can have an honest disagreement about what the best course of action is, or about what the facts are, or the results of your decision may be,\" Kerry conceded. \"Ebola is not one of them.\"\n\nAs of now, more than 4,000 people have died from the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.

The conversation, facilitated by outgoing US President Barack Obama, took place during Obama's meeting with Netanyahu on Friday.\n\nNetanyahu expressed regret for the loss of life in the Mavi Marmara incident, apologizing for any mistakes that led to the death of nine Turkish activists. The conversation marked a break in a three-year deadlock, with both leaders agreeing to complete the agreement for compensation.\n\nErdogan's office reported that he accepted the apology, stating, \"He valued centuries-long strong friendship and cooperation between the Turkish and Jewish nations.\" The UN's report on the 2010 flotilla raid, which sided mainly with Israel, is noteworthy for its criticism of the Israeli Defense Forces for using unreasonable force, acknowledgment of Israel's right to blockade Gaza, and accusations against the Turkish government for not doing enough to prevent a confrontation with the IDF.\n\nThe normalization of relations between Israel and Turkey is seen as a response to growing concerns among Syria's neighbors about the potential spillover from the ongoing Syrian conflict. The significance of this development is unclear, but it may indicate a shared interest among Israel and Turkey in containing the Syrian conflict. This development could have implications for Iran, as it prefers its enemies in Tel Aviv and its enemies among anti-Assad Islamists to remain divided.",
    " Title: Federal Judge in Maryland Blocks Revised Travel Ban, Citing \"Religious Animus\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant legal development, a federal judge in Maryland has issued an injunction against President Trump's revised travel ban, citing the ban's potential connection to the president's campaign-season \"religious animus\" towards Muslims. The ruling, handed down by Judge Theodore D. Chuang, an Obama appointee, comes just hours after a similar injunction was issued by another Obama-appointed judge in Hawaii.\n\nBoth judges have determined that the administration's efforts to restrict entry from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen are likely illegal. However, they have allowed restrictions to be implemented for North Korea and Venezuela, two non-Muslim countries.\n\nJudge Chuang, like his Hawaii counterpart, had previously ruled earlier versions of the travel ban to be illegal. In his 91-page ruling, he stated, \"The proclamation\u2019s ban generally resembles President Trump\u2019s earlier description of the Muslim ban.\" He further noted that the current list of eight countries subject to severe restrictions, which includes Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen, is similar to the previous list of six, with the addition of Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela.\n\nAdministration officials are already preparing an appeal of the Hawaii ruling, and it remains to be seen how they will respond to this latest development. The Supreme Court had initially scheduled arguments on the earlier version of the travel ban for last week, but these were postponed following revisions made by the president in September.\n\nWhile Tuesday's ruling affects the country-specific travel ban, another part of the original executive order\u2014a 120-day pause on refugee admissions\u2014remains mostly in effect, with some court-ordered exceptions. The 120-day period is set to expire at the end of this month, and analysts are waiting to see whether President Trump will seek to extend the pause. He has already reduced the overall refugee target from 110,000 people in 2017 to 45,000 in 2018.",
    " Title: Uncertainty Surrounds Reunification of Separated Immigrant Families as Government Scrambles to Address Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of President Donald Trump's policy reversal on family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border, the fate of more than 2,300 children already separated from their parents remains uncertain. One such case involves Lilian Merida-Galicia, a 23-year-old Guatemalan mother who was separated from her 7-year-old daughter in mid-May.\n\nAccording to her attorney, Michael Avenatti, Merida-Galicia, currently detained in California, is among more than 60 immigrant parents he represents, 80 percent of whom do not know the whereabouts of their children. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has not responded to Merida-Galicia's requests for information about her daughter's whereabouts.\n\nSimilar stories have emerged from other immigrant mothers, with attorneys reporting chaotic situations in which mothers are unaware of their children's locations or how to contact them. Access to detained immigrants is difficult, making it challenging for the mothers to share their experiences.\n\nThe Trump administration's abrupt policy change on Wednesday, following a wave of outrage both domestically and internationally, has left many questions unanswered. The executive order Trump issued aims to address the situation, but the specifics of reuniting the separated children with their parents and the conditions under which families will be detained during immigration proceedings remain unclear.\n\nAttorney Luis Cortes Romero in Kent, Washington, represents a Salvadoran woman who was separated from her 11-year-old daughter with Down syndrome in early May. The woman, currently detained in Washington state, has decided not to pursue asylum so she can be deported and reunited with her daughter.\n\nPresident Trump has suggested that some of the heart-wrenching stories emerging from the border are fabricated by Democrats. However, the Department of Homeland Security on Friday filed a notice stating they may need up to 15,000 more beds to handle immigrant families, a significant increase from the 2,500 beds available for families in the last fiscal year.\n\nThe U.S. Navy is drafting plans to house up to 25,000 immigrants on its bases and other facilities, at an estimated cost to taxpayers of about $233 million over six months. However, the Navy has not yet been asked to provide accommodation for migrants who have entered the United States illegally.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the family separations and the government's response has led to a stalemate in Congress, with the House of Representatives rejecting a bill aimed at halting family separations and addressing other immigration issues. The House postponed a vote on a more moderate bill after it failed to attract enough support for passage.\n\nThe situation has sparked criticism from both sides of the aisle, with some Republican lawmakers, such as Representative Mark Sanford and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, expressing concern over the president's inconsistent policy-making. The midterm elections in November could potentially impact the course of action taken regarding immigration policy.",
    " Title: U.S. President Donald Trump Faces Political Challenges Amidst Coronavirus Outbreak and Economic Downturn\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic and its subsequent economic impact have posed one of the gravest threats to President Donald Trump's political career, as fellow Republicans express concern that the White House's response may harm his re-election prospects. The U.S. stock market, a key metric Trump has touted as evidence of his success, plunged into bear market territory on Thursday, a day after he delivered an Oval Office address promising economic stimulus and a 30-day travel ban for Europeans.\n\nSome Republicans worry that the administration's response, which for several weeks downplayed the risk of the COVID-19 respiratory disease, may have come too late. Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist who ran Chris Christie's gubernatorial campaigns in New Jersey, stated, \"The president's early downplaying and politicizing of the virus hurt his credibility and will make people question the administration's readiness from now until the day this passes.\"\n\nTrump's greatest strength, the economy, could be weakened as the stock markets continue to decline and real people experience financial hardship. DuHaime added, \"If the stock markets continue to tank, and real people begin to hurt financially, it will hurt the president politically.\"\n\nLast month, Trump emerged triumphant after his Senate acquittal in a Democratic-led impeachment drive, ready to ride high on a strong economy as a crowded field of Democratic candidates bickered over who was best to take him on in November's general election. However, the narrative quickly changed as moderate Democrats consolidated their support behind former Vice President Joe Biden over liberal Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nBiden seized the opportunity to offer a contrast to voters with his own coronavirus speech on Thursday. He criticized the administration's handling of the crisis while seeking to portray himself as a steady, experienced hand in the face of a public health emergency.\n\nThe growing threat from the coronavirus forced Trump to reverse course and suspend his large campaign rallies. The Trump campaign stated, \"The safety, security, and health of the American People is President Trump's top priority right now.\"\n\nNoting that Trump had called the disease a \"foreign virus,\" Biden warned against \"xenophobia\" and said the coronavirus \"does not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender, or ZIP code.\"\n\nBiden laid out his own plan for dealing with the outbreak, including emergency paid sick leave for workers and widely available free testing for the virus. The Trump administration has been criticized for failing to produce enough tests to meet demand.\n\nSanders, who has vowed to remain in the race despite lengthening odds, also criticized Trump's handling of the crisis. He called for stronger action by government agencies to halt the spread of the virus and for measures such as paid sick leave and unemployment compensation for those affected.\n\nA Trump supporter and fundraiser stated the coronavirus outbreak had been politicized, like every issue in the United States. Jim Worthington, a health club executive in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, said, \"The battle lines are drawn. If you like Trump, you think he's done all the things right, like cutting off travel to China. If you're a Democrat, you think the opposite.\"\n\nThe crisis has reshaped the contours of the presidential campaign. Democratic officials announced on Thursday that Sunday's televised debate between Biden and Sanders would be moved to Washington from Arizona. Officials had already decided not to allow an audience into the debate hall, citing contagion concerns.\n\nBiden, Sanders, and Trump have all canceled campaign events in recent days after warnings from public health officials about holding large-scale gatherings. Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio hold Democratic nominating contests on Tuesday.\n\nBiden's campaign on Wednesday converted planned rallies in Florida and Illinois into \"virtual\" events and on Thursday said all staffers would begin to work from home beginning Saturday. Sanders' staffers will also work from home, reaching out to voters online instead of holding large events or door-to-door canvasses, his campaign said Thursday.\n\nLate Thursday, Trump's campaign said its events would also all be conducted in a virtual setting, including moving training sessions online.\n\nOne Republican strategist stated Trump's handling of the coronavirus was hurting him now but that it was too soon to gauge its impact on his long-term political prospects. Ipsos polling from March 9-10 showed 55% of Americans disapproved of Trump, while 40% approved, largely unchanged from the past year.\n\n\"A few weeks ago, the president's supporters were very dismissive of the virus. Today, they are being very silent,\" the Republican political operative said. \"It's a supply chain issue, and he's the supply chain president. When he says we have test kits on the ground and we don't, that's a real problem.\"",
    " Title: Ten Perspectives on the President's Alleged Use of Offensive Language Towards Haiti and African Countries\n\nArticle:\n\n1. The use of derogatory language by President Donald Trump in referring to Haiti and African countries has sparked a wave of criticism, with many viewing it as a reflection of his lack of diplomacy and respect. However, some argue that Trump's candidness, while often offensive, is a characteristic that appeals to his supporters.\n\n2. It is generally inappropriate for a U.S. president to label countries as \"s--tholes.\" While the exact word used by Trump is a matter of debate, it is suggested that a more constructive term, such as \"dysfunctional,\" might have been more beneficial in describing the challenges faced by these countries.\n\n3. The connection between the moral state of an immigrant's country and their contribution to America is a contentious issue. Data from the Center for Immigration Studies indicates that a higher percentage of households headed by Central American, Mexican, Caribbean, and African immigrants use welfare programs compared to East Asian and European immigrants.\n\n4. The labeling of President Trump as a racist, white supremacist, fascist, and anti-Semite by the media is often criticized as an exaggeration intended to harm the president. The most frequently cited \"evidence\" for Trump's racism is his alleged comments about the Charlottesville, Virginia, demonstrations, which have been misconstrued.\n\n5. The repeated descriptions of America as \"systemically racist\" by the left are compared to the use of the term \"s--thole.\" These descriptions are seen as offensive, less truthful, and publicly expressed, unlike Trump's alleged private comments.\n\n6. The validity of describing any country as a \"s--thole\" is questioned, with some arguing that the term is a matter of nicety rather than truth.\n\n7. Trump's openness in speaking to Democrats, who are often critical of him, is seen as a testament to his self-confidence and naivety.\n\n8. Private speech, while not always a reflection of one's character, is a topic of debate. Some argue that revealing private speech can make individuals appear less than ideal, but in reality, it may not accurately represent their true nature.\n\n9. Reports suggest that Trump also expressed a willingness to accept more immigrants from Asian countries, which could be interpreted as a counterargument to the racism charge.\n\n10. The term \"racist\" has lost credibility in the hands of the left, with accusations of racism levied against those who oppose race-based quotas, all-black college dorms, or the Black Lives Matter movement. The left's overuse of the term \"racist\" has led to a situation where real instances of racism may be dismissed.",
    " Title: President Trump Appoints Richard Grenell as Acting Director of National Intelligence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tweet Wednesday night, President Donald Trump announced the appointment of Richard Grenell, the current U.S. ambassador to Germany, as the acting director of national intelligence. The role, which was vacated by Dan Coats in August 2019, is one of grave responsibility, as the acting DNI will oversee and integrate the U.S. intelligence community and advise the president and the National Security Council on intelligence matters that concern national security.\n\nGrenell, a staunch supporter of Trump, will bring unwavering loyalty to the position. He has close ties to Trump's inner circle and the political network surrounding the White House. As acting DNI, Grenell will be the first openly gay Cabinet secretary.\n\nBefore being confirmed as ambassador to Germany, Grenell spent much of the previous two decades as a political adviser to Republicans, as the longest-serving U.S. spokesperson to the United Nations, and as the founder of Capitol Media Partners\u2014a media and public affairs consultancy. Grenell has never worked for an intelligence agency.\n\nGrenell has been a regular on Fox News and has been aggressively pursuing Trump's agenda in Germany, earning high praise from Trump and impassioned complaints from some German politicians. He has already been Senate-confirmed as ambassador to Germany. It's not yet clear whether Trump will ultimately nominate him for the permanent DNI position, which would require another Senate confirmation. Trump has told people he likes putting people in \"acting\" positions because it gives him flexibility.\n\nAs ambassador, Grenell has pressured German companies to cut business with Iran, urged Germany to hike its NATO contributions, and warned the Germans against participating in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline with Russia. On Sunday, Grenell tweeted, \"Any nation who chooses to use an untrustworthy 5G vendor will jeopardize our ability to share Intelligence and information at the highest level.\"\n\nSome German politicians objected to this Twitter diplomacy, but Grenell doubled down. \"No one is threatening you,\" he tweeted. \"I could say you are threatening the US that we must continue as usual even when you make dangerous mistakes. We get to have our own policy too.\"\n\nTrump had a fraught relationship with previous DNI Coats and blocked deputy DNI Sue Gordon from becoming acting director upon Coats' departure in August 2019. The big picture remains to be seen as Grenell takes on his new role.",
    " Title: House and Senate Approve Short-Term Spending Bill, Avert Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a swift bipartisan effort, the House and Senate approved a short-term spending bill early Friday, averting a government shutdown that began at midnight. The bill, which will keep the government open for another six weeks, allows lawmakers to start negotiating a comprehensive two-year deal that lifts spending caps on defense and non-defense spending and suspends the debt ceiling for 13 months.\n\nThe House voted 240-186 in favor of the bill, while the Senate passed it with a 71-28 vote. The bill now awaits President Trump's signature.\n\nThe bill provides funding for the government until March 23, allowing lawmakers to work on a more extensive two-year deal. The deal will lift the spending caps on defense and non-defense spending and suspend the debt ceiling for 13 months, enabling more borrowing.\n\nPresident Trump announced his approval of the measure shortly before 9 a.m. Friday, praising its support for the military and stating that it will also be good for the economy.\n\nDemocrats welcomed the increase in domestic spending, while Republicans applauded the surge in defense spending. Speaker Paul D. Ryan highlighted the bill's provisions for military rebuilding, disaster relief, and combating the opioid epidemic.\n\nIndividual lawmakers also pointed to various provisions in the bill that would benefit their home states, such as tens of billions of dollars in disaster relief for Texas and special protections for dairy farmers that will benefit Vermont.\n\nHowever, some lawmakers, particularly liberals, objected to the lack of action to protect young illegal immigrant \"Dreamers.\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi reiterated her call for a freewheeling debate on the issue.\n\nMany House Democrats initially withheld their votes, but more than 70 eventually voted yes to help Republicans get the measure across the finish line. More than 60 Republicans still voted no, as some conservatives argued that the budget amounted to a retreat on the spending cuts the GOP had won over the last six years.\n\nSen. Rand Paul had temporarily held up the proceedings in the Senate, sending the government into an official shutdown\u2014already the second of the year. Mr. Paul, the Kentucky Republican who forced the shutdown with his filibuster, showed no regrets, stating that he would continue to stand up for fiscal responsibility, regardless of which party is in power.",
    " Title: The Connection Between Fatherlessness and Mass Shootings: A Call for Stronger Family Structures\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the El Paso mass shooting, a recurring theme has emerged: the shooter's parents divorced eight years ago. This revelation, while not surprising, highlights a troubling trend among mass shooters, particularly school shooters and those involved in drug and gang-related violence.\n\nIn cities like Baltimore, where violence is rampant, fewer than 20% of teens are being raised by married parents. This statistic, though alarming, is a reflection of a broader issue: the impact of fatherlessness on society.\n\nThis week, as calls for action echo, a solution that doesn't involve legislative changes but rather personal responsibility is being proposed: raising our own children. This approach, while not a panacea, could have a profound and far-reaching effect compared to any legislative measure.\n\nThe negative consequences of fatherlessness are well-documented. A boy growing up without a father is more likely to experience feelings of abandonment and confusion, which can manifest as deep, simmering anger. This anger, without a father's guidance, can go unchecked and lead to destructive behavior.\n\nFathers are uniquely positioned to teach their sons how to channel anger and aggression constructively. They teach their sons how to take healthy risks, how to fight back and stand up to bullies, and how to respect women and protect the vulnerable. Mothers can impart these lessons, but the impact is often less profound when the lessons are not demonstrated by a father.\n\nIt's crucial to note that this is not an excuse for the actions of mass murderers. They are accountable for their actions, regardless of their upbringing. However, it's better to prevent these disadvantages from arising in the first place. And that's where parents, especially fathers, come in.\n\nAs a society, we should focus on strengthening family structures before turning to legislative solutions. By staying married, being present, raising our children, and loving them, we can help reduce the likelihood of future acts of violence. This is a call for personal responsibility, a call for us to do something within our control to create a safer, more compassionate society.",
    " Title: The Human Side of Immigration: A Tribute to Paul Gavora and the American Dream\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate on immigration, it is easy to lose sight of the human stories that lie at the heart of this complex issue. This week, we take a step back from the political fray to remember Paul Gavora, a man who embodied the American Dream and the spirit of immigration.\n\nBorn Vladimir Gavora in 1931 in the Slovakian village of Brezova pod Bradlom, Paul's life was marked by hardship and resilience. At the age of seven, he witnessed the German invasion, and at 13, he lost his father. By 14, he had escaped the Communist regime, swimming the Danube by moonlight to seek refuge in Austria. His story is a testament to the human spirit's ability to endure and adapt in the face of adversity.\n\nPaul's journey to the United States was far from easy. He spent time in a German refugee camp before being sent to Germany to complete his high school education. He worked as a hand on a United Nations refugee ship, braving a biblical storm to prevent panicking passengers from rushing to the top deck. His life took him to Colorado State University, where he changed his name to Paul and met his wife, Donna. Together, they raised nine children and built a life in Fairbanks, Alaska.\n\nPaul's story is not one of political ideology but of human determination and the opportunity for a better life. He was a man who took advantage of the opportunities America offered, opening seven supermarkets, Fairbanks' first shopping mall, and a wholesale food business that supplied native villages and the Russian far east alike. He was a pillar of his community, investing his time, money, and love in the people around him.\n\nThe immigration debate in America today is often fraught with polarizing rhetoric, casting immigrants as either victims or villains. However, Paul's story serves as a reminder that immigrants are human beings, desperate to make the most of the American dream as they see it. They are not members of MS-13 or eager to be props for the latest campus debate about intersectionality. They are people leaving or fleeing their places of birth for the freedom to try their best.\n\nPaul's story is a testament to the American Dream, a dream that is not owned by any political party but a dream that can be abandoned by all. It is a dream that reminds us of the humanity in immigration and the importance of remembering the individuals who, like Paul, have made America their home. Paul Gavora's life serves as a reminder that the immigration story in America is not a political talking point but a human story, one that deserves to be told and remembered.",
    " Title: California Voters to Decide on Cage-Free Farm Animal Standards for Nationwide Producers\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia voters will soon decide on Proposition 12, a ballot measure that aims to ban the sale of meat and eggs from farm animals raised in cages. If passed, the measure will require more spacious living conditions for pigs, veal calves, and egg-laying hens, not only for animals in California but also for those raised elsewhere and sold in the Golden State.\n\nThe measure, reminiscent of a similar animal welfare law passed in 2008, seeks to ensure farm animals live in conditions that align with their natural habitats. The Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals are among the supporters of Proposition 12.\n\nThe Yes on 12 campaign has raised $6.1 million as of Sept. 28, while the opposing group, Stop the Rotten Egg Initiative, has raised approximately $566,000. The next financial reporting deadline is Oct. 25.\n\nDede Boies, a farmer who raises chickens, ducks, turkeys, and pigs on Root Down Farm in Pescadero, supports the measure. Boies emphasizes the importance of raising animals in a way that allows them to live as they were intended to.\n\nUnder Proposition 12, farm animals will be required to have a specific amount of floor space beginning in 2020: 43 square feet for a veal calf, 24 square feet for a breeding pig, and 1 square foot for an egg-laying hen. Cage-free conditions will be mandatory for hens by 2022.\n\nOpponents of Proposition 12, such as the Association of California Egg Farmers and the National Pork Producers Council, argue that the measure applies to all veal, pork, and eggs sold in California, even when the animals are raised in other states. This could potentially impact farmers like Ken Maschhoff, a fifth-generation hog farmer from Carlyle, Illinois, who runs one of the largest pork operations in the U.S.\n\nMaschhoff, who confines his pregnant pigs in gestation crates for about 100 days, argues that the measure will require the pork industry to spend billions on new facilities, costs that may be passed on to consumers. Economists find it challenging to forecast exact pork price increases, but egg prices, which are already higher for cage-free eggs, could increase by $100 to $150 per year for consumers.\n\nAnother factor that could impact egg prices is the uncertain future of the new standards, as animal welfare groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals have expressed opposition to the measure, stating that it does not go far enough to protect chickens, which can still be confined in barns if the proposal passes.\n\nIf voters approve Proposition 12 on Nov. 6, the debate over farm animal living conditions may not end, as animal welfare groups continue to advocate for stricter standards.",
    " Title: Nationwide Protests Erupt Over George Floyd's Death: A Closer Look at the Unrest in New York, Atlanta, Detroit, and Denver\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the tragic death of George Floyd, a Minneapolis black man who died after being pinned by a white police officer's knee, protests have erupted across the United States. This article provides an overview of the demonstrations that took place in New York, Atlanta, Detroit, and Denver, highlighting the diverse and passionate responses from protesters demanding justice and an end to police brutality.\n\nIn New York, thousands of protesters stormed the security perimeter of Barclays Center, leading to numerous arrests and the shutdown of a major thoroughfare. The demonstrators were pressing for legislation outlawing the police \"chokehold\" used in the 2014 death of Eric Garner, another black man. Bernice King, the youngest daughter of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., implored protesters to maintain non-violence in her father's hometown.\n\nAtlanta saw a demonstration turn chaotic and at times violent, with fires burning in downtown Atlanta near the CNN Center, the network's headquarters. Hundreds of protesters defied an 8 p.m. curfew, gathering in the streets around a police station that had been burned the previous night.\n\nIn Detroit, hundreds joined a \"March Against Police Brutality,\" with many chanting \"No justice, no peace.\" A 19-year-old man protesting in the city was shot dead on Friday night by a suspect who fled after firing gunshots into the crowd.\n\nDenver saw a second day of protests, with hundreds marching peacefully through the city demanding justice for Floyd. Hundreds gathered at City Hall, spilling onto Interstate 45's entrance ramp, chanting \"I can't breathe\" and \"No justice, no peace.\"\n\nAs the nation grapples with the ongoing issue of police brutality and systemic racism, these protests serve as a powerful reminder of the urgent need for change and the resilience of the American people in their pursuit of justice and equality.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's 2014 Term Kicks Off with Speedy Decisions on Controversial Issues, Leaving Decision-Making Process Shrouded in Mystery\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court commenced its 2014 term this month with swift actions on same-sex marriage, voting rights, and abortion, all of which were decided in private without any explanation or breakdown of individual justices' votes. The court issued 17 words on Friday to clear the way for same-sex marriages in Alaska, and the justices did not disclose their votes or explain their actions on the 11 new cases they decided to hear this winter, or the over 1,900 they declined to hear.\n\nThe court's speedy start in making major decisions with national implications has been largely shrouded in secrecy. Eric Segall, a law professor at Georgia State University and co-author of the forthcoming book Supreme Secrecy, stated, \"All of America wants to know what they're thinking, and they refuse to let us know.\" Segall added, \"They want to stay mysterious, they want to stay aloof.\"\n\nThe court's mystery began to emerge on its opening day. While the justices debated a case that hinged on a broken brake light, their decision not to consider any of the pending same-sex marriage cases was hidden inside an 81-page list of cases similarly denied their day in court.\n\nIn the two weeks since, the court has interceded in a series of cases on gay marriage, voting rights, and abortion to consider emergency appeals. The court upheld, reversed, or altered lower court rulings without explanation, with only the dissenters explaining their votes.\n\nThe court's operating procedure is considered normal, and it has its defenders. If the justices announced their votes on every case they refused to hear, it could affect how future cases on the same topics are litigated and decided. Additionally, there is not enough time to write opinions for every emergency petition, which usually require rapid-fire rulings.\n\nThere have been instances in the past when the court saw fit to explain even emergency opinions. In 2009, it issued a three-paragraph explanation of its decision not to block the sale of Chrysler's assets during bankruptcy proceedings. In a 2006 challenge to Arizona's voter ID law, the justices issued a complete ruling that has been cited frequently ever since.\n\nHowever, these are the exceptions. More often, the court's orders read like the one clearing the way for same-sex marriages in Alaska: \"The application for stay presented to Justice Kennedy and by him referred to the court is denied.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, now entering his 10th year on the court and seeking to solidify his central role in its administration and jurisprudence, appeared to be a key player in the past two weeks' somewhat furtive actions. On same-sex marriage, he likely was among the justices who refused to grant any cases from Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Indiana, or Wisconsin. That cleared the way for gay and lesbian marriages in those states and others\u2014the single biggest step yet taken toward a 50-state solution.\n\nRoberts also appeared to be a decisive vote in the court's blocking of an anti-abortion law in Texas and a voter ID law in Wisconsin. He sided with the court's conservatives in approving lesser voting restrictions in Ohio.\n\nNow that those decisions are in the history books, court-watchers are left to speculate about Roberts' actual role. Only the justices who dissented in those cases put their names to their actions. The two whose names never appeared\u2014Roberts and Kennedy\u2014assembled the majorities.\n\n\"Even lower courts seeking guidance for their own rulings have been left to guess why the justices issued certain rulings,\" says Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice. \"All of this is harmful to democracy.\" Aron added, \"In exchange for their lifetime appointments, the least that the justices owe the American people is clear explanations for their decisions and their conduct.\"\n\nThe American people get clear explanations in most instances, Roberts says. \"We are the most transparent branch of government,\" he said in 2011. \"Everything we do that has an impact is done in public\u2026our decisions are out there.\"\n\nHowever, the court's decisions come only in cases that are fully briefed and argued\u2014about 70 a year, just 1% of the petitions the court receives. To be sure, the court has issued lengthy rulings in some blockbusters recently\u2014upholding President Obama's health care law in 2012, striking down key sections of the Voting Rights Act and Defense of Marriage Act last year, and granting religious liberties to for-profit businesses and local governments this year.\n\nBut for the 7,500 or so cases that do not make it to the court's docket, the justices simply refuse to hear them without explanation, as they did in the recent gay marriage cases. The court has \"an enormous practical effect in society on people's lives by denying review,\" says Erwin Chemerinsky, founding dean of the University of California-Irvine School of Law and author of the recent book The Case Against the Supreme Court.\n\nChemerinsky notes that without offering explanations or vote counts, the justices in the last few weeks have affected the lives of thousands of voters in Ohio, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, thousands of women seeking abortions in Texas, and thousands of gay and lesbian couples in at least 11 states, from Virginia to Alaska.\n\n\"I can not think of any time when the Supreme Court was having such a practical effect through the preliminary orders they were issuing,\" he says. \"The problem, when it's an order without an opinion, is it just seems arbitrary.\"\n\nIf the justices think they are avoiding controversy by issuing brief, unexplained orders, however, this fall's flurry of rulings may come back to haunt them. That's because the orders are temporary; lower courts still must hear the cases on the merits, and their rulings can be appealed back to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"The\u2026decisions seem to be setting the court up to issue earth-shaking rulings on voting rights, abortion, and marriage equality in the heat of the next presidential election season,\" says Doug Kendall, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. \"In the name of prudence, the court is arranging to put itself at the center of the 2016 political maelstrom.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Addresses Healthcare Exchange Website Malfunctions and Outlines Solutions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an acknowledgment of the ongoing issues with the federal healthcare exchange website, President Obama admitted on Monday that the botched opening of the platform, designed for consumers to sign up for health insurance policies under the Affordable Care Act, is unacceptable. The malfunctions pose a significant threat to the ability of the health care exchanges to enroll the estimated seven million uninsured Americans in 2014, if not rectified promptly.\n\nThe administration, with Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius and President Obama himself at the helm, is ultimately responsible for the website's debacle. The administration attributes the problems partly to an unexpectedly high demand from people eager to compare insurance policies available in their states and partly to technical glitches that have hindered or slowed people from submitting applications and sent erroneous data to insurers. The reasons behind the administration's inability to anticipate the high demand remain unexplained. Furthermore, the nature of the technical problems, as well as the primary party responsible for them, has yet to be clearly elucidated.\n\nThe website's issues have caused frustration for millions of people seeking information and coverage. In response, the administration has proposed a two-pronged strategy to manage the Web site failures. First, they have enlisted information technology experts from both inside and outside the government to work around the clock, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to address the technical glitches. Second, they have expanded and publicized alternative methods to learn about health plans and costs, such as increased staffing at call centers available at all hours, in-person counselors (navigators) in each state to assist with enrollment, and downloadable applications that can be mailed in.\n\nPresident Obama also made a commitment to those who attempted to apply through the federal website but encountered difficulties: \"In the coming weeks, we will contact you directly, personally\" to advise on completing the application, shopping for coverage, and selecting a suitable plan.",
    " Title: Global Retail Giants Close Stores Worldwide Amidst Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nIn a significant escalation of the global response to the coronavirus outbreak, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), one of the world's leading technology companies, announced on Friday that it will close all its retail stores outside of Greater China for the next two weeks. This decision was followed by several other U.S. retailers over the weekend.\n\nIn a letter posted on the company's website, Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote, \"We will be closing all of our retail stores outside of Greater China until March 27.\"\n\nApparel retailer Urban Outfitters Inc (URBN.O), which owns brands including Anthropologie and Free People, announced on Saturday that it is closing all its consumer stores worldwide until at least March 28.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) has temporarily closed \"a number of its stores\" across the United States to expand its work-from-home policy to include some of its retail employees. T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) will temporarily close its stores located in a shopping mall starting March 16.\n\nApple reopened all 42 of its branded stores in China on Friday, as the number of new cases fell in the country where the coronavirus outbreak originated. The World Health Organization reports that as of now, over 153,000 people have been infected globally, with over 5,788 deaths.\n\nRetailers are bracing for a potential blow to sales as virus-wary shoppers in Europe and the United States stay home. U.S. retailers such as Macy\u2019s Inc (M.N), Saks Fifth Avenue, and Gap Inc\u2019s (GPS.N) Banana Republic have remained open in an attempt to stem losses due to a steep drop in traffic.\n\nIn response to the store closures, Apple's hourly workers will continue to receive pay, and online sales will continue as usual. Cook also stated, \"In all of our offices, we are moving to flexible work arrangements worldwide outside of Greater China. That means team members should work remotely if their job allows.\"\n\nPhiladelphia-based Urban Outfitters also confirmed that it would continue to pay its store employees while stores are closed. The global retail industry is facing unprecedented challenges due to the coronavirus outbreak, and these closures are a significant step in the efforts to contain the virus's spread.",
    " Title: Murray-Ryan Budget Deal: Convenient for Congress, Challenging for the Nation\n\nThe recently agreed two-year budget deal between Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Paul Ryan is being hailed as a convenient solution for Congress, but it may prove detrimental for the nation as a whole. The deal, which aims to forestall election-year standoffs, leaves out crucial elements such as an extension of unemployment benefits and increases federal employees' retirement contributions, potentially slowing economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe convenience for Congress is evident. Since the Republicans took control of the House in 2010, the country has witnessed several contentious budget standoffs and two government shutdowns, as well as two near-defaults on the government's debt. These standoffs have been detrimental to the nation, with services disrupted and workers left unpaid. By avoiding such standoffs, the budget deal provides Congress with a reprieve, ensuring a smoother path through the election year.\n\nHowever, the deal's impact on the rest of the country is less favorable. One significant omission from the agreement is the lack of an extension of unemployment benefits. As a result, more than 1 million jobless workers will lose their benefits in 2014. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this will slow economic growth by 0.2 percentage points and reduce the number of jobs by around 300,000.\n\nWhile Congress has reallocated funds to soften the impact of sequester cuts, one particular reshuffling deserves attention. The budget deal would require federal employees to increase their retirement contributions, effectively reducing their pay by another 1%. This cut comes on top of pay freezes that have resulted in real wage decreases of more than 5% over the past three years.\n\nPerhaps the most significant issue for the public is that the federal budget will continue to impede economic growth by failing to stimulate the necessary growth to return to full employment. While the stimulus package approved by Congress boosted growth and added between 2-3 million jobs, the steep deficit reduction of the last three years has slowed the economy, costing millions of jobs.\n\nThe economy is still missing close to $1 trillion in annual demand due to the collapse of the housing bubble. Without a mechanism in the private sector to replace this demand, the only viable solution is increased government spending. However, the Murray-Ryan budget deal does not allocate funds for infrastructure projects, energy-efficient retrofits, or improvements in healthcare and education \u2013 areas that could have stimulated economic growth and created jobs.\n\nIn conclusion, the Murray-Ryan budget deal may provide Congress with a more comfortable election year, but it does little to address the nation's economic challenges. Millions of people will continue to be unemployed or underemployed, and workers will lack the bargaining power to secure their share of economic growth. The deal's failure to expand demand in the economy may prolong the nation's economic malaise.",
    " Title: Grassroots Opposition to Immigration Bill Lacks Fervor Compared to 2007 Effort\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2007, grassroots activists successfully derailed Congress's attempt to overhaul immigration laws. However, this time around, their efforts have yet to ignite a similar level of opposition. Last week, coordinated rallies to oppose the current bipartisan immigration legislation drew sparse crowds, with fewer than 10 people showing up for a protest in Dover, Del. The number of phone calls to lawmakers' offices opposing the bill has been a fraction of what it was six years ago.\n\nThe current immigration bill, introduced by a group of senators known as the \"Gang of Eight,\" would provide a pathway to citizenship to about 11 million people illegally in the U.S. and create new work visa programs. It would also require the Homeland Security Secretary to submit a border security plan before illegal immigrants gain provisional legal status, the first step in the legalization process. The plan does not have to be implemented for the process to begin, and a system for employment verification would come later.\n\nOpponents of the bill say that, like the 2007 effort, it amounts to amnesty for lawbreakers and does not stem the flow of illegal immigration. Adding legalized immigrants to the workforce would disadvantage jobless Americans, they say.\n\nHowever, this year's bill has not stirred as much opposition. It has more support from mainstream Republicans eager to improve the party's standing with the fast-growing Hispanic population, and from many evangelical Christian leaders. Additionally, a steep drop in illegal immigration in recent years has meant fewer television images of migrants sneaking into the country.\n\nProtesters at the Phoenix offices of Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake spoke last week against the immigration bill that the lawmakers helped write. Despite this, prospects for the bill's passage appear mixed. The Senate legislation has not yet been tested in that chamber, and efforts by a bipartisan House group to write a similarly broad bill have not succeeded. The path-to-citizenship provision of the Senate bill could prove particularly troubling in the House.\n\nMeanwhile, opponents promise to intensify their campaign. Rusty Childress, a veteran opponent of illegal immigration in Phoenix, leads \"Remember 1986,\" a group named after the year of the last big immigration overhaul, signed by President Ronald Reagan. The group sponsored the coordinated rallies last week, many of which were dwarfed by larger protests the same day against the Internal Revenue Service over its scrutiny of conservative groups. Mr. Childress said his group would start targeting a tea-party base that he said is \"newly energized\" since the IRS news broke.\n\nA fierce backlash against the bill six years ago ultimately spelled its demise because it prompted lawmakers such as Georgia Republican Sens. Johnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss, who helped draft sections of the measure, to withdraw support. \"The backlash began as soon as an outline for a bill was announced, and it was relentless,\" said Joan Kirchner, a top aide to Mr. Isakson. Neither of the Georgia senators has taken a public position on this year's bill.\n\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Isakson's office has been receiving about 100 calls a day versus as many as 2,000 a day in 2007. The volume is expected to rise if a bill reaches the floor, Ms. Kirchner said, \"but signs are it won't be as intense.\" Activists said they are planning a protest outside Mr. Isakson's Atlanta office in early June.\n\nMichael Harrison, publisher of Talkers, a talk-radio trade magazine, said many influential hosts have \"moved on\" to discuss gun control, health care, and other \"hit topics\" because \"the public's attitude is different on immigration.\"\n\nAlan Ogushoff, who made protest calls to Mr. Chambliss's office in 2007, often several times a day, said he remains a foe of any legalization. However, the avid listener of conservative talk radio said, \"I'm just going to let this happen and move on; I'm burned out fighting it.\"\n\nRoy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, a group that channeled opposition to the 2007 bill into a barrage of calls and emails to lawmakers, agreed \"there may be some fatigue\" now. However, the group over the weekend said it unveiled TV and radio ads in 18 states opposing the bill. One radio script warning of the dangers of adding more potential workers says: \"Jobs\u201420 million of our friends, family, and neighbors still can't find one.\"\n\nGroups pressing for an immigration overhaul, such as businesses and undocumented youngsters, also have been more vocal. The Evangelical Immigration Table, made up of leaders of Christian groups, this week will launch a new round of national radio ads to promote the bill.\n\n\"This time, there is not as much emotion on our side,\" said Mr. Beck of NumbersUSA. But, \"I do not know if that means there is less resolve.\"",
    " Title: Record Number of Americans Sign Up for Health Insurance on HealthCare.gov Ahead of Deadline\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant surge, more than 670,000 Americans signed up for health insurance on HealthCare.gov ahead of the Dec. 15 deadline for Jan. 1 coverage, marking the highest enrollment since the launch of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges three years ago. This was announced by President Barack Obama on Friday.\n\nDespite technical issues that caused about 1 million people to leave their contact information as they were unable to access the site, the number of sign-ups this year surpassed the 600,000 people who signed up last year on Dec. 15. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) extended the enrollment deadline on the federal exchange until 11:59 PM PST on Dec. 19, due to the high volume of traffic.\n\nHealthCare.gov handles enrollment for 38 states, and while deadlines for state exchanges vary, several allow enrollment for Jan. 1 coverage for a few more days. This week, signups rose steadily, with more than 325,000 Americans selecting plans on HealthCare.gov on Monday, and over 380,000 Americans doing so on Tuesday, marking two of the biggest days in HealthCare.gov's history.\n\nThe administration has been actively promoting the law, as Republican members of Congress and President-elect Donald Trump have vowed to repeal it next month. However, even with a repeal, individuals who do not have insurance through their jobs will still be required to buy it at least through 2017 and likely longer. A plan to replace the ACA could take several years.\n\nEarlier this week, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell went on a four-city tour to Tampa, Orlando, New York, and East Newark, N.J., to meet with people who have benefited from the ACA and encourage Americans to get covered.

    " Title: Trump Suggests Rick Perry's Role in Ukraine Call, Amidst Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a private conversation with advisors, President Donald Trump reportedly stated that he did not initially want to make the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but did so at the behest of Energy Secretary Rick Perry. This revelation comes as Perry becomes increasingly embroiled in the ongoing impeachment inquiry led by congressional Democrats.\n\nAccording to sources, Trump's comments suggest he may be seeking to distance himself from any responsibility or recast the pretext for the call. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAnother source on the call said Trump added that \"more of this will be coming out in the next few days\" \u2014 referring to Perry. Text messages released this week between Trump administration officials and Andrey Yermak, a top aide to Zelensky, suggest that Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was a primary advocate for arranging the call. However, there is no mention of Perry playing a role in making this call happen in the text messages.\n\nZelensky's discussions with Trump revolved around buying American oil and working with the U.S. on energy independence, but Perry and LNG are not mentioned in the 5-page memo of the Trump-Zelensky call released by the White House.\n\nPerry, who is reportedly resigning by the end of this year, has faced scrutiny over his role in the impeachment inquiry. In May, Perry led a U.S. delegation to Ukraine for Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in place of Vice President Mike Pence, and Democrats have begun to press Perry for more information about the trip and his conversations with Ukrainian leaders. The House subpoena of Rudy Giuliani also seeks documents related to Perry's \"involvement with Ukrainian leaders last spring.\"\n\nHowever, Perry told the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday that, \"as God is my witness,\" neither Joe nor Hunter Biden's name ever came up. Perry's spokeswoman, Shaylyn Hynes, stated, \"Secretary Perry absolutely supported and encouraged the president to speak to the new president of Ukraine to discuss matters related to their energy security and economic development.\"\n\nPerry added that he is heading to Lithuania to meet with nearly two dozen European energy leaders (including Ukraine) to discuss these issues. The White House acknowledged the conference call in a Friday readout, stating that participants included Minority Leader McCarthy, Whip Steve Scalise, Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney, and GOP leaders on key House committees. The discussion focused on Friday's jobs report, the economy, and concerns about Democrats' impeachment inquiry.",
    " Title: Trump Suggests Trump National Doral Resort as Potential Venue for 2020 G7 Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nBIARRITZ, France - U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed hosting next year's Group of Seven (G7) summit at his own property, the Trump National Doral golf resort near Miami, but emphasized that he would not personally profit from the resort's selection.\n\nThe G7 countries traditionally take turns hosting the summit, often choosing locations that highlight areas of natural beauty. Trump praised the Florida resort for its size and proximity to Miami International Airport, stating that it offers a convenient location for world leaders.\n\n\"They love the location of the hotel. They also like the fact it's right next to the airport for convenience. And it is Miami, Doral, Miami, so it is a great area,\" Trump said during this year's summit in Biarritz, France.\n\nTrump noted that a final decision has yet to be made, but added, \"We haven't had anything that could even come close to competing with it, especially when you look at the location.\"\n\nIn a subsequent press conference, Trump reiterated that he would not directly benefit financially from hosting the G7 at his golf resort. \"From my standpoint, I'm not going to make any money. In my opinion, I'm not going to make any money,\" he said.\n\nTrump has attended three G7 summits, in Italy, Canada, and France. In the past, the meetings have been held at locations far from airports that can accommodate Air Force One, requiring the president to travel by helicopter or smaller plane. Trump highlighted the convenience of the Doral resort, stating, \"So many places are so far away, the drive is so long; they need helicopters. This is somewhere you can be at within minutes of landing.\"\n\nAlthough Trump expressed some displeasure about having to switch planes in France, he praised the setup in Biarritz, at a conference center overlooking the Atlantic. \"We can learn from what they did here, even architecturally, the way the rooms were set up and designed,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Trump made it clear that he would not invite any unexpected guests, as France did by inviting Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif for talks on the sidelines of the gathering on Saturday.",
    " Title: Understanding the \"Three R's\" of Police Reform: A Neutral Perspective on Reduce, Reinvent, and Redeploy\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the nation grapples with the ongoing debate over police funding, a clear understanding of what \"defunding the police\" entails is crucial. While some interpret it as a call for the abolition of law enforcement, others view it as a specific set of policy proposals aimed at reforming the system.\n\nOne such proposal comes from Randal Mayer, a former Cato policy analyst and longtime advocate of justice reform, who outlines what he calls the \"three R's of police reform\": Reduce, Reinvent, and Redeploy.\n\n\"Reduce\" encompasses cutting expenditures on militarized equipment, over-policing minor violations, and militarized training. Instead, funds would be directed towards reducing backlogs of rape kits, increasing detective ranks for investigating serious and violent crimes, and subsidizing malpractice insurance for police to make them more accountable for wrongdoing.\n\n\"Reinvent\" involves transforming police departments into community-focused organizations that prioritize de-escalation training, a shift in culture, and changes in engagement rules to minimize harm to suspects. This also includes rethinking military-style rankings, recruitment tactics, and the overall culture of police departments.\n\nLastly, \"Redeploy\" suggests that newly trained and cultured police would be reintroduced to the community to maintain law and order while being held accountable for their conduct and actions. The goal is to redefine the role of police in the community, moving away from a militarized response to peaceful protests or mental health check-ins, and towards a more community-oriented approach.\n\nRegardless of one's stance on the \"defund the police\" movement, these proposals raise important questions about the role of police in society and the kind of help we want when we call for their assistance.

    " Title: Armed Protesters Occupy Oregon Wildlife Refuge, Demand Release of Local Ranchers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, a group of armed protesters, who have named themselves Citizens for Constitutional Freedom, have taken over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. The group, led by Ammon Bundy, son of Cliven Bundy, who was involved in a standoff with the federal government in 2014, has listed their demands, which primarily revolve around the release of local ranchers Dwight and Steven Hammond.\n\nThe Hammonds were convicted of arson three years ago for fires that occurred on federal land in 2001 and 2006. Despite serving their original sentences for the conviction, an appellate judge ruled in October that the terms were too short under federal minimum sentencing laws. The Hammonds were ordered to serve four more years in prison, with Dwight and Steven arriving at the Terminal Island Federal Correctional Institution on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe Hammonds' attorneys stated, \"Dwight and Steven Hammond respect the rule of law. They have litigated this matter within the federal courts for over five years and, in every instance, have followed the order of the court without incident or violation.\"\n\nAmmon Bundy accused federal officials of launching an \"attack\" on the Hammonds for refusing to sell their land. The protesters took over the wildlife refuge on Saturday after participating in a peaceful rally.\n\nSheriff Dave Ward of Harney County has expressed his disapproval of the protesters, stating, \"These men came to Harney County claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers, when in reality these men had alternative motives to attempt to overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States.\"\n\nThe FBI has called for a \"peaceful resolution\" to the standoff, but has not provided specifics about their response due to \"safety considerations for both those inside the refuge as well as the law enforcement officers involved.\"\n\nAmmon Bundy's brother, Ryan, stated that the protesters plan on staying at the refuge as long as necessary. If the situation turns violent, he attributes it to the federal government's actions. \"We're here to restore order, we're here to restore rights, and that can go peacefully and easily,\" Ryan Bundy said.\n\nThe Hammonds have claimed that they lit the fires in 2001 and 2006 to reduce the growth of invasive plants and protect their property from wildfires. However, prosecutors argued that the fires were set to cover up poaching activities.\n\nThe current standoff is part of a decades-long dispute between some Westerners and the federal government over the use of public lands. The issue traces back to the 1970s and the \"Sagebrush Rebellion,\" a move by Western states like Nevada to increase local control over federal land. Critics of the push for more local control have said the federal government should administer the public lands for the widest possible uses, including environmental and recreation.",
    " Title: Trump Appoints Kellyanne Conway as Counselor, Establishing Three Power Centers in His Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a flurry of announcements on Thursday, President-elect Donald Trump filled out his senior team in the West Wing, naming campaign manager Kellyanne Conway as his counselor and installing Republican National Committee chief strategist Sean Spicer as his press secretary. The appointments promise a continuation of the competition for Trump's ear that occurred throughout the campaign and transition.\n\nTrump also appointed campaign spokesman Jason Miller as communications director, campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks as strategic communications director, and Dan Scavino, who ran social media for Trump's campaign, to do the same for his White House. These three, along with Spicer, were also given the title of assistant to the president.\n\nThe appointments ended weeks of rumors and jockeying for position among Trump's campaign veterans and supporters. Of the four, Hicks and Scavino are so-called Trump originals who were with him from the start. Other longtime aides have worried that they were being frozen out in favor of more recent hires like Conway and Miller and members of the GOP establishment like Spicer and incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.\n\nOne such loyalist, Corey Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager, on Wednesday announced that he will start a lobbying firm in D.C. rather than accept a White House job other than the one he wanted.\n\nWith Priebus as his chief of staff, Steve Bannon as his chief strategist, and Conway as his counselor, Trump has set up three competing power centers in his administration. In the first of two announcements on Thursday, Trump's transition team said Conway will \"continue her role as a close advisor to the president and will work with senior leadership to effectively message and execute the Administration's legislative priorities and actions.\"\n\nKellyanne Conway, who joined Trump's campaign as it was mired in controversy over the summer and managed it to a surprise victory last month, had previously said she was hesitant to accept a White House role because such a job would take her away from her four young children. She had previously hinted that she would turn down a position inside the White House. Ultimately, Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Thursday morning that \"it's very difficult to say no\" to a White House job, \"and the president-elect is a very persuasive man.\"\n\nConway, in her new position, will be the highest-ranking woman in the White House. On Thursday morning, she noted that past counselors to the president have included Karen Hughes, who filled that role for President George W. Bush, and Edwin Meese, who worked for President Ronald Reagan. She said that while her job title is not novel, her duties and responsibilities will not be modeled after any particular predecessor but will be specific to Trump's administration.\n\nConway, a veteran GOP pollster, has been one of his most visible spokespersons, both before and after Election Day, and she told CNN's \"New Day\" that she expects to keep communications as one aspect of her new job, even as Spicer, Hicks, Miller, and Scavino also play prominent roles. Dealing with data and strategy, pulling from her background, is also likely to be part of her new position, a role she said was established in her discussions with Trump's son-in-law and close adviser Jared Kushner.\n\nSpeaking with MSNBC, Conway said she expects Trump will ask her to continue serving as a \"discreet advisor\" and somebody who \"supports him in his effective connecting and communicating with America.\"\n\n\"Well, the portfolio will be whatever the president wants it to be,\" Conway said in explaining her new position to CNN anchor Chris Cuomo. \"I'm just really pleased and frankly very humbled, Chris, to take on this role in the West Wing, near the president, and to be supportive of the senior team that he already has in place, colleagues of mine that I've worked together very closely with throughout the campaign and the transition.\"\n\nThe incoming counselor to the president said Thursday morning that her concerns about White House work taking her away from her children were ultimately assuaged by seeing Trump spend time with his own children and grandchildren and by her decades-long relationships with female employees of Trump's companies. Conway said three of her four children are excited about the family's move from New Jersey to Washington, although her 12-year-old daughter did begin a \"keep the Conway kids from moving to Washington\" online petition.\n\nAt an event hosted by \u2588\u2588\u2588 earlier this month, Conway suggested that the demands placed on any White House staffer are especially difficult for mothers, a predicament she said many men do not understand.\n\n\"I do politely mention to them the question isn't would you take the job, the male sitting across from me who's going to take a big job in the White House. The question is would you want your wife to, the mother of children to? You really see their entire visage change. It's like, 'Oh, no, they wouldn't want their wife to take that job.'\"\n\nAsked Thursday morning on Fox Business Network if she would have enough time to do her job and still be a full-time mother, Conway responded, \"I don't play golf and I don't have a mistress so, I have a lot of time that a lot of these other men don't.\"\n\nThe transition team statement announcing Conway's White House position also seemingly jabbed at Democrat Hillary Clinton, who spoke often of shattering the \"glass ceiling\" by becoming the first woman elected to be president. Conway, the Trump team statement noted, is the first woman to manage a winning presidential campaign and as such, the Manhattan billionaire's campaign had \"shattered the glass ceiling for women.\"",
    " Title: Clarification on President Trump's Remarks at Press Conference Regarding George Floyd and Job Numbers\n\nIn a press conference on Friday, President Donald Trump made comments that were interpreted by several journalists and news outlets as referring to George Floyd's reaction to improving job numbers. However, a closer examination of the transcript reveals that Trump was not referring to the jobs numbers when he mentioned George Floyd.\n\nDuring the press conference, Trump discussed better-than-expected job numbers and the role of the National Guard in limiting damage caused by riots and looting. He then made the following comments:\n\n\"Equal justice under the law must mean that every American receives equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement, regardless of race, color, gender, or creed. They have to receive fair treatment from law enforcement. They have to receive it. We all saw what happened last week. We can't let that happen. Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying, 'This is a great thing that's happening for our country.' This is a great day for him. This is a great day for everybody. This is a great day for everybody. This is a great, great day in terms of equality. It's really what our Constitution requires and it's what our country is all about.\"\n\nWhile it is true that Trump made the comments at a press conference in which he touted better-than-expected job numbers, it is clear that Trump was referring to equal justice under the law when he mentioned George Floyd. The comments in question came immediately after Trump discussed the role of the National Guard in limiting damage caused by riots and looting, and Trump was contrasting places like Minnesota, where the National Guard was active, with New York.\n\nIt is reasonable to argue that Trump's comments were tone-deaf, given the context of George Floyd's death and the ongoing protests against police brutality and systemic racism. However, it is important to accurately report the content of the president's remarks and to avoid misinterpreting them. Trump was not \"imagining George Floyd's reaction to the jobs numbers,\" but rather expressing his hope for equal justice under the law and fair treatment for all Americans.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Increased Political Polarization as a Factor in Rising Income Inequality\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in the Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties has found that political polarization is a significant factor contributing to income inequality in the United States. The study suggests that the two major American political parties are primarily focused on economically benefiting their own constituents, leading to a seesawing of economic priorities that exacerbates income inequality.\n\nAccording to the study, Democrats are primarily concerned with unemployment, while Republicans focus on inflation and wages. This polarization, the study argues, leads to \"another pathway by which inequality is transmitted.\"\n\nGillian B. White, writing for The Atlantic, noted that this mounting polarization in America may result in political leaders prioritizing their core supporters, potentially leaving others economically disadvantaged.\n\nThis finding is not unique to this study. A Princeton study from 2014 found that from 1956 to 1996, partisanship became more stratified by income. In recent years, party affiliation has become increasingly tied to one's tax bracket, leading to a constant tug-of-war over the economy between the two parties.\n\nAnother study, released last year by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, found that while there are various causes of both income inequality and increased partisanship, the two seem inextricably linked. The study concluded that both income inequality and political polarization are endogenous (or internal) variables that feed back on each other.\n\nWhile the idea that party polarization is negatively impacting the fight to curb income inequality is not new, it is important to remember that this wasn't always the case. Historically, both parties had a mixture of rich and poor constituents that voted their interests, maintaining an economic balance for much of the second half of the 20th century.\n\nHowever, this is no longer the case, and such a change isn't doing the economy any favors. The studies suggest that the current state of political polarization is contributing to the widening income gap in the United States.",
    " Title: Former President George W. Bush Endorses Republican Senators in 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, former President George W. Bush has announced his intention to support several Republican incumbents in the upcoming Senate elections. According to The New York Times, Bush will be campaigning for Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Rob Portman (R-OH) in the coming weeks.\n\nThis move marks a significant shift in Bush's political involvement since the end of his second term in 2008. Since then, he has largely stayed out of the political limelight, only making a brief appearance during his brother Jeb's presidential campaign in the Republican primaries.\n\nThe change in Bush's political activity could be attributed to a rise in his approval ratings. A 2015 CNN poll showed that 52 percent of Americans had a favorable impression of him, a significant increase from 2009 when only around a third of the public approved of him.\n\nThe shift in public opinion might be due to the unfavorable image of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump. A new Washington Post/ABC News poll shows Trump's disapproval rating at an all-time high of 70 percent. This has caused some senators in tight races to distance themselves from Trump, with some even retracting previous endorsements.\n\nSens. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) and John McCain (R-AZ) are among those who have kept Trump at arm's length. Ayotte recently stated that she would \"support, but not endorse\" Trump, while Johnson, who once associated himself with Trump as \"the Ronald and the Donald,\" now echoes Ayotte's sentiments, saying, \"To me, support versus endorse are two totally different things. I intend to support.\"\n\nLast month, both George W. and George H.W. Bush announced they had no plans to endorse Trump as the presidential candidate or attend the party's convention in Cleveland this summer.\n\nNow, the 43rd president aims to use his influence to maintain the Republican-held Senate as a \"check and balance\" on the White House. The potential president he refers to was not specified.",

The standoff between the committee and the Justice Department has raised the prospect of Barr being held in contempt of Congress.\n\nThe committee chairman, Jerrold Nadler, accused the White House of \"complete stonewalling of Congress.\" The Justice Department also stated that it would not comply with a subpoena issued by Nadler for an unredacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report and files from the investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Barr was grilled by a Senate panel about his decision to clear President Donald Trump of obstruction of justice. His defense of his actions before the Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee came after Mueller expressed frustration over the report summary. Mueller is expected to testify to Congress later this month.\n\nThe Department of Justice stated that Nadler had placed conditions on the House Judiciary Committee hearing that were \"unprecedented and unnecessary.\" The department argued that the planned move to have attorneys question Barr was unnecessary because most of the committee members were themselves lawyers.\n\nHowever, Nadler told reporters he believed that Barr was afraid to testify on Thursday given \"how dishonest he has been.\" He added, \"We plan on subpoenaing him if he decides not to show up. He can run but he can't hide.\"\n\nBarr testified for the first time on Wednesday since the release of Mueller's 448-page report. The special counsel did not establish any collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign. However, the report did not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice. It concluded the Republican president had repeatedly intervened with an inquiry that he feared would doom his presidency.\n\nBarr, who was appointed by Trump, told the Senate Judiciary Committee he was \"frankly surprised\" Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the president had tried to obstruct justice. The attorney general added that he was \"absolutely\" confident in his own judgment that Trump did not unlawfully attempt to impede the investigation.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Barr's summary of Mueller's report escalated after a letter he had received from Mueller was made public. In the document, the special counsel stated that Barr's summary \"did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance\" of his report's findings, and caused \"public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Barr argued that the objections to his summary should be nullified by the release of the report itself. He stated, \"I made clear from the beginning that I was putting out the report, as much of the report as I could, and it was clear it was going to take three weeks or so, maybe four, to do that.\" Barr called the controversy surrounding the summary, and the consequent hearings, \"mind-bendingly bizarre.\"",
    " Title: Trump Defends Business Dealings in Russia, Calls Michael Cohen a \"Weak Person\"\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump defended his actions pursuing a business deal in Russia, describing it as \"very legal & very cool\" as he began his day at the G-20 summit in Argentina on Friday.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Trump reiterated his defense from Thursday, stating that he was doing nothing wrong in running his business during the 2016 presidential campaign. The controversy over Trump's pursuit of a Trump Tower in Russia resurfaced after his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to making false statements about his involvement in pursuing the deal.\n\nTrump tweeted, \"I am a very good developer, happily living my life, when I see our Country going in the wrong direction (to put it mildly). Against all odds, I decide to run for President & continue to run my business-very legal & very cool, talked about it on the campaign trail... Lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in Russia. Put up zero money, zero guarantees and didn\u2019t do the project. Witch Hunt!\"\n\nTrump called Cohen a \"liar\" and a \"weak person\" shortly after news broke earlier Thursday that Cohen had pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress in a deal with special counsel Robert Mueller, a significant development in the investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nCohen appeared in federal court in Manhattan Thursday where he entered a guilty plea to making misstatements to Congress in closed-door testimony last year about his contacts with Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump's dealings with Cohen, while serving as a senior executive in Trump's global empire, include several projects of interest to Mueller's prosecutors, most notably the pursuit of a Trump Tower project in Moscow during the presidential campaign. According to court documents, Cohen falsely told Congress the Moscow project ended in January 2016. He then continued to look into business plans on that deal, according to the court filing.\n\nCohen's dealings with Russia, as well as his involvement in other matters, are expected to be a focus of Mueller's investigation. Despite the plea deal, Trump said he's \"not worried at all\" about what Cohen might be telling Mueller.\n\nWhen asked why, if Cohen is \"weak\" and a \"liar,\" the president kept a close relationship with him for over a decade, Trump gave a vague response. \"Because a long time ago he did me a favor,\" Trump said.\n\nDespite the plea deal, Trump has previously denied that he has any business deals with Russia, tweeting shortly before he was inaugurated, \"I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA -- NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!\"",
    " Title: Saudi Court Sentences Five to Death, Three to Prison in Jamal Khashoggi Murder Case, but U.N. Investigator Accuses Riyadh of a \"Mockery\" of Justice\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a controversial ruling, a Saudi court on Monday sentenced five individuals to death and three to prison over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but a United Nations (U.N.) investigator accused Riyadh of making a \"mockery\" of justice by allowing the masterminds of the killing to go free.\n\nThe Saudi court, in a verdict that directly contradicts the findings of a U.N.-led investigation, ruled that the killing was not premeditated but carried out \"at the spur of the moment.\" Saudi Deputy Public Prosecutor and spokesman Shalaan al-Shalaan said the court dismissed charges against three of the 11 people tried, finding them not guilty.\n\nThe verdict has been met with criticism from various quarters, including Agnes Callamard, the U.N. special rapporteur for extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions, who described the trial verdict as a \"mockery\" of justice. \"The hit-men are guilty, sentenced to death. The masterminds not only walk free, they have barely been touched by the investigation and the trial,\" she said on Twitter.\n\nThe murder of Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and a critic of the kingdom's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), caused a global uproar and tarnished the crown prince's image. Some Western governments, as well as the CIA, said they believed he had ordered the killing. Saudi officials say he had no role, though in September MbS indicated some personal accountability, saying \"it happened under my watch.\"\n\nThe trial, which took place in secretive proceedings in the capital Riyadh, has been criticized for lack of transparency and the Saudi government's refusal to cooperate with independent investigators. The publisher of the Washington Post, a newspaper for which Khashoggi wrote a column, said the lack of transparency and the Saudi government's refusal to cooperate with independent investigators suggested \"a sham trial.\"\n\nThe verdict has also been criticized by human rights group Amnesty International, which described it as a \"whitewash\" that failed to address the Saudi authorities' involvement or the location of Khashoggi's remains. However, one of Khashoggi's sons said the verdicts had been fair to his children.\n\nThe trial outcome has been far from serving justice, according to Turkey, which said important issues like the location of Khashoggi's body, the identification of the instigators, and the local co-operators are still in the dark. The trial has been marred by allegations of a cover-up and the involvement of high-ranking Saudi officials in the murder. The U.S. government has also been critical of the Saudi government's handling of the case and has called for full accountability.",

One plane landed at a US Air Force base in California, and the other in Texas. The passengers will be isolated at military facilities for 14 days.\n\nThe Diamond Princess, with approximately 400 US citizens, has been in quarantine since February 3, along with some 3,700 passengers and crew. Meanwhile, China has reported 2,051 new cases in the past 24 hours, with more than 70,600 people across China infected by the virus, resulting in 1,771 deaths.\n\nIn Japan, a public gathering to celebrate the birthday of new Emperor Naruhito later this week has been cancelled due to concerns over the spread of the virus. Additionally, organisers of the Tokyo marathon due to take place on March 1 have cancelled the amateur part of the race, affecting some 38,000 runners, after cases of the virus were confirmed in the city. Only elite runners will be allowed to take part.\n\nChina's National People's Congress standing committee is set to meet next week to discuss a delay of this year's Congress - the Communist Party's most important annual gathering - due to the outbreak.\n\nAt the weekend, an American woman tested positive for the virus in Malaysia after leaving a cruise ship docked off the coast of Cambodia. There are fears for other passengers on the cruise, who are now dispersed around the world.\n\nA Russian woman who was ordered to go back to a quarantine facility by a St Petersburg court has returned to hospital. Last week, Alla Ilyina escaped from the facility after testing negative three times for the virus, but was told to remain quarantined for two weeks.\n\nMore than 300 passengers were repatriated voluntarily, the US State Department said. Fourteen of them were reported during transit to have tested positive for the virus and were being kept separate from the other passengers, it said. They will all undergo a 14-day quarantine, on top of the time they have already spent confined on the ship.\n\nUS officials later said 13 of the passengers thought to be \"high risk\" were sent on to a special facility at the University of Nebraska in Omaha. At least 40 US citizens who were already showing symptoms prior to the evacuation were not allowed on the planes and would be treated in Japan, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told US broadcaster CBS.\n\nSome Americans have declined to be evacuated, preferring to wait until the ship quarantine comes to an end on February 19. Passenger Matt Smith, a lawyer, said he would not want to travel on a bus to the plane with possibly infected people.\n\nThe cruise ship was put in quarantine in Japan's port of Yokohama after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was found to have the virus. On Monday, Japanese officials said there were 99 new cases of infections on board the ship, bringing the total to 454 confirmed cases. It is the largest cluster of cases outside China.\n\nA Russian woman who was on board and tested positive is thought to be the first Russian national to contract the virus, Reuters news agency reports. She will be taken to a hospital for treatment, the Russian embassy in Japan said.\n\nTo assist with relief efforts, Japan's government has given away 2,000 iPhones to passengers on the ship - one for each cabin. The smartphones were distributed so people could use an app, created by Japan's health ministry, which links users with doctors, pharmacists, and mental health counselors. Phones registered outside of Japan are unable to access the app.\n\nOther evacuation flights have been arranged to repatriate residents of Israel, Hong Kong, and Canada. On Monday, Australia announced that it would evacuate 200 of its citizens, and the UK said it was considering organizing an evacuation flight.\n\nAccording to official figures for February 16, 100 people died from the virus in Hubei, down from 139 on Saturday. The Chinese authorities are tightening curbs on movement to combat the outbreak. People in Hubei province, which has 60 million people, have been ordered to stay at home, though they will be allowed to leave in an emergency.\n\nIn addition, a single person from each household will be allowed to leave the building or compound they live in every three days to buy food and essential items.

    " Title: Global Support for Hong Kong Protesters: A Call for Action and Passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019\n\nArticle:\n\nHong Kong, once known for its autonomy and democratic rule, is currently in the midst of a political crisis. Protests have been ongoing for nearly four months, with the city center barricaded, stores shuttered, and a heavy riot police presence. The situation has prompted worldwide support for the protesters, with celebrities, crowdfunded media campaigns, and viral videos amplifying their message.\n\nThe people of Hong Kong are sending a clear message to the Chinese government: they want freedom and democracy. This desire stems from the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which guaranteed Hong Kong's autonomy and was signed by Margaret Thatcher and Zhao Ziyang. However, the Beijing-selected local government is violating this pact, leading residents to fear the loss of the political system they inherited from Britain.\n\nThe United States, a champion of global democratic values, is being called upon to answer this call with all the moral and diplomatic support it can muster. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, if passed, would proactively enshrine American support for Hong Kong's democracy and autonomy into law. This legislation would send a powerful symbolic message to the people of Hong Kong, demonstrating that American support for Hong Kong is more than just empty words.\n\nThe passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act would not only be a momentous symbolic statement that the world still cares about the people of Hong Kong, but it would also help incentivize the Hong Kong government to respect people's freedoms. It is time for the act to be passed, sending a signal to China that it cannot erode the city's autonomy while reaping the benefits.\n\nLeaders in Congress on both sides of the aisle have made strong statements condemning the Chinese and Hong Kong governments' actions, but now is the time to attach action to words. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 requires the State Department to annually certify and report to Congress whether Hong Kong's status of autonomy, and the government's adherence to protecting civil liberties and upholding the rule of law justify its continued special status. The Commerce Department would also submit an annual report to Congress that determines if China is exploiting Hong Kong to circumvent U.S. sanctions and export controls. This important bill also would ensure that violators of human rights in the region are held accountable by applying sanctions and banning entry to the U.S.\n\nAs the world watches the ongoing struggle for democracy in Hong Kong, it is crucial that the United States stands with the people of Hong Kong and continues to be a leading advocate for freedom in the world. The passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 would be a significant step in this direction.",
    " Title: Fatal Shooting at Oklahoma Walmart Leaves Three Dead, Shooter Among Victims\n\nA tragic incident unfolded on Monday, November 18, 2019, as a shooting outside a Walmart store in Duncan, Oklahoma, resulted in the deaths of three individuals. The shooter is among the deceased, according to authorities.\n\nDUNCAN, Oklahoma (AP) \u2014 In a shocking turn of events, two men and a woman were fatally shot Monday morning outside a Walmart store in southwestern Oklahoma. The shooting occurred just before 10 a.m. outside the store in Duncan, as reported by Police Chief Danny Ford.\n\nAuthorities have yet to disclose a motive for the shooting. Ford stated during a press conference Monday afternoon that investigators believe the gunman shot the male and female victims before turning the gun on himself.\n\nStephens County District Attorney Jason Hicks confirmed during the news conference that there was never an active shooter inside the store, describing the incident as an isolated event. Hicks did not provide further details.\n\nTwo bodies, covered with sheets, were visible in the parking lot Monday afternoon. One body was in the driver's seat of a red, two-door car. The other body was lying on the ground next to the vehicle. Bullet holes were visible in the car's windshield. Police reported finding a handgun at the scene.\n\nFord described the gun as semi-automatic but had no further details. He stated that the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation was still processing the scene.\n\nAuthorities have not released the identities of those killed, but they confirmed that the shooter was among the dead. Ford stated that all three knew each other but declined to describe their relationships or other identifying information pending notification of immediate family.\n\nHe confirmed that all three were dead when police arrived just minutes after the shooting.\n\nWalmart spokeswoman LeMia Jenkins initially stated that no staff were involved. Jenkins later released a statement offering thoughts and prayers for the family of the woman killed in the shooting, who she said had been with the company for less than two months. Jenkins stated that the woman was at the Walmart during her free time and was not scheduled to work that day.\n\nDuncan is a city of more than 22,000 residents located about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Oklahoma City. The Walmart is in a commercial center that includes a sporting goods store and a dollar store along U.S. Highway 81, the main road that passes through Duncan heading south toward Texas.\n\nAaron Helton, of Duncan, stated he was parking outside the Walmart where he planned to buy groceries when he heard about nine gunshots. Helton was one of many nearby witnesses who fortunately was not hit by gunfire. Ford stated that the closest person was in a vehicle three parking spaces away from where the victims sat.\n\n\"We got radio of a lot of people dodging and running,\" Ford said. \"There were people in the vicinity, for sure.\"\n\nThere were more than 100 vehicles in the parking lot about two hours after the shooting, plus a steady stream of customers coming and going from Walmart, which remained open for business.\n\nThis incident marks at least the third shooting at a Walmart in the U.S. this year. A Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, reopened Thursday after being closed since August, when a gunman opened fire in the busy store, killing 22. Just days before, two Walmart employees in Mississippi were killed by a man authorities described as a disgruntled Walmart worker.\n\nThe killings in Oklahoma come amid a spate of high-profile shootings across the U.S. A 16-year-old student at a high school in the city of Santa Clarita outside Los Angeles shot and killed two classmates and wounded three other teens Thursday before shooting himself in the head. He died the next day.\n\nIn New Jersey, players and spectators ran for cover Friday night when a gunman opened fire at a high school football game, wounding two people. And on Sunday, four people were killed and six wounded in Fresno, California, where police say two shooters sneaked into a backyard party and shot into a group of Hmong family and friends.",
    " Title: Senate Election 2018: Democrats Face Uphill Battle in Retaining Control of the Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Election Day approaches, the Democrats face an uphill battle in their quest to regain control of the Senate. The party is defending a larger number of seats than the Republicans, with many in conservative states, making the task particularly challenging. However, several key races remain close, and the Democrats have paths to retake the chamber, albeit difficult ones.\n\nLet's examine the Democrat-held seats, the ones they need to defend. The latest RealClearPolitics polling averages for these key races are as follows:\n\n- Missouri and Indiana: Very close (zero to 2-point races)\n- Missouri and Indiana: Democrats leading by 2 to 5 points\n- Florida, Montana, and West Virginia: Democrats leading by 7 to 11 points\n- Minnesota special, Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan, Wisconsin: Democrats leading by more than 11 points\n\nThe Republicans, on the other hand, have four main seats that the Democrats are targeting. The RealClearPolitics averages currently show:\n\n- Nevada and Arizona: Very close (zero to 2-point races)\n- Nevada and Arizona: Republicans leading by 5 to 6 points\n- Texas and Tennessee: Republicans leading by 6 to 7 points\n\nIn addition, there's a \"jungle primary\" in Mississippi today that will likely advance one Republican and one Democratic candidate to a runoff election, which would be held near the end of the month.\n\nDemocrats start off needing to gain two GOP-held seats for a majority. However, they also have many more imperiled incumbents, and for each one who loses, they'd have to pick off another GOP-held seat to keep their hopes of Senate control alive. These polls are why every pundit and forecaster agrees that Republicans are the favorite to hold the majority.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these polls are not infallible. Polling errors in the mid-single digits are common in individual Senate races, and in recent cycles, there's been at least one significant miss each year. On average, there can also be a partisan bias\u2014polls underestimated Republican candidates in key Senate races in 2014 and 2016, while underestimating Democratic candidates in 2012.\n\nWhile Republicans are playing whack-a-mole against Democratic challengers who keep popping up in the House, it's the Democrats who are faced with that difficult task in the Senate. They're defending 26 seats to Republicans' nine, and many of those Democratic incumbents are in states Donald Trump won.\n\nIf Democrats have a good night and win every Senate race where there's a difference of 5 points or fewer between the candidates right now, as well as all the other races they currently lead by larger margins, they would deliver them two pickups of GOP-held seats, in Nevada and Arizona, in addition to getting almost every Democratic incumbent reelected. That would get them within one seat of a majority\u2014because of the expected loss of Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), the sole Democratic incumbent who has fallen behind her Republican challenger substantially in RealClearPolitics' average (she trails by 11 points).\n\nIf Heitkamp does lose, Democrats need to find another pickup somewhere for a majority. They'd likely have to pin their hopes on either Phil Bredesen from Tennessee or Beto O'Rourke (D-TX), hoping one of them pulls off an impressive upset (both currently trail by 5 to 6 points, per RealClearPolitics).\n\nHowever, if another Democratic incumbent were to lose as well (say, Missouri's Claire McCaskill or Indiana's Joe Donnelly, who are both in races that polls show are about tied), the party would probably have to make up for it with both Bredesen and O'Rourke winning. If three Democratic incumbents lose, that ends the party's hopes for a majority, barring some total stunner elsewhere (such as in that Mississippi runoff that will likely be held at the end of November).\n\nIn conclusion, while the Democrats have a chance, the odds are against them. The Republicans are favored to hold the majority, but the Democrats do have something to hope for. The polling errors in recent years have shown that upsets can happen, and the Democrats will be hoping for just that on Election Day.",
    " Title: Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort Resigns Amidst Controversy, Steve Bannon Takes Over as New Campaign Leadership\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Donald Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has resigned from his position, marking the latest shakeup in a campaign that has been plagued by poor polling numbers and self-inflicted controversies. The resignation comes just days after Trump brought in Steve Bannon, former executive chairman of Breitbart News, as the new campaign leadership.\n\nWith voters in the crucial swing state of North Carolina able to cast absentee ballots in three weeks and Trump's poll numbers rapidly declining, the Republican nominee ousted his campaign chairman on Friday, two months after the forced departure of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.\n\nManafort's exit followed an unconventional move by Trump, who hours earlier had admitted that he \"regretted\" the pain caused by some of his intemperate remarks this year. In tightly scripted remarks, said to bear the hallmark of new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, Trump acknowledged that his swashbuckling style was proving self-destructive.\n\nTrump's apology at a rally in North Carolina did not specify precisely whom he was saying sorry to, but it was the first acknowledgment by the candidate that his unfiltered style was causing problems.\n\nNews of Manafort's resignation also came as a surprise to some within the campaign, and followed a slew of denials that a shakeup was underway. \"I would have thought we were done with revolving chairs,\" one source familiar with the campaign told \u2588\u2588\u2588 after the publication of Friday's statement.\n\nAnother person familiar with the shakeup said the change underlined how Manafort had never quite been able to communicate with Trump the way Lewandowski had. His departure meant Conway would be in charge of the messaging, while Bannon, a former banker, was there to run the business side of the campaign.\n\nIt was also pointed out that Trump had long been uncomfortable with the campaign spending heavily to buy television commercials, a step that was taken earlier this week with Trump shelling out $4m to go on the air in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. \"He thinks he is being robbed,\" said the source familiar with the shakeup. \"Boots on the ground are worth it\" but \"media buys, mail, and other stuff\" were looked on by Trump skeptically.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Trump's son Eric suggested that the controversy over Manafort's ties to Russia and a report this week that he had potentially committed a felony by evading the reporting requirements of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) led to the top operative being pushed out. \"My father just didn't want to have the distraction looming over the campaign, and quite frankly, looming over all the issues Hillary is facing right now,\" said the younger Trump.\n\nManafort, a veteran political strategist, has been under mounting scrutiny as more details emerged of his role in advising foreign politicians, including Ukrainian strongman Viktor Yanukovych. His close connections to Russia through Yanukovych, at a time when Trump is trying to criticize Clinton for taking money from foreign donors for her family foundation, were proving a growing problem.\n\nManafort first joined the campaign as an unpaid adviser in March after Trump had been repeatedly outmaneuvered in the delegation selection process by rival Ted Cruz. The veteran operative, who helped Gerald Ford win the last contested convention in American history in 1976, soon used that foothold to expand his mandate. Within weeks, he had in effect replaced former campaign manager Lewandowski, who was disdained by many within the party establishment as well as the Trump family.\n\nIn a statement issued on Friday, Trump suggested Manafort's role had peaked as an adviser during the Republican national convention in Cleveland, where rival Ted Cruz had threatened to lead a revolt, but this time expressed no regret over the departure. \"This morning Paul Manafort offered, and I accepted, his resignation from the campaign,\" said a statement from the Trump campaign issued on Friday morning. \"I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process. Paul is a true professional, and I wish him the greatest success.\"\n\nThe resignation, which contradicts claims Manafort would stay on earlier in the week, is the second time Trump has exercised his famed slogan \"you're fired\" \u2013 following the ousting of Lewandowski in June. Lewandowski is now thought likely to make a comeback within the constantly shifting Trump inner circle, as he favors the same approach of \"letting Trump be Trump\" as Bannon is believed to.\n\nTrump also appeared rattled by recent opinion polling which suggests he is far adrift of where he needs to be to challenge Clinton in crucial swing states. The urgent need to confront his collapse in the polls suggests expediency, rather than a personality, may have been the largest factor leading to Manafort's departure.\n\nAt a rally on Friday night in Dimondale, Michigan, he again read off a prepared speech, with no mention of polls or crowds \u2013 two of his favorite topics for months of rallies. Instead, he urged African Americans to join his \"change movement,\" saying, \"to those hurting, I say: what do you have to lose by trying something new?\"\n\nSigns of the old Trump did break through his restrained performance. At one point, he went off-script, riffing to the mostly white crowd, \"I am nothing more than your messenger.\"\n\n\"Strong defense, common sense, take care of our vets,\" he rhymed. \"I am the change agent.\"\n\nAmid the Trump campaign shakeup and the apologetic address on Thursday night, Democrats rejected the notion of a new-look Trump on Friday, ridiculing a new emphasis on unifying the country that emerged on the same day as a campaign ad attacking immigrants.\n\n\"In case you thought for a split second Trump was genuine about feeling regret, he is back to demonizing immigrants again in his new ad today,\" said Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon.",
    " Title: Liberal Perception of Trump Voters and Right-Wing Nationalism: A Closer Look at the \"Regressive Attitudes\" Narrative\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent times, a recurring narrative has emerged among liberals, suggesting that supporters of right-wing figures like Donald Trump and their counterparts in various Western countries are primarily motivated by \"regressive attitudes\" such as racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. This perspective is not a new phenomenon, but has gained traction in the media and political discourse, particularly in the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the Brexit referendum.\n\nOne of the most comprehensive analyses of this perspective can be found in a recent article by Zack Beauchamp of Vox, who cites a range of academic studies to support the view that the rise of right-wing nationalism cannot be attributed solely to economic anxiety. Instead, Beauchamp argues that these movements are driven by \"regressive attitudes toward difference,\" with racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia being the primary factors.\n\nThis perspective, however, has sparked controversy and criticism, with many arguing that it displays outright contempt for \"particularistic instincts\" that are not only morally and politically acceptable but may also be inherent to human beings and political life. Critics contend that this perspective overlooks the economic and cultural challenges faced by communities that have experienced significant change, and that it fails to acknowledge the validity of certain forms of solidarity, be it national, linguistic, religious, territorial, or ethnic.\n\nThe debate surrounding this issue underscores the deep divide between liberals and their conservative counterparts, with each side holding firm to their respective beliefs. While liberals argue that universalistic cosmopolitanism is the key to a more inclusive and equitable society, conservatives maintain that particularistic attachments and identities are essential for preserving cultural and national identity.\n\nAs the Western world grapples with the rise of right-wing nationalism, it is crucial to engage in open and honest dialogue about the underlying causes and consequences of this phenomenon. By understanding the complex interplay of economic, cultural, and political factors, we can better address the challenges facing our societies and work towards a more inclusive and harmonious future.",
    " Title: Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. Demands Arrest of Reporters, Sparks Free Speech Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nJerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University, has long advocated for free expression and intellectual diversity on college campuses. In a June statement, he urged colleges and universities to encourage open political discourse, citing Liberty University as an example. However, Falwell is now demanding the arrest of two reporters he accuses of painting his school in a negative light.\n\nIn an interview with radio host Todd Starnes, Falwell criticized reporters at The New York Times and ProPublica for their coverage of his decision to partially reopen Liberty University during the COVID-19 outbreak. He claimed that both pieces unfairly portrayed Liberty's attitude toward the coronavirus as flippant and careless.\n\nFalwell singled out a conversation between Times journalist Elizabeth Williamson and local physician Thomas W. Eppes Jr., in which Williamson wrote that Eppes told her \"nearly a dozen Liberty students were sick with symptoms that suggested Covid-19.\" Falwell argued that the presumptive cases never numbered as high as 12, a depiction he called \"sensational click-bait.\"\n\nAs a result, Falwell secured arrest warrants for Times photographer Julia Rendleman and ProPublica reporter Alec MacGillis for trespassing, a Class 1 misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail. He also stated that an additional warrant is coming against someone affiliated with another \"big time liberal news organization.\" (There is no warrant against Williamson because she did not take any photographs, so there is no physical proof that she was on campus.) Falwell also threatened to sue The New York Times if a retraction or Liberty-friendly correction is not issued regarding the contagion numbers.\n\nThe trespassing charges are unlikely to hold up in court, as the reporters were photographing a student who invited them to campus for an interview. However, the alleged trespassing is not the main concern here, according to free speech lawyer Ari Cohn, a former director at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). \"It is clear that Falwell is engaged in a campaign of petty retribution against journalists who write articles critical of the university,\" Cohn said. \"But that's actually completely in line with Liberty University's faux concern for freedom of expression. Falwell's idea of freedom of expression on campus includes only expression that he approves of.\"\n\nThe heavy-handed approach to free speech is not limited to the media. Calum Best, the student interviewed by both The New York Times and ProPublica, described an angry phone call he received from Scott Lamb, the college's senior vice president for university communications, after he wrote a Facebook post arguing for tuition refunds amid COVID-19. Lamb included Best's work-study boss on the call.\n\n\"I thought I was in deep trouble for some professional failure,\" Best wrote on Medium. \"But, as the call went on, I realized my boss had no need to be there, and had no connection to the matter at hand.\"\n\nSimilar heavy-handedness is also evident in Liberty University's student paper, Champion. Will E. Young, the former editor-in-chief, wrote last year that Falwell actively interfered with Trump-critical coverage, at one point removing a student op-ed lamenting Trump's Access Hollywood tape. The author of that op-ed, Joel Schmieg, took to Facebook to air the grievance and was promptly contacted by a faculty adviser, who reprimanded him for doing so. Schmieg then resigned.\n\nAs a private institution, Liberty University can set its own rules of conduct. However, it's the height of hypocrisy to muzzle student speech while making a show of opposing censorship. And the university president is not just dealing with a newspaper on its own turf: With these warrants, Falwell is leveraging state power to try to stop speech by private actors whose only connection to his school is to write about it. It's a bad approach for anyone to take, but especially someone who claims to support free expression and intellectual diversity.",
    " Title: Biden Campaign Intensifies Outreach to Latino Voters Ahead of 2020 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In an effort to bolster support among Latinos, Joe Biden's campaign is undertaking a significant turnaround campaign, hiring a number of Hispanic operatives, investing $1 million in Spanish-language outreach, and signing on one of the nation's top pollsters in the field, Latino Decisions.\n\nRecent general election polls show Biden with a solid lead nationwide and in many battleground states. He is already leading among Hispanic voters. If Biden can achieve the same level of support and turnout as Hillary Clinton did in 2016, while continuing to do better than she did among black and white voters, he would effectively deny President Trump a second term by winning crucial battlegrounds such as Florida and Arizona.\n\n\"There's a huge opportunity,\" said Matt Barreto, Latino Decisions co-founder and pollster who also worked for Clinton's campaign, adding that it \"did an okay job\" with Latino turnout and support levels.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, has a record on immigration, Puerto Rico, healthcare, coronavirus response, and foreign policy. Democrats learned from Florida's last election that failing to aggressively reach out to Latino voters cost them the governor's office and the retention of a U.S. Senate seat.\n\n\"In 2018, some of the statewide campaigns in Florida did not have robust Latino engagement,\" Barreto said. \"Puerto Rican turnout in Central Florida was not robust.\"\n\nBiden's campaign plans to harness the \"incredible anger\" among Puerto Rican voters in Florida over Trump's handling of Hurricane Maria in 2017, Barreto says. The campaign also sees an opening to increase support levels in border-state Arizona, where Latinos have \"been deeply influenced by the immigrant rights movement, especially younger Latinos, and that is very bad news for Donald Trump.\" Already, 2018 demonstrated that heightened Latino turnout can flip the state, and with continued investment in Latino outreach, 2020 could follow the same path as 2018.\n\nThe Biden campaign is ready to \"pivot in South Florida and have different messages on the diversity of the community there, whether you're talking to the Cubans who were born in Cuba or born in the United States, South Americans... and engaging Latinos where they are and the issues that matter to them,\" said Jennifer Molina, Biden's Latino Media.\n\nThe Biden campaign has already begun this outreach in its Spanish-language TV ads that started running last month in Florida and Arizona. In Tucson and Phoenix, the ads were narrated by a Mexican-accented Spanish-speaker. In Miami, the narrator spoke in a Cuban accent. And in Orlando and Tampa, the narrator's voice was Puerto Rican.\n\n\"We're not taking anything for granted in this election,\" said Molina. \"The Latino vote is critically important, which is why we're bringing on Latino Decisions to help us with our messaging and outreach in order to engage with Latino voters on why Joe Biden is the best choice for President.\"\n\nMolina joined the campaign this month along with Pili Tobar, communications director for voter coalitions, and Juan Penalosa, a senior adviser in Florida. They join Julie Chavez Rodriguez, hired in May as a senior adviser, and the campaign's national Latino engagement director, Laura Jimenez, and a handful of other operatives with specialties in persuading and turning out Hispanic voters.\n\nIn a written statement, the Trump campaign said the president's values are shared by Hispanic voters who \"are motivated by jobs, education, family, faith, and community values. Those are core values for President Donald Trump and Republicans and leave little room for wondering why we continue to win in Florida.\"\n\nBiden advisers and campaign insiders, who acknowledge Biden has ground to make up with Hispanic voters if he wants to put Trump away, say the heightened focus on Latinos is driven by common-sense campaign strategy. But it's also a reflection of the greatly improved finances of the once cash-strapped campaign.\n\nTrump has a cash advantage and has been using it on TV\u2014the president's reelection campaign has spent nearly $1.2 million on Spanish-language TV ads in Arizona and Florida in the past three weeks, according to the Advertising Analytics tracking firm, which found that Biden's campaign has spent less than $100,000 on TV in that time. Including Spanish-language radio spots and digital ads, the Biden campaign said it is on pace to spend $1 million in five weeks. An outside group, Nuestro PAC, is also giving Biden Spanish-language air-support.\n\nWith the extra spending and new hires, Biden has made a sharp pivot toward addressing the longstanding criticisms of his Latino outreach from fellow Democrats, who have grown increasingly bullish on his chances of winning in November. The Biden campaign's continuing embrace of digital campaigning amid the pandemic could have a beneficial effect when it comes to outreach because Latino voters are disproportionately young and digitally connected.\n\nHowever, the most recent Trump ad focusing on crime and underfunded police departments made an impression on Spanish-speaking voters in South Florida who were part of a focus group conducted by Democrats, according to a source familiar with them.\n\n\"We've got some problem areas we need to fix, especially down in Miami,\" said one Democrat familiar with the Biden campaign's research that shows him lagging Clinton's 2016 totals in Florida's biggest county, Miami-Dade, which also has the largest proportion of Hispanic voters.\n\nThe campaign's Latino outreach will extend to other battlegrounds, where a Latino Decisions poll released Friday shows problems for Trump, Barreto said.\n\n\"Beyond Arizona and Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania have large and growing Latino populations that could ultimately decide a very close election,\" he said. \"Our research in these two states suggest over 70% of Latinos oppose Trump's divisive rhetoric and see Biden as fighting for Latinos.\"",
    " Title: U.S. and China Agree on Framework for Trade Talks, Tariffs on Hold\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced on Sunday that the U.S. will hold off on imposing tariffs on Chinese goods as both nations attempt to finalize agreements on trade. The Trump administration had previously threatened tariffs ranging from $50 billion to $150 billion in response to China's alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property and forced technology transfers.\n\nDuring high-level talks on Thursday and Friday, the U.S. and China agreed on a framework for reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China and addressing technology trade irritants. Mnuchin stated that the two sides have agreed to put tariffs on hold while they work towards executing the framework.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit with China totaled a record $375 billion in 2017, and the Trump administration had asked China to commit to reducing it by $200 billion by 2020. A joint U.S.-China statement released Saturday stated that China will significantly increase purchases of U.S. goods and services, but did not specify the amount or timeline.\n\nMnuchin expects major purchases this year, particularly in agriculture and energy products. He stated that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will be visiting China to discuss hard commitments in agriculture, where the U.S. expects to see a significant increase in agricultural exports this year alone. In energy, Mnuchin anticipates doubling the energy purchases, with potential annual energy purchases totaling $50-$60 billion over the next three to five years.\n\nMnuchin declined to confirm whether China had agreed to a specific commitment to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with the country by $200 billion. He stated that the specific targets are not publicly disclosed and go industry by industry.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly stated that China has taken advantage of trade deals, and on the campaign trail, he said tariffs would be necessary in some cases to show that the U.S. is not playing games anymore. Economist Steve Moore, who is close to the Trump administration, stated that the teeter-totter nature of the China talks is quintessential Trump, offering that the latest turn is part of his negotiating tactics.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, one of the driving forces behind the intellectual property theft investigation that led Trump to threaten tariffs on $50 billion to $150 billion worth of Chinese goods, stated that the two sides have agreed on a framework to address the issues raised in that probe. Lighthizer also downplayed the importance of China reducing trade barriers and increasing purchases of U.S. goods compared to ending practices that threaten the United States' ability to maintain its technological edge.\n\nThe tech industry welcomes the trade war cease-fire as a good step that will shield consumers from higher costs, but China still needs to make changes to level the playing field for American firms. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated that it is up to Trump's team not to \"blow it\" with China. Schumer also expressed concern about the potential leniency shown towards the Chinese technology company ZTE, which faces stiff penalties for violating U.S. sanctions against North Korea and Iran. Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, stated that ZTE would not get off \"scot-free.\"\n\nOverall, the U.S. and China have agreed to a framework for trade talks, with tariffs on hold while both nations work towards executing the framework. The specifics of the agreement, including the amount of increased purchases China will make and the timeline for these purchases, remain to be seen.",
    " Title: \"Clash Looms Between Trump Administration and Democratic Mayors Over 'Sanctuary City' Immigration Policies\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the presidential election, Democratic mayors in cities across the United States, including Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, and Chicago, among others, have reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining their'sanctuary' status, setting the stage for a potential confrontation with President-elect Donald Trump's administration over immigration enforcement.\n\nMayors and police chiefs in these cities have vowed not to cooperate with the Trump administration on deportation orders for undocumented immigrants. This stance puts them at odds with Trump's immigration enforcement push, prompting him to threaten to withhold federal funding from these so-called'sanctuary cities' as he promised during his campaign.\n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, for instance, declared during a press conference, \"Chicago will always be a sanctuary city.\" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has gone as far as stating he would destroy a database of undocumented immigrants with city identification cards before handing it over to the Trump administration.\n\nIn'sanctuary cities', local law enforcement officials are not required to contact U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement about the immigration status of individuals they encounter. This can mean that they do not notify the federal authorities when an undocumented immigrant is about to be released from custody.\n\nCritics of sanctuary cities argue that these policies harbor criminals and endanger public welfare. However, proponents of sanctuary cities argue that these policies help build trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement, making it more likely for crime victims and witnesses to cooperate with investigators.\n\nThe Trump administration's stance on immigration has sparked debate and concern among city officials and immigrant rights advocates. It remains to be seen how the administration will proceed in enforcing its immigration policies in'sanctuary cities' and whether Congress will support Trump's plan to withhold federal funding from these cities.",
    " Title: Political Divide on Trump's Crisis Management and Biden's Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe political landscape is currently divided over President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis and the sexual assault allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nOn one side, critics argue that Trump's approach to the pandemic has been inconsistent, with his initial downplaying of the severity of the virus and subsequent promotion of unproven remedies. The president's handling of the crisis has been particularly criticized for the delays in testing and resource mobilization, which some experts deem as the worst intelligence failure in U.S. history.\n\nIn contrast, supporters of Trump argue that his approval ratings, which range from 45% to 50%, should be higher given the national crisis. They point to President George W. Bush's approval rating soaring above 80% after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks as a benchmark for a leader's approval during a national crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, the left is urging Biden supporters to take Tara Reade's sexual assault allegations against Biden seriously. The former vice president has been a vocal advocate for women's rights, particularly during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, where he stood up for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. However, the allegations against Biden are yet to gain significant traction in the political discourse.\n\nBiden's approach to the coronavirus crisis has been marked by a focus on listening to experts, telling the truth about their findings, and committing to the hard, granular work required to address the pandemic. He has also expressed support for additional stimulus measures, including student loan forgiveness, boosting Social Security benefits, and delivering additional checks to households.\n\nAs the election approaches, the political divide over Trump's handling of the crisis and the serious allegations against Biden will likely continue to shape the narrative. It is a time when the country is looking for strong, decisive leadership to navigate these unprecedented challenges.",
    " Title: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie Joins Republican Contenders in Supporting 20-Week Abortion Ban\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, has announced his support for a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, aligning him with other prospective Republican nominees.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Mr. Christie expressed his backing for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill that prohibits elective abortions from the 20th week of pregnancy, based on the fetus's ability to feel pain. The bill, also known as the 20-week abortion ban, was previously shelved by House Republican leaders this year due to a revolt from female lawmakers.\n\n\"One proposal that brings Americans together is the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would protect unborn children beginning at 20 weeks, or five months of pregnancy,\" Mr. Christie said in his statement. \"America is one of just seven countries that permit elective abortions past this point. We can do far better than this. I urge Congress to take swift action on this important issue.\"\n\nJoining Mr. Christie in supporting the 20-week abortion ban are several other likely Republican presidential candidates, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, ex-Texas Governor Rick Perry, ex-Florida Governor Jeb Bush, ex-Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List, commented on the Republican unity around the push for the 20-week abortion ban.\n\n\"There is complete unity on the Republican side around this push,\" Ms. Dannenfelser said in a statement. \"Meanwhile, the national Democratic Party and its leaders remind us almost daily of the abortion lobby's importance in their policy and politics.\"\n\nMs. Dannenfelser further expects this clear difference to be a significant focus of the general election debate.",
    " Title: White House Press Corps Skeptical of Obama's Sequester Spending Cuts Messaging\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, the White House press corps, traditionally a group that aligns with the administration, has shown signs of skepticism towards President Obama's apocalyptic predictions of the economic and personal consequences of the sequester spending cuts.\n\nOver the past week, President Obama has issued a series of dire warnings about the potential impact of the so-called sequester spending cuts, scheduled to take effect on March 1. However, reporters are increasingly questioning the motivation behind the President's messaging, with some suggesting that the White House may be orchestrating the showcasing of potential cuts to boost public anxiety and pressure congressional Republicans to compromise.\n\nThis skepticism reached a peak on Friday when outgoing Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced that the Transportation Department was planning on furloughing air-traffic controllers across the country, a move that could result in delays of up to 90 minutes at U.S. airports. When asked about less disruptive cuts, Mr. LaHood faced sharp questioning from ABC News' Jonathan Karl, who inquired, \"You've got a big budget. Can\u2019t you find some other way to cut that without telling air traffic controllers to stay home?\"\n\nMr. LaHood insisted that agency officials were diligently searching for the right places to cut, even as he highlighted the potential political pressure the sequester could create for Republican lawmakers. \"Republicans need to step up here... This is not rocket science,\" he stated.\n\nIn recent days, President Obama has held public events to highlight the potential impact of the sequester on emergency first-responders and the Pentagon has warned of 800,000 civilian layoffs. The President is set to visit a shipbuilding yard in Newport News, Virginia on Tuesday to underscore more potential job losses and their impact on the local economy of the defense-heavy region.",
    " Title: Ten Dead, 10 Injured in Deadliest Texas High School Shooting Since Parkland\n\nArticle:\n\nA tragic incident unfolded at Santa Fe High School in Texas on Friday, leaving ten people dead and 10 others injured after a student opened fire. The attacker, identified as Dimitrios Pagourtzis, a 17-year-old pupil at the school, was arrested and charged with murder.\n\nAccording to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, various kinds of explosive devices were found at the school, located 40 miles (65km) south of Houston. These included a CO2 device and a Molotov cocktail, he said.\n\nThe attacker allegedly used a shotgun and a revolver taken from his father, who legally owned the weapons. Police found information on the suspect's diary, computer, and mobile phone suggesting that he planned the attack and intended to kill himself afterwards.\n\nHowever, Governor Abbott stated that the teenager \"gave himself up\" because \"he did not have the courage to commit the suicide.\"\n\nSanta Fe Police Chief Jeff Powell advised residents to be aware of any suspicious objects they find. \"Do not touch any items that look out of place,\" he said.\n\nSanta Fe school police officer John Barnes is among the injured. He was in a critical condition and undergoing surgery, local media reported.\n\nThe shooting in Santa Fe occurred on the same day as a shooting outside a high school graduation ceremony in Atlanta, where one woman died and another was injured.\n\nSo far this year, more than 5,000 people have died in shooting incidents in the United States, according to monitoring group the Gun Violence Archive.\n\nStudents reported that the shooter entered an art class and opened fire shortly before 08:00 (13:00 GMT). One witness told KTRK-TV, \"There was someone that walked in with a shotgun and started shooting,\" while another student told local network KHOU-11 that a teacher who realized what was happening activated a fire alarm to evacuate the building.\n\nThe school had 1,400 students at the time of the attack, according to Lt Gov Dan Patrick. Hundreds of people gathered at sunset on Friday on a large open lawn near the school for a vigil to remember the dead.\n\nPresident Donald Trump described the attack as \"absolutely horrific\" and ordered flags to be flown at half-mast at the White House and all public and military buildings. He also reiterated his call to arm teachers with guns during a speech in Dallas to the National Rifle Association two weeks ago.\n\nGovernor Abbott called the shooting \"one of the most heinous attacks that we've ever seen in the history of Texas schools.\" He also stated that, unlike several previous mass shootings, authorities had not been alerted to Mr. Pagourtzis before the attack on Friday.\n\nAuthorities said journals kept by Mr. Pagourtzis, 17, showed that he planned to carry out the attack and intended to kill himself afterwards. This incident marks the deadliest school shooting since a student opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people.\n\nThe Texas attack is the latest in a series of school shootings that have occurred in the United States this year. The worst school shooting in US history occurred at Virginia Tech university in Virginia, where 33 people were killed and 25 injured by Seung-Hui Cho, who committed suicide after the attack.",
    " Title: The Controversial Legacy of David Koch: A Man of Philanthropy and Political Influence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of billionaire David Koch's death this week, his legacy has been met with a mix of tributes and criticism, particularly regarding his stance on climate change. As the world grappled with record-breaking heat, wildfires, and melting ice caps, Koch's resistance to action on climate change during his career has come under scrutiny.\n\nKoch Industries, one of the country's most polluting companies, is said to have donated approximately $127 million to 92 groups that opposed climate change solutions over a 20-year period, according to Greenpeace. In 2009, Koch Industries played a significant role in the defeat of Representative Bob Inglis, a South Carolina Republican who proposed a carbon tax bill.\n\nDavid Koch's political influence extended beyond climate change, with his philanthropic efforts reaching various sectors, including arts, education, and healthcare. Despite his significant political contributions, Koch's net worth, estimated at around $50 billion, allowed him to make substantial charitable donations, surpassing $1 billion to causes such as the Smithsonian, Lincoln Center, and cancer research.\n\nHowever, Koch's philanthropy and political activities often coexisted in a complex manner. While he supported same-sex marriage and abortion rights, he also advocated for criminal justice and prison reform. His contributions to the arts, including the restoration of the fountains and plaza outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the renovation of the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, will continue to be debated.\n\nAs the investigation into Koch's political activities unfolds, the focus will be on the context and circumstances surrounding his actions. While an explicit quid pro quo may not be evident, the potential for implicit deals cannot be ruled out. The extent to which Koch's legacy will influence future policy remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Retired St. Louis Police Captain David Dorn Killed During Violent Protests\n\nIn the early hours of Tuesday, June 2, 2020, retired St. Louis Police Captain David Dorn was shot and killed while attempting to protect a friend's pawn shop during a night of violent protests in St. Louis.\n\nDavid Dorn's last moments were captured on video and were reportedly posted on Facebook Live, although the video has since been removed. His body was found on the sidewalk outside Lee's Pawn & Jewelry, a business that had been ransacked after peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd turned violent. No arrests have been made in connection with Dorn's death.\n\nThe violent night in St. Louis saw four police officers being shot, officers being pelted with rocks and fireworks, and 55 businesses being burglarized or damaged, including a convenience store that was set on fire. Police also shot and gravely injured a burglary suspect who they say shot at officers.\n\nCities across the United States have seen protests and violence since George Floyd, a black man, died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes, even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air.\n\nDavid Dorn was a friend of the pawn shop's owner and frequently checked on the business when the alarms went off, according to his wife, St. Louis Police Sergeant Ann Marie Dorn.\n\nDavid Dorn served 38 years on the St. Louis police force before retiring in October 2007. He then became the chief of Moline Acres, a small town in St. Louis County.\n\nFormer St. Louis County Police Chief Tim Fitch knew Dorn for 30 years and said they became close friends while leading youth programs for law enforcement careers. Fitch described Dorn as being \"very dedicated to youth, especially disadvantaged youth.\"\n\nDavid Dorn's personality was described as \"bigger than life\" by Fitch, who said Dorn was a \"fun guy, a happy guy.\" Fitch also noted that Dorn was straightforward and would not hesitate to speak his mind, especially when it came to addressing stupid actions such as crime.\n\nWhen Dorn became chief in Moline Acres, he made it clear that his officers would be held to the strictest of standards.\n\nThe Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in St. Louis, described Dorn as \"the type of brother that would've given his life to save them if he had to.\" St. Louis Police Chief John Hayden called Dorn a \"fine captain.\"\n\n\"Many of us, the other officers, looked up to him,\" Hayden said. \"He was very well-liked, very pleasant. And his wife still works here. So a very sad time for our agency. We will honor him.\"",
    " Title: U.S. States Pursue Comprehensive Reforms to Address Systemic Racism and Police Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of significant legislative moves, several U.S. states are taking steps to address systemic racism and police reform, going beyond traditional policing reforms to tackle the deeply rooted issue of racial bias in various sectors of public life.\n\nCalifornia, for instance, has seen a flurry of legislative activity, with bills that have long been stalled making their way through the Legislature. Last week, the state Assembly overwhelmingly approved a bill that would allow voters to decide whether to overturn the state's 1996 ban on affirmative action in government and public colleges and universities.\n\nMoreover, the state Senate passed a bill to make ethnic studies a graduation requirement in the California State University system, a move that could help foster a more diverse and inclusive education environment.\n\nIn California, state Assemblywoman Shirley Weber, chairwoman of the Legislative Black Caucus, is driving a proposal to study how California could offer reparations for slavery. The bill, which has received renewed attention, would establish an eight-member task force to study the effects of slavery and its \"legacy of structural discrimination.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in New Hampshire, a Democratic lawmaker's attempt to introduce a bill examining racial bias and discrimination in the state's corrections, judicial, and police systems was met with resistance. In Pennsylvania, Democratic lawmakers are trying to capitalize on the moment to address racial bias in the judicial system, while in Massachusetts, a Democratic lawmaker wants to overhaul state education spending to funnel more money to schools with high numbers of minority students.\n\nIn Ohio, separate resolutions are being proposed to declare racism a public health crisis, a move that could potentially lead to increased spending to address the effects of racism in education, housing, criminal justice, and healthcare. The Ohio Legislative Black Caucus believes this resolution could serve as a means of re-educating the public about the pervasive nature of racism.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Democratic lawmakers have fused a police reform and racial justice agenda with a pandemic recovery platform, aiming to shape how the state is spending federal coronavirus aid. In Massachusetts, state Rep. Russell Holmes has prioritized finding an extra $1 billion over the next few years for struggling school systems, particularly those in urban areas with high minority populations.\n\nThe Ohio House of Representatives has yet to act on the resolution declaring racism a public health crisis, with House Speaker Larry Householder, a Republican, agreeing that racism is a public health crisis but stating that more needs to be done.\n\nThese efforts underscore a nationwide push to address systemic racism and police reform, with lawmakers recognizing that meaningful change requires a comprehensive approach that extends beyond the realm of law enforcement.",
    " Title: Majority of Republicans Call for Cruz and Kasich to Exit Presidential Race, According to New Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll conducted by CNN/ORC indicates that a majority of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents believe Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich should withdraw from the presidential race, as neither candidate can mathematically secure a majority of GOP delegates through the primary and caucus process alone.\n\nThe poll, released on Monday, found that 52% of respondents think Sen. Cruz should drop out, while 63% believe Gov. Kasich should exit the race. The questions were posed following statements that neither candidate can win a majority of delegates through the primary and caucus process at this point, but could potentially win the nomination if no candidate reaches a majority.\n\nBoth Cruz and Kasich have argued that no candidate will win the 1,237 majority of delegates before the GOP convention in July, although Republican front-runner Donald Trump still has a viable path to that threshold. The latest delegate tally shows Trump with 996 delegates, Cruz with 565, and Kasich with 153, according to The Associated Press.\n\nIn terms of delegates, Kasich is also still behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who left the race a month and a half ago. A separate poll released this week found that 58% of GOP voters in Ohio think the governor should end his White House run.\n\nThe poll also revealed that a greater percentage of Republicans believe the party will still be divided in November, compared to March. Forty-nine percent of respondents said the party will still be divided in November, 41% said the party is divided now but will be united, and 7% said the party is currently united. In March, 46% said they thought the GOP would be divided in November, 45% said they thought the party is divided but will be united for the general election, and 8% said they thought the party was already united.",
    " Title: Florida Presidential Race Tightens: Marco Rubio Slightly Ahead of Jeb Bush in New Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, a new poll suggests that Marco Rubio has a slight, statistically insignificant lead over his main rival, Jeb Bush, in their shared home state of Florida. The poll, conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research, surveyed 400 registered Republican voters and found Rubio garnering 31 percent support, essentially tying Bush's 30 percent.\n\nThe poll, conducted Tuesday through Thursday and shared exclusively with POLITICO, indicates that Rubio's splashy presidential campaign announcement and subsequent media blitz have helped him gain ground in Florida. The other likely and announced presidential candidates polled in the single digits, and 17 percent were undecided.\n\nWhile Rubio's slight edge is statistically insignificant due to the margin of error, the poll offers insight into the shifting dynamics of the Florida primary race. One of Rubio's primary concerns before entering the presidential race was securing enough donors and supporters to secure his home state, a state that he shares with establishment heavyweight Jeb Bush.\n\nIn his presidential bid announcement earlier this week, Rubio addressed the skepticism surrounding his decision to run for president, stating, \"I've heard some suggest that I should step aside and wait my turn. But I can not. Because I believe our very identity as an exceptional nation is at stake, and I can make a difference as president.\"\n\nThe poll suggests that Rubio's compelling message and fundraising abilities may have helped him secure support in Florida, potentially challenging the assumption that Bush is unbeatable in the state. This development could indicate that the Florida primary race is more competitive than previously thought, with both Rubio and Bush vying for the support of Republican voters in the Sunshine State.",
    " Title: Analysis Reveals Bias in The Interpreter Blog and Newsletter of The New York Times Towards Right-Wing Politics\n\nThe Interpreter, a blog and newsletter at The New York Times, is more likely to report on far-right politicians and movements around the world than far-left ones, according to an analysis. The blog, which explores the ideas and context behind major world events, is penned by Max Fisher and Amanda Taub, who are alumni of the left-leaning explainer site Vox.\n\nThe analysis, conducted by \u2588\u2588\u2588, examined more than 50 stories that mentioned the political \"right\" or \"left\" around the globe written by Fisher and Taub for the blog, which began in 2016. The emphasis on coverage of the political right in comparison to the left was stark. The articles made 136 mentions of the \"far right\" but just one mention of the \"far left,\" and 60 mentions of \"right-wing\" politicians or movements, but just 10 mentions of \"left-wing\" politicians or movements.\n\nThirty-two of their stories overall mentioned the \"far right\" and 31 mentioned \"right-wing\" movements or politicians, while one story mentioned the \"far left\" and seven mentioned \"left-wing\" movements or politicians. In a lengthy article headlined \"How YouTube Radicalized Brazil,\" which appeared on Tuesday's front page, Fisher and Taub used the phrases \"far right\" and \"right-wing\" 15 times. It described President Jair Bolsonaro as a \"star in YouTube's far-right community\" before becoming president last year.\n\nA piece by Taub headlined \"Why Democracy Feels Like a Dangerous Game\" on Dec. 1, 2017, mentioned the \"far right\" 12 times alone. The analysis, however, noted that the blog is not always consistent in its political labeling. For instance, a report on corruption scandals embroiling former left-wing presidents Dilma Rousseff of Brazil and Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner of Argentina did not provide a label for either of them, while this 2017 Interpreter story mentioned Rousseff's \"left-wing party.\"\n\nFurthermore, stories about Venezuela omitted the \"far left\" label to describe the failed socialist government there under Nicolas Maduro. A 2017 article on the rise of authoritarianism referred to Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chavez as championing \"leftist populism.\" Another Interpreter story later that year mentioned the government's socialist bent but also omitted any \"left\" label.\n\nA May 14, 2017, piece specifically analyzing Venezuela's economic collapse did not use the word \"socialism\" or \"socialist\" once. It did report on the \"leftist\" Chavez's rise to power, increased nationalization of the economy, and cronyism that eventually crippled the nation.\n\nThe New York Times overall is far more likely to use the labels \"far-right\" and \"right-wing\" than \"far-left\" and \"left-wing\" in its reporting, a search shows. A search of the Times archives showed far fewer stories involving the terms \"far-left\" (5,259) and \"left-wing\" (40,972) than \"far right\" (11,868) and \"right-wing\" (51,168). The same also goes for the terms \"hard left\" (1,332) versus \"hard right\" (3,389) and \"extreme left\" (5,829) versus \"extreme right\" (6,902). The terms \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" can often be employed in nonpolitical contexts, so they were omitted.",
    " Title: Congress Faces Potential Shutdown, but Political Motivations Suggest Avoidance of Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nThe federal government is facing a potential shutdown next week, but recent political maneuvers and historical precedents suggest that a shutdown may be avoided. The government has been shut down before in 1995 and 1996, and the political fallout from those events may give Congress pause before embarking on another shutdown.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told CNN that he is not interested in shutting down the government and taking the blame for it. Many Republicans fear they will be blamed for a shutdown, just months before a big congressional election year. A CNN/ORC poll in mid-September showed 51% of people would hold Republicans in Congress responsible for a shutdown versus 40% for President Barack Obama.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) might already be in this camp. He initially proposed a spending bill that would have avoided a standoff, but conservatives forced him to go to war with a different version fully defunding Obamacare. Boehner's opening move was an important signal that he wants to sidestep a shutdown.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Arizona) also expressed concern about the political fallout from a shutdown, stating that he has seen this movie before and knows what happened the last time they tried this.\n\nCongress runs on political currency, and multiple House GOP aides tell CNN that the majority of Republicans in their conference fear a shutdown would cost them with voters.\n\nRepublicans are divided over how far to take the Obamacare battle right now. And GOP leaders are also preparing a second Obamacare fight during the upcoming debt ceiling debate. So, they have the option of dropping the anti-Obamacare push from the shutdown debate now and instead including it in the debt ceiling fight coming up.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats are eager to get past the shutdown debate so they can move on to the debt ceiling and start to deal with yet another fight: budget cuts slated to hit in January at the latest.\n\nThe government does not necessarily have to shut down at the end of the day on September 30. If lawmakers are close to a deal, the president can order agencies to keep running for a few hours or perhaps even a day or two for Congress to pass the legislation.\n\nAll this said, the swirling, unpredictable dynamics in Congress at the moment and Republicans' gut-level objections to Obamacare make it unclear what will happen in the coming days. If a deal is not reached, a shutdown could still occur. But the political motivations of both parties suggest that a shutdown may be avoided.",
    " Title: Media Panel Discusses Calls for Investigation into Biden's Alleged Misconduct: Partisanship and Hypocrisy in Political Coverage\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a segment of NBC's Meet the Press, political analysts discussed the calls for an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden regarding an allegation of rape. The panel, consisting of Cook Political Report's Amy Walter and NBC Capitol Hill correspondent Kasie Hunt, expressed skepticism about the demand for such an investigation, with Hunt claiming there was no \"huge appetite\" for it.\n\nDuring the discussion, NBC political director Chuck Todd read a portion of a column written by The New York Times editorial board, expressing dissatisfaction with Biden's denials made on MSNBC's Morning Joe late last week. The Times suggested that any investigation should be limited to information about the accuser, conducted by an unbiased, apolitical panel put together by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to foster trust in its findings.\n\nTodd questioned the extent of the Democratic Party's willingness to follow The New York Times' recommendations, to which Hunt responded by criticizing the focus on the handling of Brett Kavanaugh's allegations and the media's coverage of him during his confirmation hearings. She argued that Republicans were focusing on Kavanaugh and the media's handling of the situation, while ignoring Donald Trump's numerous accusers.\n\nHunt also pointed out the discrepancy in the media's coverage of sexual misconduct allegations, stating that the list of accusers against Trump is long, while the allegations against Biden are limited to one. She suggested that voters would be able to make their own decisions about the candidates' conduct.\n\nThe panel's discussion sparked accusations of hypocrisy, with Todd lamenting that every social media debate devolved into what he referred to as \"some sort of whataboutism\" between Clinton, Trump, and Biden. Walter agreed, stating that the suggestion of the DNC putting together an unbiased panel to investigate Biden was stretching it.\n\nWalter also pointed out the partisanship that drove much of the media's coverage and the hypocrisy in the way sexual misconduct allegations were handled, depending on the political affiliation of the accused. She noted that the 2016 email controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton was still a fresh memory for many Democrats, and the Biden campaign was reportedly trying to avoid a similar situation.\n\nThe panel's discussion highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the handling of sexual misconduct allegations in politics and the media's role in covering such stories. The discussion also underscores the partisan divide that exists in the United States, with each side criticizing the other for their handling of allegations against their respective candidates.",
    " Title: Kerry's Offhand Remark Sparks International Response: Syria Chemical Weapons Proposal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, a seemingly offhand suggestion by Secretary of State John Kerry that Syria could avert an American attack by relinquishing its chemical weapons has received a positive response from Syria, Russia, the United Nations, key American allies, and even some Republicans. This proposal, initially perceived as a diplomatic gaffe, has sparked a flurry of activity and discussions among world leaders.\n\nDuring a news conference in London on Monday, Kerry suggested that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad could avoid a U.S.-led strike by turning over all his chemical weapons to the international community within a week. However, the State Department quickly clarified Kerry's remarks, stating that they were \"rhetorical\" and not an official offer.\n\nThe proposal has been met with enthusiasm by Syria, Russia, and the United Nations, with Syria expressing its willingness to at least make a show of turning its chemical weapons over to the international community. The White House has stated that they are taking a \"hard look\" at the idea, and a White House official said that the administration might very well seize this opportunity to extricate President Obama from his self-inflicted \"red line\" trap.\n\nThe Senate began debate over an authorization of force resolution on Monday, with the resolution losing steam on Capitol Hill. With widespread public opposition to a Syria intervention and political realities as a backdrop, the administration might very well embrace this proposal to avoid a major international military showdown.\n\nThe White House Press Secretary, Jay Carney, stated that Congress should still vote to authorize a military strike on Syria, claiming that the only reason this proposal is on the table is because of the threat of military action. However, the administration's stance on the matter seems to be evolving rapidly, with President Obama set to attend a Senate GOP lunch on Tuesday.\n\nThe rapid development of this situation has left many questioning the administration's intentions and strategy. NBC's Chuck Todd reports that White House insiders are growing anxious over the president's precarious position at home, with Syria's chemical weapons issue threatening to undercut Obama's standing with the public and erode his political capital on other matters.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the administration will proceed, but one thing is certain: the chemical weapons proposal has opened up a potential escape route for the president, and the world watches with bated breath to see how this story will unfold.",
    " Title: Obama Adopts Aggressive Strategy in Second Presidential Debate, Challenges Romney's Claims\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a marked departure from his first debate performance, President Barack Obama adopted a more assertive approach during the second presidential debate on Tuesday, challenging Mitt Romney's claims and fact-checking him throughout the 90-minute confrontation. The debate, held in a town-hall format, covered a range of foreign and domestic issues.\n\nThe president, who frequently responded with \"not true\" to refute Romney's claims, was more aggressive than in the first debate, a strategy he has employed effectively on the campaign trail. This approach was aimed at countering the drop in his poll numbers following the Oct. 3 debate.\n\nIn one of the more notable exchanges, Obama and Romney disputed over Romney's claim that oil and gas leases and permits on federal lands and waters decreased by half during Obama's term. While Romney's statement was somewhat exaggerated, according to Bureau of Land Management figures, the number of new leases fell by roughly 42 percent in Obama's first three years in office compared to the last three years of the George W. Bush administration.\n\nObama, however, did not acknowledge any decrease in leases, instead explaining his policy of taking away leases for companies that were not using them and then putting them out again elsewhere.\n\nThe president also denied accusations of dropping the ball on comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nRomney, in turn, countered Obama's assertions, challenging the president on facts and engaging in a series of exchanges with both Obama and moderator Candy Crowley. The candidates frequently interrupted each other, leading to a more heated debate than the first round.\n\nThe debate also revisited familiar ground on taxes and the budget, with both candidates reiterating their respective positions. Romney proposed lowering tax rates across the board while ensuring the top 5 percent do not pay less than they currently do. Obama, in response, claimed Romney's tax cut plan would either \"blow up\" the deficit or lead to a middle-class tax hike to balance the books.\n\nBoth candidates were criticized for their demeanor during the debate, with Romney drawing flak for his interruptions and Obama for his laughter and interruptions, particularly during the vice presidential debate last week.\n\nThe final presidential debate will take place on Oct. 22 in Boca Raton, Florida, with a focus on foreign policy. The candidates are currently campaigning in key swing states, with Obama in Iowa and Ohio, and Romney in Virginia. The race now becomes a battle for the message going into the final debate and the election.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Rules Against Compulsory Union Dues for Public Sector Employees\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 5-4 decision on Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled that public sector unions no longer have the constitutional right to collect compulsory dues from employees who choose not to join the union. The ruling, in the case of Janus v. AFSCME, means that employees will now have to give their consent before any money from their paychecks goes to support a public-sector union. This ruling does not apply to unions at private companies.\n\nMark Janus, a child support specialist at the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, was a non-member of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union, yet he was still required to pay \"fair share\" dues to the union. Janus, who is not anti-union, objected to being forced to pay for a union he was not a part of. He argued that being forced to pay dues to a politically active union in return for employment violated his First Amendment rights.\n\nFederal law prevents unions from requiring employees to join a union as a condition of their employment. However, unions argue that since their collective bargaining benefits all employees, all employees should be required to pay into the union. These \"fair share\" fees or \"agency fees\" are supposed to go strictly to collective bargaining and contract negotiation, and not political activism. Unions say that these fees also help pay for representation if a worker is being mistreated by an employer.\n\nUnions argue that removing these fees or making them voluntary would substantially weaken their ability to perform even basic functions. However, Janus argued that having to donate any money to a politically active union violates his rights.\n\nWriting the opinion of the court, Justice Samuel Alito said that the justices had concluded that the act of taking union dues from employees who chose not to join a union \"violates the free speech rights of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern.\"\n\nThe vote took place largely along ideological lines, with Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is often considered to be the swing vote, siding with the more conservative justices. Alito delivered the opinion of the court, joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch. Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer dissented.",
    " Title: Gallup Poll Reveals Significant Drop in Uninsured Rate Among U.S. Adults\n\nArticle:\n\nAccording to a recent Gallup poll, nearly nine out of ten Americans now have health insurance, marking a substantial improvement from two years ago when the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was implemented. The uninsured rate among U.S. adults has declined to 11.9% in the first quarter, a decrease of one percentage point from the end of last year and a significant improvement from the 18% without insurance in the fall of 2013.\n\nThis is the lowest percentage of Americans without coverage since Gallup began tracking the figure in 2008. In 2008, the uninsured rate was just under 15%, a figure that remained in the range of 15% to 18% before it began to decline sharply two years ago. The law requiring most Americans to have coverage or face a penalty took effect at the start of 2014.\n\nThe report suggests that an improving economy and a falling unemployment rate may have contributed to the steep drop in the percentage of uninsured over the past year. However, the uninsured rate is significantly lower than it was in early 2008, before the depths of the economic recession, indicating that the recent decline is due to more than just an improving economy.\n\nThose making less than $36,000 a year have seen the most significant rate of improvement. Though 22% of this income group still do not have coverage, that's down from 30.7% at the end of 2013.\n\nAdults aged 26 to 34 have also seen the most improvement of any age group, but more than 20% still lack coverage. About 98% of those age 65 and older have coverage, a figure that remains unchanged from two years ago, as almost all of them qualify for Medicare.\n\nFurthermore, far more minority adults are without coverage, as about 13% of blacks and 30% of Hispanics do not have coverage. However, they have seen greater improvement in their rates of coverage than have whites.",
    " Title: FDA Voluntary Guidelines on Antibiotic Use in Farm Animals Fall Short of Addressing Antibiotic Resistance Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has been met with skepticism and concern, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued voluntary guidelines aimed at curbing the misuse of antibiotics in farm animals. However, critics argue that these guidelines are not strong enough to address the growing crisis of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, or \"superbugs,\" in the United States.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported in October that superbugs cause at least two million infections and 23,000 deaths in the U.S. annually, with the cost to the healthcare system estimated at $17 billion to $26 billion. The FDA's new guidelines, which ask industry not to use antibiotics for growth promotion but permit use for routine disease prevention with a veterinary prescription, have been criticized for leaving a loophole for continued use of antibiotics for growth promotion and for providing a disincentive to improve sanitary conditions in livestock facilities.\n\nThe FDA's guidelines come after decades of scientific studies confirming the link between antibiotic misuse in food animals and superbug infections in humans. In 1977, the FDA found that feeding antibiotics to food animals at low doses, both to promote growth and to prevent disease, contributes to this public health crisis. The CDC concurred, stating that much of antibiotic use in animals is unnecessary and inappropriate and makes everyone less safe.\n\nThe FDA's guidelines have been criticized for not going far enough in addressing the issue. The guidelines allow for the continued use of antibiotics for disease prevention, a practice that exposes bacteria to low doses of antibiotics, allowing resistant germs to thrive and reproduce. This practice has been linked to the spread of superbugs in communities and the contamination of meat during slaughter, as well as the contamination of fruits and vegetables fertilized with animal waste.\n\nThe FDA's guidelines have also been criticized for not addressing the issue of growth promotion, a practice that has been linked to the development of superbugs. The FDA's guidelines ask industry not to use antibiotics for growth promotion but permit the use of antibiotics for disease prevention with a veterinary prescription. This leaves a loophole for continued use of antibiotics for growth promotion by simply calling it another name.\n\nThe FDA's guidelines have also been criticized for not providing a strong enough incentive for the industry to clean up their facilities. The agency argues that veterinarians will ensure responsible use, but most livestock and poultry are overseen by veterinarians employed by companies that have spent years fighting regulation.\n\nWith millions of infections and thousands of deaths linked to antibiotic resistance, it is clear that more needs to be done to address this crisis. The World Health Organization has warned that antibiotic resistance could mean \"an end to modern medicine as we know it.\" It is time for Congress to take meaningful action to regulate the use of antibiotics in farm animals and step up to the plate to protect public health.",
    " Title: Trump Demotes Campaign Manager as Biden Maintains Lead in Polls\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shakeup, President Donald Trump announced the demotion of his longtime campaign manager, Brad Parscale, on Wednesday. The move is aimed at bolstering Trump's re-election bid, as he currently trails Democratic candidate Joe Biden in opinion polls.\n\nTrump, in a Facebook post, announced that Bill Stepien, the deputy campaign manager, would replace Parscale. This change comes less than four months before the November 3 vote.\n\nThe latest polls indicate that Biden is ahead of Trump nationally by an average of 8.6% as of Thursday night, according to RealClearPolitics. This lead is a significant shift from the close race that was predicted just five months ago.\n\nMany political analysts agree that Biden is a stronger opponent than Hillary Clinton was in 2016. In 2016, more voters trusted Trump, with just 37% of those polled by Quinnipiac saying they believed Clinton to be more honest. Today, Biden leads Trump by 15 points on the question of whether voters believe the candidates to be honest.\n\nThe dislike for Clinton in 2016 played a significant role in Trump's victory. However, Biden, unlike Clinton, does not seem to inspire the same level of antipathy. Polls consistently show that Trump's supporters are more excited to vote for him than Biden's supporters are to vote for the Democratic nominee.\n\nWhile Biden voters may not be overly enthusiastic about voting for him, they are very enthusiastic about voting against Trump. This gives Biden a strong edge, as Trump supporters do not despise Biden to the same extent they despised Clinton in 2016.\n\nA poll conducted by Nationscape in June showed that registered voters with negative opinions of both Trump and Biden preferred Biden to Trump by a whopping 23-point margin. This group also rated Biden less negatively overall, with only 33% of this group saying they had a very unfavorable opinion of Biden compared to 62% who said the same of Trump.\n\nThese results, combined with recent political science research on the power of negative partisanship, suggest that the public's stronger dislike of Trump is probably the more consequential enthusiasm gap in 2020. The upcoming months will reveal whether this trend continues or if Trump can regain his incumbency advantage with a potential economic rebound.",
    " Title: \"Federal Aid and State Budgets: A Look Beyond Ideological Bias\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the U.S. Congress deliberates on further coronavirus aid, a contentious issue has arisen regarding the potential use of federal funds to address pre-pandemic budgetary problems in some states. In a tweet in late April, President Donald Trump questioned the fairness of bailing out states, particularly those traditionally Democratic, such as Illinois, when many other states are not seeking aid.\n\nHowever, Christopher Mooney, a professor of state politics at the University of Illinois at Chicago, argues that such aid should not be labeled as \"blue state bailouts.\"\n\nThe COVID-19 response has created a genuine fiscal emergency, Mooney explains. Furthermore, data from the Rockefeller Institute of Government in New York shows that Democratic states such as New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Connecticut pay more to the federal government than they receive annually. Conversely, states like Alabama and Mississippi, often Republican strongholds, receive more than they contribute.\n\nThese imbalances are largely due to demographics. America's progressive tax system means that residents in wealthy states, often heavily urban and Democratic-controlled, pay higher federal taxes than those in other states. Urban-oriented states usually have high demands for public services, leading to relatively high spending by state and local governments, according to Professor Mooney.\n\nIn essence, ideology may guide, but demographics are in the driver's seat, Mooney suggests. As for the management of states, Mooney states that this is almost always a matter of opinion.\n\n\"When you start throwing out words like 'well run' or 'poorly run,' unless you have very specific criteria in mind... it's subjective by definition,\" he says.\n\nSources: U.S. Federal Reserve, Rockefeller Institute of Government, Ballotpedia, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (Jacob Turcotte and Noah Robertson/Staff)",
    " Title: Challengers to Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton's Presidency: A Closer Look at the Underdogs\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape, the \"common wisdom\" suggests that the 2016 presidential race will be a contest between former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. However, this assumption has sparked questions among some, as other candidates, such as Rand Paul, Martin O'Malley, and Joe Biden, have entered the race, challenging the perceived inevitability of a Bush-Clinton matchup.\n\nWhile Jeb and Hillary share similar strengths and weaknesses, their potential challengers focus on the unique strengths of their candidates. The established figures, with their extensive networks, financial resources, and national experience, are seen as formidable contenders. Yet, their critics see opportunities for the underdogs to prove the \"common wisdom\" wrong.\n\nBoth Jeb and Hillary entered the race with significant financial advantages over their potential intra-party opponents, enjoyed the support of their party's establishment, and were favorably portrayed by the media. They were expected to secure the nomination early, with Jeb's supporters anticipating a \"shock and awe\" fundraising blitz that would leave competitors breathless, and Democrats looking forward to a coronation rather than a nomination fight.\n\nHowever, both candidates also carry substantial baggage. Many grassroots Republican and Democratic voters yearn for fresh faces and new ideas, and the prospect of another Bush-Clinton election is seen as outdated by some on the right and left. The idea of a dynastic family claiming the party nomination and the presidency is not appealing to either party, and both Jeb and Hillary are often perceived as believing in an inherent right to their party's nomination and the presidency.\n\nBoth have also faced subtle but noticeable snubs from their parties' previous nominees. Hillary Clinton, despite serving loyally as President Obama's Secretary of State, has faced less than laudatory references from Obama and his inner circle. It has been reported that Obama confidant Valerie Jarrett may have been the first to leak news of Mrs. Clinton's private email accounts to the media. Jeb Bush's fundraisers faced resistance when they pressured 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney's backers as part of their \"shock and awe\" offensive, with Romney hinting that he might run himself, causing a monkey wrench in the works.\n\nHillary Clinton, who may be more \"progressive\" than some on the left, has struggled to maintain her image as an establishment, slightly left-of-center Democratic moderate. Her attempts to emulate the populism of the new Democratic base have been met with skepticism, and her efforts to appeal to the left may prove fatal to her presidential aspirations.\n\nJeb Bush, on the other hand, has faced criticism for emphasizing issues that are seen as suspect by the current GOP base. His responses have been as ham-handed as Hillary's among Democrats, with Bush stating his intention to ignore the protestations of GOP conservatives while seeking their votes.\n\nThe \"common wisdom\" may often be correct, but it remains to be seen whether Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton will live up to the expectations set by the current narrative.",
    " Title: Navigating Political Conversations During Holiday Gatherings: A Guide for Unified Family Dinners\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the holiday season approaches, families across the nation are preparing for the annual gathering of loved ones, food, and, often, heated political discussions. In an effort to help families navigate these potentially contentious conversations, NPR has reached out to its listeners for their best and worst experiences discussing politics over turkey.\n\nOne listener, Aaron Harmon, shared a story of a Thanksgiving dinner where his father-in-law, a devout Mormon, insisted that he, an atheist, say grace. This led to a heated debate about religion and politics, causing a rift between family members.\n\nStephanie Brown recounted a similar experience, where a seemingly innocent conversation about missing church turned into a political debate that escalated into personal attacks. However, the incident led to a family conversation about unresolved anger and the realization that the fight was not about the 2012 election results but rather unresolved issues that had been festering for years.\n\nJeremy Brown shared a story of a Thanksgiving dinner gone awry when a family member made racist remarks and used derogatory language. The incident left Jeremy feeling humiliated and led to a permanent rift within the family.\n\nTo avoid such incidents, some families have implemented creative solutions. Sally Carleton shared that her family uses a \"duck quacker\" to interrupt political or religious discussions, while Brad Heil's mother sets ground rules for dinner talk, requiring respect for other opinions or risking exile to the back porch.\n\nNPR's Sarah McCammon suggests focusing on shared interests such as food, children, and sports to steer the conversation away from politics. Danielle Kurtzleben recommends serving controversial dishes to spark conversation and create a distraction from political debates.\n\nLuke Aldridge reminds us that love and humility are essential in any conversation, and that condescending remarks and generalizations only serve to widen the divide.\n\nIn conclusion, while political discussions can be a source of tension during family gatherings, there are ways to navigate these conversations and maintain a sense of unity. Informed discussions, shared interests, and a little creativity can help families enjoy a peaceful and enjoyable holiday season. And, as a shameless plug, NPR Politics and its new podcast can help keep you informed and prepared for any political discussions that may arise.",
    " Title: Rare Defeat: Liz Cheney's Exit from Wyoming Republican Senate Primary Marks Rare Incumbent Loss in GOP History\n\nArticle:\n\nLiz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has officially ended her challenge to veteran Sen. Mike Enzi in the Wyoming Republican Senate primary, citing family illness as the primary reason for her decision. However, the state's Republican history was not on her side, as it is uncommon for the party to oust their incumbent U.S. senators.\n\nSince World War II, only approximately 11 Republican senators have lost their party primaries, while Democratic senators have been defeated by their own party more than three times that number. The majority of these defeated incumbents were southern Democrats who lost in primaries that were effectively elections, or Democrats who did not align with the increasingly left-leaning party activists.\n\nThe small fraternity of defeated Republican senators includes Wisconsin's Sen. Robert La Follette Jr., who lost renomination in 1946 to a young Marine Corps veteran named Joe McCarthy. McCarthy ran as an internationalist and backer of the United Nations, criticizing La Follette's isolationist record. He also campaigned hard in black precincts as a fighter for civil rights.\n\nIn 1968, California's swashbuckling Superintendent of Public Instruction Max Rafferty defeated Senate GOP Whip and moderate Tom Kuchel. Rafferty, who went on to lose against Democrat Alan Cranston, ran as a conservative in contrast with a more moderate incumbent. New York's Alfonse D'Amato beat veteran GOP Sen. Jacob Javits in New York's primary in 1980 and won in November, two years after conservative activist Jeff Bell defeated moderate Sen. Clifford Case in New Jersey. Bell, however, lost in November.\n\nIn 2010, constitutional lawyer and stalwart conservative Mike Lee won a convention battle over three-term Republican Sen. Bob Bennett of Utah and serves in the Senate today. That same year, conservative Joe Miller ousted the more moderate Sen. Lisa Murkowski in Alaska's Republican primary, but she came back to be re-elected as a write-in candidate.\n\nFor all the D'Amatos and Lees, there are several more examples of conservatives who could not make a strong enough case to unseat an incumbent senator. In Connecticut, Prescott Bush Jr., brother of then-Vice President George Bush, quit a 1982 challenge to Sen. Lowell P. Weicker, an outspoken liberal Republican. Two years later, conservative Rep. Tom Corcoran badly lost in the Illinois Republican primary to moderate Sen. Charles Percy. In 2010, former Rep. J.D. Hayworth could not make a case to Arizona Republicans that Sen. John McCain was not conservative enough. McCain won handily.\n\nMost state and national Republican leaders are expected to breathe a sigh of relief at the news about the Wyoming race. As revered a figure as former Vice President Dick Cheney is in Wyoming, most of his fellow GOP activists ignored his daughter and sided with three-termer Enzi. They saw no difference between the two conservatives on any issue other than Liz Cheney wanted to be a senator. Liz Cheney clearly had problems going into the race, notably the fact that she had lived in Northern Virginia most of her life before becoming a candidate. She obviously has personal reasons for ending her candidacy Monday. But she also had history against her.",
    " Title: Analysis of Hillary Clinton's Potential 2016 Presidential Run: A Neutral Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton, a prominent figure in American politics, is often speculated to run for president in 2016. However, her potential candidacy is met with mixed reactions from both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nClinton, with her extensive political resume, is seen as a plausible candidate by many pundits and the general public. She is well-versed in policy matters and is known for her ability to discuss these topics eloquently. As a woman, she is expected to appeal to female voters, although her candidacy may also divide opinion among women and men alike.\n\nClinton has carried the baggage of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and will need to navigate the political landscape carefully to avoid being associated with his controversial decisions. She has also been involved in some of President Barack Obama's decisions, which she will need to distance herself from to avoid sharing the blame for any negative outcomes.\n\nHowever, Clinton's political career is not without its drawbacks. Critics point to her stiff public speaking style, her perceived tone-deafness, and her mediocre campaigning abilities. Her ambition, while a driving force in her political career, is often criticized for lacking the \"fire in the belly\" that characterizes successful politicians.\n\nSome question whether Clinton, at 67, is ready for the grueling campaign trail, with its long hours, uncomfortable travel, and constant interaction with the public. The memory of her 2008 campaign, when she had no significant record to defend, and the media's perceived leniency, is still fresh in the minds of many. In 2016, Clinton will face sharper questions and increased scrutiny, which she will need to navigate carefully.\n\nWesley Pruden, editor emeritus of The \u2588\u2588\u2588, raises the question of Clinton's true desire to run for president, given the demanding nature of the role and the luxurious lifestyle she could maintain without seeking office. The potential financial loss from foregoing speaking engagements and foundation donations is another factor to consider.\n\nIn conclusion, while Hillary Clinton's political career and name recognition make her a plausible candidate, her potential 2016 presidential run is met with a mix of enthusiasm and skepticism. The media's increased scrutiny, her past political baggage, and her perceived lack of charisma are significant challenges she will need to overcome to secure the Democratic nomination and, ultimately, the presidency.",
    " Title: Uncertain Future for 4 Million Unauthorized Immigrants as Deferred Action Program Hangs in Legal Limbo\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a federal judge's decision in Texas to suspend President Obama's deferred action program for unauthorized immigrants, around 4 million individuals find themselves in a state of legal uncertainty more than two weeks later. Many of these parents of U.S. citizens and green-card holders are expressing concern over potential forced deportation.\n\nOne such individual is Wilfredis Ayala, a construction worker from El Salvador, who has been living in the U.S. illegally for over a decade. Ayala, 30, crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally by car and has been evading deportation orders since then. Currently residing on Long Island, N.Y., Ayala shares a life with his 5-year-old U.S.-born son, Justin.\n\nAyala was arrested last January for trespassing on private property while taking a shortcut through his neighborhood. This incident brought him to the attention of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which was preparing to deport him before his lawyer secured his release from detention.\n\n\"I cried tears of joy to be with my son again, to be able to hug him and kiss him and play with him,\" Ayala says in Spanish. \"The whole time I was locked up I longed to be with him.\"\n\nAyala's lawyer, Bryan Johnson, argued that his client was eligible for Obama's deferred action program for parents, which temporarily protected Ayala from deportation until the Texas court ruling put the program on hold. Now, Johnson is unsure about their next steps with immigration officials.\n\n\"I'm going to tell ICE that we're waiting for deferred action, and then from there, we'll see what happens,\" says Johnson, a partner at the immigration law firm Amoachi & Johnson. \"But I mean he's not safe because there is no deferred action to apply for.\"\n\nIn a statement, an ICE spokesman confirmed that the agency is still prioritizing the deportation of criminals and those who recently crossed the border illegally. President Obama emphasized this focus during a recent town hall meeting televised by MSNBC and Telemundo.\n\n\"If you've been here for a long time and if you qualify, generally, then during this period, even with legal uncertainty, they should be in a good place,\" Obama told the audience in Miami.\n\nHowever, some local immigration offices have reportedly been applying the policy inconsistently, detaining parents who would have been left alone before the Texas court ruling. Marty Rosenbluth, who teaches immigration law at Elon University, notes that this inconsistency has created widespread fear among the affected community.\n\n\"It's created a huge amount of fear, and people who were preparing to apply now don't know what to do,\" he says.\n\nRosenbluth adds that this inconsistency could have long-term implications for Obama's deferred action programs if the courts allow them to take effect. The government is still accepting applications for the original deferred action program for young immigrants who came before turning 16 and have lived in the U.S. since 2007.\n\nConvincing people that it's safe may prove challenging even if the temporary injunction is overturned, according to Rosenbluth. The legal battle over the president's deferred action programs is expected to continue for several months, with a judge still reviewing the Obama administration's request for the programs to proceed while the lawsuit continues.\n\nAyala, however, faces a much more immediate concern: he is due back in front of immigration officials next Wednesday. \"The truth is,\" he says in Spanish, \"I don't know what is going to happen that day.\"",
    " Title: New York Attorney General's Office Alleges $1 Billion in Suspicious Transfers by Sackler Family Amidst Ongoing Opioid Crisis Litigation\n\nThe New York Attorney General's Office has reportedly uncovered approximately $1 billion in wire transfers by the Sackler family, the owners of Purdue Pharma, which could suggest an attempt to conceal their wealth amidst ongoing litigation over their role in the opioid crisis.\n\nThe transfers include some that were allegedly routed through Swiss bank accounts, according to a report by The New York Times. State Attorney General Letitia James (D) reportedly issued subpoenas last month to 33 financial institutions and investment advisers in an effort to fully uncover the family's wealth.\n\nIn a statement to The Times, James said, \"While the Sacklers continue to lowball victims and skirt a responsible settlement, we refuse to allow the family to misuse the courts in an effort to shield their financial misconduct.\" Records from one financial institution alone have shown approximately $1 billion in wire transfers between the Sacklers, entities they control, and different financial institutions, including those that have funneled funds into Swiss bank accounts.\n\nCourt documents filed by James's office on Friday reportedly show initial findings from one unnamed financial institution. The filing reportedly shows a series of transfers by former Purdue board member Mortimer D.A. Sackler.\n\n\"Already, these records have allowed the state to identify previously unknown shell companies that one of the Sackler defendants used to shift Purdue money through accounts around the world and then conceal it in at least two separate multimillion-dollar real estate investments back here in New York, sanitized [until now] of any readily detectable connections to the Sackler family,\" wrote lawyer David E. Nachman from James's office in a letter to the court, according to The Times.\n\nPurdue Pharma declined to comment, while a spokesperson for Mortimer D.A. Sackler dismissed allegations surrounding the wire transfers. \"There is nothing newsworthy about these decade-old transfers, which were perfectly legal and appropriate in every respect. This is a cynical attempt by a hostile AG's office to generate defamatory headlines to try to torpedo a mutually beneficial settlement that is supported by so many other states and would result in billions of dollars going to communities and individuals across the country that need help,\" the spokesperson told \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nThe revelations come as Purdue Pharma has reached a multibillion-dollar tentative settlement with state and local governments over its alleged role in the opioid crisis.",
    " Title: North Carolina Emerges as Evenly Divided Presidential Battleground Ahead of November Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2016 presidential election approaches, North Carolina, a state known for its political contradictions, is proving to be one of the most evenly divided battlegrounds in the country. The state, which has historically elected figures like Jesse Helms, a racial hard-liner, and Terry Sanford and Jim Hunt, New South Democrats, is experiencing a significant shift in its demographics, making it difficult to predict its tilt in November.\n\nThe two largest population centers, Charlotte and the Research Triangle of Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill, have undergone a transformation due to an influx of political centrists from other states. The fastest-growing party registration preference is not Republican nor Democrat, but unaffiliated. The rural white \"Jessecrats,\" conservative Democrats who traditionally voted for figures like Jesse Helms, are dwindling, and elections are now won in fast-growing edge towns like Cary, a nickname for which locals joke as Containment Area for Relocated Yankees.\n\nNeither Donald Trump, with his hard-edged nationalism, nor Hillary Clinton, with a swirl of scandal surrounding her, seems to be a natural fit for a state that yearns for political moderation but is increasingly disillusioned with the political class. Carter Wrenn, a veteran Republican strategist in the state, stated, \"They don't like either party and they don't like either candidate. It will just depend on which one they dislike less on Election Day.\"\n\nPolls show that Trump and Clinton begin the general election close in North Carolina. The most telling sign of a toss-up: Democrats believe Trump starts with a narrow advantage, while Republicans believe Clinton does. What they agree on is that, as at the national level, Republicans are largely coalescing around Trump, and ruling out the possibility that Clinton could run away with the state.\n\nHowever, Trump needs North Carolina more than Clinton does. With his difficulties among Hispanic voters pushing typical swing states such as Colorado, Nevada, and Florida toward the Democrats, Trump will likely need to carry the combined 28 electoral votes from North Carolina and Virginia to capture the White House.",
    " Title: Tight Races and Surprises Expected as Voters Head to the Polls in Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Election Day approaches, a familiar refrain is likely to echo across the nation: \"Too close to call.\" With a surprising number of congressional and gubernatorial candidates locked in tight races, the outcome of several key contests remains uncertain.\n\nThe battle for the Senate hinges on a referendum on President Obama's final two years in office, with the result potentially decided in approximately 10 toss-up or battleground races. However, a few other races could yet surprise when the ballots are in. At the state level, nearly a dozen governors are at risk of losing their seats, a volatile landscape not seen in decades.\n\nTurnout is crucial for both parties, especially Democrats, who are battling historical midterm headwinds that typically punish the party holding the White House. Polling consistently shows GOP voters are more enthusiastic about this year's elections, suggesting an edge in turnout, but Democrats point to a ground game they claim will help them prevail in close races.\n\nIn the Senate, three races are more or less locked down for the GOP: Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia. However, Republicans remain in competitive races in a number of other states, including those that President Obama lost in 2012 and where he continues to have low approval ratings. This includes Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, and North Carolina. Arkansas is increasingly seen as a likely flip to Republican hands, with GOP Rep. Tom Cotton expected by many analysts to defeat Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor.\n\nIn the states Obama won in 2012, but where Republicans are competing, top contenders are Iowa and Colorado. Republican Scott Brown is also putting up a fight in his race against Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire. Republicans, though, are battling to retain control of three seats: in Georgia, Kansas, and Kentucky.\n\nThere's a possibility America won't even know the outcome on election night. Late-tallied votes from rural Alaska and a likely runoff in Louisiana between Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and Republican challenger Rep. Bill Cassidy - and a possible runoff in the Georgia race - could keep control of the Senate undecided for days, or even until next year.\n\nIn the House, all 435 seats are on the ballot. Of them, 233 are held by Republicans and 199 held by Democrats. Democrats would need 17 seats to take the majority, an unlikely possibility. Rather, Republicans are expected to pick up at least five more seats. Among the most compelling races are ones in Arizona and New York.\n\nIn Arizona, Republican Martha McSally, the first female Air Force pilot to fly in combat, is trying to take a House seat from Democrats. And in New York, 30-year-old Republican Elise Stefanik would be the youngest female House member if she wins Tuesday. McSally is running in one of the few remaining moderate districts, for the seat once held by Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who retired from Congress in 2012 after being shot in the head during a mass shooting. McSally again faces Democratic Rep. Ron Barber, the former Giffords staffer who narrowly defeated McSally in 2012. The nonpartisan RealClearPolitics.com lists the race as a tossup.\n\nIn New York, Stefanik, a former Bush White House aide, has positioned herself as a first-time candidate eager to bring \"new ideas\" and \"new leadership\" to the upstate 21st District. She faces Democratic nominee and film producer Aaron Woolf and third-party candidate Matt Funiciello for the open seat of retiring Democratic Rep. Bill Owens.\n\nGubernatorial seats in 36 states are on the ballot, and nearly a dozen U.S. governors are considered in political peril on Election Day, making it one of the toughest years for incumbent governors in decades. One survey, by Governing magazine, puts the number of toss-up races at 18 when including eight \"competitive\" races. The incumbents in Governing's 10 tossup races are a mix of seven Republicans and three Democrats and include such high-profile state leaders as Florida GOP Gov. Rick Scott, Wisconsin GOP Gov. Scott Walker, and Illinois Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn.",
    " Title: Trump's Travel Ban: A Closer Look at the Six Countries and Its Effectiveness\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the recent terrorist attack in London, President Donald Trump took to Twitter, advocating for a more vigilant and secure approach to national security. He called for the Supreme Court to lift the preliminary injunction against his travel ban, stating that the ban would serve as an \"extra level of safety.\" However, the focus of the travel ban, as outlined in the executive order, raises questions about its effectiveness, given that no one in the United States has died in a terrorist attack by a citizen of the six countries covered by the ban since 1975.\n\nThe executive order, which covers six countries (originally seven in the original version), includes Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Since 1975, six Iranians, six Sudanese, two Somalis, and one Yemeni have been convicted of attempting or carrying out terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, according to a count by Cato Institute immigration analyst Alex Nowrasteh. However, the order only mentions one case, involving a Somali refugee who was later naturalized as a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit noted that the order \"does not include any examples of individuals from Iran, Libya, Sudan, Syria, or Yemen committing terrorism-related offenses in the United States.\" Yet, there are at least 13 such cases involving people from Iran, Sudan, and Yemen, according to Nowrasteh.\n\nCitizens of other countries account for a much larger share of terrorist plots, attacks, and casualties in the United States. From 1975 through 2015, 19 foreign-born terrorists came from Saudi Arabia, 14 from Pakistan, 11 from Egypt, and 11 more from Cuba. Their combined death toll was 2,537. During the same period, six foreign-born terrorists came from Iran, six from Sudan, two from Somalia, and one from Yemen. Zero came from Libya or Syria. The combined death toll for terrorists from those six countries was zero.\n\nThe effectiveness of the travel ban in catching potential terrorists is also questionable. As an internal Department of Homeland Security report prepared last March notes, most foreign-born, U.S.-based violent extremists likely radicalized several years after their entry to the United States, limiting the ability of screening and vetting officials to prevent their entry because of national security concerns. In the one relevant case cited by Trump's executive order, better vetting would have made no difference, since the offender entered the country as a child.\n\nA declaration by 10 former national security, foreign policy, and intelligence officials (mostly from Democratic administrations) stated that \"there is no national security purpose for a total bar on entry for aliens\" from the seven countries named in the original travel ban (the current six plus Iraq). \"Since September 11, 2001,\" they said, \"not a single terrorist attack in the United States has been perpetrated by aliens from the countries named in the Order.\"\n\nIn a follow-up tweet this morning, Trump stated, \"The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.\" This statement is peculiar, as it was Trump, not the Justice Department, who ultimately decided to issue a revised executive order rather than continue to defend the original version. Trump further complicated the situation in a subsequent tweet, stating, \"The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court\u2014 & seek much tougher version!\" Reverting to the original order after successfully defending the revised one would only prolong the legal battle.\n\nIn conclusion, while Trump's travel ban may be tough and politically incorrect, its effectiveness in ensuring national security is questionable, given the backgrounds of terrorists who have carried out attacks in the United States and the limited number of cases involving the six countries covered by the ban.",
    " Title: New Poll Shows Republicans Narrowing Democratic Lead on Generic Congressional Ballot, Trump's Approval Rating Equal to Disapproval\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent poll conducted by \u2588\u2588\u2588/Morning Consult, the Republican party has narrowed the Democratic advantage on the generic congressional ballot for the first time since April. The poll, which was conducted from February 8-12, surveyed 1,985 registered voters with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nAccording to the poll, 39 percent of voters would support the GOP candidate for Congress in their district, while 38 percent would back the Democratic candidate. Nearly a quarter of voters, 23 percent, are undecided.\n\nThe poll shows that voters are split almost evenly along party lines. Democratic voters break for their party, 85 percent to 5 percent, while Republicans similarly favor the GOP, 84 percent to 8 percent. Among independent voters, 26 percent would vote for the Democrat, 25 percent for the Republican, and nearly half, 49 percent, are undecided.\n\nThe GOP's 1-point advantage comes after three months of tracking in which Democrats maintained a lead ranging between 2 and 10 points on the generic ballot. The most recent RealClearPolitics average shows Democrats ahead by 7 points on the generic ballot, though that's down from a high of 13 points late last year.\n\nThe new year has also produced a Trump polling bump. In the new poll, 47 percent of voters approve of the job President Donald Trump is doing as president, while the same percentage disapprove. Among Democrats, 16 percent approve of Trump's job performance and 80 percent disapprove. The numbers are almost exactly inverted among Republicans: 82 percent approve, while 16 percent disapprove. Trump is still underwater among independents: 39 percent approve and 49 percent disapprove.\n\nLike with the generic ballot, other public polling is less rosy for Trump \u2014 but there is a distinct improvement over the past two months. The president's average approval rating as of late Tuesday was 41 percent, up from a low-water mark of 37 percent in mid-December.\n\nThe poll also shows that voters' perceptions of Republicans have recovered from the lows of late last year, including on a number of key issues. \"Not only have Republicans increased support on the generic congressional ballot, they are now trusted more to handle the most important issue when voters head to the polls: the economy,\" said Kyle Dropp, Morning Consult's co-founder and chief research officer. \"In mid-December, 39 percent of voters said they trusted Democrats more to handle the economy, compared to 38 percent who said Republicans. Today, 43 percent say Republicans and 32 percent say Democrats.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans also have a 9-point advantage on handling jobs, a 6-point lead on dealing with immigration, and a 19-point lead on handling national security. The Democratic advantage on health care has dwindled to just 4 percentage points, down from double digits last year.\n\nThe poll also suggests that House Democrats' strategy of tying GOP candidates to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) may not be as effective as they hoped. While House Democrats have pledged to yoke GOP candidates to Ryan, the poll suggests that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will be a more effective foil for Republicans than Ryan will be for Democrats.\n\nVoters are split on their perceptions of Ryan: 36 percent view him favorably, and 40 percent have an unfavorable opinion. But Pelosi's numbers are more negative: Only 28 percent of voters have a favorable impression of her, while nearly half, 49 percent, view her unfavorably.",
    " Title: Republican Senators Struggle to Distance Themselves from Trump Amidst Widening Polling Gaps\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Donald Trump's controversial statements and actions, several House Republicans have expressed their inability to support the presidential nominee. The latest to join the list is Representative Mike Coffman of Colorado, who declared in a commercial that he doesn't care much for Trump and vowed to stand up to him if elected.\n\nKristen Soltis Anderson, a Republican pollster, notes that differentiating congressional candidates from the nominee may not be challenging, especially in states like Ohio, where voters can distinguish between Trump and Rob Portman, who is locked in a tight race.\n\nSenators like Mark Kirk of Illinois have flatly declared they won't vote for Trump. Others, such as Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, are trying to navigate a delicate balance, supporting Trump but not endorsing him. Ayotte has stated she'll be absent if Trump visits her state, a move prompted by Trump's recent criticism of her as \"weak.\"\n\nSenator John McCain of Arizona is facing a right-wing primary challenge this month, and despite Trump's criticism, McCain has remained cautious, reiterating his support for the party nominee.\n\nRecent polls suggest a widening gap between Trump and Hillary Clinton, potentially signaling trouble for down-ballot candidates. A five-point Clinton victory in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania is considered survivable, but anything more, particularly if her margin hits double digits, might mean the end for these candidates.\n\nDemocrats are increasingly optimistic that these wider margins are possible, noting that in this polarized environment, ticket-splitting is less prevalent. They argue that waves, as Gaylord Nelson discovered in 1980, usually break late.",
    " Title: Gruber's Remarks Under Scrutiny: A Closer Look at the Affordable Care Act's Architect's Controversial Statements\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing controversy surrounding the Affordable Care Act (ACA), a fourth video has surfaced featuring economist Jonathan Gruber, one of the architects of the health care reform law, making remarks that have sparked a renewed debate. In the video, Gruber is heard stating that the American public \"doesn't actually care that much about the uninsured\" and that the law's success in passing was due to the public's lack of understanding of the legislation.\n\nThese comments follow a series of other videos in which Gruber has been caught on tape making similar remarks, including stating that the Obama administration relied on an electorate that didn't understand the ACA, and that the law's function was unpalatable to voters. In another video, Gruber admits that the sales pitch for the ACA was a cover-up operation, stating that \"lack of transparency is a huge advantage\" and that the law passed because the American people were \"too stupid to understand the difference.\"\n\nWhile Gruber's comments may seem inflammatory, it is important to examine the context and accuracy of his statements. Gruber did not make these comments in private, but rather in public lectures and speeches, without any attempt at discretion.\n\nThe ACA has been a contentious issue since its inception, and it is true that the law relies on healthy people to pay in so that sick people can receive coverage. However, it is not accurate to suggest that the public was not aware of this fact, as most people understand how insurance works. Furthermore, opponents of the ACA were vocal about this point during the public debate, and the administration spent millions on marketing to convince young, healthy individuals to invest in health insurance.\n\nIt is also important to note that the ACA was passed by a Democratic majority in Congress, without a single Republican vote, and without a public referendum. The law's passage was not a result of the American people's lack of understanding, but rather a political decision made by the majority party.\n\nGruber's comments reflect a sense of arrogance and hubris that is not uncommon in the realm of policy-making. Technocrats, or individuals who believe they can solve complex social problems through technological or policy solutions, often assume they understand the problems they set out to tackle without fully investigating them. This kind of hubris can lead to the creation of flawed policies that may not work as intended or may not be well-received by the public.\n\nAs the ACA continues to be implemented and its effects are felt, it will be important to examine the law's successes and failures and to learn from the experiences of its architects. Gruber's comments may be controversial, but they provide a valuable opportunity to reflect on the role of technocrats in policy-making and the importance of understanding the complexities of the problems they seek to solve.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Budget Deal Averts Government Shutdown, Boosts Military and Domestic Spending\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A hard-won budget and debt deal, which received President Donald Trump's endorsement and bipartisan support, cleared the Senate on Thursday, ensuring the government can resume borrowing to meet its obligations and eliminating the prospect of a government shutdown in October.\n\nThe legislation, which Trump has promised to sign, passed by a 67-28 vote, with Trump and his GOP allies relying on numerous Democratic votes to secure its passage. The measure, which sets an overall $1.37 trillion limit on agency budgets approved by Congress annually, also reverses scheduled 10 percent cuts to defense and non-defense programs next year, at a two-year cost of more than $200 billion.\n\nThe bill was powered by a coalition of GOP defense hawks, Democrats seeking to preserve gains in domestic accounts, and the leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Democrats voted for the bill by a wide margin, and it won a healthy majority of Senate Republicans.\n\nThe measure was an epitaph to the 2011 Budget Control Act, which came about due to a tea party-fueled battle over debt limit legislation during the run-up to President Barack Obama's re-election. That law promised more than $2 trillion in deficit cuts through 2021, including automatic spending cuts that were put in place after the failure of a so-called deficit supercommittee.\n\nThe bill would lift the debt limit for two years, into either a second Trump term or the administration of a Democratic successor. It also adds $100 billion over two years to recent gains for military readiness, combating opioids, and other domestic initiatives, and keeps pace with rising costs for veterans' health care.\n\nThose increases alone, assuming they are repeated year after year, promise to add $2 trillion or more to the government's $22 trillion debt over the coming decade.\n\nThe bill was opposed by more conservative elements of the White House, with Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and Acting Budget Director Russell Vought unsuccessful in attempts to add spending cuts to defray the bill's cost.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who initiated the negotiations and was deeply invested in bringing order and relative predictability to the budget and debt deadlines, hailed the deal as an opportunity to invest in military readiness, research and development, and rock-solid support for U.S. military alliances.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, a longshot candidate for president, accused Republicans of financial hypocrisy, stating, \"Remarkably, they seemed to have forgotten their supposedly principled calls for fiscal discipline now that President Trump is in office.\"\n\nFollow-up legislation will fill in the line-by-line details of agency budgets when the Senate returns in September. Trump is expected to continue seeking billions of dollars for border security and wall construction, but unlike last year, he does not appear eager for a government shutdown over it.",
    " Title: White House and Trump Clash Over Black Progress Under Obama Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange on Thursday, the White House and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump disagreed over the progress made by African-Americans under President Barack Obama. Mr. Trump's assertion that black Americans have \"nothing to lose\" by voting for him has sparked criticism from the White House, which has struggled to provide compelling evidence that life for blacks in America has improved over the past eight years.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest argued that it would be difficult to make the case that black Americans are not better off under the first black president. He pointed to the black unemployment rate, which was 8.4 percent in July, compared to 12.6 percent when Mr. Obama took office in January 2009. However, the jobless rate for whites, now at 4.3 percent, has fallen slightly more than it has for blacks in the past eight years \u2013 down 37 percent for whites and 33 percent for blacks.\n\nOn a range of other government data, blacks are faring worse under Mr. Obama. The black labor force participation rate has fallen from 63.2 percent in 2009 to 61.2 percent last month. Black homeownership last month was 41.7 percent, down from 46.1 percent in 2009 \u2013 a drop of nearly one-tenth. The percentage of black Americans living below the poverty line has risen from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 26.2 percent in 2014, according to the most recent Census Bureau data. The number of black food-stamp participants increased 58 percent, from 7.3 million to 11.7 million.\n\nConfronted with such statistics, the White House argued that it is important to elect Hillary Clinton as president so she can build on Mr. Obama's legacy. \"The president's never made the case that the work is finished, that the job is done,\" Mr. Earnest said. \"The point is, President Obama's interested in being succeeded in office by someone who is committed to building on the progress we've made thus far as opposed to tearing it down.\"\n\nBlack leaders have criticized Mr. Trump's claim that he will improve conditions for black Americans. Ben Jealous, former president of the NAACP, said, \"Donald Trump is dancing around on race and immigration, because his racism and xenophobia is threatening to trump the GOP's chances to hold on to the Senate let alone take back the White House.\" He added, \"This election will prove to be a referendum. If a wave of racist, xenophobic and unlikely voters turn out, then Ann Coulter and Breitbart win the argument. But if the election goes the way we predict it will and Trump is defeated, then the whole country will be affirmed that we are moving forward, together.\"\n\nAlthough there is little evidence that Mr. Trump's plea to black voters is changing minds, dissatisfaction among blacks with the lack of progress under Mr. Obama has been no secret. Broadcaster Tavis Smiley said earlier this year, \"Sadly \u2013 and it pains me to say this \u2013 over the last decade, black folk, in the era of Obama, have lost ground in every major economic category.\" The Urban League's National Equality Index has found blacks losing ground, from 57.4 percent equality with whites in 2009 to 56.2 percent this year. This year's rating represented a slight improvement from 55.8 percent in 2015.\n\nThe White House is arguing that, with Mr. Obama having lowered jobless rates dramatically for whites and blacks, Mrs. Clinton has better proposals than Mr. Trump to benefit all workers. \"The kinds of proposals that have been put forward by the other side would have the effect of eroding our progress, primarily because they would have a devastating impact fiscally and economically doling out significant tax cuts to those at the top of the income scale and leaving the rest of us to pay the tab,\" Mr. Earnest said. \"The president believes that's a strategy we have tried and it has not worked. To go back to that strategy now would make the situation worse for everybody in America, including African-Americans.\"\n\nMrs. Clinton moved more aggressively Thursday, using a campaign ad and a speech, to link Mr. Trump to white supremacists such as former KKK figure David Duke. She said Mr. Trump is \"helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party.\" Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton is trying to appeal to black voters with \"race baiting.\" \"But they know she is all talk and no action!\" he said on Twitter.",
    " Title: President Trump Delivers Remarks at National Prayer Breakfast Amidst Impeachment Aftermath\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a victory lap following his Senate acquittal, President Donald Trump criticized supporters of the impeachment drive during his speech at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday.\n\n\"As everyone knows, my family, our great country, and your president have been put through a terrible ordeal by some very dishonest and corrupt people,\" Trump said, a day after the Republican-led Senate acquitted him of impeachment charges in a largely partisan vote.\n\nTrump, who held copies of \"ACQUITTED\" from The Washington Times and \"Trump Acquitted\" from The Washington Post, told religious leaders that impeachment supporters \"know what they are doing is wrong, but they put themselves far ahead of our great country.\"\n\n\"Weeks ago and again yesterday, courageous Republican politicians and leaders had the wisdom, fortitude, and strength to do what everyone knows was right,\" he continued. \"So many people have been hurt, and we can\u2019t let that go on.\"\n\nSigns of the political tensions generated by impeachment dominated the prayer breakfast, an annual event designed to bring together people of different parties and religious faiths. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who led the impeachment drive, was present on the dais. Trump and Pelosi did not interact personally during the event, but Trump said he does not like people \"who say 'I pray for you,' when they know that is not so.\"\n\nAfter the event, Pelosi said it was \"completely inappropriate\" for Trump to criticize people for looking to their faith as a basis for their decisions \u2013 \"especially at a prayer breakfast.\" Several speakers cited political polarization and prayed for the nation to get past it.\n\nTrump recited a list of things he has done for his religious supporters, from support of school prayer to international efforts to prevent the persecution of Christians. The National Prayer Breakfast is a Washington tradition that stretches back to 1953, when President Dwight Eisenhower established it at the suggestion of evangelist Billy Graham.\n\nTrump spoke less than 17 hours after the Senate finished its impeachment trial by acquitting him of charges that he abused his power by trying to get Ukraine to investigate political opponent Joe Biden. It was a partisan vote, with one exception: Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the GOP's nominee for president in 2012, voted to convict Trump on abuse of power. Citing the evidence, as well as his Mormon faith, Romney called Trump's conduct \"grievously wrong.\"\n\nTrump fired back in a midnight tweet about Romney's loss in 2012, saying that if the candidate had \"devoted the same energy and anger to defeating a faltering Barack Obama as he sanctimoniously does to me, he could have won the election.\" At the prayer breakfast, he said, \"I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong.\"\n\nHistorian Kevin Kruse, a scholar at Princeton University who has studied the National Prayer Breakfast, told The Washington Times, \u201cI can\u2019t say how bizarre it is for a president to use the moment \u2013 traditionally one devoted to bipartisanship and unity \u2013 to strike such a vindictive tone.\" Trump concluded his speech by saying, \"When they impeach you for nothing, then you\u2019re supposed to like them, it\u2019s not easy, folks. I do my best.\"",
    " Title: California Cruise Ship in Quarantine as First COVID-19 Death in State Confirmed\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Grand Princess cruise ship is currently in a state of limbo off the California coast following the confirmation of the state's first known death from COVID-19. The deceased individual, an elderly man, is believed to have contracted the virus during a trip from San Francisco to Mexico in mid-February.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom announced a state of emergency in California on Wednesday to help the state cope with its first COVID-19 death and over 50 confirmed cases overall. Health workers are now testing some current passengers to determine the presence of the respiratory virus.\n\nEleven passengers and 10 crew members were showing symptoms of COVID-19, according to Governor Newsom, with the number potentially understating the virus's presence on the ship. The man who died was on the ship from February 11-21 and had underlying health conditions. He was hospitalized in California's Placer County on February 27.\n\nAnother California resident who was on the same trip has also tested positive for the virus, Governor Newsom said. That individual is currently hospitalized in Sonoma County.\n\nThe Grand Princess, carrying around 2,500 passengers and 1,150 crew members, will be tested using a helicopter to deliver testing kits to the ship on Thursday morning. The onboard medical team will then collect samples, which will be flown back to shore to be analyzed at a lab in Richmond, Calif.\n\nPrincess Cruises has asked passengers to report any symptoms they might have had, such as a fever or a cough, that could indicate they have COVID-19. The company has also canceled the ship's next planned Hawaii cruise, which was to depart on Saturday.\n\nAs of midday Thursday, the Grand Princess was about 100 nautical miles from the coast as it headed toward San Francisco, according to the maritime tracking site Vessel Finder. The cruise ship won't be allowed to dock until the coronavirus testing is complete, officials said.\n\nThe Grand Princess is the second Princess Cruises ship to be identified with a potential cluster of coronavirus cases. Last month, the Diamond Princess was held in quarantine for weeks at the port in Yokohama, Japan.\n\nCalifornia health agencies are currently monitoring at least 9,400 people in 49 counties who were potentially exposed to the coronavirus through air travel, Governor Newsom said. The U.S. now has at least 99 domestic cases of coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday morning. That figure does not include the 49 cases in which Americans were repatriated to the U.S. on evacuation flights from Japan and from Wuhan, China, where the novel coronavirus was first detected.",
    " Title: Record-Breaking Gun Background Checks in March Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) processed a record 3.7 million gun background checks in March, surpassing any previous reported month, according to the agency's latest data. This surge in gun sales could potentially be linked to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, as the Trump administration this week designated gun shops as \"essential\" businesses, enabling them to continue operating while other retail outlets remain closed.\n\nFive of the top 10 days with the highest number of background checks occurred last month, since the inception of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System in 1998. March was the second-busiest month ever for gun sales, trailing only January 2013, which followed President Obama's re-election and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, as reported by The New York Times.\n\nDavid Yamane, a sociology professor at Wake Forest who has studied gun culture, attributes this increase in gun buying to mass social uncertainty. He noted that the current situation has seen an influx of first-time gun owners and individuals who do not traditionally fit the profile of a typical gun buyer, such as older, white males.\n\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588-Ipsos Coronavirus Index also reported rises in purchases of guns and ammunition, although the sample size was relatively small. In a video tweeted by the National Rifle Association (NRA) on March 21, an activist warned, \"You might be stockpiling up on food right now, but if you aren't preparing to defend your property when everything goes wrong, you're really just stockpiling for somebody else.\"\n\nThis trend of increased gun sales during times of social upheaval and uncertainty has been observed in areas heavily impacted by COVID-19, such as Washington state, California, and New York. The spike in firearm and ammunition purchases is a reflection of the broader societal response to the pandemic, as people seek to protect themselves and their property during these uncertain times.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Decision on Gay Marriage and DOMA Cases Awaited, Potential Impact on Same-sex Couples Nationwide\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to deliver major rulings on two landmark cases concerning gay marriage and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) this week. The decisions have the potential to significantly alter the legal landscape for same-sex couples across the United States.\n\nIn one case, the court is reviewing the constitutionality of California's Proposition 8, a voter-enacted ban on same-sex marriage. The other case involves the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a law that defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman, affecting a range of benefits available to married couples, including tax breaks, survivor benefits, and health insurance for federal employees.\n\nSeveral possible outcomes are anticipated in the Proposition 8 case. One outcome could make bans on gay marriage unconstitutional nationwide, while another could legalize gay marriage only in California and six other states that currently provide legal rights of marriage through civil unions or domestic partnerships. Other scenarios could allow same-sex marriages to resume in California alone, or uphold Prop 8, allowing the ban to remain in place.\n\nDuring oral arguments in March, several justices, including some liberals who seemed open to gay marriage, expressed doubts about the case's validity. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is often considered the potentially decisive vote on a closely divided court, suggested that the court could dismiss the case with no ruling at all. Such an outcome would likely allow gay marriages to resume in California but would have no impact elsewhere.\n\nIn the DOMA case, the justices are considering the constitutionality of the law's provision that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. The law, known as DOMA, affects a range of benefits available to married couples. The Obama administration abandoned its defense of the law in 2011 but continues to enforce it.\n\nThe case of Edith Windsor, an 83-year-old woman from New York, is at the heart of the DOMA case. Windsor sued to challenge a $363,000 federal estate tax bill after her partner of 44 years died in 2009. During a hearing in March, Justice Kennedy expressed concerns that the law intrudes on the power of states that have chosen to recognize same-sex marriages. Other justices described the law as creating two classes of marriage: full marriage and \"skim-milk marriage.\"\n\nIf the Supreme Court finds that it does not have the authority to hear the case, Windsor would likely still receive her refund because she won in the lower courts. However, there would be no definitive decision about the law from the nation's highest court, and it would remain on the books.\n\nIn a separate case, the Supreme Court issued a 5-4 ruling on Tuesday, stripping the government of the requirement in the Voting Rights Act that all or parts of 15 states with a history of discrimination in voting, mainly in the South, get Washington's approval before changing the way they hold elections. The court ruled that the formula determining which states are affected was unconstitutional.\n\nThe ruling potentially opens the door for certain states to proceed with voter ID laws and other efforts that had been held up because of the Voting Rights Act. Prominent among those are voter identification laws in Alabama and Mississippi. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican, said his state's voter ID law, which a panel of federal judges blocked as discriminatory, would likely take effect following Tuesday's ruling.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder warned states against going too far. He said the Justice Department would not hesitate to take \"swift\" action against states looking to \"take advantage\" of the ruling. He, like President Obama, expressed disappointment in the decision, stating that discriminatory practices still exist and need to be addressed.\n\nThe high court is currently in the midst of a broad re-examination of the ongoing necessity of laws and programs aimed at giving racial minorities access to major areas of American life from which they once were excluded. The justices issued a modest ruling on Monday that preserved affirmative action in higher education and will take on cases dealing with anti-discrimination sections of a federal housing law and another affirmative action case from Michigan next term.",
    " Title: An Analysis of Bernie Sanders' Presidential Campaign: A Call for Revolution vs. Practical Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Democratic primary, it is crucial to examine the big-picture reasons behind the skepticism towards Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign. This article aims to present an unbiased analysis of the argument that Sanders' call for a revolution may not be the most effective strategy for progressive change.\n\nBernie Sanders' campaign platform is built upon the premise of a necessary revolution in the United States. The argument is that the rich control the economy, income inequality is escalating, the middle class is stagnating, the finance industry is unchecked, and Washington, D.C., is gridlocked. However, as Bill Scher points out, the revolution that Sanders calls for never materialized, and it is unlikely that it will occur in the current economic climate.\n\nThe author argues that the United States has experienced only two economic revolutions: the destruction of the Southern slave economy following the Civil War and the economic collapse that led to the Great Depression. These events required significant time, bloodshed, and economic turmoil to bring about change. The current economic situation, with low unemployment, relatively high wages, and widespread insurance coverage, does not provide a foundation for a revolution.\n\nThe author contends that Sanders' call for a revolution is unrealistic and may lead to disillusionment among his followers. If a revolution does not occur, these followers may either join the established political system or abandon politics altogether. The author fears that some talented future leaders may be lost due to disappointment and cynicism, which is the last thing the progressive movement needs.\n\nThe author acknowledges that the practical politics advocated by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama may not be as inspiring as Sanders' revolutionary rhetoric. However, the author argues that attainable goals are necessary to prevent disillusionment among followers. By offering a chimera instead, Sanders has done the progressive movement no favors.\n\nIn conclusion, this article presents an unbiased analysis of the argument that Bernie Sanders' call for a revolution may not be the most effective strategy for progressive change. The author contends that the current economic climate does not support a revolution, and that unrealistic promises may lead to disillusionment and cynicism among followers, potentially causing a net increase in political apathy. The author suggests that attainable goals and practical politics are necessary to maintain the interest and commitment of future leaders in the progressive movement.",
    " Title: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Threatens Legal Action Over Whistleblower Complaint Dispute with Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated standoff between the Trump administration and the House Intelligence Committee, Chairman Adam Schiff has vowed to take legal action if necessary to obtain a whistleblower complaint involving a high-ranking individual, most likely President Trump or someone close to him. The dispute centers around a complaint to the intelligence community's inspector general, Michael Atkinson, that the Justice Department has reportedly deemed privileged and withheld from lawmakers.\n\nDuring a closed-door meeting with Atkinson on Thursday, Schiff argued that the law and practice are clear: Congress oversees the intelligence agencies, and in this case, it must see the materials at issue. Schiff stated, \"If any party \u2014 whether it's the Department of Justice or the White House or someone indeed who may be the subject of the complaint \u2014 is able to... deprive Congress of that information simply because they choose to, then the whistleblower statute does not work at all and it chills people from coming forward.\"\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the complaint was filed by an unnamed intelligence official on August 12, and it is believed to involve something Trump said to a foreign leader. Schiff, however, stated that he does not know whether this is accurate.\n\nPresident Trump, in response, denied any wrongdoing and called the report \"Fake News\" in a series of tweets. Trump wrote, \"Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!\"\n\nThe acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, is set to testify in an open session before the panel next week. Schiff stated, \"We will hear more. We will learn more. If that hearing does not answer some of these questions, Schiff said, he will confer with the House's general counsel about legal action.\"\n\nThe committee also released letters it received from the inspector general and a letter from Schiff to acting DNI Maguire. The Post reported that the as-yet-unknown intelligence official filed a formal complaint to the IG on Aug. 12, and records show the president had \"conversations or interactions\" with five foreign leaders in the preceding weeks, including a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and two letters from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nOther members of Congress, such as Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who sits on the Senate intelligence committee, are waiting to learn more about the complaint. Cornyn stated, \"I'm anxious to hear more about it, but I expect we will in due course.\"\n\nThe standoff between Schiff and Trump is the latest political battle between the two, who have skirmished for months during the height of the Russia imbroglio.

    " Title: Mueller's Testimony Leaves Political Landscape Unaltered, According to Key Figures\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Robert Mueller's testimony before Congress did not seem to shift the calculations of Speaker Nancy Pelosi regarding the impeachment of President Donald Trump. The Senate Republicans' unwavering stance on the matter, which would make it difficult to secure a two-thirds vote for conviction in a Senate trial, remains a significant hurdle.\n\nJeff Flake, the former Arizona senator and one of the few prominent Republicans to publicly oppose Trump, commented, \"It will certainly escalate the pressure on the Democrats to initiate impeachment proceedings, but I don't think it changes the fundamentals much. It's still a risky move for 2020, and the speaker is aware of it.\"\n\nAt the White House, Trump watched Mueller's testimony on television from his residence, spending most of the day there. Following the testimony, he met briefly with a few members of his staff and issued claims of vindication via Twitter and a press statement. However, privately, Trump expressed frustration with Mueller, feeling that he had always been out to get him and that more people were not defending him on television, according to sources familiar with his day.\n\nAides within the West Wing reported a dominant feeling of outrage towards Mueller, but they also concluded that the special counsel had not altered the overall dynamics. No new facts emerged, and no smoking gun that had not already been known was presented. Mueller made it clear that he would not go beyond his report even if he were to appear before a congressional committee.\n\nIn a striking contrast to the Watergate era, where Leon Jaworski, the special prosecutor, left no doubt about his conclusions regarding President Richard M. Nixon, Mueller's testimony left many questioning his intentions and the implications of his report.",
    " Title: Senate Judiciary Committee Debates Immigration Overhaul, Boston Bombing Overshadows Discussion on Agricultural Workers' Legal Status\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Monday, lawmakers debated the provisions of the proposed immigration overhaul, with the Boston Marathon bombings casting a long shadow over the proceedings. The central point of contention was the eligibility of agricultural workers for a new \"blue card,\" which would grant them permanent residency after five years.\n\nThe Senate Democrats and Republicans, engaged in the second hearing since the bill's introduction, found themselves at odds over the eligibility of illegal immigrants working on U.S. farms for the blue card. Non-agricultural workers in the United States illegally would have to wait approximately twice as long to achieve the same status.\n\nHowever, the Senate Judiciary Committee debate was once again dominated by the Boston Marathon bombings and the legal status of the two Russian-born suspects. New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer argued that the tragedy should not be used as an \"excuse\" to delay the passage of immigration reform legislation. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the committee, countered, \"I never said that.\"\n\nThe hearing was called to order by Committee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who expressed his disapproval of those exploiting the Boston Marathon bombing to obstruct comprehensive immigration reform. \"Let no one be so cruel as to try to use the heinous acts of two young men last week to derail the dreams and futures of millions of hardworking people,\" Leahy stated.\n\nA bipartisan group of eight senators has been working on immigration reform legislation since January, an effort by both parties to reach out to Hispanics, the fastest-growing part of the U.S. population. The legislation was officially introduced last week, and five Senate hearings on the overall issue have been held so far this year. Chamber leaders expect to start submitting amendments in May with a vote this summer.\n\nThere are an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., and as many as 70% of U.S. agricultural workers are in the country illegally. Roughly 700,000 to 1.1 million illegal agricultural workers would be eligible for the blue card, provided they have at least a two-year work history and pass a criminal background check, pay fines, and taxes.\n\nSupporters argue that the change is necessary due to the high percentage of illegal workers in the industry and the unwillingness of Americans to perform the work. Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, however, argued that the guidelines for the proposal were crafted as part of a deal between big business and organized labor that primarily benefits the United States.\n\nSen. Sessions also took issue with the argument about \"jobs Americans won't do.\" He expressed concern that the agriculture industry is demanding \"these workers\" without considering the potential impact on American workers. Republican Sens. John Cornyn, Texas, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, also raised concerns about the tracking of immigrants who overstay their visas.\n\nGraham reiterated his argument that the 19 hijackers involved in the 9/11 terror attacks were all students who overstayed their visas. The debate on the proposed immigration overhaul continues, with the Boston Marathon bombings serving as a stark reminder of the complexities and sensitivities surrounding the issue.",
    " Title: California Attorney General Charges Undercover Journalists, Ignoring Alleged Fetal Harvesting Confession\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has filed 15 felony charges against undercover journalists David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, the individuals who exposed the practices of Planned Parenthood and its affiliates through undercover investigations. The charges, which allege that the recordings of business-related conversations among strangers held in restaurants and at conferences were in violation of California eavesdropping laws, have sparked controversy and raised questions about the state's prosecutorial power and the media's role in reporting on sensitive issues.\n\nThe controversy stems from a series of videos released by the Center for Medical Progress, one of which features former StemExpress technician Holly O' Donnell describing her experiences at Planned Parenthood Mar Monte's Alameda Clinic in San Jose, California. In the video, O' Donnell describes an incident where she was asked to \"harvest\" a fetus's brain, an act that, if accurate, could be considered murder under California law.\n\nThe California Penal Code defines murder as the \"unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, with malice aforethought.\" The allegations against Planned Parenthood include refusing to render care to a born-alive infant, as required by California law, and acting affirmatively to cause the child's death.\n\nDespite the controversial nature of the allegations, major newspapers, mainstream websites, and nightly news outlets have largely ignored the story. This has led to criticism that these crimes were not the focus of anyone's interest.\n\nBecerra, a Democrat, has been criticized for his ties to Planned Parenthood, having received financial support from the organization and helping to draft legislation to restrict reporting on \"health-care providers\" while he was a senator. His actions have been seen as a partisan abuse of the state's prosecutorial power, with some comparing it to California's Justice Department's investigation of animal cruelty on chicken farms.\n\nThe media's response to the charges against Daleiden and Merritt has also been criticized, with many journalists and media outlets remaining silent on the issue despite their previous emphasis on the importance of a vigorous press. This hypocrisy has been linked to the moral rot that is said to consume the abortion industry, with the Center for Medical Progress's undercover videos revealing discussions of \"crushing\" babies to death and jokes about abortionists requiring \"biceps\" to dismember a baby.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Center for Medical Progress released a new video featuring an undercover conversation between Daleiden and Dr. DeShawn Taylor, former medical director of Planned Parenthood Arizona and the founder of her own abortion clinic in Phoenix. In the video, Taylor discusses abortion procedures in Arizona, including the requirement to transport a fetus with signs of life to a hospital.\n\nThe debate over the ethics of undercover journalism and the role of the media in reporting on sensitive issues continues to rage, with some arguing that the journalists' actions were necessary to expose the truth, while others argue that the tactics used were unethical and potentially illegal. The case also raises questions about the moral and legal boundaries of abortion, and the role of the state in regulating the practice.",
    " Title: Obama Pays Tribute to Fallen Heroes on Memorial Day, Urges Americans to Honor and Support Military Families\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his weekly address on Saturday, U.S. President Barack Obama commemorated Memorial Day by paying tribute to the men and women in uniform who have given their lives in service to the country. The president asked all Americans to honor the nation's fallen heroes and to stand with its veterans and military families this weekend.\n\nIn his address, Obama highlighted the importance of remembering the sacrifices made by these heroes, stating, \"They are heroes, each and every one. They gave America the most precious thing they had -- 'the last full measure of devotion.'\"\n\nThe president emphasized the quiet and unassuming nature of those who serve in the military, stating, \"They don't seek the limelight. They don't serve for our admiration, or even our gratitude. They risk their lives, and many give their lives, for something larger than themselves or any of us: the ideals of liberty and justice that make America a beacon of hope for the world.\"\n\nObama also called for Americans to support military families, stating, \"We must be there for the military families whose loved ones are in harm's way -- for they serve as well.\" He urged Americans to care for the loved ones that our fallen service members have left behind, to ensure all our veterans have the care and benefits they've earned, and to provide jobs and opportunities for them.\n\nThe president concluded his address by stating, \"The young men and women I met at the Naval Academy this week know the meaning of service. They've studied the heroes of our history. They've chosen to follow in their footsteps -- to stand their watch, man a ship, lead a platoon. They are doing their part. And each of us must do ours.\"\n\nObama's full address can be found on the White House website and on YouTube. The president's message serves as a reminder to Americans to honor and remember the sacrifices made by our fallen heroes this Memorial Day weekend.",
    " Title: Global Business Leaders Convene for ARISE Conference in Israel to Counter BDS Movement\n\nArticle:\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel - The second-annual ARISE conference, themed \"Israeli Innovation for Humanity,\" is set to take place in Israel on Dec. 4, bringing together more than 600 business leaders from over 50 countries to connect with and invest in Israeli businesses. The event aims to counter the global Boycotts, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.\n\nThe conference will showcase Israeli companies in various sectors, including medical, agricultural, transportation, and others, whose products contribute significantly to humanity. ARISE Founder and President Adv. Calev Myers stated that the summit offers an opportunity for Christians to engage with Israel's economy and confront the BDS movement.\n\n\"The best way to fight BDS is by bringing more business to Israel,\" Myers told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News. \"Our overarching goal is to connect with hundreds of thousands of evangelical Christian business people out in the nations who see what is happening in the economy of Israel and the Israeli innovation as nothing less than a miracle of biblical proportions and they want to connect their lives, their businesses, and their families to this miracle.\"\n\nARISE facilitates business connections through matchmaking during the conference, setting up hundreds of face-to-face meetings between Christian business leaders and Israeli companies to establish long-term investment relationships. The result is millions of dollars worth of transactions that strengthen Christian businesses and Israel's economy.\n\nMyers emphasized the importance of for-profit engagement with Israel, stating, \"When you connect your business with a for-profit relationship, you're going to be coming to Israel more, you're going to be looking over your investments and your business, you're going to be reading Israeli headlines. It connects you on a deeper level.\"\n\nFor those unable to attend the event in Rishon Lezion, ARISE has created an online digital platform where business owners can upload their profiles and chat with attendees online. The summit will also feature a \"Shark Tank\"-style competition for Israeli companies and businesses to present their best products to the conference attendees. The winning business will receive a $10,000 grant from ARISE.\n\nMyers also announced plans for a global trade center in Jerusalem, set to launch in 2022. \"I can't think of a better way to humiliate BDS than by opening up a fully-functioning global trade center in Jerusalem,\" he said. \"It will be a global trade center whose founding partners are faith-based business networks around the world that want to be part of bringing Israeli innovation to the nations in the most streamlined way possible.\"\n\nMyers encourages Christians worldwide to participate in next week's conference.",
    " Title: An Analysis of President Obama's Foreign Policy: A Shift in Perception and Accountability\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent discussions, Jeremy Shapiro, a former Obama State Department official now at the Brookings Institution, has pointed out a significant shift in President Obama's approach to foreign policy, particularly his willingness to acknowledge the limitations of American power. Shapiro suggests that this shift is an attempt by Obama to realign the public's expectations of what the President can accomplish, given the increasing disparity between the expectations of omnipotence and actual capabilities.\n\nHowever, this shift in approach has not been without criticism. Daniel L. Byman, a former member of the Sept. 11 commission staff now teaching at Georgetown University, has expressed concern that Obama is not differentiating between issues he can influence and those beyond his control. Byman suggests that Obama's response to various global crises, such as the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the vacuum left in Iraq post-2011, and Russia's intervention in Ukraine, lacks distinction and clarity.\n\nThe list of criticisms against President Obama is extensive. According to his detractors, Obama failed to curb the growth of the Islamic State by rejecting proposals to arm moderate elements of the Syrian resistance. He is also criticized for not doing enough to leave a residual force in Iraq after the withdrawal of American troops in 2011, and for signaling weakness to Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, encouraging the Kremlin to intervene in Ukraine without significant consequence.\n\nWilliam C. Inboden, a former national security aide to President George W. Bush and executive director of the William P. Clements Jr. Center on History, Strategy and Statecraft at the University of Texas, offers a more nuanced perspective. Inboden acknowledges that Obama is not solely responsible for the global crises that have occurred during his tenure. However, he does hold Obama accountable for actions and attitudes that have contributed to these crises, and for his responses, or lack thereof.\n\nThis analysis serves to highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of President Obama's foreign policy, and the ongoing debate surrounding its effectiveness. As the world continues to evolve, so too does the role of the United States in global affairs, and the expectations placed upon the President in managing these affairs. This shift in approach, as seen in President Obama's tenure, is a reflection of this evolving landscape, and the challenges that come with it.",
    " Title: EPA Chief Scott Pruitt Resigns Amid Ethics Controversies, Andrew Wheeler to Serve as Acting Administrator\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief Scott Pruitt, who was known for his aggressive efforts to roll back environmental regulations, resigned on Thursday under heavy fire for a series of ethics-related controversies. Pruitt's resignation letter cited unrelenting personal attacks and their impact on his family.\n\nPruitt, one of President Donald Trump's most polarizing Cabinet members, had been instrumental in slashing regulations on the energy and manufacturing industries, including a move to repeal President Barack Obama's signature program to cut carbon emissions from power plants, known as the Clean Power Plan. He also lobbied Trump to withdraw the United States from the global 2015 Paris climate accord to combat global warming.\n\nHowever, Pruitt lost favor with Trump's inner circle after a string of controversies, including first-class travel at taxpayer expense, lavish spending on security, the installation of a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office, and accusations that he used his position to receive favors, such as a discounted rental on a high-end condo from an energy lobbyist's wife.\n\nEPA Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former mining industry lobbyist, will become the regulatory agency's acting chief on Monday. Wheeler is expected to continue Pruitt's efforts to roll back and streamline regulation, a promise Trump made during his presidential campaign.\n\nDemocrats and environmental advocacy groups welcomed Pruitt's departure, with Democratic Representative Gerry Connolly calling him \"unquestionably the worst head of the agency in its 48-year history.\" The Environmental Working Group, a public health and environment watchdog, echoed Connolly's sentiments.\n\nPrior to heading the EPA, Pruitt, as Oklahoma's attorney general, had sued the federal agency more than a dozen times on behalf of his oil-drilling state. Pruitt also rankled some Republican lawmakers, including in Midwest corn-producing states, with his efforts to overhaul a U.S. policy requiring biofuels like corn-based ethanol in gasoline.\n\nRepublican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Trump made the \"right decision.\" Other Republicans, as well as coal and oil industry groups, praised Pruitt for his work in reducing regulatory burdens.\n\nPruitt was facing around a dozen investigations into his tenure, including his frequent use of first-class flights and his spending on security. Travel records showed the U.S. government spent $17,000 in taxpayer money on a December trip to Morocco to promote U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas, which is not part of the EPA's jurisdiction.\n\nIn one of the investigations, the U.S. Government Accountability Office concluded that the EPA violated two laws by installing the $43,000 phone booth for Pruitt's office without telling lawmakers first. Pruitt said his staff never told him the cost.\n\nSome of the ethics accusations against Pruitt also involved jobs for his wife. Emails obtained by the Sierra Club environmental group showed Pruitt had an aide contact the chief executive of a fast-food chain about his wife becoming a franchise owner.\n\nPruitt also had aides try to get his wife a job at the Republican Attorneys General Association with a salary topping $200,000. Pruitt also had an employee carry out his personal errands, including researching the purchase of an old mattress from the Trump International Hotel, according to an interview transcript released by congressional Democrats last month.\n\nDuring congressional testimony in April, Pruitt was unapologetic for the controversies, often blaming his staff for any agency missteps.",
    " Title: California Governor Gavin Newsom Signs Controversial Bill Requiring Presidential Tax Returns for Primary Ballot\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has reportedly signed a contentious bill that mandates presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns in order to appear on the state's primary ballot. The bill, SB 27, is primarily aimed at President Donald Trump, who has not released his tax returns.\n\nThe bill, which passed both houses of the California state legislature earlier this month, is now awaiting Newsom's signature by the Tuesday deadline. Analysts describe the bill as a political \"freebie\" for Newsom, but it could potentially be deemed unconstitutional, and it could strain the few areas where Trump has cooperated with Newsom's administration.\n\nJay Sekulow, a personal attorney for President Trump, has suggested that legal action will be taken in response to Newsom's move. \"The state of California's attempt to circumvent the Constitution will be answered in court,\" Sekulow stated.\n\nCalifornia, which has often sued the Trump administration over its policies, is also dependent on federal aid in several areas. Earlier this year, Trump canceled nearly $1 billion of funds for California's now-defunct high-speed rail project, a move that Newsom had still hoped to utilize despite canceling the project.\n\nNewsom himself published his tax returns during the 2018 race for governor. Notably, Newsom's predecessor, Jerry Brown, did not publish his tax returns. California's new law will largely be symbolic, as it will not affect Trump's appearance on the general election ballot, as he will still appear regardless. California exempts the presidential primary from its usual \"jungle primary\" process, in which only the top two candidates advance to the general election, regardless of party.\n\nThe bill could, however, inspire other Democrat-governed states to follow suit. It is also expected to boost Newsom's national profile. Joel B. Pollak, Senior Editor-at-Large at \u2588\u2588\u2588, notes that the bill is unlikely to succeed in court and could jeopardize California's precarious relationship with the Trump administration.",
    " Title: U.S. Job Growth Slows in July, but Economy Still Adds 209,000 Jobs in a Respectable Trend\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a report released Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that the U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in July, a slight slowdown from the 298,000 jobs added in June. Despite the dip, the broader trend remains \"respectable,\" according to economists. Over the past six months, the economy has added 1.5 million jobs, marking the strongest six-month hiring period since 2006.\n\nThe unemployment rate ticked up to 6.2% in July from 6.1% in June as more workers joined the labor force. The recovery has been a long, slow haul, but it now seems to be hitting its stride. About 8.7 million American jobs were wiped out in just two years following the 2008 financial crisis. The economy finally gained them all back earlier this year.\n\nBlue-collar industries like manufacturing and construction were the hardest-hit sectors in the recession, and those jobs have started to trickle back. Manufacturers have added 99,000 jobs over the past six months, while construction firms have added 114,000 jobs since January. Meanwhile, government jobs are starting to come back slowly too.\n\nJobs in these sectors tend to offer middle-class wages. The recovery is no longer dominated by hiring for low-wage retail and restaurant jobs. That said, stronger hiring has yet to translate into bigger paychecks for most workers. The average American wage edged up only 1 cent in July to $24.45 an hour. Over the past 12 months, wages rose 2%, but that's not enough to surpass inflation.\n\n\"As the labor market strengthens, we should see stronger wage growth, but this report does not provide much evidence that that's happening yet,\" said Heidi Shierholz, economist for the Economic Policy Institute.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has said she wants to see wages rise faster than inflation so American households will have more buying power. That has yet to happen, but the Fed is quickly nearing its other goals for a lower unemployment rate and stable prices. The central bank is gradually winding down its stimulative policies, and investors have recently become obsessed with trying to gauge when the Fed will eventually hike interest rates. Most economists expect a rate hike will occur in the spring or summer of 2015.\n\nFriday's jobs report does not move the needle much for the Fed, and stocks were flat in morning trading. Many Americans still think the economy is not fully recovered. According to the results of a CNN/ORC International poll released Friday, 41% of people surveyed rate the economy as \"good,\" while 58% rate the economy as \"poor.\"\n\nThese perceptions about the economy will be a key factor in November's midterm elections. More than a third of the Senate and the entire House are up for grabs. Both sides of the aisle are blaming each other for holding back the recovery.\n\nWhen it comes to job creation, \"there are a lot of things that can be done on a bipartisan basis,\" said Secretary of Labor Tom Perez. He points to the Obama administration's push to raise the minimum wage, pass an immigration reform bill, and approve funding for infrastructure. Meanwhile, the GOP points fingers at the Democratic-controlled Senate for blocking their job-creation bills, including legislation that would build the Keystone Pipeline.\n\n\"We're doing our part, but we need the president and his party to do theirs,\" House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. Both sides agree on one thing: \"When I look at this report, I think one thing: we can do better.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court Declines to Reinstate Pennsylvania's Gerrymandered Congressional Maps, Leaving Partisan Redistricting Unchanged\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Supreme Court of the United States has declined to intervene in a case challenging Pennsylvania's gerrymandered congressional maps. This decision marks the first time the high court has turned away a Republican-led effort to reinstate a partisan gerrymander in Pennsylvania since the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who is widely considered to have solidified a Republican majority on the court.\n\nThe decision comes after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the state's congressional maps in January, citing violations of the state constitution. The unconstitutional maps, which were so aggressively gerrymandered, resulted in Republicans winning 13 of the state's 18 congressional districts in 2012 despite Democrats winning a majority of the popular vote.\n\nThe state supreme court's decision should have been the final word on the case. Typically, state supreme courts have the final say on questions of state law, and the Supreme Court of the United States cannot overrule their interpretation of a state constitution. However, Pennsylvania Republicans took their case to the U.S. Supreme Court with a legal theory that is both outlandish and well-crafted to appeal to Republican judges.\n\nThe Constitution provides that \"the times, places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.\" Pennsylvania Republicans argued that this language prevents state supreme courts from tossing out a partisan gerrymander because a court is not a legislature.\n\nHowever, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected this reading of the word \"legislature.\" It did so most recently in its 2015 decision in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission. More than a century ago, the Supreme Court held that redistricting can be determined by a referendum. Not long thereafter, the Supreme Court held that the governor may veto state redistricting legislation, even though the governor is not a member of a state's legislative branch. Taken together, these cases establish that when the Constitution assigns the power to draw districts to the \"legislature,\" it refers to the state's valid lawmaking process\u2014not necessarily to the body of lawmakers elected by the people.\n\nNevertheless, Arizona State Legislature was a 5-4 decision, with four Republicans arguing that the word \"legislature\" can only refer to a state's legislative branch. The Court's fifth Republican, Justice Anthony Kennedy, crossed over to vote with the Court's four Democrats in Arizona State Legislature. However, Kennedy is no longer on the Court, and his replacement, Brett Kavanaugh, is a hardline conservative who appeared to call for revenge against Democrats during his confirmation hearing.\n\nAt the very least, however, Kavanaugh will not be able to take his revenge in this particular case. The Court's decision not to hear Turzai suggests that, at the very least, Republicans don't have the votes to reinstate one of the nation's most egregious gerrymanders.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Coronavirus Response Package Approved by U.S. House of Representatives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 363-40 vote early Saturday, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a coronavirus response package negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The bill, known as the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, received unanimous support from House Democrats, while 40 Republicans opposed it. Independent Representative Justin Amash from Michigan abstained from the vote.\n\nThe bill, which was initially announced by Pelosi at around 6 p.m. ET on Friday, addresses several aspects of the coronavirus outbreak, including free testing, paid sick leave, and expanded unemployment insurance. The bill also includes nutrition security initiatives, increased federal funds for Medicaid, and support for local, state, tribal, and territorial governments and health systems.\n\nThe apparent delay in the bill's passage caught Democrats by surprise, with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer stating, \"We thought we had an agreement.\" However, the hold-up was due to extraneous matters that House Republicans objected to in the original bill.\n\nThe bill's revisions came after the GOP flagged \"major\" concerns about the sick leave legislation on Thursday. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy criticized the initial legislation for creating a paid sick leave program through the Social Security Administration that he said would take six months to set up and hamper the agency's normal functioning of disbursing checks to senior citizens.\n\nMcCarthy also objected to forcing permanent paid sick leave \"for all businesses without exemptions and no sunsets.\" He later stated that the bill \"had some things which needed to be cleaned up.\"\n\nPresident Trump, who had previously expressed support for the bill, tweeted, \"I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening. This Bill will follow my direction for free Coronavirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers.\"\n\nIf the measure passes the House with an overwhelming majority, the Senate is expected to take it up next week. The bill is a significant step towards addressing the economic and health challenges posed by the coronavirus outbreak in the United States.",
    " Title: Grassley Meets with Merrick Garland: A Step Toward Bipartisan Dialogue Amidst Political Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Sen. Chuck Grassley, a long-standing Republican senator from Iowa, recently met with Merrick Garland, President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, to discuss the ongoing impasse in the confirmation process. This meeting, which took place in the Senate Dining Room, marked a shift in Grassley's stance, who had previously refused to hold confirmation hearings for Garland.\n\nThe meeting, described as cordial by media outlets such as The New York Times, occurred after Grassley faced criticism from constituents during his town halls in Iowa. With the midterm elections approaching and the potential for a challenging year for the Republicans, Grassley seems to have softened his stance slightly.\n\nThe purpose of the meeting, according to Grassley, was to explain his reasons for not holding confirmation hearings for a Supreme Court nominee. Grassley, an 82-year-old senator with over three decades of service, has been a vocal critic of the Obama administration's nomination, citing the proximity to the election as a reason for delaying the process.\n\nDuring the meeting, Grassley and Garland reportedly discussed the separation of powers and the role of the Senate in the confirmation process. The meeting, while not resulting in a confirmation hearing, was seen as a step towards bipartisan dialogue and a demonstration of the government's ability to engage in civil discourse, despite political differences.\n\nHowever, the meeting raises questions about the Republican strategy of refusing to consider Garland's nomination from the outset. With the GOP facing a potential loss of their Senate majority this fall, some speculate that Grassley's meeting with Garland is an attempt to appease constituents while maintaining a hardline stance on the nomination.\n\nIf the Republicans had allowed Garland a hearing and then voted against his confirmation, the current impasse might not have arisen. Grassley's compromise of meeting with Garland, but not granting him a hearing, has been criticized as a token gesture aimed at appeasing both the GOP base and less-conservative voters.\n\nAs the midterm elections approach, senators up for re-election, such as Grassley, may find themselves in a precarious position. The potential for a significant Democratic gain in the House of Representatives, combined with polling and anecdotal evidence suggesting that the Supreme Court obstructionism has been unpopular with the general public, could impact the re-election prospects of senators like Grassley.\n\nDespite the meeting, it remains unclear whether Grassley's compromise will be enough to appease both his conservative base and the general public. As the political landscape continues to shift, the future of the Supreme Court nomination process and the composition of the Supreme Court remain uncertain.",
    " Title: NASCAR's Confederate Flag Ban: Enforcement and Celebrity Support Amidst Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nNASCAR's recent decision to ban the Confederate flag from its races and venues has garnered widespread praise, with celebrities such as Reese Witherspoon and New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara expressing their support. The move comes as the sport faces the challenge of enforcing the ban at its sprawling, rowdy tracks when fans return.\n\nThe enforcement question is likely to be a significant issue, especially at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama, where up to 5,000 fans are expected to be allowed in during the June 20-21 races. Flags are a common sight at the superspeedway, located in the heart of NASCAR's Southern base. NASCAR is currently developing protocols for enforcement, but the extent of the ban remains unclear. Security may be tasked with policing flag displays, from Rebel flag string bikinis to flag-adorned bumper stickers.\n\nNASCAR executive vice president Steve O'Donnell acknowledged the challenge, stating, \"We'll try to do that the right way... We'll get ahead of it as we are today in letting people know that... come on into the track. But if we see something displayed at the track we're going to have to react and we will.\"\n\nThe push for the ban was largely driven by NASCAR's lone black driver, Bubba Wallace. Wallace, who publicly condemned the flag's presence in racing, has been praised for his efforts. He finished 11th at Martinsville on Wednesday night, driving a Black Lives Matter paint scheme.\n\nFellow drivers have praised Wallace for his advocacy. Joey Logano, the 2018 NASCAR champion, commended Wallace, saying, \"He should be proud of the movement he's made for the African-American community in our sport.\" Brad Daugherty, the lone black Cup Series team owner, expressed his support, stating, \"This is a big step in the right direction and now is the time to envision the future.\"\n\nHowever, not all fans are in support of the ban. Some have taken to social media to express their frustration, claiming their rights are being infringed upon. NASCAR helmet artist Jason Beam, who designs helmets for drivers such as Jimmie Johnson and Kyle Busch, has been vocal in his opposition to the ban. Wallace and several drivers, including Johnson, have since cut ties with Beam Designs.\n\nThe ban has also sparked a surge of interest in NASCAR, with ratings up 1% compared to last year. The series, which has been one of the only live U.S. sports on television during the pandemic, could be on the path to a revival, with the support of celebrities potentially attracting new fans.\n\nAs NASCAR moves forward, the question remains: How will the series enforce the Confederate flag ban while maintaining the rowdy, flag-filled atmosphere that is synonymous with its races? Only time will tell.",
    " Title: New NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll Reveals Slight Uptick in Approval Rating for President Obama, Mixed Views on Economy and Health Care Reform\n\nThe latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll has shown a slight increase in President Barack Obama's approval rating, with 44% of Americans approving of his job performance compared to 50% who disapprove. This marks a slight uptick from his all-time low 41% approval rating in the poll last month.\n\nThe poll indicates that majorities of Americans do not approve of how Mr. Obama is handling the economy and foreign policy. However, for the first time since early October, more people have a positive view of the president (44%) than a negative one (41%).\n\nThe poll also reveals that a majority of registered voters believe the economy is stacked against them, and a majority of Americans say that because of a widening income gap, America is no longer a country where, regardless of their background, people have an opportunity to improve their standard of living.\n\nIn terms of the economy, a plurality of respondents (47%) believe the current economic conditions are something Mr. Obama inherited as opposed to something his policies are mostly responsible for. Forty-one percent believe that the economy has improved during his presidency and give him some credit, 17% say the economy has improved but do not give him much credit, and 42% say the economy has not really improved.\n\nRegarding Mr. Obama's health care law, 36% of voters say it was a good idea, while 46% say it was a bad idea. However, just about one-fifth of voters (20%) say the law should be completely repealed. Two-thirds of voters say it needs a major overhaul or minor modifications to improve it, and eight percent think it's working well the way it is.\n\nAs for the midterm elections, 45% of registered voters prefer a Republican-controlled Congress, and 45% prefer a Democratic-controlled one. Forty-two percent of those polled identified with the Democratic party in some form, 34% identified with the Republican party, and 17% said they were independent.\n\nThe poll of 1,000 adults taken from April 23-27 has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",
    " Title: The Shift in Conservative Politics: Ruth Davidson's Call for a Moral Capitalism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the evolving political landscape, the Right has demonstrated its ability to win elections, but the challenge now lies in governing effectively. This is a reality that is becoming increasingly apparent in both Europe and the United States.\n\nEmmanuel Macron's victory over the Front Nationale and Angela Merkel's expected reelection in the fall indicate a resurgence of globalist ideologies. The Brexit saga, once a symbol of nationalist fervor, is now mired in uncertainty, with the process of leaving the European Union stalling due to incompetent and convictionless politicians.\n\nIn the United States, the new nationalist constituency, who had pinned their hopes on Donald Trump, are now grappling with the reality of his presidency. Trump's approach to governance has been met with mixed results, with some applauding his unconventional methods and others criticizing his lack of a clear strategy.\n\nAmidst this political turbulence, Ruth Davidson, the leader of Scotland's Conservative and Unionist party, has emerged as a potential beacon of hope for the Right. Davidson, a young, feisty, and creative politician, has been credited with resurrecting her party from the ashes of Theresa May's failed leadership.\n\nHowever, Davidson's recent political essay has sparked debate, as she calls for a reboot of capitalism. She argues that capitalism must be a moral enterprise, reaching out to those who feel left behind and addressing the social solidarity gap. Davidson cites Adam Smith's contention that capitalism can provide the means for public services and praises \"intervention, market restraints, and decisions made at a macro-level by governments to ensure basic fairness for the little guy.\"\n\nIn essence, Davidson is grappling with the same problems and opportunities that conservatives face globally across the industrialized world. The erosion of traditional social supports, the disillusionment of the working classes, and the perceived exploitation of capitalism are issues that Davidson, like May and Trump, has identified.\n\nAs the political landscape continues to shift, it remains to be seen whether conservative parties and thinkers will find the right answers to address these challenges. However, the problem set, as Davidson suggests, does not seem to be changing any time soon.",
    " Title: \"Anonymous Op-Ed Author Denied as Vice President Mike Pence and Other Administration Officials Distance Themselves\"\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 As the identity of the author of a scathing op-ed published in The New York Times remains a mystery, Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials have begun to distance themselves from the piece, denying authorship and criticizing the newspaper for publishing the anonymous article that has caused a stir within the White House.\n\nJarrod Agen, communications director for Pence, tweeted, \"The Vice President puts his name on his Op-Eds. The @nytimes should be ashamed and so should the person who wrote the false, illogical, and gutless op-ed. Our office is above such amateur acts.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, during a trip to India, told reporters, \"It's not mine,\" and denounced The New York Times for publishing the anonymous article that suggests President Donald Trump may be facing a potential revolt within his own administration.\n\nThe op-ed, entitled \"I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,\" was penned by an anonymous senior administration official who claims to be part of a group working to block what they perceive as bad decisions by the president, on issues ranging from free trade to military policy.\n\nIn the piece, the author describes the president as unprincipled and \"amoral,\" stating that meetings with Trump \"veer off topic and off the rails,\" and that his impulsiveness results in \"half-baked, ill-informed, and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back.\"\n\nThe author also compared Trump unfavorably to the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., describing him as a \"lodestar for restoring honor to public life and our national dialogue.\"\n\nIn response, a livid Trump questioned the legitimacy of the author, tweeting, \"Does the so-called 'Senior Administration Official' really exist, or is it just the Failing New York Times with another phony source? If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to the government at once!\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the author should step forward and resign, stating, \"He is not putting country first, but putting himself and his ego ahead of the will of the American people.\"\n\nInternet sleuths had initially identified Pence as a suspect due to the piece's use of the term \"lodestar,\" one of the vice president's favorite words. However, as of now, the identity of the author remains unknown.",
    " Title: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos Issues Final Rules on Sexual Misconduct Allegations in Schools\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has issued final rules on how schools will address allegations of sexual misconduct, securing new protections for students and faculty accused of misconduct. The new regulations, which take effect in August, modify Title IX, a 1972 law prohibiting discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance.\n\nThe new rules narrow the definition of sexual harassment and require schools to challenge evidence and cross-examine students via a live hearing, among other things detailed in the more than 2,000-page rule. The regulations will only find schools in violation of Title IX if they are determined to be \"deliberately indifferent\" to accusations of sexual assault that occurred in their programs and activities.\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued a statement describing the new regulations as \"even-handed justice\" with \"a transparent grievance process that treats the accused as innocent until proven guilty.\" In a statement, Trump said, \"With today\u2019s action and every action to come, the Trump administration will fight for America\u2019s students.\"\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate Education Committee, said in a statement, \"This final rule respects and supports victims and preserves due process rights for both the victim and the accused.\" He added, \"Under the previous administration, a single official in the U.S. Department of Education was issuing edicts, without the proper public input, to 6,000 colleges and universities about how to handle the complex and sensitive problem of sexual assault on college campuses.\"\n\nVictim advocacy groups, such as Know Your IX, have criticized the new rules, claiming they roll back the rights of student survivors and shield schools from liability for sexual misconduct that takes place in their facilities. \"If this rule goes into effect, it will make schools more dangerous and could push survivors out of school entirely,\" the group tweeted.\n\nThe National Women\u2019s Law Center has also expressed opposition to the new rules, with president Fatima Goss Graves stating, \"Betsy DeVos and the Trump administration are dead set on making schools more dangerous for everyone\u2014even during a global pandemic. And if this rule goes into effect, survivors will be denied their civil rights and will get the message loud and clear that there is no point in reporting assault.\"",
    " Title: High School Gunman Killed in Shootout with Police Officer After Maryland School Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nA 17-year-old gunman, identified as Austin Wyatt Rollins, opened fire at Great Mills High School in St. Mary's County, Maryland, injuring two teenage students before being shot dead in a gunfight with a school resource officer. The shooting occurred on Tuesday morning, just over a month after the tragic shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead.\n\nRollins shot a 16-year-old girl, who is currently in critical condition, and a 14-year-old boy. The attack took place in a hallway at the school, with Rollins firing at the female student before turning to a male student. Sheriff Tim Cameron reported that the school resource officer, Deputy Blaine Gaskill, was alerted to the shooting and engaged the gunman in a gunfight. The exact cause of the gunman's death is still under investigation, with it being unclear if he was hit by Deputy Gaskill's gunfire or if he shot himself.\n\nDeputy Gaskill was not injured in the incident, and the female student is currently receiving treatment in a hospital. Approximately 1,600 students attend the school in the community of Great Mills near the Chesapeake Bay. The students were evacuated to a nearby school following the event.\n\nFederal agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, along with local police, are currently investigating the incident. One Twitter user, who appears to be a student at the school, posted about the shootings.\n\nMaryland Governor Larry Hogan expressed concern, stating, \"Today's horrible events should not be an excuse to pause our conversation about school safety.\" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also commented on the attack, stating, \"This serves as another tragic and exasperating reminder of the enduring threat of gun violence.\" He called upon \"our so-called leaders in Washington\" to take action to combat gun violence.\n\nThe shooting occurs four days before the March for Our Lives rally for student safety, inspired by the 14 February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in southern Florida.",
    " Title: Treasury Department Delays Employer Mandate in Obama's Health Care Law by One Year\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - The requirement for businesses to provide health insurance to their employees or face fines, a key provision in President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, will be delayed by one year, the Treasury Department announced Tuesday. The postponement comes after business owners expressed concerns about the complexity of the law's reporting requirements, the agency said.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, businesses employing 50 or more full-time workers that do not provide them health insurance will be penalized. Mark J. Mazur, assistant secretary for tax policy, wrote in a post on the Treasury Department's website that the extra year before the requirement goes into effect will allow the government time to assess ways to simplify the reporting process for businesses.\n\nPenalties for firms not providing health coverage to employees will now begin in 2015, after next year's congressional elections. The new delay will not affect other aspects of the health law, including the establishment of exchanges in states for low-income Americans to obtain health insurance.\n\nSupporters of the employer mandate note that most firms already provide health insurance to full-time workers, and downplay the effect the requirement would have on small businesses, citing figures showing the vast majority of small businesses employ fewer than 50 workers.\n\nHowever, opponents claim the employer mandate is a potential job killer, saying businesses near the 50-worker cutoff will be unlikely to ramp up hiring if it means they're required to provide employees health insurance.\n\n\"The administration has finally recognized the obvious \u2013 employers need more time and clarification of the rules of the road before implementing the employer mandate,\" said Randy Johnson, a vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a business group.\n\nObama's administration has previously expressed openness to making the health care law easier to implement, and acted to shorten applications for health insurance on government-run exchanges from 21 pages to three.\n\nOn Tuesday, Obama's senior adviser Valerie Jarrett \u2013 who acts as the White House's liaison to big business \u2013 wrote the new delay was indicative of the administration's determination to implement the health care law effectively and fairly, and that it wouldn't affect other aspects of Obamacare.\n\n\"While major portions of the law have yet to be implemented, it's already a little more affordable for businesses to offer quality health coverage to their employees,\" Jarrett wrote, adding later: \"As we implement this law, we have and will continue to make changes as needed. In our ongoing discussions with businesses, we have heard that you need the time to get this right.\"\n\nYet many Republicans \u2013 and even some Democrats \u2013 have continued to express serious concerns about the roll-out of Obamacare. On Tuesday, GOP lawmakers said the delay of the employer mandate didn't go far enough.\n\n\"This announcement means even the Obama administration knows the 'train wreck' will only get worse,\" House Speaker John Boehner wrote.\n\n\"Obamacare costs too much and it isn't working the way the administration promised,\" Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader, wrote in response to the decision, adding: \"The fact remains that Obamacare needs to be repealed and replaced with common-sense reforms that actually lower costs for Americans.\"\n\nRep. Eric Cantor, the House Majority Leader, was more succinct. \"The best delay for Obamacare is a permanent one,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nMany allies of Obama, including major labor unions, did not immediately weigh in on the delay. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in response to the decision, \"Flexibility is a good thing.\"\n\n\"Both the administration and Senate Democrats have shown \u2013 and continue to show \u2013 a willingness to be flexible and work with all interested parties to make sure that implementation of the Affordable Care Act is as beneficial as possible to all involved. It is better to do this right than fast,\" Adam Jentleson continued.\n\nYet even some Democrats have voiced concern about the roll-out of the health law \u2013 Sen. Max Baucus, a key Democrat who helped craft the legislation, expressed serious anxiety in April about its implementation.\n\n\"The administration's public information campaign on the benefits of the Affordable Care Act deserves a failing grade. You need to fix this,\" Baucus told Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at a hearing.\n\n\"I just see a huge train wreck coming down,\" he added later.",
    " Title: President Trump Fires FBI Director James Comey, Citing Loss of Public Trust and Confidence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump on Tuesday dismissed FBI Director James Comey, citing a need for new leadership to restore public trust and confidence in the nation's top law enforcement agency. The decision came amidst an ongoing investigation into potential ties between Trump's campaign and Russia, as well as the FBI's correction of a statement made by Comey during his testimony before Congress last week.\n\nIn a letter to Comey, Trump stated that the FBI, one of the nation's most cherished and respected institutions, was due for a \"new beginning.\" The president's decision, according to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, was based on the \"clear recommendations\" of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nThe search for a new permanent FBI director will commence immediately, with Deputy Director Andrew McCabe assuming the position of acting director in the interim. The White House made the announcement shortly after the FBI corrected a statement made by Comey regarding the number of emails found on the laptop of Huma Abedin, a top aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nInitially, Comey had stated that Abedin had sent \"hundreds and thousands\" of emails to her husband's laptop, including some with classified information. However, the FBI later clarified that only a \"small number\" of the thousands of emails found on the laptop had been forwarded there, while most had simply been backed up from electronic devices.\n\nComey's handling of the Clinton email investigation had previously caused controversy. In July 2016, he concluded that Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, had not acted criminally with classified emails but had been \"extremely careless.\" He then announced a revived probe regarding the emails and Abedin's handling of them in the closing days of the race.\n\nThe FBI and U.S. intelligence community, along with Congress, are currently investigating the extent to which Russia was involved in stealing and making public emails from Clinton's presidential campaign.\n\nIn his letter to Trump, Attorney General Sessions stated that the next FBI director must be someone who follows \"faithfully the rules and principles\" of the Justice Department. Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said Comey had lost the \"public trust and confidence.\"\n\nDemocrats are calling for an independent prosecutor to investigate possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia following the firing. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) stated, \"The only way the American people can have faith in this investigation is for it to be led by a fearless special prosecutor.\"\n\nJames Comey, 56, was nominated by President Barack Obama for the FBI post in 2013 to a 10-year term. Praised for his independence and integrity, Comey has spent three decades in law enforcement and has been no stranger to controversy. Sessions stated that the FBI needs a \"fresh start.\"",
    " Title: Navigating the Partisan Divide: Mail-In Voting and the 2020 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2020 presidential election approaches, the issue of mail-in voting has become a contentious topic, with President Donald Trump's tweets fueling a partisan divide on the matter. However, local election officials from both parties recognize the necessity of increased mail voting, despite the associated challenges.\n\nRecent surveys indicate that most voters support efforts to reduce voter density on Election Day and during early voting, with an expansion of mail balloting being crucial to this goal. While many Americans have voted in person throughout their adult lives, some view in-person voting as an expression of civic pride and duty. Others, however, do not trust the postal system to deliver their ballot or have been influenced by Trump's criticism, choosing not to vote by mail on principle.\n\nIn a survey of registered voters in Pennsylvania, approximately half indicated they would vote in person in the fall. Even among primary voters who cast a mail ballot, 20% said they were likely to vote in person in the general election. Most of those who did not vote in the primary but plan to vote in November intend to do so in person.\n\nFor new or infrequent voters, certain aspects of absentee voting may be unfamiliar. They may encounter difficulties navigating the websites to request a ballot or be surprised by the need to sign the outside envelope for verification. In recent New Jersey elections, for example, as many as 10% of ballots were not counted due to lateness or technical deficiencies.\n\nMail-in voting procedures can trip up some groups more than others. An analysis of data from Florida revealed that African Americans, young people, and first-time voters were less likely to have their mail ballots counted due to lateness or noncompliance with technical requirements.\n\nElection Day polling places serve as an indispensable fail-safe for voters who do not receive their mail ballots on time. Jurisdictions with limited experience in mail voting have been overwhelmed during the primary season by the number of mail ballots that need to be processed. In Wisconsin earlier this year, for example, more than 10,000 voters requested absentee ballots that they never received. A local federal judge extended the deadline for casting these ballots, but this decision was overturned by a narrow majority of the United States Supreme Court the day before the election. This left voters in the cold, as those who never received mail ballots now had to wait in long lines in places such as Milwaukee, which opened only five polling locations.\n\nAs the election nears, it is essential to address the challenges associated with mail-in voting while ensuring that all voters have access to safe and secure polling places.",
    " Title: The Supreme Court's South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc. Case: A Battle Over State Taxation of Online Sales\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court is currently hearing the case of South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., a significant legal battle that could reshape the landscape of state and local taxation of online sales. The case revolves around the question of whether state and local governments should be allowed to collect taxes from out-of-state companies.\n\nCurrently, a 1992 Supreme Court decision, Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, reaffirms that a business must have a significant presence in a state before that state can require it to collect sales taxes. This means that a mother selling handcrafted goods on Etsy, for example, does not have to collect sales taxes from her consumers unless they are physically located in her state. However, companies like Amazon collect sales taxes from customers in all 45 states that have a statewide sales tax due to their vast distribution network.\n\nMany state lawmakers are pushing for Quill to be overturned, aiming to force out-of-state companies to collect sales taxes on their behalf. If the states were to win, they would be able to reach into the pockets of small online sellers, even if they reside on the other side of the country, have never agreed to the states' tax laws, and were never elected by those states' officials.\n\nA potential overturning of Quill could also lead to the loss of healthy tax competition among states. Under the new regime, online consumers, regardless of where they shop or what they buy, would lose the ability to shop around for a better tax system. This competitive pressure, which limits their tax-grabbing abilities, is what these lawmakers resent and want the Supreme Court to put an end to.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the states' financial woes are not primarily due to the lack of revenue from online sales. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 33 states faced shortfalls in fiscal 2017 and/or fiscal 2018, even though revenue collection has been growing in most states. This is because the more states collect in revenue, the more they spend.\n\nFurthermore, states are overestimating the revenue they'd gain from taxing online sales. Online sales represent less than 10% of retail sales, and taxing them wouldn't make a significant difference. According to a 2017 report by the Government Accountability Office, online sales would, at most, contribute 2-4% of total state and local government tax revenues if Quill were to be reversed.\n\nA reversal of Quill could also impose substantial compliance costs on small online retailers, who, unlike Amazon, tend to have razor-thin profit margins. Compliance with the nation's 12,000 tax-collecting jurisdictions could prove burdensome, especially considering the intricacies of state tax laws.\n\nDuring the South Dakota v. Wayfair hearing, Republican state senator Deb Peters of South Dakota, in an interview with NPR, dismissed concerns about compliance costs. However, an eBay representative noted on NPR that tax software is not precise enough to handle the complexities of state tax laws, and compliance would still have to be handled on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe outcome of the South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc. case could have significant implications for online sellers and consumers alike. If Quill were to be overturned, compliance costs could skyrocket for many retailers, and good principles of taxation could be thrown out the window. Let's hope the highest court in the land makes the right decision to preserve healthy tax competition and protect small businesses.",

The day marked the celebration of all US veterans, a shift from the original Armistice Day, which was established in 1954.\n\nSince 2001, over two million Americans have served overseas in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. A record number of veterans from these wars were recently elected to the US Congress.\n\nAddressing a crowd of veterans and their families, Biden acknowledged the unprecedented demands placed on the all-volunteer force. He described veterans as \"the most trusted among us and the most tested of all Americans.\"\n\nThe past year has seen challenges for the Department of Veterans Affairs, with the secretary stepping down amid a scandal involving delayed care and falsified records at the agency's hospitals.\n\nIn a significant move, Ohio reminded Iraq war veterans from their state of the limited time left to collect a bonus authorized by the state in 2009.\n\nA first for this year's Veterans Day parade, a group representing gay and lesbian veterans marched in Boston.\n\nIn a fitting tribute, a star-studded concert featuring artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Rihanna, and Carrie Underwood is planned for the National Mall in Washington, in honor of veterans.",
    " Title: House Democrats Announce Articles of Impeachment Against Trump and USMCA Agreement in Twin Announcements\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Tuesday, House Democrats unveiled two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump and announced they had reached an agreement with the White House on a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\nIn a somber announcement, Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled the articles of impeachment, charging the president with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. However, an hour later, Pelosi praised the USMCA, which she said Democrats took \"great pride in.\" The deal, which Mexico and Canada are expected to sign in the coming days, includes various environmental and labor regulations secured by Democrats.\n\nPresident Trump took a break from the impeachment proceedings to promote the deal, tweeting, \"Looking like very good Democrat support for USMCA. That would be great for our Country!\"\n\nSpeaker Pelosi told reporters that the timing of both developments was not a coincidence. The impeachment hearings concluded on Monday, so it made sense to unveil the articles of impeachment on Tuesday. Additionally, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer wanted to finalize the NAFTA replacement before Congress went on recess and while Democrats and Republicans remained on the same page.\n\nBehind closed doors, Pelosi insisted that Democrats had the upper hand in the trade deal and outmaneuvered the GOP. \"We ate their lunch,\" Pelosi reportedly said in a caucus meeting.\n\nSupporters of Pelosi and more moderate Democrats praised the one-two punch of impeachment and the trade deal, arguing that Democrats needed to prove they could \"walk and chew gum at the same time.\" However, many progressives slammed the strategy, arguing that the USMCA undermined the party's case for impeachment.\n\nCritics of the strategy argued that the USMCA also undermined Democrats' claim that the president is dangerously unfit for office and lent credence to Trump's argument that he's getting his job done despite an impeachment process he has called a \"coup.\"\n\nSome argued that Democrats were fulfilling the \"Dems in disarray\" stereotype and mistakenly looking to appease voters in swing states. \"Nothing more perfectly embodies the Democratic party than announcing articles of impeachment and a huge deal with the President on his single biggest priority on the same day,\" said Chris Hayes, the progressive MSNBC host.\n\nWill Stancil, a researcher at the University of Minnesota Law School, called Pelosi's strategy \"insane.\" \"This is not 12-dimensional chess, it's just House Democrats spinning wildly in place, trying to square two incompatible facts: their irresistible desire to look sober and bipartisan by always compromising [and] the absolute objective unacceptability of Trump,\" he tweeted. \"And the result is lunacy.\"\n\nBrian Beutler, the editor-in-chief of the progressive media outlet Crooked Media, called Pelosi's strategy \"a stunning betrayal.\" \"If you kill the deal you can say it was a shitty deal, like everything else Trump has done and that you'll do better,\" he tweeted. \"If you pass the deal you tell voters yeah, president deals actually did a good deal just like he promised.\"",
    " Title: Romney's Favorability Rating Surges After Debate Performances\n\nArticle:\n\nBOCA RATON, Fla. \u2014 Mitt Romney has surpassed the 50 percent mark in his favorability rating, according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls, marking the first time the Republican candidate has led President Barack Obama in this measure. This development comes after the presidential debates, which many believe have dismantled the Obama campaign's strategy of portraying Romney as unacceptable to voters.\n\nThe debates, particularly the first one, have reportedly undermined the Obama campaign's strategy of disqualification, according to Republican pollster Mike McKenna. \"Six months of work and $400 million of ad buys went up in smoke in about 10 days,\" McKenna said. With less than three weeks remaining until the election, the Obama campaign is reportedly struggling to regain its footing.\n\nThe effect of the debates can be seen in the favorability ratings. At the end of September, Romney's favorable rating was 44.5 percent. By Monday, following the third and final debate between the two candidates, Romney's rating had risen to 50.5 percent.\n\nTom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, a Democratic firm, described Romney's favorability surge as \"remarkable\" and attributed it to the candidate's improved standing with independent voters. \"It was inevitable that Republicans were going to warm up to him once he became their nominee, but ever since his big victory in the first debate, his numbers with independents have improved a good deal,\" Jensen said.\n\nBy Tuesday, Romney's favorability rating had dipped below 50 percent again, but he still leads Obama in net favorability, with a difference of 6.5 points. Obama's favorability rating averaged 49.7 percent, or 4.5 points more than his unfavorable rating. Romney's favorability was 49.3 percent, or 6.5 points more than his unfavorable rating.\n\nDuring the foreign policy debate on Tuesday, Romney delivered a measured performance, hewing closely to Obama's decision-making on Syria, Iran, and Afghanistan. While some pundits criticized Romney for not offering clear differences on foreign policy, Republicans argued that Romney made himself a more palatable alternative to Obama.\n\nIn the final two weeks of the campaign, the election is expected to be decided on domestic issues. Obama has used the debates to present voters with a framework to choose, emphasizing his administration's progress in digging the country out of economic crisis and his plans to continue that progress.\n\nInstant polls showed Obama winning the debate on points, but Republicans argued that Romney's measured and presidential demeanor was a significant victory. During October, Romney has connected with voters in a way he never had before, humanizing himself through stories of everyday voters he has met and personal interactions.\n\nJohn Zogby, a pollster for The \u2588\u2588\u2588, said Romney's favorability surge is a significant development in the race. \"Voters got to see an option. Now that there is an option, Romney is viewed as favorably as Obama as a person,\" Zogby said. However, Romney still faces challenges when it comes to relating to voters, as evidenced by a recent poll showing Obama nearly doubling Romney's likability rating.",
    " Title: U.S. Job Growth Improves Slightly in January, but Remains Below Expectations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. economy added 113,000 jobs in January, according to the latest government report, marking a slight improvement from the previous month but falling short of economists' expectations. The addition of jobs was far weaker than anticipated, with experts predicting an increase of 178,000 jobs.\n\nEconomists described the report as \"disappointing\" and \"weak,\" but characterized the broader economic growth as \"steady-as-she-goes.\" Julia Coronado, chief economist, North America for BNP Paribas, stated, \"The U.S. economy is very stable. 2014 might not be a breakout year, but it's not a disaster either.\"\n\nMany economists had hoped that December's weak job gains would be significantly revised higher, as many experts considered the December report a fluke. However, the number was revised higher by only 1,000 jobs to 75,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate was 6.6% in January, with 10 million Americans counted as unemployed. Despite the improvement in the unemployment rate since it peaked at 10% in 2009, much of the decline in unemployment has been due to Americans dropping out of the labor force. As of January, only 63% of Americans over age 16 participated in the labor market, which is hovering around its lowest level since 1978.\n\nWhile some of the decline is partly due to baby boomers retiring, economists are also concerned about the long-term unemployed, who may be giving up on the job market altogether. Following the report, one of President Obama's top economic advisers, Jason Furman, called the unemployment rate \"unacceptably high.\"\n\nAbout 3.6 million Americans have been unemployed for six months or more. Those who were relying on extended government benefits lost that lifeline in December. In a White House blog post, Furman wrote, \"These figures provide a stark reminder that despite the progress that has been made, the after-effects of the recession still linger and are creating hardship for many families.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been emphasizing that its stimulus policies depend on economic data, and while it has been aiming for an unemployment rate of 6.5%, it's expected to distance itself from using that number as its main measure of the job market. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren stated, \"Using the narrow, widely reported unemployment rate alone could suggest a misleadingly optimistic state of affairs.\"\n\nRecently appointed Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to testify before two Congressional committees next week.\n\nSurprisingly, more than half of January's job gains came from traditional blue-collar sectors. Goods-producing industries added more jobs than the services sector for the first time since 2005. Construction firms added 48,000 jobs, manufacturers added 21,000 jobs, and the mining industry added 7,200 jobs.\n\nHowever, that was one of few bright spots in the report. The health care sector cut 400 jobs - the first month of job losses since 2003. Health care had been an industry with strong job growth throughout the recession. Professional and business services added 36,000 jobs, but a large part of those jobs were through staffing agencies. About 15,000 jobs were added at restaurants and bars, while sporting goods, hobby, book, and music stores cut 22,000 jobs.\n\nOverall, the U.S. economy lost 8.7 million jobs in the financial crisis. As of January, 7.8 million jobs have come back, but once economists also account for population growth, they expect that it will still take years to get back to a pre-recession job market.",
    " Title: Trump's Change of Heart: A Look at Donald Trump's Reversal on Supporting the GOP Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has reversed his pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee, a promise he made during the party's primary debates in August.\n\nDuring the debates, all the Republican candidates, including Trump, were asked to pledge their support to the nominee, and Trump was the only one who refused. However, on Tuesday, Trump told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he no longer intends to honor that pledge.\n\nTrump's change of heart comes amidst growing tension between the candidate and the Republican National Committee (RNC). Trump has expressed dissatisfaction with the RNC's treatment of him, citing the possibility of a brokered convention and delegate allocation rules as reasons for his discontent.\n\nIn the August debates, Trump had stated that he was discussing the pledge with party officials, but he was also talking about \"leverage.\" Trump's threat to run as an independent candidate is seen as his most significant piece of leverage, as many Republicans believe an independent Trump bid could ensure a Hillary Clinton presidency, given Trump's strong performance in Southern states outside the party structure.\n\nTrump's decision to renege on his pledge follows similar moves by other Republican candidates, including Ted Cruz and John Kasich. The change in stance by these candidates is largely due to the active #NeverTrump movement, which aims to prevent Trump from securing the 1,237 delegates needed to become the GOP nominee.\n\nThe rules of the Republican primary process state that the candidate with a majority of delegates, which is 50% plus one of the total voting delegates (2,472), will be the nominee. Trump has expressed frustration with the process, calling 1,237 a \"very random number\" during a debate on March 10.\n\nTrump has also threatened to sue over not receiving the most delegates in Louisiana despite winning the most votes in the primary. This frustration stems from a lack of understanding of the primary process and the need for a well-organized on-the-ground team to navigate the complex rules in each state.\n\nTrump's decision to renege on his pledge to support the eventual nominee is seen as an attempt to exert pressure on the RNC and prevent a third-party bid, which could potentially hobble the party's chances at the White House. Some party loyalists are willing to take that risk, as they believe a Trump-led Republican Party would be detrimental to the party's chances in the general election.\n\nTrump's inconsistency in his pledge to support the eventual nominee has raised questions about his decision-making abilities, with some viewing it as indecisiveness, while others see it as a calculated move to gain leverage in the race. Regardless of one's perspective, Trump's actions highlight the unpredictable nature of his campaign and the potential consequences of his decisions on the Republican Party and the 2016 presidential race.",
    " Title: Attorney General Sessions Indicates Openness to Recuse Himself from Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement to NBC News on Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions indicated that he would be willing to recuse himself from any investigation of Russian involvement in President Trump's campaign if it is \"appropriate.\"\n\n\"I have said whenever it's appropriate, I will recuse myself,\" Sessions told NBC News. \"There's no doubt about that.\"\n\nReports emerged late Wednesday that Sessions spoke twice with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 presidential race. Sessions did not disclose those conversations during his confirmation hearings for attorney general, testifying under oath that he \u201cdid not have communications with the Russians.\u201d\n\nSessions defended himself during his comments with NBC News, saying he did not discuss the presidential campaign with Russian officials.\n\n\"Well, I have not met with any Russians at any time to discuss any political campaigns,\" he said. \"Those remarks are unbelievable to me and are false. I don\u2019t have anything else to say about that.\"\n\nSessions' latest comments come as more GOP lawmakers say he might have to recuse himself from any investigation involving Russia and the Trump campaign at the Justice Department.\n\nOn Thursday morning, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) suggested it would be \"easier\" if Sessions recused himself from any Russia-related investigations that might come up.\n\n\"I don't have all the information in front of me, I don't want to pre-judge, but I just think for any investigation going forward, you want to make sure everybody trusts the investigation,\" McCarthy said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\n\n\"That there's no doubt within the investigation... I think it would be easier from that standpoint, yes.\"\n\nThe FBI is said to be investigating contact between Russian officials and members of the Trump campaign, though there has yet to be any formal charges brought. Committees in the House and Senate are pursuing their own investigations.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Wednesday said that if the FBI finds any criminal activity related to campaign aides' alleged contact with Russian officials, then a special prosecutor will likely be needed.\n\nRep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) meanwhile, said he wished Sessions had been \"more clear\" during the confirmation process about his meetings.\n\n\"It gives me some pause that he was not more clear about the meeting,\" Duffy said Thursday morning on CNN's \"New Day.\"\n\n\"I think as he's going through the campaign with Mr. Trump though, he was acting in his official capacity as a senator, you want to disclose that information and I think it should have been more clear during his confirmation process that he did have the meetings.\"\n\nSessions, a former Republican senator from Alabama, reportedly spoke with Kislyak during a July Heritage Foundation event at the Republican National Convention attended by about 50 ambassadors. Sessions also spoke with Kislyak via phone in September, according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general.\n\nThe conversation took place during a time when U.S. intelligence officials assert that Russia was interfering in the 2016 race through a hacking and influence campaign.\n\nReports emerged last month that top aides and allies of Trump's White House run were in recurring contact with senior Russian intelligence officials.\n\nDemocrats seized on news about Sessions speaking with Kislyak, arguing Sessions must recuse himself from any federal investigation into contact between Russia and Trump's team.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called for Sessions to resign following the news.\n\n\"This is not normal. This is not fake news,\" Warren tweeted. \"This is a very real & serious threat to the national security of the United States.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also called for Sessions' resignation, saying Sessions is \"not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly dismissed the reports of Russia contacts as \"fake news\" and suggested the real issue is leaks of information from the intelligence community. Yet scrutiny of the issue continues to build, particularly after Michael Flynn resigned last month as national security adviser for misleading Vice President Pence about his own phone conversations with Kislyak after the election.",
    " Title: Study Suggests Democratic Party's Leftward Shift Outpaces GOP's Rightward Drift in Political Polarization\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by political scientists from Princeton, Georgetown, and the University of Oregon has challenged the conventional wisdom that the Republican Party has been moving further to the right, causing political polarization and gridlock in Washington. The study, published in August, argues that the Democratic Party's leftward drift is more pronounced than the GOP's rightward drift, particularly at the state level.\n\nThe study, highlighted this week in a Washington Post article, suggests that income inequality has increased political polarization at the state level since the 1990s. However, the authors find that this polarization happens more by moving state Democratic parties to the left than by moving state Republican parties to the right. The authors argue that as the Democratic Party lost power at the state level over the past 15 years, it also effectively shed its moderate wing. Centrist Democrats have increasingly lost seats to Republicans, resulting in a more liberal Democratic party overall.\n\nThe authors also find that the ideological median of Republican legislators has shifted much less. One study does not a thesis prove, but the paper is certainly interesting, and it coheres with the trends we've been seeing.\n\nThe study's findings challenge the narrative that Democrats are moderate and in line with public opinion while Republicans have undergone a sudden jolt to the right. The authors argue that our discussions about polarization need to reflect the fact that it is a bipartisan affair.\n\nIn 2012, political scientists Norman Ornstein and Thomas Mann wrote a book blaming Republican extremism for every problem in Washington. However, the new study suggests that the Democratic Party has also moved to the left at least as quickly as the Republicans have moved to the right.\n\nThe study's findings are particularly relevant in the context of the ongoing debates over issues like the $15 minimum wage, healthcare, and universal preschool. The authors' findings challenge the notion that doubling the minimum wage is not radical or that passing a 2000-page health insurance reform law is not extreme.\n\nThe study's findings are a reminder that political polarization is a complex issue that requires a nuanced understanding of the factors that contribute to it. The study's authors argue that a more accurate understanding of political polarization is essential for finding solutions to the challenges facing our democracy.",
    " Title: Trump's Immigration Proposals Rejected by Democrats Amid Ongoing Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets and an address on Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump proposed a compromise to end the ongoing government shutdown, which is now the longest in U.S. history. However, his proposals have been met with rejection by the Democratic party.\n\nThe President's offer included a three-year extension for approximately 700,000 \"Dreamers,\" undocumented immigrants who entered the U.S. as children with their parents, and 300,000 individuals holding Temporary Protection Status (TPS) for three years. These are people who have fled countries affected by war or disasters.\n\nIn a tweet, Trump stated that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats had \"turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak.\" He further accused his opponents of focusing on the 2020 election rather than addressing the issues at hand.\n\nIn response, Pelosi issued a statement anticipating and rejecting the concessions before they were made. She described the proposals as \"a non-starter\" and \"a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives.\"\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer called the President's offer \"not a compromise but more hostage taking.\" The Democrats have maintained their stance that they will not negotiate until the government is reopened.\n\nThe federal budget funding must be agreed upon by both parties, as the Democrats now control the House, while Trump's Republicans still have a majority in the Senate. Opinion polls suggest most Americans blame Trump more than the Democrats for the shutdown.\n\nThe shutdown's impact is being felt acutely by the more than 800,000 federal employees who have been going unpaid since 22 December. Over 1,500 appeals have been set up by them on crowdfunding site GoFundMe, seeking financial assistance to pay rent or feed and clothe their children.\n\nAs the shutdown enters its fifth week, the President's move may put pressure on his opponents to return to the negotiating table, but they still feel they have the upper hand. Unless the situation changes or the President backs down, the shutdown will continue.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Increases Seasonal Worker Visas by 30,000 for Summer\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014The Trump administration has decided to allow an additional 30,000 seasonal workers to return to the U.S. this summer, a move that reflects internal tensions within the White House regarding legal immigration. The decision, which is higher than the initially expected 15,000 visas, was cleared last week by the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.\n\nThe H-2B visas, which are issued to foreign workers who have held them in the past, are used by various industries such as landscaping, fisheries, county fairs, holiday resorts, and even President Trump's own golf and beach clubs to fill lower-skilled jobs that they claim cannot be filled by American workers. The annual cap for these visas is 66,000, with 33,000 allocated for summer and 33,000 for winter, and demand often exceeds the supply.\n\nIn 2017, half of all H-2B visas were granted to agricultural and horticultural industries, according to the most recent U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data on approvals. Building and construction, forestry and logging, food services and handlers, helpers, and laborers accounted for most of the rest.\n\nThe rule comes amid an ongoing immigration debate within the administration, with some advocating for relaxed rules to facilitate growth in a tight job market, and others pushing for stricter immigration policies to prevent foreign workers from undercutting American wages. The group NumbersUSA, which supports immigration restrictions, launched a cable-TV ad campaign in late April in response to the administration's plans for more H-2B visas.\n\nThe administration has also been investigating companies seen as discriminating against American workers in favor of temporary workers, through the Protecting U.S. Workers Initiative, housed in the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. The initiative has reached settlements with several companies for failing to follow all the steps required of the H-2B program.\n\nThe administration's decision to increase the number of H-2B visas has divided Congress, with some members expressing concerns about the impact on both immigrant and American workers. The debate over low-skilled and high-skilled foreign labor continues to be a contentious issue in Washington.",
    " Title: The Columbia Journalism Review Challenges Media's Approach to Reporting on Presidential Truthfulness\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Columbia Journalism Review, a long-standing authority on journalistic practices, has taken a critical stance on the media's approach to reporting on the truthfulness of a president, specifically in relation to the current administration. The Review questions the strategy of labeling a president as a liar without explicitly doing so, citing the New York Times' recent headlines as an example.\n\nThe Review's critique revolves around the Times' headline, \"Trump Falsely Says Times Made Up Source in Report on Korea Summit Meeting,\" and other similar attempts to downplay President Trump's commitment to truth. The Review highlights the ongoing debate on social media platforms, such as Twitter, regarding the President's veracity.\n\nThe Review points to a tweet by White House Reporter Maggie Haberman, who stated, \"Trump told two demonstrable falsehoods this AM,\" as an instance of this journalistic approach. The Review argues that this strategy has sparked a heated discussion on the matter, with some Twitter users finding Haberman's charge too mild.\n\nThe Review also mentions the Times' headline from May 28, \"He Uses Conspiracy Theories to Erode Trust,\" as another example of this journalistic approach. The Review questions the effectiveness of this strategy, suggesting that it may be undermining the media's status in the 21st century and deepening national disarray by abandoning journalistic standards.\n\nThe Review argues that reporters and editors should not have the right or duty to expose the president as a liar. Instead, they should present facts and asseverations that contradict the president's statements, allowing the White House to respond and leaving the interpretation to the public. The Review suggests that this approach fosters a more informed and engaged public, rather than leading them by the nose.\n\nThe Review's critique raises questions about the role of the media in a democratic society and the potential consequences of the media's approach to reporting on a president's truthfulness. The Review's argument suggests a need for a more nuanced and fact-based approach to reporting, one that allows the public to make informed decisions without the media's overt bias or judgment.\n\nWilliam Murchison, a journalist and author, recently wrote a book about moral restoration and is the Radford Distinguished Professor of Journalism at Baylor University. His work highlights the importance of trust in a free society and the potential consequences of the media's angry judgmentalism and love of crying \"Liar!\" on the future of American democracy.",
    " Title: Christine Hallquist Makes History as First Transgender Candidate to Win Major Party's Nomination for Governor\n\nIn a significant milestone for LGBTQ representation in politics, Christine Hallquist has emerged victorious in Tuesday's primary, becoming the first transgender individual to secure a major political party's nomination for the position of governor.\n\nHallquist, a 62-year-old Vermont resident, has garnered the support of The Victory Fund, a political action committee that champions LGBTQ candidates nationwide. However, Hallquist emphasizes that her platform, which encompasses higher wages for state workers, improved healthcare, and enhanced education, is the primary focus of her campaign.\n\n\"Vermonters are going to elect me on my platform,\" Hallquist stated. \"They are not going to elect me because of the fact that I'm transgender\u2014that's the reality.\" She further acknowledged the historical significance of her potential victory, stating, \"Nationwide, it's significant, the first transgender governor. It is pioneering.\"\n\nElliot Imse, communications director for The Victory Fund, commended Hallquist's openness and authenticity, stating, \"Because she is open and authentic about the fact that she is transgender, that immediately takes away all the questions, all the whispers, and instead allows people to focus on her personality and what she wants to do.\"\n\nHallquist relocated to Vermont in 1976 and joined the Vermont Electric Co-operative in 1998, eventually becoming CEO in 2005. She publicly transitioned from male to female in 2015, allowing news organizations to document her transformation. This year, she resigned from her position at the co-op to pursue a career in politics, citing Governor Phil Scott's perceived disregard for the interests of rural Vermonters.\n\nIn the primary, Hallquist defeated environmental activist James Ehlers, dance festival organizer Brenda Siegel, and 14-year-old Ethan Sonneborn, who made it onto the ticket due to a state law loophole that does not require candidates to be of voting age. If successful in November, Hallquist would become the nation's first transgender governor.\n\nThe upcoming November elections are expected to see a record number of LGBT candidates running for state and federal offices, with approximately 200 candidates anticipated, according to The Victory Fund. This includes Alexandra Chandler, Massachusetts' first openly transgender candidate for Congress, and Kim Coco Iwamoto, who could become Hawaii's first transgender lieutenant governor if elected. Both Chandler and Iwamoto, like Hallquist, are Democrats.",
    " Title: U.S. Natural Gas Exporter Excelerate Energy Negotiates Long-term Contracts for Global Export\n\nArticle:\n\nExcelerate Energy, a Texas-based natural gas exporter with significant backing from billionaire George B. Kaiser, is in negotiations with several foreign companies to secure long-term contracts for shipping natural gas abroad. The company anticipates signing agreements by early 2023, with the first shipments departing from the U.S. coast by 2017.\n\nRob Bryngelson, the 44-year-old CEO of Excelerate Energy, expressed optimism about the potential for the U.S. to capitalize on high global market prices. \"There's so much potential for the U.S. to take advantage of high prices in global markets,\" he said. \"We've got to capitalize while we can.\"\n\nWith 15 other export projects currently under review by the Energy Department, the U.S. could soon become the world's second-largest natural gas exporter, trailing only Russia, which maintains its position as the largest seller due to long-term contracts with energy buyers across Europe and beyond.\n\nThe International Energy Agency predicts that demand for natural gas will increase by 50% over the next 20 years, with most growth coming from emerging markets like India and China, which rely heavily on energy imports to support their economies.\n\nHowever, obstacles remain. Domestic consumers of natural gas, such as the petrochemicals industry, are concerned that allowing energy companies to export natural gas could lead to higher domestic prices due to record-low prices currently in the U.S. Politicians also express concerns about the impact of exports on the country's energy security.\n\nRoger Ihne, a principal in the energy practice of the consultancy Deloitte in Houston, noted, \"People are struggling to decide what to do with this energy gift.\"\n\nThe abundance of natural gas in the U.S. places the country at the center of the increasingly globalized natural gas market. Unlike the oil industry, which relies on a few global benchmark prices, the natural gas sector was traditionally a regional business. Prices still vary significantly among continents, and most producers depend on vast pipeline networks to supply local customers like energy utilities and industrial companies.\n\nTechnology is changing how business is done in the natural gas sector. This includes the extraction of natural gas via hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and the transportation of the fuel over long distances. By converting their product to liquefied natural gas (L.N.G.), natural gas suppliers can ship overseas in large tankers rather than relying on decades-old pipelines, which often run through politically unstable countries.\n\nWith the potential to ship natural gas anywhere in the world, energy companies are connecting regional natural gas markets to a greater extent than ever before. Analysts say producers can hunt for the highest price across different continents before deciding where to ship the gas.\n\nFor example, Qatar, the world's largest L.N.G. exporter, has shifted supplies from its European customers to new clients in Asia due to reduced demand in Europe as a result of economic problems. In Asia, political decisions, such as Japan's move to close its remaining nuclear power plants after the Fukushima reactor disaster, have increased demand for L.N.G. imports. This year, Cheniere Energy, a Houston energy firm, signed a 20-year deal with the Korea Gas Corporation to ship natural gas to South Korea beginning in 2017. Cheniere, which plans to export from Louisiana, also has a long-term contract with GAIL India, the country's largest natural gas distributor.\n\nTeri Viswanath, a commodity strategist at the French bank BNP Paribas in New York, noted, \"Asian companies are out in front in signing natural gas contracts. For countries like China, the tremendous domestic demand ensures it will always be an importer.\"\n\nStronger ties within the natural gas industry are also bringing international energy companies to America. By acquiring stakes in American energy projects, analysts say, foreign firms are seeking access to the country's vast untapped resources.\n\nIn early October, Golden Pass Products, a venture whose majority owner is the state-owned Qatar Petroleum International, was granted a license to export liquefied natural gas from a proposed site in Texas. The British energy company BG Group, which owns shale gas deposits from Texas to New York, also plans to ship American natural gas from its operations in Louisiana.\n\nDespite the multibillion-dollar investments, changes are not expected to happen overnight. Building L.N.G. terminals, for example, can take years. And many utilities, particularly in Europe and Asia, are locked into contracts with existing natural gas producers that could limit the opportunities for new entrants like American companies.\n\nYet the expansion of the natural gas industry in the U.S. and elsewhere, including in East Africa and South America, is expected to transform the sector over the next 20 years.\n\n\"We still have regional markets, but they are becoming more tied together with each successive year,\" said Joseph A. Stanislaw, a founder of the consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates.",
    " Title: The Decline of War and Peace Advocacy Organizations: A Shift in Focus from National Security\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the years following the 2008 election, a significant change has been observed in the landscape of advocacy organizations, particularly those focused on war and peace issues. The once-robust network of groups advocating for national security has seen a decline, with many organizations shifting their focus to other topics.\n\nThis shift is particularly noticeable on the right, where groups that were once prominent in providing political cover for interventionist politicians have all but disappeared. The absence of these organizations is a reflection of the political aftermath of the Iraq War and the rise of a more libertarian-leaning brand of conservatism, which prioritizes domestic issues over foreign policy.\n\nOne of the most prominent groups, Freedom's Watch, which spent millions of dollars during the 2008 campaign to rally support for the Iraq War, disbanded following President Barack Obama's election. The conservative veterans' advocacy organization Vets for Freedom has also become dormant, with the last video on its website dating back to 2010. Keep America Safe, a hawkish group founded in 2009 by Liz Cheney and others, closed its doors ahead of Cheney's decision to run for Senate in Wyoming.\n\nAri Fleischer, a former Bush White House press secretary and one of the founders of Freedom's Watch, stated that there is currently no standing entity dedicated to supporting aggressive foreign and military policy. Fleischer, who supports military action in Syria, noted that Freedom's Watch was intended to continue its work post-Iraq, but ultimately became an organization with a \"one-time mission.\"\n\nPete Hegseth, the former head of Vets for Freedom, commented that the Syria issue does not lend itself to sharp partisan battle lines. Hegseth, who now leads the nonprofit group Concerned Veterans for America, stated that he supports \"limited action that shows red lines matter\" in Syria, but does not expect substantial pro-intervention advocacy from outside groups.\n\nThe anti-war side of the advocacy world has also slowed down. Democratic-leaning groups that ran ads defending opposition to the Iraq War have shifted their focus to domestic issues. The liberal Americans United for Change, which aired ads during the 2008 cycle pressuring Republican lawmakers to break ranks on Iraq, has Syria not on its current agenda. Brad Woodhouse, the president of Americans United for Change, stated that the group is currently busy with Obamacare and the upcoming budget fight.\n\nThis decline in the number and activity of advocacy organizations focused on war and peace issues may present a challenge for lawmakers as they weigh the prospect of potential military action in Syria. With the public strongly opposed to military intervention and no apparent infrastructure in place to change public opinion, the political landscape for military action in Syria appears daunting.",
    " Title: Lawmakers Propose Firearm and Ammunition Taxes as Part of Broader Gun Control Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of high-profile mass shootings, such as the Newtown school shooting, lawmakers at both the state and federal levels are considering new taxes on firearms and ammunition as part of a broader effort to tighten gun control regulations. The proposed taxes range from a 5 percent tax on firearms in New Jersey to a 50 percent tax on ammunition in Maryland.\n\nThese taxes, similar to so-called \"sin taxes\" on items like cigarettes, serve a dual purpose: deterring buyers and generating revenue for favored programs, such as mental health services, police training, and victims' treatment. However, firearms groups argue that a \"sin tax\" on firearms unfairly penalizes law-abiding gun owners.\n\nLawrence Keane, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, stated, \"If anything, gun owners ought to be getting a tax rebate for helping reduce crime.\" He further argued that the purpose of the taxes is to \"frustrate and limit the exercise of the Second Amendment.\"\n\nWhile some revenue from these taxes and fees would go to victims' services, Keane noted that those paying the tax are not typically responsible for gun crime. \"We're obviously extremely opposed to trying to tax the lawful exercise of the Second Amendment rights by law-abiding Americans,\" he said.\n\nAt the federal level, Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.) has proposed a bill that would impose a 10 percent tax on \"any concealable\" firearm, with the revenue used to fund a national gun buyback program. At the state level, California state Rep. Roger Dickinson recently introduced a bill to impose a 5-cent tax on every bullet.\n\nSimilar measures have been introduced in several other states, including a 25 percent sales tax on ammunition and firearms in Massachusetts, a 50 percent tax on ammo and an annual $25 gun registration fee in Maryland, and a proposed $25 per gun sales tax and a 2-cent tax for every round of ammunition in Nevada.\n\nThe tax proposals are part of a broader campaign by pro-gun control lawmakers to restrict firearms. While some states, such as Colorado, have aggressively pursued new gun regulations, the movement on Capitol Hill has been more restrained. President Obama, who has been largely silent on the gun control issue since initiating legislative efforts, is expected to address the topic during a speech to supporters and donors in Washington on Wednesday.",
    " Title: Trump Defends Soleimani Strike, Ties Iraq Instability to Iran's Influence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Friday, President Donald Trump defended the U.S. airstrike that killed Iran's top military commander, Qassem Soleimani, and linked the unstable situation in Iraq to Iran's growing influence in the region.\n\nTrump asserted that Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' elite Quds Force, was responsible for the deaths of thousands of American soldiers over the years and had been plotting to kill many more. He also claimed that Soleimani was \"directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people,\" including the recent large number of protesters killed in Iran itself.\n\nThe president argued that the people of Iraq do not wish to be dominated and controlled by Iran, but ultimately, that is their choice. He stated that over the last 15 years, Iran has gained more and more control over Iraq, and the people of Iraq are not happy with that situation.\n\nTrump's tweets came after the U.S. launched air strikes at Baghdad's airport, which killed Soleimani and several others. The airstrike has received applause from Republicans, but it has left much of the world on edge, and Iran has vowed revenge.\n\nThe State Department urged U.S. citizens to leave Iraq immediately and advised that American citizens \"should not approach\" the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. The Pentagon confirmed that the president had ordered the strike against Soleimani. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that the move \"saved American lives.\"\n\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, called Soleimani's death \"bitter\" but vowed that life would be \"more bitter for the murderers and criminals.\" Foreign Minister Javad Zarif described the strike against Soleimani as an \"act of international terrorism\" and a \"foolish escalation.\"\n\nThe move marked a significant escalation in Trump's widening confrontation with Iran and stoked fears about the potential for destabilizing consequences in the region. In a sign of the immediate ramifications, the U.S. Embassy in Iraq urged Americans to immediately leave the country.\n\nDemocrats have criticized Trump for not giving Congress proper notification of the strike and warned of the potential for significant and debilitating consequences. The White House and Trump, who is at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., had been relatively quiet about the decision until Friday. Late Thursday, shortly before the Pentagon statement was issued, the president tweeted an image of an American flag without any text. Earlier Friday, Trump also retweeted a number of accounts referencing the strike and wrote cryptically that Iran \"never won a war, but never lost a negotiation.\"",
    " Title: Katie Couric Accused of Deceptive Editing in Second Documentary Amid Ongoing Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nJust one week after Katie Couric took responsibility for a deceptive edit in an interview with pro-gun activists, she is now facing accusations of deceptively editing another film, \"Fed Up.\" According to reports by the Washington Free Beacon and WND, Couric is said to have edited the documentary to embarrass individuals who were interviewed.\n\n\"Fed Up\" examines the issue of obesity and the food industry. The film includes two interviews with figures who hold viewpoints counter to the narrative of the film, and sources say both interviews include at least one misleading or deceptive edit intended to embarrass the interviewee.\n\nOne of the interviewees, Dr. David Allison, director of the Nutrition Obesity Research Center, told the Washington Free Beacon that Couric, the producer of the film, edited the interview to embarrass him. Allison said he had a brief discussion with Couric about whether sugary drinks exacerbate America's obesity problem more than other foods. Couric reportedly questioned Allison about the science behind his claims, and he asked for a moment to \"get his thoughts together\" because she had specifically requested that all his answers be in layman terms.\n\nIn a clip of the interview, Couric responds to Allison's on-camera request with, \"OK.\" However, the cameras continued rolling, and Allison can be seen sitting silently for nearly 10 seconds before the documentary cuts to the next interviewee. After those seven seconds passed, Allison says, he answered Couric's question.\n\n\"I had what I thought was a very cogent answer,\" he said. \"Of course I gave an answer. I gave an answer to every question she asked me in a 90-minute interview that was a barrage of questions. And out of a 90-minute interview, she chose to show the approximately 10 seconds when I paused and said, 'Let me collect my thoughts.'\"\n\nAnother example of deceptive editing involves Stephanie Soechtig, the director of \"Fed Up,\" and Lisa Gable, a spokeswoman for the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation. Sources told the Free Beacon that Soechtig's voice was deceptively edited to embarrass Gable. Soechtig and Gable talked about whether stores would consider removing food products from shelves. At one point, Soechtig can be heard saying Gable is avoiding the question, and Gable is seen sitting silently for around three seconds.\n\n\"She is badgered about companies' willingness to reformulate their products, to which the producer answers, 'It feels like you're avoiding the question,'\" an industry source told the Free Beacon. \"That response from the producer didn't actually follow that particular exchange and was edited to make it look like that was how their conversation actually went.\"\n\nWatch the \"Fed Up\" clip of the interview with Dr. Allison and Lisa Gable.\n\nThe new accusations surface only one week after Couric accepted blame for deceptively editing the \"Under the Gun\" documentary. Couric wrote on the website of \"Under the Gun\" about the edit:\n\n\"I take responsibility for a decision that misrepresented an exchange I had with members of the Virginia Citizens Defense League (VCDL). My question to the VCDL regarding the ability of convicted felons and those on the terror watch list to legally obtain a gun, was followed by an extended pause, making the participants appear to be speechless. When I screened an early version of the film with the director, Stephanie Soechtig, I questioned her and the editor about the pause and was told that a 'beat' was added for, as she described it, 'dramatic effect,' to give the audience a moment to consider the question. When VCDL members recently pointed out that they had in fact immediately answered this question, I went back and reviewed it and agree that those eight seconds do not accurately represent their response.\"\n\nUpon hearing news of the \"Under the Gun\" edit, radio host Rush Limbaugh came down harshly on Couric, whom he described as \"not a nice person.\"\n\n\"It was a totally fake and phony edit, and she's now taking responsibility for it because the pressure obviously got to be so intense,\" Limbaugh said. \"I bet you there will not be a single story on how many sponsors she's lost because of this. Not a single one. Nor will there be any stories on how many sponsors lost here and wanted to come back and we said 'no' to. There won't be any coverage like that at all, cause that's not the point of the coverage.\"\n\nSoechtig, the film's director, released a statement trying to explain why she inserted the long pause of nothingness: \"There are a wide range of views expressed in the film. My intention was to provide a pause for the viewer to have a moment to consider this important question before presenting the facts on Americans' opinions on background checks. I never intended to make anyone look bad and I apologize if anyone felt that way.\"\n\nAlthough the documentary cut out the responses, the film's website is now providing the transcript, showing the responses were immediate and substantive.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Exchange Tariff Threats: A Precursor to a Potential Trade War?\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. and China have engaged in a series of tit-for-tat tariff threats this week, with the world's two largest economies testing each other's resolve without yet entering into a full-blown trade war. The exchange of threats has sent the stock market into wild swings, causing investors to fear a potential trade war.\n\nOn Wednesday, China released a list of $50 billion worth of U.S. products it plans to target with tariffs, in response to the Trump administration's threat to increase taxes on 1,300 of China's high-tech imports also worth about $50 billion. This is the second round of tariff threats between the two nations this week.\n\nThe 106 products on China's new tariffs list target industries that do significant business in China and are politically significant for President Trump, including agriculture and other industries that dominate regions of the country that make up the president's political base. Beijing proposed a 25 percent tariff on 106 products, including soybeans, pork, cranberries, whiskey, automobiles, airplanes, and plastic.\n\nPresident Trump has made good on a top campaign promise to crack down on China's trade abuses, with the tariffs and other moves targeting technology aimed at China's theft of American intellectual property. \"We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We can not let this continue!\" Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nHowever, a full-blown trade war is not inevitable, and it is more likely that President Trump will make a deal, according to Denise Bode, a tax and trade analyst at a Washington law firm. \"It is more the beginning stages of a major reset in a trade relationship between China and the United States,\" Ms. Bode said. \"Obviously, it is a strong ploy, but a lot of our other efforts have not worked [and] everybody is at the table now.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones industrial average erased early losses and rallied higher on Wednesday as investors hedged their bets on the likelihood of an all-out U.S.-China trade war. The S&P 500 index added 14 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,628 as of 2:30 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow climbed 86 points, or 0.4 percent, to 24,120. The Nasdaq composite rose 49 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,990. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gained 10 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,522.\n\nIn issuing its hit list, Beijing blamed the U.S. for picking a fight. \"It must be said, we have been forced into taking this action,\" said Wang Shouwen, China's deputy commerce minister. \"Our action is restrained.\" The value of the U.S. products was virtually identical to the $50 billion in Chinese high-tech products identified for tariffs on a list that the Trump administration rolled out late Tuesday. Neither list will go into immediate effect. The U.S. tariffs require a monthslong comment and review process, and China said it, too, is moving slowly.\n\nLarry Kudlow, director of the president's National Economic Council, tried to tamp down concerns about a trade war, saying a negotiated resolution is more likely. \"He wants to solve this with the least amount of pain,\" Mr. Kudlow told reporters at the White House. \"I would take the president seriously on this tariffs issue. There are carrots and sticks in life.\"\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, said he agreed with getting tough with China but Mr. Trump's strategy puts his constituents in the crosshairs. \"Farmers and ranchers shouldn't be expected to bear the brunt of retaliation for the entire country. It's not fair, and it doesn't make economic sense,\" Mr. Grassley said. \"The administration knew that if it imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, China would retaliate against U.S. agriculture. I warned President Trump as much in a White House meeting in February. Today shows that's exactly what happened.\"\n\nMr. Grassley said the federal government has a responsibility to mitigate damages caused by trade policies, and he vowed to push the issue in the Senate. The 1,300 Chinese products on the U.S. tariff list included aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. Beijing had threatened to retaliate when Mr. Trump announced pending tariffs last month. China previously responded with a list of more than 120 U.S. items worth about $3 billion to hit with an import tax after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum from all countries, though exemptions were later offered to Mexico, Canada, South Korea, and other major importers of those metals.",
    " Title: President Trump Calls for Potential Government Shutdown in September to Address Legislative Impasse\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Tuesday, President Donald Trump suggested a potential government shutdown in September as a means to address the ongoing legislative impasse in Congress. The President expressed frustration with the need for 60 votes in the Senate due to the filibuster, stating that either more Republican Senators need to be elected in 2018 or the rules need to be changed to a 51% majority.\n\nTrump's comments appear to reflect his dissatisfaction with the spending deal Congress is poised to approve this week, which would fund the government through September and represents the first major bipartisan legislation of Trump's presidency. The deal, however, does not include funding for Trump\u2019s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border or include language stripping federal money from so-called sanctuary cities, both of which the White House demanded at the outset of negotiations.\n\nThe President's tweets come amid reports that Democrats have won most of the battles surrounding the bill, with several media accounts suggesting that Trump and the White House were losers in the negotiations. However, during a ceremony honoring the Air Force Academy football team, Trump said, \"this bill is a clear win for the American people.\"\n\nWhite House budget director Mick Mulvaney expressed frustration with the analysis that Trump lost in the negotiations during a press briefing after Trump's remarks. Mulvaney argued that the current deal running through September was a White House victory because Democrats were determined to cause a shutdown that would hurt Trump.\n\nThe President's comments are likely to irk top Republican lawmakers, who have been frustrated by Trump's repeated attempts to intervene in the legislative process. However, if GOP lawmakers are frustrated with Trump, the feeling may be mutual, as the businessman-turned-president has vented frustration with the slow pace of work on Capitol Hill.\n\nSenator John Cornyn, a top Republican, did not mention the President or his tweets, but his remarks about the importance of avoiding a shutdown and the strength of the filibuster were notable coming shortly after Trump's tweets. \"We were elected to govern,\" Cornyn said. \"Yes, governing is hard. It's hard by design.... But that's the way our founding fathers designed our constitutional system.\"",
    " Title: CIA Assessment Suggests Saudi Crown Prince Ordered Khashoggi Killing, Trump Maintains Cautious Stance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, President Donald Trump has reportedly been briefed by the CIA and his top diplomat about the intelligence agency's assessment regarding the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. According to a U.S. official, the CIA has intelligence that substantiates an assessment that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing. However, the official declined to specify the confidence level of the CIA's assessment.\n\nA separate U.S. official stated on Friday that U.S. intelligence has \"high confidence\" in its assessment that bin Salman was involved in the killing, an assessment based on an understanding of how Saudi Arabia operates. Neither official indicated that there is direct evidence linking bin Salman to the killing on the day of the incident.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Trump spoke with CIA Director Gina Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo while en route to California to assess wildfire damage. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders provided no additional details but stated that the president has confidence in the CIA.\n\nBefore departing the White House, Mr. Trump told reporters that, as of then, the crown prince had \"not played a role\" in the killing. He added, \"We're going to have to find out what they have to say.\"\n\nIn his remarks, the president emphasized Saudi Arabia's role as a significant ally in terms of job creation and economic development. He stated, \"I have to take a lot of things into consideration\" when deciding what measures to take against the kingdom.\n\nThe intelligence agencies' conclusion could strengthen efforts in Congress to impose harsher punitive measures on the close U.S. ally for the killing. The Trump administration penalized 17 Saudi officials this past week for their alleged role in the killing, but American lawmakers have called for the administration to curtail arms sales to Saudi Arabia or take other severe punitive measures.\n\nSaudi Arabia's top diplomat has denied any involvement of the crown prince in the killing. Vice President Mike Pence, while at a summit of Pacific Rim nations in Papua New Guinea, declined to comment on \"classified information.\" He did, however, state that the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was an atrocity and an affront to a free and independent press.\n\nKhashoggi, a Saudi national residing in the United States, was a columnist for The Washington Post and often criticized the royal family. He was killed on October 2 at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul while seeking marriage documents. Turkish and Saudi authorities have stated that he was killed inside the consulate by a team from the kingdom.\n\nThis past week, U.S. intelligence officials briefed members of the Senate and House intelligence committees, and the Treasury Department announced economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials suspected of being responsible or complicit in the killing. Additionally, the top prosecutor in Saudi Arabia announced he will seek the death penalty against five men suspected in the killing.\n\nMr. Trump has described the killing as a botched operation carried out poorly and has stated that the cover-up was one of the worst in history. However, he has been reluctant to cut off arms sales to the kingdom and has expressed reluctance to antagonize the Saudi rulers, considering them vital allies in his Middle East agenda.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Rescinds DAPA Program, Leaves DACA Intact for Now\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a move that fulfills part of President Donald Trump's campaign promises, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has rescinded a 2014 memo that shielded millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation, but has left intact the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly announced late Thursday that, after consulting with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, he is rescinding an Obama-era memorandum that allowed immigrants to remain in the United States under certain conditions. The rescinded memo created a program that protected undocumented immigrants from deportation if they have a child who is a U.S. citizen or lawful resident.\n\nThe program, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), was never implemented because it was challenged in court by 26 states and was put on hold by federal courts. The DHS decision to rescind the memo came ahead of a court-ordered deadline to resolve the case.\n\nKelly said in a news release that he decided to rescind the memo because \"there is no credible path forward\" to litigate the policy. The decision fulfills part of a campaign promise by Trump, who vowed to overturn two of Obama's memos on illegal immigration.\n\nHowever, Kelly said the decision would not impact an Obama program created in 2012 that granted reprieves from deportation to nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children. The terms of that program, known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), will not change, Kelly said.\n\nThe rescinded program provided expanded work authorization for recipients under DACA. But so-called Dreamers \"who were issued three-year extensions before the district court's injunction will not be affected and will be eligible to seek a two-year extension upon their expiration,\" the news release said. \"No work permits will be terminated prior to their current expiration dates.\"\n\nAdvocates for undocumented immigrants warned that while Kelly left the DACA program in place for now, there's nothing to keep the Trump administration from reversing it in the future.\n\n\"This memo and the response from the White House is not a permanent promise to protect [DACA],\" said Greisa Martinez Rosas, advocacy director for United We Dream, which identifies itself as the largest immigrant youth-led organization in the nation. \"The DACA program still stands, but it's vulnerable.\"\n\nAdvocacy groups also were incensed that the Trump administration rescinded the parental program on the fifth anniversary of DACA. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., praised Kelly's decision to rescind the DAPA program, calling it \"a deeply irresponsible policy from the start.\"\n\n\"It essentially said to illegal immigrants that we wouldn't enforce our laws and encouraged them to risk their lives in coming to the United States,\" Cotton said. \"It was also a blatant attempt by the president to circumvent Congress that the courts swiftly shut down. I'm glad to see Secretary Kelly take it off the books. Such a high-handed fiat deserves nothing less than to be rescinded in full.\"\n\nRep. Don Beyer, D-Va., blasted Kelly's decision, noting that it came as Democrats and Republicans had put aside partisanship and gathered for the Congressional Baseball Game following the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., during a practice session early Wednesday.\n\n\"Before the game had even finished, the Trump administration shattered this spirit of good feelings by announcing the rescission of the DAPA program,\" Beyer said. Beyer took some comfort in noting that the DACA program would remain in place, but said that the need for comprehensive immigration reform giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship \"has never been more urgent.\"",
    " Title: Romney Breaks with GOP on Minimum Wage, Endorses Increase\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from many of his fellow Republicans, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney has expressed support for an increase in the minimum wage. During an interview on \"Morning Joe\" on Thursday, Romney stated, \"I, for instance, as you know, part company with many of the conservatives in my party on the issue of the minimum wage. I think we ought to raise it.\"\n\nRomney's stance contrasts with Senate Republicans' recent rejection of a bill that would have raised the minimum wage to $10.10. In the past, former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, both of whom also ran for the Republican nomination in 2012, have also expressed support for an increase in the minimum wage.\n\nDuring the wide-ranging interview, Romney reiterated that he is not running for president in 2016. He praised several potential Republican presidential candidates, including his 2012 running mate, Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI), New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and Ohio Senator Rob Portman, among others. Romney also mentioned New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez as a potential female candidate, praising her \"great potential and leadership.\"\n\nRomney also criticized Hillary Clinton, who is expected to be the presumptive front-runner for the Democrats if she chooses to run in 2016. He criticized Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, stating that \"the four years that she served as secretary of state were not good years for the United States of America abroad.\" He added that Clinton's record as Secretary of State would \"raise a lot of questions about her capacity to actually accomplish things of significance, particularly on foreign soil.\"\n\nIn addition, Romney appeared to condone fundraising efforts by the National Republican Congressional Committee and National Republican Senatorial Committee that invoked the September 2012 attacks in Benghazi. When asked about fundraising off the issue, Romney responded by saying that, without a GOP majority in the House, there would have been no investigations into Benghazi or the IRS.",
    " Title: America Commemorates 18th Anniversary of 9/11: Tributes, Reflections, and Political Undercurrents\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a solemn ceremony on Wednesday, America marked the 18th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks, with tributes, moments of silence, and political undercurrents.\n\nIn New York City, the Tribute in Light, consisting of two parallel light beams, illuminated the sky to represent the fallen Twin Towers. The names of the nearly 3,000 people who lost their lives were solemnly read at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. Moments of silence marked the impact times of the Ground Zero planes, the time when each tower collapsed, and the moments when planes struck the Pentagon and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.\n\nAt the ceremony, Mary Ann Marino, whose son, firefighter Kenneth Marino, was among the victims, read some of the names. The first moment of silence was observed at 8:46 a.m. EDT to mark the time when American Airlines Flight 11, en route to Los Angeles from Boston, crashed into the north face of the World Trade Center's North Tower.\n\nIn Shanksville, Vice President Mike Pence lauded the heroes from United Airlines Flight 93, whose passengers fought with hijackers intent on crashing into the U.S. Capitol. The memory of those who died is \"carved into the hearts and memories of the American people,\" Pence said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump led a remembrance on the South Lawn of the White House, speaking at a ceremony at the Pentagon, where 184 people were killed 18 years ago. Trump blamed the Taliban for the cancellation of peace talks to try to end the war that started in Afghanistan shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nIn Michigan, an anti-Muslim event was canceled amid condemnation from politicians and organizations. The event, titled \"9/11 forgotten? Is Michigan surrendering to Islam?\", was set to host two speakers addressing topics such as \"How the interfaith movement is sabotaging America and the church\" and \"How Islam is destroying America from within.\"\n\nThe commemoration of the 9/11 anniversary serves as a reminder of the resilience of the American spirit and the enduring impact of the tragic events of that day. The nation continues to honor and remember the lives lost, and to strive for unity and understanding in the face of adversity.",
    " Title: Indiana Governor Mike Pence Defends \"Religious Freedom\" Law Amidst National Backlash\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" Indiana Governor Mike Pence defended the state's new \"Religious Freedom Restoration Act,\" stating that the controversy surrounding the law is due to \"a tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding.\"\n\nHowever, Pence declined to answer several direct questions about whether the measure could be used to discriminate against LGBT individuals. He also stated that he would not support legislation adding protections based on sexual orientation to Indiana's anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThe backlash against the law, signed into effect last week, has been intense. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest criticized Pence, stating, \"It should be easy for leaders in this country to stand up and say that it is wrong to discriminate against people just because of who they love.\"\n\nTech companies, including Apple and Salesforce.com, have voiced their disapproval, with Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeting, \"Apple is open for everyone. We are deeply disappointed in Indiana's new law.\"\n\nMayors of several major cities, including San Francisco and Seattle, have announced bans on public funds being spent for employee travel to Indiana. The mayors of these cities have also announced inspections of city contracts to see if any are with businesses located in Indiana.\n\nIndianapolis' mayor, Greg Ballard, condemned the new law, stating, \"We are a diverse city, and I want everyone who visits and lives in Indy to feel comfortable here. RFRA sends the wrong signal.\"\n\nThe NCAA, which is headquartered in Indianapolis and is set to host its men's basketball Final Four in the city this week, has expressed concern that the law could lead it to move events elsewhere in future years. The NBA, WNBA, and NFL have also issued critical statements.\n\nPopular culture figures, such as Miley Cyrus and M.C. Hammer, have weighed in on social media, with Cyrus calling Pence an \"a--hole\" and Hammer stating that Indiana's law is \"barbaric and inhumane.\"\n\nPence maintained that the law is about protecting the religious liberty of people of faith and families of faith, and that it is not a mistake to have signed the law. He noted that President Bill Clinton signed a similar law nationally, and then-state Sen. Barack Obama supported one in Illinois.\n\nHowever, Pence declined to answer several direct questions about whether the law would protect businesses that refuse service to LGBT individuals, citing that the law is not about disputes between individuals but about government overreach.\n\nLocal businesses have also expressed concern, with the CEO of Angie's List, who was also the campaign manager for Pence's Republican predecessor, stating that his company is halting its plans for a major expansion in Indianapolis.\n\nPence stated that he is open to legislative efforts to clarify the \"religious freedom\" law, though the state's Republican-dominated legislature has already rejected Democrats' push to amend it to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination.",
    " Title: The 2020 Presidential Race and the Challenge of Addressing Structural Inequality for African Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries move onto Nevada, South Carolina, and the Super Tuesday states, candidates are focusing their efforts on courting African American voters. However, many candidates' rhetoric is being met with skepticism as their records often contradict their promises.\n\nDonald Trump, the incumbent president, is attempting to appeal to black voters by highlighting the economy, the initial steps towards reducing mass incarceration, and the so-called \"opportunity zones.\" Yet, his history, marked by the infamous \"birther\" movement, the Charlottesville rally, his administration's efforts to erase Obama-era policies, and his racially charged political appeals, casts doubt on his sincerity.\n\nPete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Michael Bloomberg, among others, also face scrutiny for their records on race and policing. Buttigieg's tenure as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has been criticized by African American leaders for his handling of race and policing issues. Klobuchar, who positions herself as a moderate, has a harsh record as a prosecutor that limits her appeal. Bloomberg, with his resources, is trying to flood the zone, but his support for stop-and-frisk policies and his embrace of right-wing theories about the financial crisis have not endeared him to African American voters.\n\nJoe Biden is on an apparent apology tour, attempting to address concerns about his past actions and comments that have been perceived as racially insensitive.\n\nAfrican American voters are not easily swayed. They are acutely aware of the structural inequalities they face, including higher unemployment rates, lower wages, inadequate healthcare, unaffordable housing, and a biased criminal justice system. They seek the same things most Americans want, but they are discerning when it comes to politicians.\n\nThe absence of a leader prepared to address these issues as boldly and seriously as the Kerner Commission did 52 years ago is notable. The Kerner Commission, established by President Lyndon Johnson in response to the urban riots of the late 1960s, issued a stark warning: \"Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white\u2014separate and unequal.\"\n\nThe commission, chaired by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner, included representatives from both major parties, labor, the police, business, and civil rights groups. It offered a serious agenda to redress the maladies, including new jobs, integrated schools, daycare for children, higher wages, greater services, and more diverse and sensitive police forces.\n\nThe Kerner Report and Johnson's War on Poverty were overshadowed by the Vietnam War, which diverted resources and attention from domestic issues. The costs of the Vietnam War\u2014in money, lives, and political upheaval\u2014precluded any serious effort to address domestic problems.\n\nFifty years later, much has changed, yet many issues remain unresolved. Affirmative action has opened doors for some people of color, but de facto residential segregation persists. Inequality has grown more extreme, schools are more divided by class and race, and affordable housing is even less available. Structural racism still stains our criminal justice system.\n\nAs the 2020 presidential candidates campaign for African American votes, they will receive a hearing. We appreciate the attention and the gestures, but the Kerner Report set the standard for what a serious leader would champion. We'll see who comes close\u2014if anyone does\u2014to accepting that challenge.",
    " Title: Economic Uncertainty and Job Growth: A Look at the Current State of the U.S. Labor Market\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the year-end approaches, economists are expressing concerns about a potential slowdown in job creation if the U.S. government fails to reach a deficit reduction agreement. This could result in over $600 billion in government spending cuts and automatic tax increases in 2013, leading to a possible recession in the first half of the year and an increase in unemployment.\n\nEthan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, stated that while businesses seem to be hiring despite the political uncertainty in Washington, this could change quickly. He warned that if the budget impasse cannot be resolved this month, jobs growth will weaken early next year.\n\nDespite the addition of jobs by businesses and government in November, the labor force shrank by 350,000. This decrease can partly be attributed to baby boomers retiring, but a significant number of workers remain discouraged, causing them to drop out of the job market. The labor participation rate, which represents the portion of the adult population that is either employed or actively looking for work, remains low by historical standards.\n\nThe latest jobs report showed a notable point of weakness in the manufacturing sector, which lost 7,000 jobs in November. The demand for goods from Europe and other overseas markets has softened, and some manufacturing companies have held up spending due to the ongoing political standoff in Washington.\n\nOn a positive note, the construction sector lost 20,000 jobs in November, which could be a sign of Hurricane Sandy's impact. However, construction employment could increase in December as homeowners rebuild in the Northeast and as the housing sector continues to recover nationwide.\n\nRetailers added 53,000 jobs last month, more than triple the typical monthly rate in the last year. This increase was largely due to an early start of sales promotions and an early Thanksgiving, and job growth in the retail sector may decrease in December.\n\nThe percentage of long-term unemployed (those out of a job for more than 27 weeks) has decreased slightly, falling to 40.1% in November from 40.6% a month before. Younger workers, who have had significantly higher rates of unemployment since the recession, also seem to have improved in November. Unemployment among workers aged 20 to 24 fell to 12.7% in November from 13.2% in October, and among 25- to 34-year-olds it fell to 7.9% from 8.3%.\n\nWhile the unemployment rate among workers 55 and older held steady at 5.8%, the overall unemployment rate remains high, with the broad unemployment gauge dipping to 14.4% in November from 14.6% in October. The average hourly earnings rose 0.2% in November, and are up about 1.7% from a year earlier\u2014about half the annual rate of growth seen in 2007 before the recession hit, when unemployment was below 5%.\n\nThe ongoing political uncertainty in Washington, coupled with the slow pace of job growth, suggests that the U.S. labor market remains vulnerable. Consumer confidence, as measured by the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index, showed a marked drop in early December, reaching its lowest since August. The deterioration in consumer expectations was likely related to increased concerns regarding the political theater surrounding the \"fiscal cliff\" negotiations, according to Bricklin Dwyer, an economist with BNP Paribas.",
    " Title: Trump Ends Years of Birtherism, Acknowledges Obama's U.S. Birth\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, on Friday, acknowledged that President Barack Obama was indeed born in the United States. The statement came after five years of questioning Obama's citizenship on various media platforms.\n\nThe announcement was made during a campaign event at the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C., where Trump was 63 minutes late. The event, initially perceived as a potential address on the birther issue, turned out to be a campaign rally, with Trump focusing on other topics for the majority of the event.\n\nThe Republican nominee, in his statement, denied any connection between his campaign and the birther controversy, stating, \"Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy.\" However, this claim contradicts historical facts.\n\nTrump's statement came amid a media frenzy about his refusal to disavow his birtherism, despite his campaign manager and spokesperson claiming he believed Obama was born in the United States. The event was held in the gilded ballroom of the $212 million hotel at 1100 Pennsylvania Ave., which remains federal property.\n\nThe event was heavily attended by veterans, Medal of Honor winners, and former generals, with Trump focusing on his relationships with these individuals during his speech. He made no direct mention of the birther issue until the end of his speech, long after many cable networks had cut away from the stage, expressing frustration at being led there for no apparent reason.\n\nTrump's change of heart comes after Obama released his long-form birth certificate in 2011, eight years after he disclosed his birth announcement. For years, Obama's detractors have attempted to portray him as alien, with the birther movement being one of the most prominent examples.\n\nThe birther movement gained traction in 2008, with claims that Obama's mother was unable to fly in the late months of her pregnancy, and so he was born in Kenya. These claims were largely debunked, and Clinton did not push the rumors. However, Trump's public questioning of Obama's citizenship in 2011 is widely considered to have given the movement a significant boost.\n\nTrump's acknowledgment of Obama's U.S. birth comes as the polls are narrowing, and his campaign strategists' advice to act more diplomatically has proven effective. However, a few words on the subject may not be enough to erase years of questioning that have delighted racists throughout the country.",
    " Title: House Armed Services Committee Releases Bipartisan Report on Benghazi Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bipartisan report released today, the House Armed Services Committee has found that the White House failed to adequately comprehend or address the deteriorating security situation in Libya prior to the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. The report, which reflects the views of the committee's most senior members, also concludes that U.S. personnel in Benghazi were \"woefully vulnerable\" and that the Defense Department believed the violence was a terrorist attack \"nearly from the outset.\"\n\nThe 31-page report, authored by Chairman Buck McKeon (R-Calif.), Vice Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), and Rep. Martha Roby (R-Ala.), states that the White House failed to direct a change in military force posture, and there was no intelligence of a specific \"imminent\" threat in Libya. The Department of State, which has primary responsibility for diplomatic security, \"favored a reduction\" of Department of Defense security personnel in Libya before the attack.\n\nThe report also agrees with the administration that during the attack, military assets were not positioned to make a difference in the response, and there was no stand-down order issued by the administration to forces in Tripoli preparing to respond. However, the report states that there was no \"stand-down\" order issued to U.S. military personnel in Tripoli who sought to join the fight in Benghazi.\n\nDemocrats on the committee believe the report ends the controversy that there was any corruption in the aftermath of the attack. \"This report, produced by House Armed Services Committee Republicans, should finally bring an end to the politicization of the heinous attacks on brave Americans in Benghazi,\" ranking Democrat Adam Smith (D-Wash.) and Rep. Niki Tsongas (D-Mass.), the top Democrat on the committee's investigative subcommittee, wrote in a statement. \"All of these conclusions are counter to assertions and accusations leveled by a number of Republicans.\"\n\nThe report concludes that the U.S. military's response to the Benghazi attack was severely degraded because of the location and readiness posture of U.S. forces, and because of a lack of clarity about how the terrorist action was unfolding. \"There was no'stand down' order issued to U.S. military personnel in Tripoli who sought to join the fight in Benghazi,\" the report states.\n\nThe report also notes that the quick reaction force preparing to reinforce Americans was never ordered to stand down and would not have arrived in time to save any lives. The report states that the attack killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. It also triggered a firestorm of criticism accusing the Obama administration of covering up its response to the attack.",
    " Title: House Republicans and President Obama Remain Far Apart on Budget Priorities After White House Meeting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to bridge the partisan divide on Capitol Hill, President Barack Obama met with House Republicans on Wednesday, but the meeting, part of the White House's \"charm offensive,\" did little to narrow the gulf between the president and his chief adversaries.\n\nAfter nearly an hour and a half of discussion, House Speaker John Boehner thanked the president for coming but noted the challenges remaining on a host of issues, especially ones related to reducing the deficit.\n\n\"We know there are some very real differences between our two parties (on issues like) jobs, balancing the budget, and what do we do to get the economy moving again,\" Boehner said. \"Republicans want to balance the budget. The President does not. Republicans want to solve our long-term debt problem. The President does not. We want to unlock our energy resources to put more Americans back to work. The President does not.\"\n\nThe speaker added, \"But having said that, today was a good start, and I hope that these kinds of discussions can continue.\"\n\nRepublicans' top priority\u2014tackling federal spending and reining in record deficits\u2014came up early in the Republican conference meeting. Oklahoma Rep. Jim Lankford asked the first question, pressing the president to explain why he would not join House Republicans in their effort to balance the budget in a decade.\n\nObama, according to several Republicans, explained that he did not share that priority, an answer that many emphasized as they left the meeting. Georgia Rep. Paul Broun, a conservative who is running for the Senate, mentioned that exchange as he left, telling reporters, \"basically his whole talk was just a bunch of platitudes and no substance to it.\"\n\n\"He thought what was more important was that deficits fall below growth as a percentage of GDP\u2014certainly a laudable goal, but I think the federal government, like any business or any family, needs to work towards a balanced budget,\" Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, said afterward.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor gave a blunt assessment about the divide on fiscal issues, suggesting it could carry over to other issues.\n\n\"If the president wants to let our unwillingness to raise taxes get in the way, then we're not going to be able to set differences aside and focus on what we agree on,\" Cantor told reporters at the GOP leaders' news conference.\n\nWhen Lankford raised fiscal issues during the meeting, he also pointed out that the president's other meeting on Wednesday was with his political arm, Organizing for Action. Word of that meeting rankled many GOP members who suggested Obama was more concerned with political goals than working across the aisle.\n\n\"We know the president is going to speak before Organizing for Action tonight,\" Rep. Greg Walden, R-Oregon, who leads the House Republicans' campaign arm, told reporters as he left the meeting. \"We know he's made it clear that taking out the House is his big priority, and we know he's been on the never-ending campaign tour up to this point, so there's a trust factor.\"\n\nMindful of the House GOP undercurrent that Obama is chiefly focused on scoring political points, one source inside the meeting said the president addressed those concerns directly at the end of the meeting. This source told CNN that the president told GOP members that if he were only focused on the midterms, he would not be pushing immigration reform because that's not necessarily helpful for some members of his party. He said he would not push for entitlement reform because a lot of Democrats do not agree and are nervous about tackling such a politically explosive issue.\n\nHe told them that he runs the country, that he wants it to succeed, and that he looks around the room and sees other people who love their country. Obama said they have a moment and should seize it, according to this source.\n\nWalden did say the session helped build some trust, and it was a good opportunity to raise a wide spectrum of issues. He mentioned Israel as one area where both parties found some common ground.\n\nExiting the conference, House Budget Committee Chairman and former Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) said of the president: \"He did himself some good.\"\n\nSeveral members in the meeting said it helped open a dialogue but lamented that the session was only the second time the president had traveled up Pennsylvania Avenue to talk to House Republicans since he was elected.\n\n\"The president does not spend a lot of time working with members of Congress. He does not have to\u2014he's president of the United States\u2014but I think it's made his job a lot more difficult, and it's made our task a lot more difficult because there's very little communication,\" Florida Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart said after the meeting.\n\nCotton described the president's demeanor in the meeting as \"affable\" and said the various members who asked questions were \"very cordial and respectful.\"\n\nAccording to multiple GOP sources, conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington screened questions in advance and called on members after the president made opening remarks.\n\nRep. Michael Grimm of New York said the event had been peppered with occasional lighter moments such as speculation after word got around the room that the new pope was about to be announced.\n\n\"Anyone who thinks this president is anything but affable and pleasant when he's speaking with a group is just simply wrong. They have not met him,\" said Grimm. But he added he was waiting to see if the president would follow up his outreach with some bipartisan action.",
    " Title: \"Congress Pushes for 'Jobs' Bills as Unemployment Rate Remains Stagnant\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the latest unemployment report, which showed a minimal increase in job creation and an unchanged unemployment rate of 8.2 percent, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are intensifying their efforts to pass legislation aimed at creating or preserving jobs. Over the past 18 months, approximately 90 bills have been introduced, three times the number from the previous two-year congressional cycle and seven times more than the Congress before that.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, has announced that the Senate will move towards votes on a series of \"common-sense jobs bills\" this week. These bills include a small-business tax cut designed to incentivize hiring and promote payroll growth. Reid emphasized the need for lawmakers to prioritize job creation over political agendas, stating, \"Putting Americans back to work should be our top priority, not tea party politics or partisan maneuvering.\"\n\nHowever, job-creation policies, like many issues on Capitol Hill, are often entangled in partisan and political spin. The definition of a \"jobs bill\" is subjective, with Republicans characterizing the employment report as evidence that the jobs agenda of the Obama administration and the Democrat-controlled Congress has been unsuccessful. House Speaker John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, stated, \"Today's report shows the private sector clearly isn't 'doing fine' and that President Obama's policies have failed.\"\n\nRepublicans, who control the House, have criticized the Senate for failing to act on more than two dozen of their \"jobs\" bills that have passed their chamber. House GOP leaders plan to introduce legislation this summer to \"rein in job-crushing red tape,\" including a measure to continue tax cuts instituted during the administration of President George W. Bush that are set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nSome of the so-called \"jobs\" bills appear to be a stretch, such as the National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act, which does not specifically mention jobs but aims to develop domestic sources of strategically important minerals. The Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act, which has been indefinitely stalled in the Senate, is also labeled as a jobs bill by House GOP leadership. This bill aims to exempt \"farm dust\" from Clean Air Act regulations, a move that supporters argue would protect American farm jobs.\n\nA rare example of bipartisan support for a jobs bill was the massive bill that cleared Congress last month to fund federal transportation projects. The bill, which promises to save or create almost 3 million jobs, was nearly derailed due to a dispute over the proposed Keystone XL pipeline. The pipeline, which was ultimately left out of the bill, has become a frequent point of debate regarding so-called jobs bills, with GOP backers often citing tens of thousands of jobs as a potential outcome, a figure dismissed by opponents as excessively optimistic.\n\nLawmakers continue to label almost any legislation they support as a jobs bill, while also quick to label measures they dislike as job killers. The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, is a prime example, with Republicans arguing that it will force employers to lay off workers or close their businesses altogether. Representative Michele Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican and former presidential candidate, stated in late June that the \"No. 1 reason [small businesses] aren't hiring is because of Obamacare.\" President Obama, on the other hand, maintains that the health care law will lay the foundation for a stronger economy and create jobs.",
    " Title: Trump Advocates for Easing Coronavirus Restrictions by Easter, Contradicting Public Health Experts and State Governors\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed a desire to ease up on coronavirus-related restrictions in the United States within the next few weeks, a move that contradicts the advice of top public health experts and state governors on the front lines of the pandemic.\n\nDuring a Fox News town-hall event at the White House on Tuesday, Trump stated, \"I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,\" referring to April 12, a date 19 days away. The president's comments come as the World Health Organization has warned that the US could become the new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, citing a \"very large acceleration\" in infections.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the US's top expert on infectious diseases, has expressed skepticism about the timeline, stating on Friday, \"I can not see that all of a sudden, next week or two weeks from now, it's going to be over. I do not think there's a chance of that.\"\n\nThe president's call to reopen the US economy goes against the advice of his own experts and the measures implemented by state governors. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, for instance, implored Trump not to risk endangering lives by rushing to reopen the economy.\n\nThe US had fewer than 100 confirmed coronavirus cases on March 1, but by Tuesday afternoon, it had nearly 50,000. The White House announced new guidelines on March 16 aimed at slowing the spread of the virus, including avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people, canceling nonessential travel, and not going out to bars and restaurants. These guidelines were intended to be in place for 15 days and then reassessed.\n\nTrump's comments on Tuesday suggest that he believes more people could die by suicide due to stress and anxiety about the economy than would die from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. However, it's important to note that the president has limited power to enforce such decisions, as they will largely occur at the state level and be made by governors, not the president. The 10th amendment of the US Constitution grants powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or to the people.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Adds 280,000 Jobs in May, Unemployment Rate Rises Slightly\n\nThe U.S. economy added 280,000 new jobs in May, surpassing economists' expectations, according to the latest report from the U.S. Department of Labor. Despite the job growth, the unemployment rate slightly increased to 5.5 percent.\n\nEconomists had anticipated 226,000 new jobs and expected the unemployment rate to remain steady at 5.4 percent. The latest figure also surpasses April's revised job growth of 221,000.\n\nThe leisure and hospitality sector saw a significant increase of 57,000 new jobs, while the arts, entertainment, and recreation sector added 29,000 jobs. Retail added 31,000 jobs, and the construction sector saw 17,000 new positions.\n\nThe civilian labor force saw an increase of 397,000 people, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but the labor participation rate remained virtually unchanged at 62.9 percent.\n\nThe latest figures follow a report on Thursday that unemployment claims had dropped, indicating that employers were confident in retaining workers. The Labor Department reported that claims had decreased by 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 276,000.\n\nThe manufacturing workweek remained unchanged at 40.7 hours, and wages for private, nonfarm payrolls rose by 8 cents to $24.96.\n\nThe Associated Press notes that May's strong job growth \"suggests that employers remained confident enough to keep hiring even after the economy shrank during the first three months of the year.\" The government also revised up its estimate of job growth in March and April by a combined net 32,000.\n\nValuewalk.com points out that some investors have been watching the three-month average of 191,000 on the low end, and note that any print under this level would be a negative sign for the U.S. economy. To reassure economic observers, yield curve traders note that the strong job gains would need to move well past the 255,000 six-month moving average for nonfarm payrolls and show a print above 300,000.",
    " Title: Carolina Panthers' Cam Newton Urges Accountability, Calls for Community Unity in Response to Charlotte Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the violent protests in Charlotte this week, following the police shooting of an armed black man, Keith Lamont Scott, Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton has emphasized the importance of accountability and unity.\n\nDuring a press conference on Wednesday, Newton, a firm believer in justice and doing the right thing, expressed his views on the matter. He underscored the need for accountability, irrespective of race, gender, or age, and called for mutual responsibility within the community.\n\n\"My big thing is always holding people accountable, no matter what the race is, no matter what the gender is, no matter what the age is. We all have to hold each other accountable,\" Newton said, as reported by a local NBC News affiliate.\n\nHe acknowledged the frustrations within the black community due to the ongoing state of oppression but emphasized the need for self-accountability. \"We also, as black people, have to do right by ourselves. We can\u2019t be hypocrites,\" he added.\n\nRegarding the specific incident that sparked the protests, Newton admitted he did not have enough information to form an opinion about Scott's death or the ensuing rioting. Police reported that Scott was armed at the time of his death, contrary to his family's claim that he was holding a book.\n\n\"My heart mourns for the family,\" Newton said. \"But I just don\u2019t know enough info now.\"\n\nThroughout his comments, Newton remained mostly neutral, expressing concern over the high number of police shootings in the U.S. He also lamented the potential consequences of speaking out on race relations, stating that his position could lead to criticism or accusations of insincerity.\n\nHead coach Ron Rivera supported Newton's comments, praising his thoughtfulness and careful consideration of the city's issues. Rivera suggested that the best way to bring about change is through voting, rather than destructive actions.\n\n\"I think he\u2019s very thoughtful when he talks about this city and his feelings,\" Rivera said. \"He thinks before he speaks.\"\n\nRivera's comments echo Newton's call for accountability and unity, emphasizing the importance of careful consideration and thoughtful action in addressing complex social issues.",
    " Title: Trump Accuses Clinton of Causing \"Tremendous Death\" in Middle East, Escalates Criticism Ahead of Primaries\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump escalated his criticism of Hillary Clinton, accusing her of causing unnecessary deaths in the Middle East during her tenure as Secretary of State.\n\nTrump argued that Clinton's decisions led to \"tremendous death\" on both sides in the Middle East, stating, \"She has caused tremendous death with incompetent decisions.\" He further asserted that Clinton's policies were responsible for many of the problems the world currently faces, including the migration crisis.\n\nTrump reiterated his stance that the removal of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, a policy initiated by President George W. Bush, has led to the rise of the Islamic State. He claimed, \"All of this has led to tremendous death and destruction.\"\n\nThe Republican candidate acknowledged that his call for a ban on Muslim immigration to the United States has been used by the terrorist group al-Shabaab as a rallying cry. However, Trump defended his statements, saying, \"What I have to say? There's a problem. We have to find out what is the problem. And we have to solve that problem.\"\n\nIn the interview, Trump also disagreed with President Obama's stance on gun control, particularly Obama's potential use of executive action. Trump argued that mental health, not guns, is the root of the problem, suggesting the need for more mental health institutions.\n\nDespite his lead in national polls, Trump plans to spend approximately $2 million per week on advertising in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. He commented, \"I think I'm probably wasting the money,\" but added, \"I'm $35 million under budget... I almost feel guilty.\"",
    " Title: House Approves Senate Compromise Bill to Avert Fiscal Cliff, Securing Tax Cuts for Most Americans\n\nThe House of Representatives voted Tuesday night to approve a Senate bill aimed at averting a feared fiscal cliff. The measure, which maintains tax cuts for most Americans but increases rates on the wealthy, passed the Democratic-led Senate overwhelmingly earlier in the day.\n\nIn a crucial move, the House lawmakers voted on the bill as written, in what is known as an up-or-down vote. The legislation would raise roughly $600 billion in new revenues over 10 years, according to various estimates.\n\nRep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, told CNN before the House vote, \"I'd say let's take the Senate deal, fight another day.\" He predicted the House would pass the bill with a \"pretty strong bipartisan majority.\"\n\nRep. Nan Hayworth, an outgoing Republican representative from New York, said, \"This is the best we can do given the Senate and the White House sentiment at this point in time, and it is at least a partial victory for the American people.\"\n\nThe timing of the vote was significant, as a new Congress is set to be sworn in Thursday. The legislation averted much of the fiscal cliff's negative near-term economic impact by extending the Bush-era tax cuts for the majority of Americans. It also extends long-term unemployment benefits that were set to expire.\n\nHad the House not acted, and the tax cuts enacted last decade expired fully, broad tax increases would have kicked in, as would $110 billion in automatic cuts to domestic and military spending.",
    " Title: Opinion Piece Examines Immigration and Safety Concerns Ahead of Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the midterm elections, a controversial opinion piece has sparked debate on the issue of immigration and its impact on public safety. The article, published on a conservative news website, argues that the Democratic Party's stance on immigration, particularly illegal immigration, is responsible for the deaths of American citizens due to the influx of criminals entering the country.\n\nThe piece, titled \"Democrats and the Bloodbath: The Consequences of Open Borders,\" asserts that the Democratic Party's support for open borders and opposition to stricter immigration enforcement has led to an increase in crime committed by illegal immigrants. The article cites the case of Mollie Tibbetts, an Iowa college student who was murdered by an illegal immigrant, as an example of this trend.\n\nThe author of the piece argues that the Democratic Party's focus on immigration reform is prioritized over the safety of American citizens. They claim that the party's stance on immigration is a deliberate attempt to create a new electorate and a cheap labor force, at the expense of American lives.\n\nThe piece has sparked a heated response, with some readers agreeing with the author's assessment and others criticizing the article as fear-mongering and xenophobic. The opinions expressed in the piece are the author's own and do not represent the views of the news website.\n\nThe midterm elections are expected to be a referendum on immigration, with both parties vying for control of Congress. The issue is likely to remain a contentious one, as both sides continue to debate the best approach to immigration reform and the impact it has on American communities.",
    " Title: \"Unraveling the Web of Misinformation: A Look at Recent Bogus News Stories\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the rapidly evolving world of journalism, the adage \"All I know is what I read in the papers\" may no longer hold the same weight it once did. Today's newspapers are rife with stories that, upon closer inspection, turn out to be far from the truth. Here are three recent examples of such instances.\n\nThe Rolling Stone's controversial story about an alleged rape at the University of Virginia has been widely discredited. The story, based solely on the word of the alleged victim, has been met with skepticism as university officials and local police have yet to find any evidence of the seven rapists. The fraternity at which the alleged rape took place has no record of a party there, two years ago. Furthermore, three of the victim's original supporters have begun to doubt her elaborate story, which features no witnesses other than herself.\n\nAnother instance of journalistic misstep can be seen in a story published in New York magazine. Over the weekend, a high school student from Queens, who claimed to have made $72 million trading in stocks during his lunch break, admitted to making the entire story up. The student, Mohammad Islam, and his sidekick, Damir Tulemaganbetov, informed the New York Observer that they had pulled a fast one on the magazine in its \"Reasons to Love New York\" issue. The magazine has since claimed that it is \"looking into [the hoax] further and will update accordingly.\"\n\nPerhaps the most amusing, yet unfortunate, example of bogus news is the story that made the front page of The New York Times. The story, which originated in Italy's Corriere della Sera and quickly traveled around the world, claimed that Pope Francis had asserted that heaven is open to pets. The story, which was met with widespread enthusiasm by animal lovers, was later debunked as completely untrue. Pope Francis never made such a statement, and there was no grief-stricken boy involved.\n\nThese instances highlight the importance of fact-checking and the dangers of relying solely on one source. As R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., founder and editor in chief of The American Spectator, points out, \"There is a fundamental rule in journalism. That is double-checking, and in this case it was not done.\"\n\nIn conclusion, it is essential for journalists to uphold the highest standards of accuracy and integrity in their reporting. The consequences of failing to do so can be far-reaching and damaging, as seen in the examples above. It is our hope that these instances serve as a reminder to all journalists to approach their work with diligence, care, and a healthy dose of skepticism.",
    " Title: President Obama and Mayor Bloomberg Launch Nationwide Gun Control Tour Amidst Stalled Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to revive the stalled gun control legislation, President Barack Obama is embarking on a nationwide tour, while New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's pro-gun control group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, is launching a campaign in key states. The tour comes after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's decision to shelve Senator Dianne Feinstein's latest gun control bill last week.\n\nReid has offered to present Feinstein's legislation as an amendment, but has declined to bring it to the Senate floor for a vote as part of a larger gun control package. The push for the legislation seems to be faltering, prompting President Obama to address the need to reduce gun violence across the country. A senior administration official confirmed the tour to Fox News.\n\nMayor Bloomberg, who has long been an advocate for gun control, will reportedly spend $12 million on advertisements in at least 10 states, suggesting a potential political cost for opposing the proposed gun control measures.\n\nIn response, National Rifle Association (NRA) CEO Wayne LaPierre has challenged Bloomberg's plan, stating, \"He can't buy America.\" LaPierre made these remarks during an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday.\n\nBloomberg, in turn, has expressed his intention to counter the NRA's influence in the debate, stating, \"If I can make sure the powerful gun lobby is not the only voice in this debate, then I think my money would be well spent.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the NRA has reportedly achieved its best fundraising totals in a decade.

Rowling, Salman Rushdie, and Wynton Marsalis, has sparked controversy and debate, with some criticizing the signatories for their perceived hypocrisy. The letter, penned by Harper's Magazine, alleges a narrowing of public discourse and the threat of reprisal for free speech.\n\nHowever, the irony lies in the fact that many of the signatories are themselves high-profile figures, employed or commissioned by outlets such as The New Yorker, The New York Times, Vox, The Washington Post, and Harper's Magazine itself. Several have also received lucrative book deals, and some are global icons. The educators on the list are affiliated with prestigious universities like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Columbia.\n\nThe letter's focus on perceived censorship in the U.S. has been met with criticism, particularly given the challenges faced by journalists and intellectuals worldwide. The Committee to Protect Journalists estimates that at least 250 journalists were imprisoned globally last year for their reporting. In the U.S., the Trump administration continues to threaten reporters' safety and undermine the belief in the value of journalism in a democracy.\n\nThe country is also experiencing an economic recession, impacting industries such as journalism and academia. Yet, the signatories of the Harper's letter, who include James Bennet, former editor of the New York Times editorial page, lost their positions not due to economic factors or government pressure, but for contentious pieces that were deemed potentially harmful to marginalized groups.\n\nThis small group's concerns have been met with a counter-letter from another group of writers and academics, published on a Slack channel called Journalists of Color. The debate continues, highlighting the complexities and nuances surrounding free speech and its implications in today's society.",
    " Title: Wall Street Journal Editor-in-Chief Accused of Suppressing Story Over Political Bias\n\nArticle:\n\nA controversy has arisen within the Wall Street Journal newsroom over allegations that editor-in-chief Gerry Baker attempted to suppress a story due to its political leanings. An anonymous email circulated among staffers on Thursday accused a senior editor, later identified as Baker, of attempting to \"desurface\" a story and accompanying graphics because they were perceived as too liberal.\n\nThe story, published on Tuesday and authored by Cezary Podkul, examined the country's recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, including the increase in economic inequality. The graphics-heavy piece was shared on social media by several staffers at noon on Thursday, as per the email's suggestion.\n\nA Journal spokesperson denied that the editor had suppressed the story, stating that the piece had been online since its initial publication and would be expanded with additional reporting and analysis.\n\nOne source familiar with the matter told media outlets that there was a miscommunication, and that Baker had not seen the final version of the story and graphics before they were published. The source claimed that Baker wanted the piece to be expanded and then resurfaced in a more prominent position on the Journal's website once more information was added.\n\nBaker reportedly wanted the piece to be more exhaustive, with more macro-economic context, including \"a lot more on the markets.\" Without that information, he felt the piece was tilting in one direction, making it too liberal.\n\nA second Wall Street Journal newsroom employee confirmed that Baker was unhappy with the initial version and requested additional information to be added, so that the piece could later be re-launched.\n\nBaker has faced criticism in the past for perceived soft coverage of President Donald Trump. He has denied the criticisms, but claimed that other outlets had been too one-sided in their coverage of the 2016 election.\n\nThe financial crisis piece published on Thursday is not the first time the Journal's coverage of Trump has been controversial. In January, the Journal broke the news that Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, paid adult-film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence before the election about an alleged affair with the president.\n\nThe accusations regarding the proposed changes were made in an anonymously written email sent to colleagues under the name \"Barney Kilgore,\" a reference to the late Journal managing editor who helped transform the paper more than a half century ago.\n\nThe email read, \"This week a senior editor at the Wall Street Journal attempted to take a graphic offline because the facts it contained were not politically palatable. When that failed, it was 'de-surfaced,' or, in other terms, taken off the front page and links were removed to it from as many places as possible. After an early flurry of traffic, views plummeted. This is censorship and it is beneath the standards of the Wall Street Journal. It is not the first time either.\"\n\nThe anonymous author proposed \"resurfacing\" the graphics piece on social media, including blasting it out at noon on Twitter. Podkul, the author of the piece, began tweeting about the article's findings at 12:02 p.m. on Thursday.",
    " Title: Democrats Pursue \"Chaos\" Campaign Strategy Ahead of 2014 Midterms, Accusing Republicans of Gridlock and Ideological Obstruction\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2014 midterm elections, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has adopted a \"chaos\" campaign theme, aiming to portray House Republicans as more focused on ideological battles than responsible governance, potentially leading to government shutdowns and credit defaults.\n\nAccording to The Hill, DCCC Chairman Steve Israel asserts that American voters are disillusioned with the House Republicans' gridlock and obstruction, particularly their efforts to defund the Affordable Care Act, which has garnered support from approximately 80 GOP members in the House. Israel stated, \"Americans are fed up with House Republicans' gridlock and obstruction \u2014 but most importantly, they're frustrated with the lack of progress on issues that matter, like working together to create good jobs, protecting Medicare, and reducing our deficit in a balanced way.\"\n\nRepublicans, however, counter that the Democrats' strategy will be ineffective, arguing that the public holds all lawmakers accountable for Washington's gridlock. They also contend that a similar narrative failed during the 2011 debt ceiling debate. New York Congressman Israel, the DCCC chairman, responded, \"It sounds to me [what] House Democrats are saying more and more is they're actually rooting for a government shutdown so they can score political points. That's the lowest of the low.\"\n\nThe DCCC's strategy centers on the potential for a government shutdown over the defunding of Obamacare, a move that could jeopardize the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The party aims to capitalize on this issue, hoping to sway voters disillusioned with the gridlock in Washington.\n\nTo regain the majority in 2014, Democrats would need to pick up 17 seats, a challenging goal for a midterm election, according to The Hill. The outcome of this political maneuvering will likely have significant implications for the balance of power in Congress and the direction of policy in the coming years.",
    " Title: Alabama Senate Passes Controversial Abortion Bill, Potentially Facing Legal Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a contentious 25-6 vote, the Alabama Senate passed a bill on Tuesday night that could impose life imprisonment on doctors who perform abortions. The legislation, known as HB 314, is considered one of the most restrictive abortion bills in the country and aims to effectively ban abortions in the state.\n\nThe bill, which now heads to Governor Kay Ivey's desk, would penalize doctors with up to 99 years in prison for performing an abortion. The Alabama House passed the bill earlier this month. The law allows exceptions only to avoid a serious health risk to the unborn child's mother, for ectopic pregnancies, and if the \"unborn child has a lethal anomaly.\"\n\nDemocrats attempted to amend the bill to exempt rape and incest victims, but the motion failed in an 11-21 vote. The bill would not take effect until six months after becoming law. Governor Ivey has not publicly stated her stance on the bill but has previously expressed anti-abortion views.\n\nIf signed into law, the American Civil Rights Union of Alabama, along with the national ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and Planned Parenthood of Southeast, plan to challenge the bill in court within a few weeks. The bill's consideration Tuesday followed the chamber's dramatic vote last week to drop an amendment that would have made exemptions for abortions performed for instances of rape or incest.\n\nRepublican State Sen. Clyde Chambliss, who ushered the bill through the chamber, emphasized that the bill affects women who are \"known to be pregnant\" and provides \"every female that's pregnant or thinks they're pregnant, and the male who was involved, it gives them that window of time -- this bill does not change that window of time.\"\n\nThe bill outlaws surgical abortions as soon as a pregnancy can be medically determined. The bill's consideration Tuesday made frequent reference to the chamber's dramatic vote last week to drop an amendment that would have made exemptions to abortions performed for instances of rape or incest.\n\nIn a news release, Chambliss touted that his bill outlaws surgical abortions as soon as a pregnancy can be medically determined. Speaking on the Senate floor, Chambliss repeatedly referred to a \"window\" of time between conception and when a woman knows for certain that she's pregnant. The state senator said he believed that time was between about seven and 10 days.\n\nMany women do not yet know for certain that they're pregnant even at six weeks into a pregnancy, the earliest a fetal heartbeat can be detected. When Democratic state Sen. Rodger Smitherman asked what would happen under the bill to a young girl who was a victim of incest and found out she was pregnant, Chambliss said that he hoped that the bill would result in young women learning to seek physical and mental help quickly if they are abused.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Vivian Figures told Chambliss that a rape victim's trauma \"is not your business.\" \"You do not have to raise that child, you do not have to carry that child, you do not have to provide for that child, you do not have to do anything for that child,\" she told Chambliss. \"But yet you want to make that decision for that woman, that that's what she has to do.\"\n\nFigures proposed amendments to have legislators who backed the bill pay for the anticipated legal fees accrued by subsequent legal challenges, to expand Medicaid in anticipation of the bill's impact on low-income women, and to make having a vasectomy a class A felony, as the bill would designate performing an abortion. All three motions failed.\n\nEric Johnston, head of the Alabama Pro-life Coalition and the drafter of the initial legislation, told CNN that while the amendment to exempt rape and incest victims is \"sympathetic\" and \"deals with very difficult issues,\" it would upend the law's legal standing. \"Regardless of how the conception takes place, the product is a child, and so we're saying that that unborn child is a person entitled to protection of law,\" he added. \"So if, be it a rape or incest conception, then it would be impossible to ask a judge which of these is protected by law and which is not.\"\n\nStaci Fox, president of Planned Parenthood Southeast, told CNN before the chamber's vote that \"even the authors of this bill know that it is blatantly unconstitutional and would not stand up in court.\" \"We've seen the continual chipping away year after year in Alabama and efforts get bolder and bolder each year,\" Fox said. \"I think with the President and now Kavanaugh on the court, the politics in Alabama just feel emboldened to take this egregious swipe at women's health care.\"\n\nHowever, Eric Johnston, head of the Alabama Pro-life Coalition, cast doubt on whether this bill would ever take on Roe, citing how the case would take several years to get to the Supreme Court while several other states have already passed so-called heartbeat bills effectively banning abortion. \"There are already 14 cases nationwide in the pipeline, two of which are currently at the Supreme Court of the United States,\" he said. \"The notion that somehow this is going to be the vehicle for the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade is really misplaced.\"",
    " Title: \"Eskimo Pie, Aunt Jemima, and Other Brands Review Marketing Amid Racial Stereotypes Controversy\"\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 In a series of recent announcements, several brands are reevaluating their marketing strategies, as they confront the racial connotations associated with their logos and names. The latest brand to take this step is Eskimo Pie, a nearly century-old chocolate-covered ice cream bar.\n\nElizabell Marquez, head of marketing for Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, the U.S. subsidiary of Froneri, stated, \"We are committed to being a part of the solution on racial equality, and recognize the term is derogatory.\" The decision is part of a broader review to ensure the company's brands align with their values.\n\nThe Eskimo Pie was patented by Christian Kent Nelson and his business partner Russell C. Stover in 1922, according to Smithsonian Magazine.\n\nJoining Eskimo Pie in this reassessment is Quaker Oats, which announced Wednesday that it will retire the Aunt Jemima brand, acknowledging that the character's origins are \"based on a racial stereotype.\"\n\nOther companies are also reviewing their names or logos. Geechie Boy Mill, a South Carolina-based family-owned operation that produces white grits, stated it is \"listening and reviewing our overall branding,\" though no decisions have been made. Geechee is a dialect spoken mainly by the descendants of African American slaves who settled on the Ogeechee River in Georgia, according to Merriam-Webster.com.\n\nMars Inc. is reviewing its Uncle Ben's rice brand, while B&G Foods Inc., which makes Cream of Wheat hot cereal, initiated an \"immediate review\" of its packaging this past week. A smiling black chef holding a bowl of cereal has appeared on Cream of Wheat packaging and in ads since at least 1918, according to the company's website.\n\nChicago-based Conagra Brands, which makes Mrs. Butterworth's syrup, acknowledged that its bottles, which are shaped like a matronly woman, could be misinterpreted. Critics have long claimed that the bottle's design is rooted in the \"mammy\" stereotype.\n\nThese changes reflect a growing movement in response to the Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the death of George Floyd. As companies reassess their branding, they aim to promote racial equality and avoid perpetuating racial stereotypes.",
    " Title: Trump Suggests 'Rogue Killers' in Khashoggi Disappearance, Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump has suggested that \"rogue killers\" may be responsible for the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S.-based journalist whose mysterious disappearance has sparked an international outcry.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House on Monday, Trump stated, \"Rogue killers,\" and not Saudi officials, may have been involved in Khashoggi's disappearance. The president offered no specific evidence, but noted he had just spoken with Saudi King Salman, who denied that Riyadh was involved.\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to get into his mind, but it sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers. Who knows?\" Trump said.\n\nThe president's comments could spur further controversy surrounding the journalist's apparent death. Turkish officials have stated they believe Khashoggi was killed and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on orders from the Saudi government.\n\nKhashoggi, who wrote for The Washington Post and resided in Virginia, visited the consulate on Oct. 2 to get paperwork necessary for his marriage and has not been seen since. Reports suggest 15 Saudi agents entered Turkey before Khashoggi arrived at the consulate and left the country following the journalist's disappearance.\n\nTrump's comments come amid a major diplomatic crisis between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, with lawmakers pressing Trump to take swift action to punish Riyadh. The president has previously threatened to impose penalties on Saudi Arabia if it is found to have been responsible for Khashoggi's disappearance, but he said on Monday that he did not raise the issue with King Salman.\n\n\"We didn\u2019t talk about that. We didn\u2019t talk about that. I did say this is very important. The world is watching, the world is talking. This is very important to get to the bottom of it. I think he understands that very well,\" Trump said.\n\nThe incident has sparked a major diplomatic crisis between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, with lawmakers pressing Trump to take swift action to punish Riyadh. The president's comments could spur further controversy surrounding the journalist's apparent death.\n\nTrump's comments echo his earlier statements regarding the 2016 presidential election, where he repeated Russian President Vladimir Putin's denials that Moscow interfered in the election. Similarly, Trump has suggested that others might have been responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee during the campaign, an attack the U.S. intelligence community has unanimously blamed on Russia. Trump appeared to have arrived at that conclusion on his own and not from a conversation with Putin.\n\n\"I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC,\" Trump said during a September 2016 debate with his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. \"It could be Russia, but it could also be China. Could also be lots of other people. It could also be somebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds, OK?\"\n\nThe ongoing investigation into Khashoggi's disappearance is likely to continue, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meeting with King Salman on Monday to discuss the matter. The outcome of this meeting and the subsequent investigation could have significant implications for U.S.-Saudi relations and the broader geopolitical landscape.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Seeks Supreme Court Intervention for Revised Travel Ban\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to reinstate the revised travel ban, which was previously blocked by two lower courts. The administration filed two emergency applications with the nine justices on Thursday, challenging the rulings that barred President Trump's executive order.\n\nIn the filing, the Justice Department argued that the appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, made several errors in their ruling against Trump's travel order. Sarah Isgur Flores, a Justice Department spokeswoman, stated that the ban is lawful. The department is \"confident that President Trump's executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe and protect our communities from terrorism,\" Flores said.\n\nThe order, issued in March, barred entry for individuals from six Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, for 90 days while the U.S. implements stricter visa screenings.\n\nThe 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had previously deemed the national security concerns an after-the-fact justification for a policy that was \"intended to bar Muslims from this country.\"\n\nRights groups fighting the policy in the courts have expressed opposition to the travel and refugee bans taking effect. Karen Tumlin, legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, stated, \"Again and again, our nation's courts have found that President Trump's Muslim ban is unconstitutional. We will continue to defend our plaintiffs' right to live free from fear of discriminatory treatment by the federal government.\"\n\nTrump signed his first executive order on travel a week after taking office in January. It applied to travelers from the six countries, as well as Iraq, and took effect immediately, causing chaos and panic at airports as the Homeland Security Department struggled to determine who the order covered and how it was to be implemented. A federal judge blocked it eight days later, an order that was upheld by a 9th Circuit panel. Rather than pursue an appeal, the administration opted to revise the policy.\n\nThe revised order, issued in March, was also met with legal challenges and has been blocked by federal courts thus far.",
    " Title: Senate Proposes Comprehensive Immigration Bill with Merit-Based Green Card Program and Guest Worker Initiatives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, a bipartisan group of senators has introduced a comprehensive immigration bill that, if passed, will introduce a merit-based system for awarding green cards to legal permanent residents. The proposed legislation aims to shift the balance in the immigration system over time, with a focus on skills and education, as well as family ties and length of residence in the United States.\n\nThe bill, which is expected to take effect five years after its passage, will ensure at least 120,000 foreign-born individuals annually can obtain green cards through the merit system. Over a decade, the proportion of visas allocated for family members of immigrants currently residing in the U.S. is expected to decrease from 75 percent to around 50 percent, with the remaining half allocated based on job skills.\n\nThe bill also includes border security measures. Employers will be required to verify the legal status of new hires using a federal photo-matching system within five years. Additionally, the federal government will establish an electronic system within ten years for checking foreigners as they leave the country through airports and seaports.\n\nThe bill introduces two new guest-worker programs, one for farmworkers and another for low-wage laborers. It also provides for increased visas in technology and science fields, with tens of thousands of new temporary and permanent resident visas annually for computer engineers and foreign graduates with advanced degrees from American universities. The annual cap on temporary high-skilled visas, known as H-1B, will rise from 65,000 to 110,000, with an additional 5,000 visas for foreign graduates. The cap will gradually increase to 180,000.\n\nThe bill also offers a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, young illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. They would be able to become citizens after five years.\n\nThe senators behind the bill are hoping it will address longstanding issues and garner support from a diverse range of groups, including Latinos, religious groups, labor unions, big technology companies, agricultural growers, and immigrant families seeking faster reunification with their legal family members.",
    " Title: Skepticism Surrounds Jussie Smollett's Alleged Hate Crime Incident as Chicago Police Investigate Staged Attack Claims\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the reported hate crime incident involving actor Jussie Smollett, a growing sense of skepticism has emerged as Chicago authorities investigate claims that the attack may have been staged.\n\nOn January 29, the New York Times tweeted that Smollett, a star of the television show 'Empire,' was attacked in Chicago by two assailants who hurled racial and homophobic slurs. The certain tone of the report, published without the six crucial words \"says he,\" raised eyebrows among many observers.\n\nThe Times is typically cautious about publishing unconfirmed information, but the certain tone of the report about an attack that may or may not have transpired in the way Smollett described it was notable. The strange circumstances surrounding the actor's claims led many to question the veracity of the incident.\n\nThis week, Chicago's ABC7 News reported that \"multiple sources,\" presumably within the Chicago Police Department, had called the alleged attack \"staged\" by Smollett and two accomplices. CBS2 News and the Chicago Tribune made similar reports. A spokesman for the CPD quickly rushed to say that the sources cited were \"uninformed and inaccurate.\"\n\nThe strange circumstances surrounding the incident were evident from the outset. Who walks around Chicago on a frigid night with a rope and a bottle of bleach looking for gay black men to attack, but then suddenly turns and runs away from the victim without doing much injury or robbing them?\n\nDespite the growing evidence that the attack may have been staged, some public figures, including Cory Booker, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris, have continued to express support for Smollett and condemn the alleged attack as a modern-day lynching.\n\nThe reaction from the progressive community has been mixed. Some have expressed disappointment that a gay black man may not have been viciously beaten up by Trump-supporting thugs, while others have argued that the publicity surrounding the case will distract from the real issue of hate crimes against the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nHowever, the incidence rate of hate crimes in the United States is extremely low, with the FBI logging only 7,000 incidents of all kinds in the entire country in the supposed nightmare first year of the Trump administration, 2017. The incidence rate is in the range of 0.00002 percent.\n\nIn light of the growing evidence that the attack may have been staged, it is essential to approach reported hate crimes with a critical eye and a healthy dose of skepticism until they are proven true. The media tend to lose interest in hate-crime hoaxes once they are unmasked, but as a glance at fakehatecrimes.org will show, there are a lot of liars out there.\n\nJournalists, whose priors align with those of activists, ought to be doubly careful about taking at face value claims that seem wobbly, for the good of their own reputations. But it's not just as a journalist that I doubted Smollett's version of events. I doubted it as an American. I decline to look at Chicago (or Kentucky, or Oklahoma, or anywhere else) and put much credence in the idea that vicious Trump-supporting attackers are roaming around looking for minorities to assault.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking the US President: Librarian Emma Johansson Debunks Trump's Alleged Sweden Terror Claim\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, President Donald Trump, during a rally in Florida, made controversial remarks about his immigration policy and terror attacks in Europe, including those in Brussels, Nice, and Paris. However, it was his comments about Sweden that sparked confusion and debate.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump referred to Sweden as a country experiencing terror incidents, a claim that has been met with skepticism due to the lack of recent terror attacks in the country. The internet quickly responded, sending hundreds of messages to the Sweden Twitter account, currently managed by Swede Emma Johansson, or 'kseenaa'. Johansson found herself in an unusual position, debunking the US president's statement.\n\nContrary to Trump's claims, all the news in Sweden has been about a music competition, with no terror attacks to report. Johansson, a librarian, is currently participating in the project Curators of Sweden, an initiative from the Swedish Institute and Visit Sweden that assigns a different citizen to manage the Sweden Twitter account each week.\n\nThe White House has yet to issue a clarifying statement regarding Trump's statement, with speculation online suggesting he may have been referring to a Fox News segment about Sweden, hosted by Tucker Carlson. This incident marks another instance of the president engaging with 'fake news'.\n\nJohansson's fact-checking of the US president has garnered her viral attention, highlighting the role of ordinary citizens in verifying information in the digital age. Her story serves as a reminder of the importance of fact-checking and the potential consequences of spreading misinformation.",
    " Title: Calling Out China's Economic Aggression: A Time for Change in U.S.-China Relations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Beijing, a paramilitary policeman stands guard at Tiananmen Square, a stark reminder of the complex relationship between China and the Western world. This relationship, long marked by economic exploitation, has come under renewed scrutiny in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor years, the People's Republic of China has been a relentless and pernicious economic adversary, taking advantage of the greed and weakness of American companies. Since its entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, China has consistently exploited imbalances in trade relationships, a trend that has only intensified in the two decades since.\n\nIn early December 2019, China became aware of an infectious virus in Wuhan. It was not until December 31 that China reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a potential risk of human-to-human transmission of the virus. The WHO failed the world by not publishing this information promptly. However, U.S. intelligence services briefed the president on January 3, and eleven times after that throughout January and February about the magnitude of the coronavirus threat. Yet, no action was taken.\n\nWhile the world grapples with health and financial challenges, China has seized the opportunity to further its economic ambitions. China controls many critical products and components of America's supply chains. Of U.S. imports, China accounted for 95 percent of ibuprofen, 91 percent of hydrocortisone, and 80 percent of all antibiotics. Our dependence on Chinese medicine has crippled our ability to fight COVID-19 and various illnesses. This reliance must change.\n\nBeyond its domination of the production of everyday medications, China's exploitation of intellectual property is a significant concern. This has led to the introduction of the SHEET Act to prevent countries such as China from stealing technology and intelligence from educational foreign-exchange programs, a method that illustrates the Communist country's desire to steal and misuse intellectual property from the U.S.\n\nSince China's entry into the WTO, it has been abusive toward American companies and businesses. The Institute for Supply Management estimates that three-quarters of American companies report supply-chain disruptions in China. Their manipulation goes beyond supply-chains. When Marriott and Delta posted maps showing Taiwan as an independent country, China objected and demanded that they remove these maps from their websites. Regrettably, both companies complied with authoritarian China and changed their maps.\n\nTo oppose China's outsized influence, American business and government can create new supply chains and reinforce existing ones with U.S. allies in Asia, the Western Hemisphere, and Europe. Chinese leaders do not believe that our leaders and businesses have the resolve to accept higher costs in a less efficient supply chain for imported products, and we need to call their bluff. Policymakers should create new incentives for businesses to reorient supply chains away from China and disincentives for companies to invest there. A \"sovereignty tax\" on American investment in China, reflecting the value that U.S. companies derive from U.S. sovereignty but the damage they are doing to our strategic position by investing there, could be an example. It is worth incurring higher costs to be strategically secure.\n\nAs the pandemic abates, the U.S. and our allies should clearly and openly call out the abuses that China has perpetrated on the Western world since its admission to the WTO. The mantra of accommodation to China to mollify the PRC and slowly integrate them into existing global trade relationships has failed\u2014or, more precisely, has worked for China but no one else. China's leaders are repressive, they violate trade norms, and they steal intellectual property. They project hegemonic power wherever they can. We need to develop a partnership with American, European, and Asian businesses and governments to bring China's exploitation to an end.",
    " Title: Jon Stewart Urges Mitch McConnell to Expedite 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund Reauthorization\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" on Monday, comedian Jon Stewart took aim at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over the delayed reauthorization of the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund. The fund, established to aid victims and families of the 2001 terrorist attacks, is running out of money and requires reauthorization to continue its operations.\n\nDuring the segment, Stewart emerged from beneath Colbert's desk to address McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, in response to comments McConnell made in a Fox News interview earlier in the day. McConnell had stated, \"Many things in Congress happen at the last minute... we will address it again. I don't know why he's all bent out of shape,\" referring to Stewart.\n\nIn response to McConnell's comments on the members' absences, Stewart said sarcastically, \"I didn't mean to interrupt them with their JOBS!\" He also criticized McConnell for using the fund as a political tool, stating, \"Senator, you're not good at this argument thing. Basically, we're saying you love the 9/11 community when they serve your political purposes, but when they're in urgent need, you slow-walk, you dither. You used it as a political pawn to get other things you want, and you don't get the job done completely, and your answer to that charge is, 'Yeah, duh, we're Congress. That's how we do.'\"\n\nStewart urged McConnell to meet with the 9/11 community \"tomorrow as soon as possible,\" stating, \"You can pass this thing as a standalone bill tomorrow. Meet with them. I'm begging you.\" The reauthorization bill, which currently has 320 bipartisan House cosponsors, is expected to pass the House. However, it is unclear if it will pass the Republican-controlled Senate, as previous renewal attempts faced opposition from Senate Republicans who objected to the price tag of reauthorization legislation.\n\nThe emotional testimony of Stewart and first responders before the congressional panel last week highlighted the urgent need for the fund's reauthorization. The House panel passed the bill the day after Stewart's emotional appeal, and it now awaits consideration by the full House. The bill aims to provide long-term funding for the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund, ensuring that those affected by the attacks continue to receive the support they need.",
    " Title: Cokie Roberts Challenges Grover Norquist's Tax Pledge: \"The Emperor Has No Clothes\"\n\nIn a recent interview, veteran journalist Cokie Roberts questioned the political strategy of adhering to the anti-tax pledge of conservative activist Grover Norquist, suggesting that it could potentially harm the Republican Party.\n\nRoberts argued that by standing firm on the pledge, Republicans risk being associated with unpopular policies, particularly the Bush-era tax cuts. She pointed out that if President Bush had been unable to secure the permanent extension of the tax cuts in 1992, it could have negatively impacted his re-election bid.\n\nHowever, Roberts contended that the Republicans' current position, which involves making 80% of the Bush tax cuts permanent for 98% of the American people, is a political victory. She also suggested that this move allows the party to continue fighting for higher tax rates while generating revenue, a proposal put forward by the Speaker of the House.\n\nRoberts further argued that taking the initiative and moving the discussion away from the fiscal cliff, a potential economic crisis, could be politically advantageous for the Republicans. She also noted that the party should be wary of being blamed for the economic consequences if they fail to reach a deal and the country goes over the fiscal cliff.\n\nRoberts also touched on the 1994 government shutdown, led by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, and the political backlash the Republicans faced. She suggested that this history could repeat itself if the current fiscal cliff negotiations fail.\n\nIn conclusion, Cokie Roberts' interview raises questions about the political wisdom of adhering to Grover Norquist's anti-tax pledge, suggesting that it could potentially harm the Republican Party's image and political prospects.",

Bader asked Ryan directly if he could say with certainty that he seeks another term as speaker.\n\nRyan, who was calling in from a bus tour of Wisconsin, responded affirmatively, stating that the speculation is typical \"palace intrigue\" often seen in Washington. He expressed his desire to continue as speaker and complete the \"unfinished work\" of his \"Better Way\" agenda.\n\nThe speaker also revealed his plans to campaign with Sen. Ron Johnson and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the GOP nominee for vice president, in the coming days. In discussing the election, Ryan expressed concern over the potential return of the Clinton administration, citing the scandals and investigations that marked the Clinton presidency in the 1990s.\n\nRyan lamented that young people may not remember the Clinton administration's impact on the country and warned of the potential return of \"Clinton Inc.\" if Hillary Clinton were to be elected. He described the Clinton administration as one that \"always had a scandal around the corner\" and was \"playing the system to enrich themselves.\"",
    " Title: Trump Announces Executive Action on Police Reform, Aims to Balance Law and Order with Justice\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at addressing the ongoing national conversation on police reform, President Donald Trump announced on Monday that he would be taking executive action to encourage local law enforcement departments to bolster training and certification around a set of national \"best practices.\" The action, which is the result of months of deliberation by a policing commission established by Trump in late December, is intended to strike a balance between law and order and justice.\n\nAt a White House event on Tuesday, Trump is expected to call on Congress to pass legislative reforms, but he felt compelled to act to \"turn the anger in the country now into action and hopefully bring some unification and some healing,\" another administration official said on the briefing call.\n\nThe president's announcement comes amidst ongoing protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man whose death at the hands of Minneapolis police three weeks ago has sparked nationwide protests. However, Trump himself has contributed to the deep divisions in the nation in the wake of Floyd's death by emphasizing the need to establish \"law and order\" and painting many of the protesters as violent looters and vandals who have committed acts of \"domestic terror.\"\n\nOn Monday, Trump called the death of Rayshard Brooks, who was shot and killed Friday night by police in Atlanta while running away after a scuffle with officers, \"very disturbing\" and a \"terrible situation.\" Brooks' killing resulted in a new round of protests in that city.\n\nIn Seattle, where protesters have taken over several city blocks and local police officers have abandoned a precinct, Trump has been particularly critical. He lambasted Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, both Democrats, and threatened federal action if they failed to \"do the job.\"\n\nOf his pending executive action, the president said he intends to make the announcement at a news conference, where he is likely to be joined by law enforcement officials, as well as family members of people who have been killed by police.\n\n\"We need great people in police departments,\" Trump said. \"We have mostly great people, but we will do better, even better, and we're going to try to do it fast.\"\n\nThe pending executive action comes as Republican congressional leaders signal that legislative reforms to overhaul police practices could slip beyond this month. Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said it was \"probably unlikely\" that the Senate takes up the police package before the July 4 recess.\n\nThe Senate GOP package, being primarily drafted by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), is expected to be released later this week. Though it is not expected to explicitly bar the use of chokeholds, like the House Democratic plan does, it attempts to discourage the practice by withholding federal funds to police agencies that allow them, according to two Senate GOP officials who spoke anonymously to describe legislation that is not yet public.\n\nSen. Scott, the Senate's lone black Republican, said it would be a \"bad decision\" to wait until next month to deliberate on a legislative package and added that he spoke with Trump on Sunday evening about his own draft legislation.\n\nThe House Democrats' plan also would establish a national database to track police misconduct and prohibit certain no-knock warrants. The bill, which has more than 200 Democratic co-sponsors, contains several provisions that would make it easier to hold officers accountable for misconduct in civil and criminal court.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee meets Wednesday to work on the bill. Trump aides emphasized that the president remains opposed to any legislation that would end qualified immunity for police officers.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday afternoon on the Senate floor that the Senate GOP is developing a \"serious proposal to reform law enforcement in smart ways without lashing out needlessly and counterproductively at the first responders who are a credit to their communities.\"\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee also has scheduled a hearing Tuesday afternoon with law enforcement, legal experts, and government officials. Trump administration officials did not specify how much federal money could be tied to police training reforms, and they suggested it could be up to Congress to provide additional funding to help create new programs that Trump will outline on Tuesday. Among them is a \"co-responder program\" that would help pair local police with mental health experts to respond more holistically to reports of crime in communities and in dealing with suspects.\n\nAsked how the president envisioned getting around potential objections from police unions, the first administration official acknowledged the executive action would hinge on cooperation from mayors and other local officials. \"The federal government can only do so much,\" the official said.\n\nIn a statement, the National Fraternal Order of Police said it had reviewed a draft of Trump's executive action and found that it \"strikes a great balance between the vital need for public and officer safety, and the equally vital need for lasting, meaningful, and enforceable police reform.\"",
    " Title: Trump, Xi Discuss North Korea Nuclear Threat and Trade at G20 Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a critical meeting on Saturday, with the escalating North Korea nuclear threat being a key topic of discussion. China, being North Korea's largest trading partner, holds significant influence over Pyongyang and its growing nuclear threat, which includes the development of nuclear warheads and long-range missiles.\n\nTrump stated that resolving North Korea's nuclear missile testing might take longer than desired, but assured that there will be success \"one way or the other.\" Xi, in his brief comments, spoke in Chinese and his remarks were not immediately translated.\n\nThe meeting also touched upon trade between the two nations. Trump expressed that trade imbalances between the United States and China have been created by various factors, but asserted that these imbalances will be rectified.\n\nThe meeting was attended by a dozen top administration officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and adviser Jared Kushner. The meeting followed a long-range missile test launch by North Korea on Tuesday, which a Pentagon spokesman described as a type not previously seen by U.S. analysts.\n\nFollowing the missile launch, Trump expressed frustration with China over its expanding trade with North Korea. In a tweet on Wednesday, Trump stated, \"Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!\"\n\nChina has historically resisted intensifying economic pressure on neighboring North Korea due to concerns about the potential instability that could ensue, including the possibility of millions of North Koreans fleeing into China. China has also been wary of a reunified, democratic Korea, dominated by South Korea, potentially placing a U.S. ally and possibly U.S. forces on its border.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson, on Tuesday, vowed \"stronger measures\" to hold North Korea accountable. He emphasized, \"Global action is required to stop a global threat.\" Tillerson also stated that any country aiding North Korea militarily, economically, or taking in its guest workers, or failing to comply with Security Council resolutions is \"aid[ing] and abet[ing] a dangerous regime.\"",

This tradition, which has been in place for over 50 years, serves as a means for the incoming President to prepare for the global challenges they will face during their term. However, the current President, Donald Trump, has deviated from this tradition by declining to receive the briefing most days, making it more of a weekly occurrence rather than a daily one.\n\nTrump's decision to forgo the PDB has raised questions about his view of the CIA and other intelligence agencies. During his campaign and recently, Trump has questioned the competence and quality of the nation's intelligence gathering operations. On Fox News, Trump did not directly address this issue, instead focusing on his reasons for not receiving the daily intelligence briefing, known as the PDB within the President and White House staff.\n\nTrump stated, \"I don't have to be told\u2014you know, I'm, like, a smart person. I don't have to be told the same thing and the same words every single day for the next eight years. It could be eight years\u2014but eight years. I don't need that.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama warned Trump against dismissing briefings from intelligence professionals in an interview on Comedy Central's The Daily Show. \"If you're not getting their perspective\u2014their detailed perspective\u2014then you are flying blind,\" Obama said.\n\nThe PDB originated during the early days of John F. Kennedy's presidency, in response to the tense global climate and the need for a more organized way to keep the President informed about potential crises and hot spots around the world. The briefing, initially called the Presidents Intelligence Checklist, was a small, punchy document that Kennedy could easily check and refer to throughout the day. It took its current name, the \"President's Daily Brief,\" during President Lyndon Johnson's tenure.\n\nThe PDB is considered the most tightly controlled daily document in the world, with the President determining who gets to see it. The circle of recipients has varied among different administrations, with some Presidents, like George W. Bush, sharing it with top national-security staff, the Attorney General, Secretary of State, FBI Director, Chief of Staff, and others. Under President Obama, the circle remains a very exclusive group.\n\nU.S. intelligence veteran Barry Pavel, who served in the past two administrations, noted that different Presidents have different preferences when it comes to the briefing. Some, like George W. and George H.W. Bush, preferred an in-person briefing so they could ask questions on the spot. Most others, including Obama, preferred the briefing in briefing-book form, with any questions being relayed to the appropriate agencies and experts at the CIA or elsewhere.\n\nPavel emphasized the importance of these regular sessions with intelligence briefers during the presidential transition period. It's a way to begin to get up to speed on the state of the world, and it's equally important to begin to establish a good relationship and rapport with intelligence officials. Pavel also highlighted the need for a new approach or briefer to present the information to Trump in a way that resonates with him, suggesting that Trump's current belief that he doesn't need the briefing every day might change in the White House.",
    " Title: FCC Shuts Down Austin's Liberty Radio, Known for Alex Jones Broadcasts, Faces $15,000 Fine\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has taken action against Liberty Radio, a pirate station known for its broadcasts of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. According to The Austin American-Statesman, the station was fined $15,000 and temporarily removed from the airwaves due to allegations of unlicensed broadcasting since at least 2013.\n\nThe newspaper reported that the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Austin, claims Liberty Radio, also known as LRN.FM, was transmitting from an apartment complex in Austin. The station ceased airing on the radio in December but continues to stream online.\n\nThe FCC alleges that the station was also illegally broadcasting on an FM wavelength. The defendants in the lawsuit, as reported by The Associated Press, are Walter Olenick and M. Rae Nadler-Olenick, and the apartment complex is linked to them. According to reports, the Olenicks have stated they will not pay the fine and will consider FCC representatives as trespassers.\n\nMedia outlets, including The Austin American-Statesman and NPR, have described Liberty Radio as Jones's \"flagship\" outlet, with the nickname \"Alex Jones Radio\" emerging over the years. The station does air rebroadcasts of \"The Alex Jones Show.\" However, station host Danny Sessom disputed this characterization in a Facebook post, stating that media reports describing the station as Jones's \"flagship\" are \"actual fake news,\" as Jones did not broadcast from the station.\n\nJones, who founded the site Infowars, has recently been banned by several platforms, including Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, for alleged violations of their terms of service. Infowars and Jones's content have also been removed from Spotify and Vimeo. Jones has faced criticism for promoting conspiracy theories, with the parents of children killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting suing him for claiming the massacre was staged and orchestrated by the parents of the children.",
    " Title: U.S. Congress Faces Looming Fiscal Cliff Deadline as Lawmakers Return from Holiday Recess\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the New Year approaches, the United States Congress faces a daunting task of averting more than $600 billion in tax hikes and spending cuts in less than a week. The predicament, a result of lawmakers' failure to act sooner, is a familiar one in Washington.\n\nWith the Jan. 1 deadline looming, all sides are expressing hope that the pressure will at last yield an agreement on the looming fiscal crisis. The White House confirmed that President Obama will return to Washington early Thursday, following his Christmas vacation in Hawaii.\n\nOfficials have cited a \"unanimous desire\" on Capitol Hill, with a few exceptions, to avert the doomsday scenario of income tax hikes, investment tax hikes, defense cuts, and a cut-off in long-term unemployment aid all at once. However, few are spelling out exactly how that might happen.\n\nOver the long holiday weekend, it seemed as if not a creature was stirring on the fiscal crisis front. There was little activity, with no talks reported between the president and House Speaker John Boehner, or between the Republican and Democratic Senate leaders.\n\nThe options for averting the crisis dwindled last week after Boehner pulled his \"Plan B\" proposal from the floor, citing a lack of Republican support. That bill, though fiercely opposed by Democrats, would have extended current tax rates for all but those making over $1 million.\n\nThe move, however, also effectively sidelined talks between Boehner and Obama toward a broader compromise agreement. Obama aides and lawmakers are now discussing a scaled-down package as the most likely vehicle for solving the problem, something that could at least prevent most of the scheduled tax hikes and maybe extend jobless aid.\n\nLawmakers still need to decide who, if anyone, would see a tax hike next year. They also need a bill to work from. The administration official suggested there was a bit more contact in recent days between White House staff and Senate Democratic leadership staff, indicating that new legislation, if proposed, could come from the Senate side.\n\nBoehner, in announcing late last week that he did not have the votes to pass Plan B, called on the Senate to make the next move. \"At some point, the United States Senate has to do something,\" Boehner said. \"What we were trying to do this week was to basically jumpstart and try to kick into gear some action by the Senate to avert these tax increases going into effect January 1.\"\n\nCongress has been in the position of having to craft an 11th-hour deal plenty of times before, most recently over the vote to raise the debt ceiling but also on countless budget bills and tax cut extension packages.\n\nThe senior administration official said the pressure mounting this week should \"animate\" all sides to come together on a deal. If Washington cannot, however, Americans are in for a historic blow. The rollback of the Bush-era tax rates is estimated to cost the typical middle-income family more than $2,000 a year. Another expiring tax provision could cost thousands more. Investment taxes and the estate tax are also scheduled to rise. The automatic budget cuts could slam defense contractors and other businesses that rely on Washington.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has predicted a double-dip recession if the stalemate drags on well into 2013.",
    " Title: Unprecedented Leaks Pose Challenges for Trump Administration in Diplomatic and Military Matters\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of unprecedented leaks, confidential conversations between President Donald Trump and foreign leaders have been disclosed to the media, causing a stir in the political landscape. The Washington Post and the AP have published stories detailing Trump's conversations with the leaders of Australia and Mexico, raising questions about the president's ability to maintain confidential discussions with world leaders.\n\nThe leaks, which are believed to have originated from within the State Department or the White House, are seen as an attempt to portray Trump as a disruptive force on the international stage. The selective release of excerpts from the private calls provides a limited perspective, with the tone and context remaining unclear.\n\nThe leaks have sparked a flurry of activity from the White House, with officials scrambling to provide context and clarify the president's remarks. For instance, a source told CNN that Trump was fatigued during the call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, while the AP quoted a White House official as stating that Trump's remarks about sending troops to Mexico were \"lighthearted.\"\n\nThe Australia issue is particularly serious, with Trump taking to Twitter to question the Obama Administration's agreement to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Trump's comments have also drawn criticism from unnamed sources within the Pentagon, following the raid in Yemen that resulted in the death of a Navy SEAL.\n\nThe leaks underscore the challenges faced by the Trump administration in dealing with hostile elements within the government. As the new president navigates diplomatic and military matters, the challenge for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and other Cabinet chiefs will be to instill a sense of loyalty among their troops and maintain the confidentiality of sensitive conversations. The situation may prompt the White House to become more secretive, as the administration grapples with the fallout from these leaks.",
    " Title: The Founding of Plymouth Colony: A Tale of Two Leaders and a New World\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the year 1620, on a bitterly cold day off Cape Cod, the Mayflower, a wine carrier converted into a passenger ship, landed, marking the beginning of the Plymouth Colony. The journey, lasting 66 days, was fraught with challenges, as the ship was too small for the 102 passengers and crew, leading to a mix of individuals with differing motivations. While most were focused on making money in the New World, a minority, known as the \"Saints,\" sought to establish a religious community free from English political authority.\n\nUpon arrival, the Saints, later known as the Pilgrims, gave thanks for reaching their destination, which they named Plymouth. The ensuing weeks, months, and years were marked by adversity, as the settlers initially lived on the ship and then in caves and shoddy wooden shacks. However, under the leadership of two governors, William Bradford of Plymouth and John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the settlement transformed into a thriving religious community supported by a strong private enterprise economy.\n\nWilliam Bradford, who became governor of Plymouth at the age of 31, was a maverick who deserted his family's church for a separatist faith. As a man, he believed in the importance of work and paid off a high-interest loan quickly. John Winthrop, like Bradford, was a Puritan who stressed man's quest for perfection and the belief that good people could build a model society through religious devotion and hard work.\n\nThe success of both Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay can be attributed to the allure of America as a place to build a better community. Not a single Pilgrim and only a few Puritans opted to return to the Old World. The Pilgrims, who lost half their population in the first year due to disease and starvation, remained resolute, stating, \"It is not as with other men, whom small things could discourage or small discontents cause to wish themselves home again.\"\n\nJohn Winthrop, like the Pilgrims, celebrated his first Thanksgiving in one of his first letters to his wife, expressing his contentment in the New World. The story of the Pilgrims and their journey to Plymouth serves as a testament to the human spirit's resilience and the allure of the New World.",
    " Title: \"Winter Storm Octavia: East Coast Braces for Snow, Cold as Boston Experiences Record Snowfall\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe East Coast is currently grappling with the aftermath of Winter Storm Octavia, a winter storm that has been causing chaos in several states, particularly in the South and East. The storm, which has been described as a \"snow hurricane\" by The Weather Channel, has been captured on camera by the network's Jim Cantore and his crew.\n\nWhile Boston is expected to receive only a glancing blow from the storm, other states such as Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and Maryland are bracing for significant snowfall. Washington D.C., known for its struggles with handling large storms, is preparing for between 4 and 8 inches of snow, with most of it falling early Tuesday and tapering off during the morning commute. With up to a foot of snow forecasted for Roanoke and Richmond, Virginia, Governor Terry McAuliffe has declared a statewide emergency.\n\nNon-essential travel is discouraged, and thousands of students throughout the region will have an extra day off due to Winter Storm Octavia. Bitter cold temperatures are adding to the region's woes. Washington's high temperature is forecasted to reach 25 degrees, about 20 degrees below average for the date.\n\nIn New England, frigid temperatures were prevalent on Monday. Mount Washington, NH, recorded a low of -34 degrees with a wind-chill factor of -87. A New York City hiker who activated her emergency personal locator beacon in the state's Presidential Range amid minus-30 temperatures and 100-mph winds was found dead on Monday.\n\nIn Kentucky, a section of Interstate 71 near Louisville closed on Monday shortly after the snow started. Parts of the state could see more than a foot of snow, according to the National Weather Service. \"For Louisville, it could be one of the worst (snowstorms) in 10 years,\" said meteorologist Joe Sullivan.\n\nWaterford, KY, reported 7.5 inches of snow at midday on Monday. In Nashville, homeless shelter volunteer coordinator Robb McCluskey expressed concerns that a few inches of slush, ice, and snow would keep drivers from bringing people to the shelter and keep church congregations from delivering dinner.\n\nSnow, sleet, and freezing rain are making travel difficult, and winter storm warnings have already been posted for almost 47 million people. This could translate to 4 inches of nasty ice and snow as far south as northern Georgia.\n\nAtlanta forecasters have cautioned about possible black ice for the morning commute after a day of cold rain and overnight temperatures dipping below freezing. Frigid temperatures were reported all across the northeastern USA on Monday morning.\n\nThe cold and snow have caused disruptions in air travel, with more than 1,000 flights canceled nationwide on Monday and over 300 for Tuesday. Monday's cancellations were scattered across airports from New England to the Deep South, as lingering disruptions from the weekend's blizzard mixed with the latest winter storm.\n\nEastern Massachusetts has faced the most winter difficulties. In Boston, the 58.5 inches of snow so far this month make February 2015 the city's snowiest month on record, according to the National Weather Service. This is 10 times what the city typically receives in February. The city's 2014-15 winter is the third-snowiest on record, with more than 95 inches recorded so far. The city is only 12 inches away from its snowiest winter ever, based on records dating to the 1870s.\n\n\"It's certainly not a record that we want,\" said Mayor Marty Walsh to the Boston Herald. \"It looks like a record we can get.\"",
    " Title: Clinton and Sanders Engage in Friendly Fire in Final New Hampshire Debate Before Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nThe final debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders before the New Hampshire primary took place on Thursday night, with the two Democratic candidates sharing the stage for nearly two hours. The event, hosted by MSNBC, showcased both areas of agreement and disagreement between the two candidates.\n\nClinton and Sanders expressed mutual respect for each other, with Sanders stating, \"I happen to respect the secretary very much; I hope it's mutual.\" Clinton responded, \"If I'm so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Sen. Sanders.\"\n\nOn several issues, the candidates found common ground, including foreign policy and government priorities. Sanders, however, declined to criticize Clinton for her use of a private email server while Secretary of State, and Clinton demurred when asked to comment on certain tactics of the Sanders campaign.\n\nThe debate also featured moments of conflict, with Sanders discussing his vision for change and Clinton presenting herself as the pragmatic candidate. Sanders continued to focus on Clinton's campaign donations and speaking fees from Wall Street and other big business entities, describing the \"business model of Wall Street as fraud.\" Clinton, in response, denounced what she called \"an artful smear\" and challenged Sanders to identify a single vote she had cast or changed to pay off a donor.\n\nClinton also faced questions about her six-figure paid speeches, stating that she had spoken to these groups only about her knowledge of world politics. When asked whether she would release transcripts of those speeches, Clinton replied, \"I do not know the status, but I'll certainly look into it.\"\n\nSanders also came under scrutiny for an ad that featured praise from an Iowa newspaper that had endorsed Clinton. Sanders defended the ad, stating that it never claimed he had received the endorsement, but MSNBC moderator Rachel Maddow noted the ad was titled \"Endorsement.\"\n\nOn foreign policy, Clinton demonstrated her fluency and mastery of the field, while Sanders seemed to struggle. However, Sanders reiterated his point that Clinton may have experience, but he had the judgment to vote against the Iraq War.\n\nThe debate did not appear to significantly alter the dynamic of the pending contest in New Hampshire, with Sanders currently holding a 20-point lead over Clinton in two polls. The primary will take place on Tuesday, and the campaign will move to South Carolina and Nevada later this month. On March 1, a dozen states will vote, with most being in the nation's Southeast. On March 15, Florida holds a primary that could be decisive for the candidate trailing at that point.\n\nBefore then, there will be at least two more debates between Clinton and Sanders. The candidates' supreme confidence and sunny demeanor suggest that they are both aiming for brighter days ahead, whether in New Hampshire or in the voting venues beyond.",
    " Title: Louisiana's Economic Recovery: A Contentious Debate on Fiscal Policy Amidst Term-Limited Governor's Tenure\n\nArticle:\n\nLouisiana, a state known for its oil industry, is experiencing a slower-than-ideal economic recovery, a point of contention among political figures, including some Republican candidates vying for the governorship, currently held by term-limited Bobby Jindal.\n\nSenator David Vitter, a Republican and the current frontrunner in the gubernatorial race, criticizes the state's economic situation, stating, \"In many ways, the economy's doing pretty good, but there's a disconnect because of this broken fiscal policy.\"\n\nSenator Vitter, who is running to replace Jindal, targets the state's generous and expanding tax incentives and its increasing reliance on one-time sources of revenue to balance the budget. He disagrees with Jindal's general approach, stating, \"I don't agree with his general approach.\"\n\nIn a telephone interview, Jindal defended his record, attributing the state's financial woes primarily to the downturn in oil prices. He emphasized that a smaller state government was the goal, not an unintended consequence. \"We made an explicit decision and commitment that we were going to cut the government, the public sector economy, as opposed to the private sector economy,\" Jindal said, adding that per capita income in the state is at its highest.\n\nJindal also highlighted the state's intention to shrink government and cut taxes, a policy he believes is unusual for Louisiana. A movement to reassess tax credits and exemptions, which total more than $1 billion annually, has been gaining momentum in the Republican-controlled Legislature. However, Jindal remains firmly against any changes that would result in net new revenue. Last year, he vetoed a bill that would have required the state to tally up the costs of those tax credits and rebates, citing potential uncertainty about the state's commitment to job creation and economic development.\n\nThe debate over Louisiana's economic recovery and fiscal policy is a complex issue, with both sides presenting compelling arguments. The outcome of the gubernatorial race and the decisions made in the Legislature will likely shape the state's economic trajectory in the coming years.",
    " Title: Obama Campaign Pre-empts Romney's Foreign Policy Speech, Criticizes Candidate's Stance on Libya and Iran\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a pre-emptive move ahead of Mitt Romney's planned foreign policy address, President Obama's re-election campaign launched a series of criticisms on Monday, arguing that the Republican presidential candidate has failed the commander-in-chief test on the global stage. The Obama camp released a new television advertisement and issued a memo, highlighting Mr. Romney's bumpy overseas trip this summer and his response to the assault on the U.S. diplomatic post in Libya.\n\nThe Obama campaign's memo, penned by two former top Obama national security advisers, Michele Flournoy and Colin Kahl, accuses Mr. Romney of staking out positions that are \"outside of the mainstream and often to the right of even George W. Bush.\" They argue that this is not surprising, given that Mr. Romney has surrounded himself with the same ex-Bush advisers who embraced the \"with-us-or-against-us approach\" that led to \"some of the worst foreign policy failures in American history, including the Iraq War.\"\n\nThe Obama camp also challenges Mr. Romney to provide specifics on how his foreign policy approach would differ from the current administration. \"Governor Romney still can\u2019t say what he\u2019d do differently on Iran other than taking us to war,\" the memo states. \"He continues to criticize the president\u2019s time line in Afghanistan even while saying he\u2019d pursue it as president. His position on Libya has no credibility since he\u2019s been both for and against our Libya policy. And he offers no way forward on Syria other than suggesting that the United States should get more deeply involved in the conflict without defining a strategy.\"\n\nIn the memo, the Obama campaign also argues that their candidate has one of the strongest national security records of any president in generations. \"He has decimated al Qaeda\u2019s leadership, taken out Osama bin Laden, ended the war in Iraq, provided unparalleled support to Israel, produced unprecedented pressure on Iran, strengthened our alliances, and restored our standing in the world,\" they said.\n\nIn response, the Romney campaign argued that Mr. Obama has weakened America's standing abroad in the past four years. \"In every region of the world \u2014 and particularly in the Middle East \u2014 American influence has been weakened by President Obama\u2019s failed foreign policy,\" said Romney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg.\n\nThe new ad released by the Obama campaign on Monday highlights critical news reports of Mr. Romney's stumbles during his July trip to Britain, Israel, and Poland, as well as the biting commentary of Anthony Cordesman, a McCain adviser from the 2008 presidential campaign, who said Mr. Romney's response to the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya was \"the worst possible reaction.\" The ad concludes with the narrator saying, \"If this is how he handles the world now, just think what Mitt Romney might do as president.\"",
    " Title: Escalating Tensions: Israel, Syria, and Iran Face Off in Syria, Risking Regional Conflict\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of escalating events over the past few hours, actions by Israel, Syria, and Iran have increased the chances of a full-blown conflict. On Saturday morning, an Iranian drone entered Israeli territory from Syria. In response, Israel dispatched eight fighter jets to strike the area from where the drone supposedly launched, near the city of Palmyra. This aerial attack, according to Middle East security experts, was larger than previous ones.\n\nIn response to the Israeli aerial attack, Syria launched anti-aircraft missiles, one of which hit an Israeli F-16. Both of the Israeli pilots in the plane are safe, but one is severely injured due to an emergency evacuation, according to the Israeli military. The Washington Post reported that the Israeli military launched a \"large-scale attack\" after one of its jets \"crashed under Syrian anti-aircraft fire.\"\n\nThe White House issued a statement on Saturday night, condemning Syrian hostility and affirming its support for Israel. \"Israel is a staunch ally of the United States, and we support its right to defend itself from the Iranian-backed Syrian and militia forces in southern Syria. We call on Iran and its allies to cease provocative actions and work toward regional peace.\"\n\nIsraeli officials say this situation started because of Iran. \"Iran is dragging the region into an adventure in which it doesn't know how it will end,\" Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, Israel's chief military spokesperson, said in a statement. \"Whoever is responsible for this incident is the one who will pay the price.\"\n\nIsrael also faults Syria for allowing Iran to attack Israel from its soil. \"The Syrians are playing with fire that they are allowing the Iranians to attack Israel from their soil,\" IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus told the Washington Post. \"The IDF is ready and capable to inflict a heavy price on anyone that attacks us.\"\n\nIsrael now says it has the drone and claims it is Iranian. In response to the incident, Israel struck at least 12 targets in Syria, including four Iranian military targets in the country. If true, it would be Israel's first direct military confrontation with Iran across the Golan Heights, a demilitarized zone between Israel and Syria.\n\nThis most recent flare-up could escalate simmering tensions between Israel, Syria, and Iran even further, something an already roiling Middle East can't afford. This is a developing story, and updates will be provided as more information becomes available.",
    " Title: Puerto Rico, Whitefish Energy, and Power Grid Restoration Efforts Under Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\n-Start of Article-\n\nOctober 24 (Reuters) - Amidst the ongoing struggle to restore power to over 80% of Puerto Rico, a month after Hurricane Maria made landfall, the U.S. territory's $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings for power grid repairs has come under scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers.\n\nThe controversy surrounds a deal signed last month between Whitefish and Puerto Rico's quasi-public power utility, PREPA, to help rebuild a grid that was devastated by Hurricane Maria, the strongest storm to hit Puerto Rico in 90 years. The contract was awarded without a competitive bidding process, and to a company with just two full-time employees and a two-year history.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Governor Ricardo Rossello announced that his administration would review PREPA's contracting practices and forward findings to the island's comptroller. Rossello defended the deal, stating that it was necessary to ensure Puerto Rico would have workers in place quickly.\n\n\"Of those (contractors) who met the requirements and aggressive schedules to bring brigades, one was asking for a substantial amount of money - which PREPA had no liquidity for - and another did not require it,\" Rossello said. \"That other one is Whitefish.\"\n\nPuerto Rico, already in financial straits with $72 billion of debt, has been grappling to recover since the storm. Power restoration is a key challenge, and one of keen interest to contractors and lawmakers alike. Maria left all of Puerto Rico without power when it made landfall on Sept. 20. As of Monday, only 18% had been restored, according to U.S. Department of Energy data.\n\nRossello's comments followed criticism from lawmakers like Democrat Raul Grijalva, the ranking member of the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources, who said in a statement on Tuesday that \"Congress needs to understand why the Whitefish contract was awarded and whether other, more cost-effective options were available.\"\n\nWhitefish spokesman Ken Luce called the criticism unfounded, stating in a telephone interview that \"Washington's got it backwards.\" Luce added that the firm has been working in Puerto Rico since Oct. 2 and has hired dozens of workers, largely through subcontracts, as it ramps up operations in Puerto Rico.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Defense announced on Tuesday that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has awarded a similar power grid repair contract to a subsidiary of Fluor Corp. Greenville, South Carolina-based Fluor Enterprises Inc beat out another undisclosed bidder for a $240 million construction contract set to run through next April, the DOD said in a statement.\n\nOther entities working on power restoration include JEA, a Jacksonville, Florida-based utility, and representatives from the New York Power Authority.\n\nFixing Puerto Rico's power grid is an enormous task. Maria would have seriously damaged a healthy grid, but Puerto Rico's was hanging by a thread after years without maintenance. PREPA has struggled with heavy management turnover and a $9 billion debt load, which landed it in bankruptcy in July.\n\nPREPA has set aggressive goals for fixes, saying it wants 95% of power back by mid-December, a schedule viewed as ambitious.

    " Title: North Korea Fires Short-Range Ballistic Missile, Escalating Tensions on Korean Peninsula\n\nArticle:\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea fired at least one short-range ballistic missile on Monday, the latest in a series of tests defying international pressure and threats of additional sanctions. The missile, believed to be a Scud-class ballistic missile, flew about 450 km (280 miles) before landing in the sea off its east coast, according to South Korean officials.\n\nThe missile launch followed two successful tests of medium-to-long-range missiles in the past two weeks by North Korea, which has been conducting such tests at an unprecedented pace in an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of hitting the mainland United States.\n\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Roh Jae-cheon said the missile reached an altitude of 120 km (75 miles) and that the assessment was that there was at least one missile, with the number still being analyzed.\n\nNorth Korea, which has conducted dozens of missile tests and tested two nuclear bombs since the beginning of 2016 in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, says the program is necessary to counter U.S. aggression.\n\nThe White House said President Donald Trump had been briefed about the launch. The U.S. Pacific Command said it tracked what appeared to be a short-range ballistic missile for six minutes and assessed it did not pose a threat to North America.\n\nThe United States has said it is looking at discussing with China a new U.N. Security Council resolution and that Beijing, North Korea's main diplomatic ally and neighbor, realizes time is limited to rein in its weapons program through negotiations.\n\nChina reiterated that U.N. Security Council resolutions have \"clear rules\" about North Korean missile activities and urged Pyongyang not to contravene them. Japan lodged a protest against the test missile, which appeared to have landed in its exclusive economic zone.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed action along with other nations to deter Pyongyang's repeated provocations. South Korea's Moon called a meeting of the National Security Council in response to the test launch.\n\nExperts say North Korea may be testing new capabilities that may be fed into its efforts to build an ICBM. The United States will test an existing missile defense system to try to intercept an ICBM on Tuesday, the first such test, officials said last week.",
    " Title: Analysis: Christie's Bridgegate Scandal: A Questionable Future Ahead\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the \"Bridgegate\" scandal, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie finds himself in a precarious position, with the potential for two stark conclusions to emerge: either he is an inexperienced politician surrounded by unscrupulous associates, or he is one of the most audacious liars in contemporary American politics.\n\nThe former governor's press conference on Thursday, following the release of damning emails, was met with mixed reactions. While some praised his theatrical performance, others questioned the veracity of his statements. Mark Halperin, a political analyst, gave a similar review, admitting that his assessment bore little resemblance to the truth.\n\nThe crux of the issue lies in Christie's assertion that he was unaware of or involved in the traffic jam conspiracy until the now-infamous emails became public. If this claim is true, Christie still faces the challenge of explaining how he allowed a group of questionable individuals to operate within his inner circle, with seemingly no oversight.\n\nHowever, if it is revealed that Christie was not entirely truthful about his knowledge of the scandal, his political career could be in jeopardy. During the press conference, Christie announced the firing of his deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, and the potential dismissal of another confidant from future political jobs. He claimed to have been \"blindsided\" by the revelations, left exposed and humiliated by Kelly's lies.\n\nChristie's defense, that he delegates authority extensively and is not a micromanager, raises questions about his ability to maintain control over his staff and prevent such incidents from occurring. If it is proven that he was aware of the conspiracy, it would call into question his judgment and managerial skills.\n\nConservatives, who are traditionally inclined to defend Christie, have resorted to tu quoque defenses, comparing the \"Bridgegate\" scandal to the Benghazi controversy or the IRS targeting of political nonprofits. However, these comparisons fall short, as the bad actors in this case were Christie's closest aides, not low-level officials in a distant bureaucracy.\n\nIn conclusion, the \"Bridgegate\" scandal has left a significant mark on Christie's political career. Whether he was genuinely unaware of the traffic jam conspiracy or not, the inconsistencies in his statements and the actions of his associates cast a shadow over his future prospects. The coming weeks and months will likely reveal the truth behind the scandal, and Christie's political career will hinge on that revelation.",

Initially, the FBI had stated that there wasn't enough public interest to outweigh Clinton's privacy concerns. However, after Clevenger appealed to the Department of Justice, they have now \"modified the FBI's response.\"\n\nJustice Department official Sean R. O'Neill explained that the records in question are part of the Clinton email investigation file, which they are already making public in installments. He stated, \"Any records concerning the FBI's investigation of obstruction of justice are currently being processed by the FBI along with the remainder of the Clinton email investigation file. The FBI is publicly posting all releasable records on a rolling basis.\"\n\nThe records are being posted on the FBI's \"vault,\" a section of the bureau's website, under the heading \"Hillary R. Clinton.\" According to O'Neill, the FBI will continue to process and post subsequent releases of responsive records until the entire investigative file is complete.\n\nClevenger interpreted this as the Justice Department overruling the FBI and reversing its earlier decision. Earlier this week, Clevenger won a ruling from a state judge in Maryland who overruled the state bar counsel's office and ordered an investigation into whether Clinton's lawyers should face discipline for their handling of Clinton's emails.\n\nClevenger alleges that by deleting emails that the government later determined were official records and should have been returned to the State Department\u2014and were subject to preservation requests\u2014the lawyers engaged in destruction of evidence.",
    " Title: Virginia Governor's Race: A Closer-Than-Expected Victory for Democrats Amidst Obamacare Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Virginia gubernatorial race, one of the two significant elections of the night, saw a narrow 2-percentage-point victory for Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe, despite initial polls suggesting a more substantial lead. The Republican candidate, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, managed to make the race closer than anticipated, demonstrating the potential of Obamacare as a campaign issue for the GOP.\n\nIn the elections of New Jersey and Virginia, neither Democratic candidate surpassed 50% of the vote. The combined votes for the Republican candidates in these two states totaled 2.2 million, which is 400,000 more than the Democratic candidates.\n\nThe results in Virginia have left many Republicans questioning what might have transpired had the government shutdown not occurred for most of October, and had major donors contributed more funds in the final days of the campaign. Michael McKenna, a Republican strategist in Virginia, stated, \"If we had had five more days, or 5 million more dollars, we would have won.\"\n\nThe tight race in Virginia, with McAuliffe's initial lead of up to 17 percentage points dwindling after the end of the government shutdown, has been attributed to the Obamacare debate. Exit polling showed 41% of Virginians strongly opposed to the health care law, while only 27% strongly supported it. Among voters who considered health care the most important issue, Cuccinelli led McAuliffe, 49% to 45%.\n\nCuccinelli's misstep came on social issues, particularly abortion, with a significant portion of voters citing this as their primary concern. McAuliffe overwhelmingly won these voters, 59% to 34%. This showing will provide ammunition for Democrats who argue their party should continue to emphasize the \"war on women\" narrative, a message that contributed to President Obama's re-election in 2012.\n\nIn New Jersey, the polling on Obamacare was slightly closer, with 34% strongly opposed and 23% strongly supporting it. Liberal groups viewed the election as a referendum on Obamacare, with the Virginia results going Democratic in both the governor's and lieutenant governor's races.\n\n\"Advantage: Obamacare,\" said Americans United for Change, a group run by the former spokesman for the national Democratic Party. Current Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz attributed the Virginia victories to the negative impact of the government shutdown on the Republicans.\n\nBoth candidates received negative ratings in the exit polls, with only 52% of voters strongly backing their chosen candidate, and 17% voting for their choice because they disliked the other. McAuliffe won half of these voters, indicating his margin of victory was not due to voter enthusiasm for him, but rather voter apprehension towards Cuccinelli.\n\nA Libertarian candidate, Robert C. Sarvis, received 6.6% of the vote, a significant portion that could have influenced the slim margin of victory for McAuliffe. Sarvis won almost all of his support from voters who were dissatisfied with the two major-party options.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Decide Fate of Citizenship Question on 2020 Census\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to review a lower court ruling that blocked the Trump administration from including a question about citizenship in the 2020 census. The high court will hear arguments for the case in late April, with a decision expected by late June.\n\nInitially, justices were scheduled to hear the case on Feb. 19, but oral arguments on the plan to add a citizenship question to the census next year were suspended last month. The justices put the matter on hold after a federal district court judge ruled the government could not proceed with its plans.\n\nIn a court opinion, the judge stated that such a question would dramatically reduce the response rate\u2014and congressional representation\u2014of non-citizens. The judge, however, ruled that while a question on citizenship would be constitutional, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had added it arbitrarily and did not follow proper procedure.\n\nThe judge's ruling came in a case in which a dozen states or big cities and immigrants' rights groups argued that the Commerce Department, which designs the census, had failed to properly analyze the effect the question would have on immigrant households.\n\nThe Commerce Department announced last month that it would directly ask the Supreme Court to overrule the federal court judge. The Trump administration argued that the judge's ruling was incorrect and that the question is necessary to provide complete and accurate census block level data.\n\nThe census count is required by the Constitution, and its results are used to determine federal spending, as well as the number of congressional seats allocated to each state for the next decade, as well as the number of electoral votes available from each state.\n\nRepublicans largely supported the additional census question as a logical step, while Democrats argue that the inclusion of such a question amounts to an effort to intimidate immigrant communities and siphon money and electoral power away from them.\n\nThe Commerce Department pointed out that almost every decennial census between 1820 and 1950 \" asked a question about citizenship in some form.\" The department also said the citizenship question would be \" the same as the one that it asked on the yearly American Community Service ( ACS ),\" which is sent to a much smaller percentage of American homes than the actual census.\n\nThe Trump administration maintains that the citizenship data provided to the Department of Justice will be more accurate with the question than without it. However, the lower court ruling has put this plan on hold, and the Supreme Court will now decide whether the 2020 census can include a question about citizenship.",
    " Title: The Role of Spouses in 2020 Presidential Campaigns: Navigating Gendered Perceptions\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2020 presidential race heats up, the role of spouses in political campaigns is once again under scrutiny, particularly for female candidates. The dynamic of a candidate's spouse taking a more visible role can raise questions about the candidate's independence and leadership, according to political strategists, academics, and other observers.\n\nKelly Dittmar, a Rutgers University professor who studies women in American politics, explained, \"People start to question, who's really in charge?\" She continued, \"For men, there's more complicated terrain in just how active they want to be in order to preserve the independent view of their wife.\"\n\nThis was a dynamic former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm's husband, Dan Mulhern, faced when she became the state's first female chief executive in 2003. In an interview, Mulhern said he and Granholm dealt with \"sexist undertones and implicit bias,\" including \"people who thought I was somehow calling the shots, which is the furthest thing from the truth.\"\n\nMulhern added, \"That's the liability, potentially undermining your female spouse who's a female executive. We're looking for a picture of power, and we haven't had a lot of examples of men in blue suits be the supporter, rather than at center stage.\"\n\nDemocratic campaign operatives believe that a primary election is a relatively safe space to begin pushing past these questions. However, they acknowledge that managing public impressions of the candidates is crucial before they can focus on their spouses' roles.\n\nOne senior campaign official stated, \"It's something I think about, but not the number one thing. Before we get to the gendered perceptions of the potential first man, we have to tackle the gendered perceptions of the first female president.\"\n\nHowever, the general election presents a different challenge. As another senior campaign official noted, \"That's when how and what way we roll out [the husband] will matter more, when it will be a more complicated question as to how to do it.\"\n\nVoters have not often seen men in the \"supportive role\" in campaigns, according to Jen Palmieri, a former communications director for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's presidential campaigns. When they have, it has largely been for legislative roles, not executive ones. Only 3 percent of governors in American history have been women, according to an analysis by Dittmar.\n\nPalmieri said, \"It's a challenge to puzzle through how voters want to see it, what kind of role they want to see that man in. There's no playbook for it.\"\n\nSome of the other 2020 spouses can draw from their husbands' past campaigns. Former second lady Jill Biden is a regular presence in the early states for former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign, while Jane Sanders continues to play a critical strategic role for Bernie Sanders, as she did in 2016.",
    " Title: \"Ron Paul's 'Audit the Fed' Bill Gains Momentum in House Amidst Pre-Election Push\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to highlight their political stances before the upcoming elections, House Republican leaders have scheduled a vote on the \"Audit the Fed\" bill this week. The legislation, initially championed by former Congressman Ron Paul, aims to audit the Federal Reserve's decision-making, particularly on monetary policy.\n\nFirst introduced by Paul in 2012, the bill garnered significant bipartisan support, passing with a vote of 327-98. However, the bill faced opposition from then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who had previously expressed support for an audit but later reversed his stance.\n\nRon Paul, who retired from the House after the last Congress, is now urging his supporters to pressure the Senate to act on the bill. In an email from his advocacy group, Campaign for Liberty, Paul stated, \"If Harry Reid refuses to hold the vote before the Senate leaves town, you can help us make sure the American people hear about it all the way until Election Day and build so much pressure by the time Congress returns, the Senate will be forced to act in the Lame Duck.\"\n\nThe current House version of the legislation is sponsored by Rep. Paul Broun, a Georgia Republican. Broun's version cleared the House Oversight Committee on a voice vote in July, suggesting continued bipartisan support.\n\nThe bill, if passed, would task the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Congress's chief investigative arm, with reviewing the Fed's decision-making. The Federal Reserve, established nearly a century ago, acts as a lender of last resort to the country's banking system and is charged with fighting inflation, promoting economic growth, and employment.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the bill would cost about $5 million for the staff required to conduct the audit, with the Federal Reserve spending an additional $3 million complying with the review, resulting in a net cost of $3 million in lower revenue from the Fed over the next decade.\n\nPrevious Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, had opposed the audit, expressing concerns that it could lead to politicians second-guessing the secretive board's decisions. When Paul's bill came up for a vote in 2012, Bernanke called it a \"nightmare scenario.\"\n\nRon Paul's son, Sen. Rand Paul (Kentucky Republican), has a companion bill in the Senate, but it has yet to see any action due to Democrats controlling the chamber. Despite Democratic leaders' opposition, a number of rank-and-file Democrats support the legislation.\n\nNineteen Democrats in the House are co-sponsors of Rep. Broun's bill, and in the Senate, Sen. Mark Begich (Alaska Democrat) is a co-sponsor. Begich has even publicly supported the legislation during a recent Senate campaign debate.",
    " Title: Obama Accuses Congressional Republicans of Inaction on Student Loan Rates as Deadline Nears\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a renewed call to action, President Obama addressed the ongoing stalemate over student loan rates on Thursday, blaming congressional Republicans for inaction as the deadline for a decision looms. The President, accompanied by students, stated that there are still 10 days for Congress to take action to prevent an increase in interest rates on federal Stafford student loans.\n\nRepublicans, in response, accused the White House of ignoring their proposed solutions over the past three weeks. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, stated that the administration has yet to respond to their good-faith attempts to resolve the issue.\n\nInterest rates on federal Stafford student loans are scheduled to double on July 1 if no action is taken by Congress. The White House estimates that the rate hike would result in an additional $1,000 in interest payments for the average student.\n\nThe President has been visiting major college campuses in recent weeks to rally students, leading to accusations from Republicans that he is exploiting the issue for political gain in his reelection campaign.\n\nPresident Obama acknowledged that discussions between lawmakers are ongoing but expressed concern that a solution has not yet been reached. He stated, \"This issue didn't come out of nowhere. It should have been resolved weeks ago.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, also expressed optimism, stating that while Congress is not yet at an agreement, there is still a chance to reach one before the deadline. He reported that discussions over the past two days have been productive.\n\nThe President's remarks come after he repeated a debunked claim that House Republicans want to pay for student loans by cutting funding for women's health care programs. The House did pass a student-loan bill that would take money from a preventative health care fund, but it was not set up specifically for women's health care, and the White House has proposed cutting the same program.\n\nThe ongoing debate over student loan rates continues as both parties work to find a solution before the July 1 deadline.",
    " Title: Virginia's Political Crisis Deepens as Attorney General Mark Herring Admits to Blackface Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nThe political crisis engulfing Virginia's Democratic Party took another unexpected turn on Wednesday as Attorney General Mark Herring admitted to a blackface incident from his past. This revelation comes on the heels of Governor Ralph Northam's admission of a blackface photo on his medical school yearbook page and Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax's sexual assault allegation.\n\nIn a statement, Herring, who is the third in line to the governorship, admitted to dressing up as a rapper in 1980, when he was a 19-year-old college student. He stated, \"In no way reflective of the man I have become in the nearly 40 years since.\"\n\nOrdinarily, such an admission might have ended Herring's political career. However, the current political dynamics in Virginia's Democratic Party are far from ordinary. The crisis began last week with the emergence of a photo on Governor Northam's med-school yearbook page that showed a man in blackface next to a man dressed as a Klansman. Northam initially admitted he was one of the men in the photo, though he later backtracked, suggesting he wasn't either man.\n\nIf the top three Democrats in Virginia's state government become embroiled in scandals, the fourth in line to the governorship would be House Speaker Kirk Cox, a Republican.\n\nBoth Northam and Fairfax have responded defensively. Northam is reportedly hiring a private investigator to look into how the photo was leaked, while Fairfax has accused his political enemies of orchestrating a smear campaign. Fairfax's future was further complicated on Wednesday with a detailed statement from Dr. Vanessa Tyson, a professor at Scripps College in California, who accused Fairfax of sexual assault in 2004.\n\nIn her statement, Tyson described an incident during the Democratic National Convention, where she and Fairfax, who were colleagues, interacted. She alleged that Fairfax kissed her without consent and forced her to perform oral sex, despite her objections. Tyson stated, \"To be very clear, I did not want to engage in oral sex with Mr. Fairfax and I never gave any form of consent.\"\n\nThe developments in Virginia's political landscape are unfolding rapidly, and the future of the state's leadership remains uncertain. The allegations against Fairfax and the blackface incidents involving Northam and Herring have sparked calls for resignation from some quarters, while others are calling for investigations and due process. The events serve as a stark reminder of the importance of accountability and the potential consequences of past actions in the public eye.",
    " Title: Obama's Future Relevance: A Look at the President's Final Two Years in Office\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the historic Republican victory in the midterm elections, President Barack Obama has expressed optimism and a desire for cooperation with the new Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. However, the question remains: Is Obama still relevant, or is he on the verge of becoming a lame-duck president?\n\nWhile the office of the president holds inherent power, the question of Obama's relevance is valid given the magnitude of the Republican victory. To answer this question, it is worth looking back at the final two years of another Republican president, Ronald Reagan. Despite losing the Senate and the House in 1986, Reagan's final years were marked by significant policy achievements, such as the INF Treaty with Mikhail Gorbachev and the 1986 Tax Reform Act.\n\nHowever, it is unlikely that Republicans will seek to emulate the Iran-Contra hearings in their pursuit of Obama, as any attempt to do so would be met with accusations of racism and other criticisms from the progressive corner. Instead, the focus will likely shift to the Democrats' presumptive nominee for 2016, Hillary Clinton, who is expected to face continued investigation into the Benghazi incident.\n\nIn terms of policy, Obama's final two years are unlikely to mirror Reagan's. Foreign policy has been a particular area of weakness for Obama, with his approach to America's role in the world often criticized as diminished. Domestically, his signature policy achievement, Obamacare, is likely to face significant obstacles, as it has lost momentum and support from the legislature.\n\nIn an effort to leave a lasting legacy, Obama may rely on executive orders and court appointments to shape law and culture. The potential replacement of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with a leftist in the mold of Elena Kagan could have significant long-term impacts on issues like religious freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, while President Barack Obama remains relevant, his ability to implement his agenda will be limited. His radicalism in attempting to fundamentally transform America has prompted Americans to fundamentally transform his plans. His final two years in office are likely to be marked by unilateral overtures, a focus on the courts, and continued partisan division.",
    " Title: Thousands in Hong Kong Protest, Call for U.S. Intervention as Tensions Mount\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a display of solidarity with the United States and a call for intervention, thousands of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong marched towards the U.S. Consulate on Sunday, waving American flags, singing the U.S. national anthem, and carrying banners pleading with President Donald Trump to \"liberate\" the city.\n\nThe demonstrators, clad in black shirts and masks, chanted slogans such as \"President Trump, please liberate Hong Kong\" and sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as they marched under the watchful eyes of riot police. One of the organizers, Panzer Chan, told the Associated Press that Hong Kong is \"at the forefront of the battle against the totalitarian regime of China\" and urged President Trump to support their fight for democracy.\n\nThe protests began peacefully but turned violent later in the day when police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds that had gathered in the Central District, where banks, jewelry stores, and high-end clothing shops are located. The demonstrators responded by smashing windows, vandalizing a subway station, igniting fires in the street, and setting up barricades.\n\nThe unrest in Hong Kong has been ongoing since the summer, sparked by an extradition bill that would have allowed suspects in semi-autonomous Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China to face trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party. Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam announced last week that she was formally withdrawing the bill, but the protests have since evolved into calls for more democratic reforms.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper has counseled Beijing to use \"restraint\" in its dealing with Hong Kong, urging the Chinese government to \"sit down and talk with the protesters and resolve the differences.\" The U.S. has been closely watching the situation in Hong Kong and has expressed concern over the Chinese government's response to the protests.\n\nThe protests in Hong Kong continue to escalate, with no clear end in sight. The U.S. government has yet to announce any specific actions in response to the protesters' calls for intervention, but the situation remains a point of contention between the U.S. and China.",
    " Title: Paul Ryan Steps into the Fray: A New Chapter in Obama-Ryan Relationship\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Republican Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin has emerged as a key player in the ongoing political standoff in Washington, D.C. After keeping a low profile, Ryan has successfully appeased House Republicans and engaged President Barack Obama in less than 48 hours, a feat that seems nearly impossible in the current climate of extreme partisanship.\n\nRyan's recent intervention in the budget battle, which has led to a government shutdown and no agreement yet on avoiding a possible U.S. debt default, has seen him move demands by tea party-aligned House Republicans away from Obamacare. This shift enabled House Republicans to propose an approach on Friday regarding the fiscal impasse, although it still falls short of President Barack Obama's primary requirements and has not halted negotiations.\n\nDuring a meeting at the White House on Thursday, Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate, played a pivotal role in changing the tone of the discussion. After initial progress seemed elusive, Ryan stepped in, conceding that his side would not get all it wanted, while Obama asked how he could make something happen. The meeting concluded with Republicans expressing optimism and the White House admitting progress.\n\nHowever, the question remains whether Ryan can push a deal over the finish line. Given the fractured history of bitter negotiations between House Speaker John Boehner and Obama, Ryan might be the Republican most likely to achieve a deal. Boehner has been unable, or unwilling, to reach a deal with the President amid the shutdown.\n\nRyan and Obama have a different relationship compared to Boehner and Obama. While they were fierce competitors during the presidential election, they remain political foes. Despite their months of criticism and derision towards each other on the campaign trail, the mantra of politics is not personal seems to be true with these two.\n\nAfter Thursday's meeting, Republican Rep. Steve Southerland of Florida said, \"Paul and the President certainly have a past, and I think there's a great respect between them. And you can't make that up.\" Southerland added that \"the communication between Paul and the President, I think, was an important part of the conversation.\"\n\nA White House official told CNN that the President viewed Ryan's op-ed as an opening and provided an opportunity for negotiations to reopen the government and lift the debt ceiling. Ryan, as chairman of the House Budget Committee, is steeped in fiscal matters, and he and Obama, despite their political differences, seem to get along.\n\nThe last time they worked together was six months ago during the last budget battle in March. Obama invited Ryan and his Democratic counterpart, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, to lunch. It was the first time Obama and Ryan had sat down together since the presidential race. Van Hollen said at the time that \"their relationship is developing.\"\n\nTheir first public encounter, however, was mixed. When Obama invited himself to a Republican retreat in Baltimore in 2010, he took questions from the members while the television cameras rolled. Ryan introduced himself as \"a ranking member of the Budget Committee,\" indicating he was unsure the president knew who he was. After a back-and-forth about the budget, the president abruptly cut Ryan off, ending the discussion.\n\nObama later complimented Ryan, saying, \"I think Paul Ryan is a pretty sincere guy and has a beautiful family.\" Obama joked, \"And by the way, in case he's going to get a Republican challenge, I did not mean it. Don't want to hurt you, man.\"\n\nFast forward to today. While they have been on different sides of nearly every debate, their relationship is not broken. In today's Washington, that's saying a lot.",
    " Title: Romney's Debate Strategy: A Shift in Stances Akin to an Etch A Sketch\n\nArticle:\n\nMonday night's third and final presidential debate will serve as the latest platform for Mitt Romney to continue the strategic shift in stances that his campaign alluded to months ago, as symbolized by the Etch A Sketch toy. The Republican nominee has utilized the presidential debates and their vast television audiences to present a more moderate image, distancing himself from the \"severely conservative\" candidate he was perceived as during the primary contests.\n\nIn March, Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom famously foreshadowed these changes when he told CNN, \"Well, I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes. It\u2019s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all of over again.\"\n\nSome of the fall campaign's Etch A Sketch moments include Romney now advocating for increased funding for Pell Grants, a reversal of his criticism of President Obama's increases. Additionally, Romney now acknowledges parts of the national health care law that are worth keeping and has shown more flexibility on legalizing young illegal immigrants and on abortion.\n\nOn the campaign trail, President Obama has poked fun at the return of what former President Bill Clinton called \"Moderate Mitt.\"\n\nDuring a speech on Friday, Obama diagnosed the \"condition\" as \"Romnesia,\" warning college students in Virginia that Romney will say anything to get elected and cannot be trusted\u2014repeating the \"flip-flopper\" charge that has dogged Romney, thanks to his support of an individual health care mandate in Massachusetts and his evolution on abortion and gun rights.\n\nHowever, in polls that show Romney even or pulling ahead of the president, the move to the middle seems to be paying off.\n\n\"At this point, the Romney campaign has correctly sensed that the GOP base would vote for a poorly sculpted hunk of driftwood to defeat Obama,\" said Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. \"Romney has more flexibility to maneuver than almost any presidential nominee I can think of. He\u2019d be crazy not to take advantage of this fact. And he\u2019s not crazy.\"\n\nRepublican strategist Ford O'Connell agreed, saying that Romney is trying to woo single-issue voters and to narrow Mr. Obama's lead among the coalition of voters\u2014women, Hispanic, and young voters\u2014that propelled the Democrat to victory four years ago.\n\n\"The president wants to make this a demographics election, but by keeping his original stances and moderating them a bit, Romney is trying to break apart the president's coalition,\" Mr. O'Connell said. \"It is actually very smart, because what Romney is basically saying is, 'I can't win this election with voters by just touting the economy or just doing well with men over 35 years old.'\"\n\nDuring the first two presidential debates, Romney has vowed to \"keep our Pell Grant program growing\" and to keep the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as pre-existing conditions being covered under his plan and young people being able to stay on their family plan. He has also promised not to \"reduce the share that\u2019s being paid by the highest-income taxpayers,\" months after promising that \"we\u2019re going to cut taxes on everyone across the country by 20 percent, including the top 1 percent.\"\n\nInstead of emphasizing the notion of \"self-deportation\" as the solution to the nation's illegal immigration problems, he has advocated for a pathway to legal status for young immigrants, also known as \"Dreamers,\" who were brought to the United States illegally through no fault of their own.\n\n\"The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States, and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident,\" Romney said in last week's town-hall-style debate.\n\nThe Romney camp later walked back his remarks, telling The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the only path he has identified would be for illegal immigrants to join the U.S. military.\n\nWhatever the case, Romney has softened his stance on immigration\u2014a perennial top issue for Hispanic voters in polls\u2014before the first debate, telling The Denver Post something that he refused to say for months: He would not immediately deport the illegal immigrants granted temporary legal status under President Obama's nondeportation directive.\n\nHe also told The Des Moines Register's editorial board a few days later that \"there is no legislation with regards to abortion that I\u2019m familiar with that would become part of my agenda\"\u2014a direct appeal to female voters in swing states, who in a recent Gallup Poll said abortion is the most important issue for them this election season.\n\nAlong the way, Romney has also generated some doubt about whether he supports the National Defense Authorization Act after saying in a debate earlier this year that he would in fact sign the legislation as written.\n\nRomney's vagueness on some of these issues has irritated some people.\n\nMichael F. Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, said he had decided \"there\u2019s no point in trying to nail [Romney] down\" on what he will do with Obamacare.\n\n\"He won\u2019t be nailed down; he wants ambiguity. And even if you did, his word is a poor predictor of his thoughts and future actions because he\u2019s Mitt Romney,\" Mr. Cannon said.\n\nFrank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, which advocates for immigrant rights, said that when it comes to immigration, Romney is \"trying to put lipstick on the pig.\"\n\n\"The pig, his policies, amount to this: All but young undocumented immigrants who serve in the military should be forced out of the country. His rhetoric is this: I want permanent solutions on a bipartisan basis,\" Mr. Sharry said. \"He\u2019s got the fog machine on in hopes that Latino immigrants will think he\u2019s actually going to do something for them. But they get this issue better than the Boston brain trust. They get he actually wants to do something to them.\""
