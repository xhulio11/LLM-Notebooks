Authorities began searching an apartment building where Bouhlel apparently lived, and Molins said Bouhlel\\'s ex-wife had been detained.\\n\\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and authorities did not release information about a motive. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said that so far, the investigation has not uncovered any evidence of jihadism. But Molins said the attack fits with calls that \"terrorist organizations regularly give out on their videos and elsewhere.\"\\n\\nBouhlel was known to police because of allegations of threats, violence and thefts over the last six years, and he was given a suspended six-month prison sentence this year after being convicted of violence with a weapon, Molins said.\\n\\nBouhlel\\'s father, who lives in Tunisia, has revealed that his son showed signs of mental health issues -- having had multiple nervous breakdowns and volatile behavior, said CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank.\\n\\nThe man was \"entirely unknown by the intelligence services, whether nationally or locally,\" Molins said.\\n\\n\"He had never been the subject of any kind of file or indication of radicalization,\" Molins said.\\n\\nDead in the street\\n\\nThe attack was launched on a popular street that would normally be packed with tourists and residents on a sunny afternoon in July.\\n\\nOn a normal day, the stunning beach here in #Nice would\\'ve been packed.

At one point, he fired a gun several times at three police officers close to a hotel, the prosecutor explained said.\\n\\nOfficers gave chase for about 300 meters until they shot him, Molins said.\\n\\nThe truck was rented on Monday and was supposed to have been returned Wednesday, Molins said, without saying who rented it. Surveillance video shows that about two hours before the attack Thursday, Bouhlel rode a bicycle to pick up the truck east of the city, the prosecutor said.\\n\\nAfter Bouhlel was shot, police found a handgun and some ammunition in the truck\\'s cab, as well as a replica handgun, two replica assault rifles, a cell phone and various documents, Molins said. In the trailer was the bicycle and some empty pallets.\\n\\nCrews covered the dead in the street with blue sheets so emergency vehicles could both avoid running over them and spot them for evacuation.\\n\\nSlowly, authorities are putting names to the bodies. Four members of one family have been identified as killed, according to the mayor of the Herserange municipality in the suburbs of Longwy, where the family lived. Michael Pellegrini, 28, was a professor of economics at a private school in Longwy, in northeastern France. Pellegrini died along with his mother, Véronique Lyon, and his grandparents, Francis and Christiane Locatelli.\\n\\nTeacher, Mickaël Pellegrini was killed in Nice attack\\n\\nThree Germans are among the dead, Mayor Reinhard Naumann of Berlin\\'s Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district said in a statement.

We mourn with the parents of the school, their relatives and their friends,\" the statement said. \"We stand with them side by side and we will provide all the necessary support that is now needed.\"\\n\\nAmericans Sean Copeland, 51, and his son, Brodie, 11, of Texas also were killed in the attack , a statement from the family said. U.S. officials confirmed that at least two Americans were killed in the attack, but did not name them.\\n\\nApart from those confirmed dead, three Australians, two Chinese and one British national were injured, officials said.\\n\\nLearn to live with terrorism\\n\\nHollande declared a national mourning period from Saturday to Monday.\\n\\nFrance was just preparing to lift its state of emergency, which was put into place in the wake of the November terror attacks in Paris that killed 130 people, the deadliest attack in France\\'s history.\\n\\nThe state of emergency would have expired later this month, but Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Friday that a bill to extend it would be submitted to parliament by Tuesday.\\n\\n\"France has been struck once again in her flesh, on the 14th of July, on the day of our national celebration,\" Valls said. The attacker wanted to \"harm the very idea of national unity,\" he said, adding grimly that France will have to \"learn to live with terrorism.\"\\n\\nJUST WATCHED French president: Horror has struck France Replay More Videos ...
