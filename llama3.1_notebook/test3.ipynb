      "{'original_article': [\"Former Hewlett-Packard chief questions Hillary Clinton’s record in hunt for female voters and startup cash on campaign trail, but ex-colleagues insist Fiorina ‘didn’t know what she was doing’\\n\\nThis article is more than 4 years old\\n\\nThis article is more than 4 years old\\n\\nWhen Carly Fiorina launches her campaign for president this week, her message to the world will be emphatic: what she did for HP, she can do for America.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom spaghetti dinners in New Hampshire to startup conferences in New York, the former head of Hewlett-Packard is expected to keep staking her claim as a pioneering executive prodigy: “It is only in the United States of America that a young woman can start as a secretary and become CEO of the largest technology company in the world,” she recently posted on Facebook, next to a low rating from a pro-choice group that she called “a badge of honor”.\\n\\nFiorina, 60, has never held public office. A 2010 run for US senate collapsed amid images of private jets and million-dollar yachts. Now, she hopes the revived record of a dot-com businesswoman will vault her over the otherwise all-male Republican field of mostly professional politicians – or at least lead to a spot as one of their vice-presidential running mates to face Hillary Clinton head-on.\\n\\n“We went from a market laggard to market leader,” Fiorina has said of her six years running the computer giant. “Unlike Hillary, I have actually accomplished something.”\\n\\nIs Carly Fiorina the GOP's best hope of damaging Hillary Clinton? Read more\\n\\nBut those who watched what Fiorina did to HP – mishandling the $25bn acquisition of Compaq, getting ousted by the board in 2005 with a $21m golden parachute, repeatedly being named one of the worst CEOs in American corporate history – say those supposed accomplishments are already coming back to “haunt” her run for the White House.\\n\\n“She put herself ahead of the interests of the company and I fear she would do the same as president,” Jason Burnett, a grandson of the late HP co-founder David Packard and a member of the Packard Foundation board of trustees, told the Guardian. “I don’t want her to do harm to this country.”\\n\\nHP’s longtime director of corporate communications, Roy Verley, said his ex-boss alienated colleagues with a “cult of Carly” that put self-promotion first.\\n\\n“She didn’t know what she was doing and couldn’t deliver on her promises,” said Verley, who left HP in 2000.\\n\\nThe notion of a successful Fiorina reign at HP, he said, was “fantasy”.\\n\\nBurnett, echoing criticisms from more Hewletts and Packards alike, warned the emergent class of political bankrollers in Silicon Valley – already courted by Fiorina’s competitors like Rand Paul and Jeb Bush and soon Clinton herself– to “refresh their memory” before signing campaign checks.\\n\\nLeslie Shedd, press secretary for Carly for America, defended Fiorina’s tenure at HP, saying she doubled revenue, tripled innovation, quadrupled cash flow and bequeathed a stronger company.\\n\\n“Under Carly’s leadership, HP weathered the 2001 economic recession that shuttered some of the top tech companies in Silicon Valley,” Shedd said. “Carly Fiorina made the tough decisions that were necessary to reform the company, and HP and its shareholders reaped the rewards of those decisions after she left.”\\n\\nShedd cited tech players such as investor Tom Perkins and Craig Barrett, former Chairman of the board at Intel, who defended Fiorina’s handling of the Compaq merger.\\n\\nShe said Fiorina had had to deal with a “dysfunctional” board at HP and disputed the credibility of lists ranking her boss as one of America’s worst CEOs.\\n\\n“Those lists are based on no metrics,” Shedd said, “ are completely the opinion of whomever is compiling the list, and are nothing other than gossip.”\\n\\nBut political scientists and technology bankrollers agreed that even a woman-focused, folksy-outsider-meets-business-insider campaign would struggle to shrug off cobwebby boardroom battles predating the Facebook era and re-emerge as much more than a longshot.\\n\\n“She takes the Silicon Valley motto that it’s ‘OK to fail’ a tad too literally,” wrote the usually sober editorial board of the San Jose Mercury News, in calling for more women in politics – except Carly Fiorina.\\n\\nTexas to riches – and taking on Clinton\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ‘They claim to care about people’s lives while destroying lives,’ Fiorina said of liberal politicians. The Packard family said it watched her ‘almost destroy’ their family business. Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images\\n\\nLittle of Fiorina’s boom-and-bust time at HP appears to have registered in the Republican heartland, where she has been working on an invisible campaign for months, touting her ostensibly humble origins and an only-in-America backstory.\\n\\nThe Texas-born daughter of an artist and a federal judge, she studied philosophy and medieval history at Stanford and worked as a secretary and receptionist before joining AT&T as a trainee manager.\\n\\nFiorina zoomed up the ranks, and in 1999, HP poached her to become the first woman to lead a Fortune 50 company. The pay, perks and egalitarian ethos elicited fierce employee loyalty, but the Silicon Valley behemoth needed a bold new leader.\\n\\nThat is often where Fiorina’s Horatio Alger-style narrative ends on the campaign trail, and where the pro-life, pro-guns, pro-God social conservatism begins.\\n\\nFrom Iron Lady to #GrandmothersKnowBest: Hillary Clinton is playing the 'gender card' to win Read more\\n\\nWhile insisting that Clinton “can’t play the gender card” against her, Fiorina has further burnished her conservative appeal by challenging the Democratic frontrunner’s credentials.\\n\\n“She has not accomplished much,” Fiorina said of the former secretary of state at a campaign stop last month in Iowa. “I have sat across the table from Vladimir Putin.”\\n\\n“Obviously I’ve never negotiated a nuclear deal with Iran,” she said at a recent breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. “But I’ve negotiated a lot of deals.”\\n\\nThe dual appeal – “I’m not a political neophyte, but I’m also not a professional politician” – appears to have won over voters in early battleground states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. But an Associated Press poll released over the weekend suggests she may have many deals yet to make: just 7% of those surveyed had a favourable view of Fiorina, and a full three-quarters said they did not know enough about her.\\n\\n“People out there are not troubled by the fact I have not held elected office,” Fiorina told a conservative audience in Washington on Saturday.\\n\\nA ‘disaster’ at HP looming on the campaign trail\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fiorina at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2005, one month before she was ousted by the board of Hewlett-Packard. Photograph: Mike Blake/Reutuers\\n\\nEven if Fiorina’s presidential run ends as a way to the vice-presidency, campaign-watchers say her six years at HP will shape voter perceptions: “And not to her advantage,” said Melinda Jackson, a politics professor at San Jose state university. “It was a rocky tenure. I think it will haunt her.”\\n\\nCritics recall that HP’s board accused her of “destroying” the company’s value by mishandling the Compaq takeover, a move that committed HP to making low-margin personal computers rather than focusing on higher-margin products such as printers.\\n\\nThe company was sued by its shareholders, who argued she didn’t deserve such a massive severance package. Ben Rosen, the former chairman of Compaq, said Fiorina “simply did not have the skills to manage one of the world’s largest technology companies”.\\n\\nUnder Fiorina, HP revenue more than doubled – from $42bn in sales to $87bn – but net earnings fell to $2.4bn from $3.1bn.\\n\\nThe Unlocking Potential Project, Fiorina’s new initiative to help close the gender gap and recruit more independent women backers, describes her achievements at HP as including “market leadership in every market and product category and quadruple cash-flow”. But HP stock tumbled 50% during her tenure – and leaped 6.9% the day after her departure.\\n\\nBurnett, the Packard grandson, said those financial realities create a dilemma for an ardent advocate of a free market advocate: “What can she say? The market was mistaken?”\\n\\nFive years after the ouster, when Fiorina began her first bid for public office and challenged Barbara Boxer for her California senate seat, his sister Arianna wrote a letter. Fiorina, the heiress warned three Republican senators who had endorsed the former CEO, was spinning her record at HP – and Arianna Packard accused her of using the golden parachute for “financing her campaign”.\\n\\n“[A]llow me to disillusion you of a few of your stated reasons for supporting her,” Packard wrote. “Most business commentators consider Fiorina’s tenure at HP to be a disaster.”\\n\\nBoxer defeated Fiorina resoundingly, thanks in large part to devastating attack ads.\\n\\nOne intoned: “As CEO of HP, Carly Fiorina laid off 30,000 workers. Fiorina shipped jobs to China. And while Californians lost their jobs, Fiorina tripled her salary, bought a million-dollar yacht and five corporate jets ... Carly Fiorina. Outsourcing jobs. Out for herself.”\\n\\nRepublican rivals for the 2016 nominating fight may borrow that playbook from 2010, said Bill Whalen, a Hoover Institution research fellow who advises California’s top Republicans.\\n\\n“I can see a Super Pac doing the same to her in the primary,” Whalen said. “Hers is not an easy story to tell.”\\n\\nEscaping ‘haters’ and courting startup dollars\\n\\nAfter spending last week in New Hampshire, Fiorina will roll out her candidacy via social media on Monday, followed by media interviews, a campaign booklet called “My Leadership Journey” and an address to the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in New York, where she will seek to regain confidence from a startup world she left behind on the wrong side of a bubble.\\n\\nBut her bid for the White House is already being cast by many politicos as a bid for redemption, to banish the ignominy from her HP departure. Activists and donors are watching closely to see if she can still lure campaign financing out of a “Carly for America” fundraising operation already drawing scrutiny from federal officials.\\n\\n“I was in junior high; I don’t know what happened at HP,” said Aaron Ginn, the co-founder of San Francisco-based Lincoln Labs, a lobbying group that enlists an increasingly influential – and rich – group of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs wading into the world of donations with politics that are a blend of socially open-minded libertarianism and new-school Republicanism.\\n\\nSpeaking in a personal capacity, and without endorsing any candidate, Ginn said he liked Fiorina’s conviction and philosophical underpinnings. He shrugged off the attacks on her as standard electoral fare: “You can find a hater anywhere,” he said.\\n\\nCarly Fiorina will lose the Republican nomination to prove there's no war on women Read more\\n\\nBut as the Clintons discovered with Whitewater and now everything from email servers to charitable donations, US presidential campaigns can shine harsh, sustained spotlights on old events. Just ask John Kerry about that swift boat and the Vietnam war.\\n\\nFiorina’s admirers see presidential attributes in the tenacity and confidence of an executive willing to confront the future – if not quite all of her past.\\n\\nHer “incredibly smart, passionate, articulate” qualities shone some years ago, said Carl Guardino, a former HP executive who is now CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, when she accepted his invitation to address an audience of mostly underprivileged Latina girls.\\n\\n“She was mesmerising,” Guardino said.\\n\\nVerley, the former communications director at HP, said Fiorina’s self-confidence may have led to boardroom fiasco and that historical “fantasy” may yet help Fiorina make an impact on the most crowded Republican field in years – and be a thorn in Clinton’s side.\\n\\n“She’s a born politician,” he said. “She’s extremely confident of her ability to step into any situation and command it.”\", 'The establishment favorites won in Virginia on Tuesday, but the results still sent shock waves through Richmond and Washington.\\n\\nThe state’s gubernatorial primaries were expected to feature a tight race on the Democratic side between Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and ex-Rep. Tom Perriello, while former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie was supposed to romp in his race against Donald Trump-inspired Corey Stewart, the former chairman of the president’s campaign in Virginia.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nBut Northam won easily and early, and it was Gillespie who barely squeaked out a win, sending fear through the heart of the Republican establishment that had written off Stewart early. The number of ballots cast stunned operatives on both sides: Democratic turnout skyrocketed, reaching nearly 170 percent more than the last time there was a contested primary in 2009.\\n\\nIt all sets up a titanic battle for the governorship in November, with Northam now favored over a bruised Gillespie.\\n\\nHere are POLITICO’s five takeaways from Virginia’s contest:\\n\\nIt\\'s always about Trump\\n\\nGillespie barely mentioned Trump on the campaign trail. The Trump political apparatus didn’t lift a finger for Stewart. If anything, Stewart drew more mention in the news media for his pro-Confederate statements than his ties to Trump.\\n\\nEven so, the story of the night was Stewart’s shocking strength against someone with vastly more money, name recognition, and appeal to mainstream voters — suggesting that the Trump effect is alive and well in the state, where he won the primary last year.\\n\\nFor mainstream Republicans, it might mean that their turnout models need tweaking, as they consistently underestimate the enthusiasm and turnout of Stewart-style Trump voters. For Gillespie, it means the coming months will likely have to be spent trying to win over voters he assumed would be with him, rather than tacking to the middle against Northam.\\n\\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

But the primary in Virginia underscored that the party’s new reality isn’t so clear-cut.\\n\\nWhile some national pundits tried to cast the race as a replay of 2016’s Hillary Clinton vs. Bernie Sanders presidential primary — with Northam playing the role of insider favorite and Perriello as the insurgent — the fault lines were less clear than that.\\n\\nJust as in New Jersey one week earlier — where Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination with the backing of some of Sanders’ biggest allies, including his son — the endorsement game didn’t line up along progressive outsider versus moderate insider lines. Neither did the policy platforms: both candidates ran on liberal platforms.\\n\\nNortham may have had the support of the entire state Democratic leadership and Perriello may have had backing from Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but many prominent local liberals were quick to rally behind the state’s no. 2 elected official, while the former congressman had the support of many Barack Obama allies.\\n\\nA late-breaking endorsement from The Washington Post may have sealed the deal for Northam. Perriello’s own internal polls showed him dipping 12 points in the week afterward, according to a Democrat close to the campaign.\\n\\nLt. Gov. Ralph Northam celebrates his victory in the Democratic primary during an election party in Crystal City, Va., on June 13. | AP Photo\\n\\nStill, that doesn’t mean the Democratic Party is finally united and on the same page after its bruising 2016 primary and months of lingering proxy battles between Clinton and Sanders forces. The surprisingly tight race in Virginia suggested that the party simply has a different set of internal questions to resolve. Those include whether simply running with the “insurgent\" label is enough to get the attention of enough voters to cause a real stir, and whether past breaks from party orthodoxy — like Perriello’s on abortion and gun control — are enough to doom a bid.\\n\\nDemocratic Party enthusiasm is very real\\n\\nOne defining characteristic of the Trump era has been the consistently surprising energy from Democrats eager to oppose him. That’s true among activists and also in states that have held elections this year. The high Democratic turnout on Tuesday continued a trend that was highlighted last week in New Jersey — where the party primary attracted higher-than-expected turnout even though the race wasn’t competitive.\\n\\nTuesday’s vote attracted well over a half-million Democratic votes, blowing past the party’s last competitive primary in Virginia, when 320,000 Democratic voters showed up.\\n\\nMany state political operatives expected that a higher turnout election would swing the election to Perriello, but Northam coasted. And his win included higher-than-expected numbers in regions with more African-American voters, a major question mark heading into the vote.\\n\\nThat bodes well for his general election chances. If Democrats are going to mount a comeback in the Trump era, governor\\'s mansions must be a big part of it.\\n\\nWhat does it mean for 2018 — and 2020?\\n\\nVirginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who has been facing the prospect of a tough GOP challenge next year, is breathing easier after watching Democrats turn out in such massive numbers while the Republican establishment pick struggled in a much-lower turnout primary.\\n\\nAnother big winner not named Northam or Gillespie on Tuesday: Gov. Terry McAuliffe, whose national ambitions got a boost from Northam’s big win.\\n\\nThe governor, a longtime national party operator and former Democratic National Committee chairman, was by far the most prominent outside figure in Northam’s campaign, featuring heavily in the lieutenant governor’s rotation of ads.\\n\\nA big Northam win suggests that McAuliffe remains popular with the Democratic base, and burnishes the governor’s stature — a rejection Tuesday would have diminished his appeal as a 2020 prospect. Given that some among the party’s more liberal base are likely to regard him skeptically because of his deep ties to the party establishment and his years-long friendship with the Clintons, a strong victory in a battleground state affords him additional national credibility.\\n\\nNortham now enters the general election as a favorite over Gillespie, giving McAuliffe a chance to campaign for his legacy while taking his advocacy of redistricting and his campaign work for other Democratic governors nationwide.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that McAuliffe isn’t the only one whose 2020 hand looked stronger after Tuesday’s election: Stewart’s shock performance gave Trump some luster as well.\\n\\nThe ghost of Eric Cantor\\n\\nGillespie’s close call immediately reminded Virginians and political professionals alike of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s stunning loss in his House race three years ago — another establishment favorite stunned in Virginia by a come-from-nowhere insurgency.\\n\\nIn Cantor’s case, the win by now-Rep. Dave Brat foreshadowed a broader uprising within the party. In Gillespie’s case, the near-loss in a low-turnout, low-attention race now forces GOP leaders and lawmakers alike to re-evaluate their positioning ahead of 2018.\\n\\nAfter all, if Gillespie — a former national chairman and Republican stalwart who was forecast to win by at least 20 points — is vulnerable to an unexpected Trump-inspired challenger, is anyone really safe?', '“This is a marathon, not a sprint,” Sarah Mason, a graduate student in sociology at the University of California Santa Cruz, tells a crowd of several hundred students, wrapping up the fourth day of an unprecedented wildcat strike that has drawn threats of mass dismissal and captured the attention of UC campuses across the state. Using a megaphone, Mason reminds them that LA teachers went on strike for six days last year and Oakland teachers for seven before getting their pay raises. She asks for a show of hands to see how many wanted to continue to picket the following day. Arms shoot up all around her.\\n\\nGraduate student employees have been on a work stoppage since February 10, refusing to teach, hold office hours, or do other work until the university meets their demands for a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of $1,412 a month to help alleviate the rent burden in Santa Cruz, one of the least affordable housing markets in the country. This was an escalation from a grade strike that over 200 graduate students launched on December 9.\\n\\nStrikers have filled the field of patchy grass at the main entrance to campus every day to picket with chants like “Pay us more,” “No COLA, no grades,” and “Spread the strike.” Students have been handing out water, sunscreen, and food. There are medical and legal teams on hand. There’s music—students banging on percussion instruments in the morning and Latin hip hop blasting out of speakers in the afternoon. There’s a guy printing wildcat symbols on people’s T-shirts. Some professors have even held their classes down at the picket line. The vibe has oscillated between palpable activist rage and the buoyancy of a music festival. Grad students, joined by undergraduates in solidarity, have significantly disrupted daily class operations, at times blocking the main entrance to campus by sitting in the middle of the road and linking arms in a well-organized mass direct action that has forced the university to respond.\\n\\nOn February 12, after an hours-long standoff, 17 students were forcibly arrested by over a hundred police officers in full riot gear brought in by the administration from outside the county. The crackdown ended in several injuries. Those arrested were suspended for two weeks. The police brutality at a university that prides itself on progressive values has made headlines and only emboldened the strikers, whose chants now include “Cops off campus, COLA in my bank account!”\\n\\nLast Friday night, UC President Janet Napolitano published a letter threatening to fire students if they don’t call off the strike, and reiterated the university’s position that it refuses to negotiate with the students. “To accede to the demands of a group of employees engaged in an unauthorized wildcat strike would undercut the very foundation of an agreement negotiated in good faith by the UAW and ratified by thousands of members across the system.”\\n\\nThe university has given them until 11:59 p.m. tonight to submit grades for the previous fall quarter or face dismissal. For international students on a student visa—about 30 people, in all—this is de facto deportation. For teaching assistants who are parents, this could endanger a child care subsidy of $3,300 they receive per year as part of the union contract. The high stakes have challenged the unity of the strikers, as each student faces distinct and personal consequences should they lose their jobs. They will be taking a vote on Friday on how to proceed, and some appear ready to submit grades.\\n\\nThe strike “has been a longtime coming,” says Yulia Gilichinskaya, a student in the Film and Digital Media Department and co-president of the Graduate Student Association. She is part of a group of students that for the past year or so has been organizing around the cost-of-living crisis. A majority of student union members in Santa Cruz voted down the statewide contract signed by the UAW in summer 2018 because the annual three-percent wage increase cannot keep up with their housing costs. After Measure M on rent control failed to pass in the 2018 midterm election, Gilichinskaya says, the students started to call for a campus-specific solution out of a feeling they had no other recourse. “Everyone is so damn desperate. Some of us have been homeless and a lot of us are one paycheck away from homelessness. Housing in the Bay Area is pushing boundaries in terms of what is possible in organizing.”\\n\\nIn Santa Cruz, downzoning is one of the main culprits, according to Steven McKay, associate professor of sociology and director of the UCSC Center for Labor Studies. Since the 1990s, county residents have voted for leadership that prioritizes single-family homes on large lots. Attempts to build more affordable, multi-family homes have been met with resistance by NIMBY organizations that push for zoning regulations and land-use policies to block new development. In Santa Cruz, many are averse to even four-story buildings. “There’s a skyrocketing demand for housing, but no new housing, especially affordable housing,” McKay says. This has only intensified in recent years, as Santa Cruz became a commuter town for Silicon Valley. And with a student body of over 18,000, some of whom are squeezed into converted common dorm areas the university has been under pressure for a while to build more housing. A plan to build 3,000 new beds for graduate students has been frozen for over a year due to legal challenges from environmental groups.\\n\\nMcKay says the problem is much bigger than just Santa Cruz, and that if the university concedes, it would push the state to more fully fund the entire UC system, one of the largest employers in California. “California is as flush as ever. It has a $20 billion surplus in its budget,” he says. “The strike is a real opportunity for UC to lead on a much bigger national issue: the funding of public higher education. The strike’s caught fire because it speaks to the real need for living wages and for truly affordable college for everyone.”\\n\\nGraduate student instructors, readers and graders across the UC system earn $2,400 a month, for nine months—around $21,000 a year—as part of their union contract with the United Auto Workers Local 2865, which represents more than 18,000 academic workers in the state. With average rents in Santa Cruz at $2,611 per month, many students live under extreme rent burden, paying 50–70 percent of their gross income on rent and utilities. According to a report released in October 2019, over half of renter households (nearly 21,300 of all 35,734 households) in Santa Cruz County were considered rent burdened. (Rent burden is defined as spending more than 30 percent of one’s income on rent.)\\n\\n“We don’t know what our paycheck will look like this month. People are afraid they won’t get paid,” says Kelsey James, a fourth-year psychology student on strike and a member of the union. “But we also know this situation is untenable. If we didn’t do it now, people would soon be doing the same thing. It’s just unlivable. People are living in their cars. Everyone has a story about what they can’t afford.” James says she pays $1,000 for a room in a house with two other roommates, spending nearly 60 percent of her income on housing.\\n\\nIn January, the university responded to the grade strike by proposing two measures for the next academic year: a $2,500 need-based housing fellowship; and for doctoral students, a five-year funding program that guarantees part-time teaching assistant work. Students rejected the proposal, which they say would only decrease their rent burden by 5 percent.\\n\\nWhile students face a tough decision on whether and how to continue their strike, their efforts have already gotten widespread attention and galvanized a sense of solidarity. The union has called on the university to come to the bargaining table and reach a resolution. Members have raised over $85,000 dollars for a support fund. Students at UC Davis, UC San Diego, UC Berkeley and others have been emboldened to make their own calls for a COLA and held various sit-ins and marches this week. Both UCLA students and UC Santa Barbara students indicated a willingness to go on full strike if UCSC students are fired.\\n\\nUCSC faculty members have urged the university to halt disciplinary measures and instead open a direct line of communication. Some have joined students at the picket line. The Santa Cruz City Council voted unanimously to endorse the students’ demands. The executive board of the Council of UC Faculty Associations, representing faculty on all 10 UC campuses, issued an open letter of support urging a resolution. Over 2,000 non-UCSC faculty across the country have signed a noncooperation pledge to boycott UCSC until it “provides a more equitable standard of living.” The West Virginia teachers who went on strike and successfully increased their wages in 2018, sent a letter of support. City bus drivers in Santa Cruz have refused to cross the picket and drive into campus.

That scary guy in Pennsylvania.\\n\\nThe world seems like a pretty big mess right now.\\n\\nThe climate? Not top of the agenda.\\n\\nPolls indicate Americans care less about climate change than pretty much anything. Even among those of us who are inclined to care about the planet, there\\'s the holy-crap-I-can\\'t-even-deal-with-it factor. It seems too big, too daunting -- and like so much damage is already being done.\\n\\nBut I put those doubts completely to rest on Sunday as I wove through hopeful crowds of thousands at the People\\'s Climate March in New York, which was billed by organizers as the biggest rally against climate change world has ever seen. There was no independent estimate of the size of the crowd immediately available, but organizers said as many as 310,000 people attended -- many from far reaches of the globe, ahead of a UN climate summit here this week.\\n\\nMarchers sound urgent call for climate change action\\n\\nWorld leaders are expected to discuss the topic and, hopefully, build momentum for more-concrete climate talks in Paris next year. Climate marches also were held on Sunday in 2,800 other locations, according to organizers, from Paris to Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.\\n\\nRelated: \\'I\\'m on the front lines of this crisis\\'\\n\\nIn a world disinclined to care about the urgent threat of climate change, these were the people who are both experiencing the crisis -- right now, not 100 years in the future -- and who also believe there\\'s still time to make a difference.\\n\\n\"I am fearful, but for the most part, I\\'m optimistic,\" said Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, a 26-year-old who came to New York from the Marshall Islands, in the Pacific. Sea level rise already is washing away grave sites and lashing homes on the islands, she said. She came to New York in part to represent her 7-month-old daughter, who she hopes will be able to live on the island, rather than relocate. \"I see this movement and I see this march and I see all these thousands of people coming together for climate change; I believe there are things we can do to change the world.\\n\\n\"I believe it can happen.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s not possible for her to ignore this issue like the rest of us.\\n\\n\"The thing you have to imagine is the ocean is huge next to our islands,\" she told me. \"Our islands are completely tiny ... You don\\'t get to forget how vulnerable you are.\"\\n\\nThe march, which wandered along the edge of Central Park and through the streets of Midtown Manhattan, took on the feel of a celebration for a planet that\\'s worth saving rather than a funeral for one already lost.\\n\\nI saw accordions, drums, a giant-dancing-puppet representation of Mother Earth. The mood was a bit surprising considering some climate scientists and policy experts say the world already has acted far too slowly to curb carbon emissions and that we\\'re locked into some level of harmful warming. The atmosphere already has warmed about 1-degree Celsius because of people, said Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org, which helped organize the events. \"That\\'s enormous,\" he told me. \"It\\'s been enough already to melt the summer Arctic\" and to increase ocean acidification by 30%. \"As astonishing as those changes are, they are a very small trailer for the horror movie that\\'s coming if we don\\'t act quickly,\" he said.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s what people here were calling for: Quick, assured action. A reduction in harmful carbon emissions. Real targets, based on science. New, clean industry. A revolution, really -- an economy that looks beyond the fossil era. I met people from China, Tibet, West Virginia, Arizona -- all of whom want the world to act.\\n\\n\"We are here representing the Earth,\" said Whatwenïne \"Freida\" Jacques, 64, who moving with the crowd in a motorized wheelchair. \"I really think this should have happened a good 20 years ago.\"\\n\\nJayeesha Dutta, a 36-year-old from New Orleans, marched in New York wearing a Mardi Gras mask and carrying one side of a banner that read, \"The Seas Are Rising and So Are We!\"\\n\\n\"We are at the front lines of climate change,\" she said, echoing a familiar refrain. \"Our communities are going to be the first climate change refugees of our country ... As we lose the land, we\\'re also going to be losing cultures.\"\\n\\nSome of the most poignant pleas for action came from people impacted by Superstorm Sandy, which hit New York in October 2012, filling subways with water, displacing coastal residents and killing more than 100 people in the United States as well as more than 60 in the Caribbean and Canada. Hurricanes are expected to continue to get stronger as the climate warms, and locals here fear a repeat tragedy.\\n\\nI met Silaka Cox, 19, from the Rockaways, at the city\\'s edge. It was hit hard by Sandy. If climate change isn\\'t stopped, Cox told me she worries her community, where she still lives even though it means a 1 1/2 hour commute to New York University, where she\\'s a sophomore, might not be viable. \"The sea levels are just going to keep rising if we don\\'t do anything about it,\" she said.\\n\\nAnd I met Brendan McAvoy, a 21-year old who lost his home in the storm. He came to the rally Sunday with a blue sign simply reading, \"Hope.\" The letters were made of sand he collected from the beach in New Jersey. He told me he initially made the sign for his mom, to help get her through the months after the storm.\\n\\n\"That\\'s all you have when the water takes away your house and takes away your family,\" he said, referencing the fact that he attributes his father\\'s death, after the storm, in part to the stress caused by the displacement. \"All you have is hope.\"\\n\\nClimate change is a collective tinnitus -- always ringing in the background, but so constant and seemingly incurable that we try to ignore it.\\n\\nThat\\'s impossible for McAvoy and the others I met on Sunday. For them, climate change is sounding an alarm far too loud to be silenced.\\n\\nTo demonstrate this in the most literal of ways, rally attendees raised their hands in the air in a moment of silence at 12:58 p.m. Then at 1 p.m., they let out a collective yelp.\\n\\nIt was so loud and heartfelt it gave me chills.\\n\\nI hope it brought some degree of comfort -- and maybe inspiration -- to all those attending whose lives already are being shaken up by this crisis, which the world should act far more urgently to address. As I heard from many people I met, we have the technology and the popular will to fix this.

His request is narrowly targeted and rooted in a legal technicality.\\n\\nBut supporters of the drive to get clarity on Trump\\'s taxes argue that it is vital for Congress to establish whether Trump has any conflicts of interest that bear on his official duties and to see whether he is getting payments from foreign states in violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution.\\n\\nDemocrats have also justified an effort to open Trump\\'s returns as a way to examine how much he and his businesses -- from which he is not fully divested -- benefited from the massive GOP tax reform law.\\n\\nTrump has also been accused, notably by his former attorney Michael Cohen, of both deflating and over estimating the value of his properties and assets in insurance claims and on loan applications — a practice on which tax returns could shed light.\\n\\n\\'Within our ... rights\\'\\n\\nNeal, who was facing increasing pressure from liberal activists to speed up a meticulous process of requesting the returns, insisted his move was about \"policy not politics,\" in a letter to the IRS.\\n\\n\"I am certain we are within our legitimate legislative, legal and oversight rights,\" said Neal, a 16-term congressman who is not well known outside his home state of Massachusetts or the halls of power on Capitol Hill, said in a statement.\\n\\nNeal, 70, will now shed his relative obscurity and become one of the top political generals in the Democratic battle against Trump -- and will have to accept all the vitriol, attacks and mockery that comes with taking on the President.\\n\\nThough he insisted his move was not political, it will inevitably be seen in the context of a widening use of Democratic muscle following the party\\'s capture of the House in November.\\n\\nJust this week, House committee chairs have readied subpoenas to demand the full release of Robert Mueller\\'s Russia report and to examine accusations of abuses in the White House\\'s handling of top secret security clearances.\\n\\nNeal\\'s intervention came less than two weeks after Mueller ended his investigation and a summary by Attorney General William Barr said the special counsel did not establish there was cooperation between Trump\\'s team and Russia\\'s election meddling scheme or decide whether the President obstructed justice.\\n\\nThe request dampened the hopes of liberals in the party\\'s grass roots that an impeachment saga could be looming. The New York Times, however, reported on Wednesday evening that some of Mueller\\'s investigators have told associates that the findings of the original report are more damaging for the President than Barr indicated.\\n\\nTrump shrugged off the Democratic request for his taxes on Wednesday evening, using similar phraseology as when he was asked during the campaign about his taxes.\\n\\nAsked whether he would comply with the Democratic request, Trump said that \"until such time as I\\'m not under audit I would not be inclined to do that.\"\\n\\nAnother unreasonable scrutiny?\\n\\nJUST WATCHED These are Trump\\'s Fox News hires (2018) Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH These are Trump\\'s Fox News hires (2018) 01:24\\n\\nRepublicans are certain to argue that the request for Trump\\'s taxes is yet another example of unreasonable scrutiny by Democrats frustrated with indications that Mueller\\'s report will not doom Trump\\'s presidency. One reason that the request appears to be comparatively narrow -- for returns between 2013 and 2018 -- could be to confine the search to the period immediately before and during Trump\\'s political career and to stave off accusations that the Democrats are embarking on an illegitimate fishing expedition.\\n\\nThe drama threatens to draw in some key members of the Trump administration -- including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\\n\\nMnuchin said at a congressional hearing in March that he would \"comply with the law\" if asked to release Trump\\'s returns -- though also suggested the final call could rest with the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service.\\n\\nIt is significant therefore that Neal\\'s request was made to the IRS and not the Treasury.\\n\\nIt is certain that the President would see any decision by Mnuchin to get involved and comply with Neal\\'s request as a flagrant personal betrayal.\\n\\nNeal\\'s gambit now puts Charles Rettig, the current IRS commissioner, who was nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate, in a delicate political position.\\n\\nIt is all but certain that the administration will take steps to challenge the Democratic interpretation of the law on which the request is based. Such a scenario could see the Ways and Means committee issue a subpoena after Neal\\'s April 10 deadline and the unleashing of a complicated legal duel.\\n\\nThe fight could become a cause celebre that works its way through the court system and even reaches the Supreme Court, and the conservative majority that is newly restocked by Trump.\\n\\nThe committee spent weeks plotting its move in the hope of preparing the most complete case possible for the court battle to come.\\n\\nNeal argued that he needed to see Trump\\'s returns in order to properly consider legislation related to the IRS\\'s practice of auditing sitting presidents.\\n\\n\"Under the Internal Revenue Manual, individual income tax returns of a President are subject to mandatory examination, but this practice is IRS policy and not codified in the Federal tax laws,\" Neal wrote in a letter to the IRS.\\n\\n\"It is necessary for the committee to determine the scope of any such examination and whether it includes a review of underlying business activities required to be reported on the individual income tax return.\"\\n\\nTrump has long seen scrutiny of his complicated and difficult to penetrate personal finances as a red line that should not be crossed.\\n\\nIn addition to Trump\\'s personal records, Neal requested information from the President\\'s business entities, including the Bedminster golf course LLC, as well as DJT Holdings LLC, DJT Holdings Managing Member LLC, DTTM Operations LLC, DTTM Operations Managing Member Cor, LFB Acquisition Member Corp and LFB Acquisition LLC.\\n\\nNeal\\'s request is specific and under the section of the IRS code that he is using only he, and not other chairmen of House committees can see the returns.\\n\\nIt would require a vote in the committee to release any such documents to the public if they are eventually handed over.', '(CNN) How do all seven cars and the engine of an Amtrak train jump the rails, sending passengers, luggage, laptops and more flying?\\n\\nOne possibility loomed over all others Wednesday: speed.\\n\\nMayor: \\'Clearly he was reckless and irresponsible\\'\\n\\nMayor: \\'Clearly he was reckless and irresponsible\\' 07:18\\n\\nMayor: \\'Clearly he was reckless and irresponsible\\'\\n\\nAuthorities haven\\'t said what caused the derailment of Amtrak Northeast Regional Train 188 in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, but Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter had harsh words for the train\\'s engineer.\\n\\n\"Clearly it was reckless in terms of the driving by the engineer.

The train was traveling about 106 mph as it headed into a left turn. The speed limit immediately before the curve was 80 mph.\\n\\nAn official with direct knowledge of the investigation earlier said that authorities were focusing on speed as a possible cause, given the angles of the wreckage and type of damage to the cars. The recorder, or \"black box,\" discovered at the scene could be pivotal by showing just that, former NTSB official John Goglia said.\\n\\nPeter Goelz, once a top NTSB figure and now a CNN analyst, predicted that a definitive conclusion could come soon.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid that this train might be going too fast for this turn,\" he said.\\n\\nSumwalt has said only that his team will examine things such as the condition of the track and the train, how the signals operated and \"human performance.\"\\n\\nEven if it\\'s determined the train was going too fast, that could be because of the engineer or a mechanical issue, such as faulty brakes.\\n\\n\"You have a lot of questions, we have a lot of questions,\" Sumwalt told reporters. \"We intend to answer many of those questions in the next 24 to 48 hours.\"\\n\\nMidshipman, AP staffer among the 7 dead\\n\\nSome 238 passengers and five crew members were on the train when it crashed around 9:30 p.m. Tuesday.

One of those hurt is the train\\'s engineer, who received medical treatment and was interviewed by police, Mayor Nutter said.\\n\\nBostian, the engineer, initially told Philadelphia police he could not recall his speed, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation.\\n\\nDetectives have since tried to interview the engineer of the train further. They brought him in Wednesday, but he refused to be interviewed, and left with a lawyer, according to a police official.\\n\\nPolice are in the process of getting a search warrant for the engineer\\'s phone records so they can determine whether he was distracted at the time of the crash, the law enforcement official said.\\n\\nDetermining Bostian\\'s blood-alcohol level immediately after the crash would be a normal part of the investigation, according to Sumwalt. Regulations require Amtrak to take a blood sample.\\n\\n\"It should have been done, and I have no reason to believe it was not done,\" Sumwalt said.\\n\\nAccording to Bostian\\'s LinkedIn profile, he has been an engineer for Amtrak since 2010, and was a conductor for four years before that. Prior to Amtrak, Bostian worked as a cashier at Target.\\n\\nCNN spoke to a neighbor of the engineer near his home in Forest Hills, New York, who last saw him two weeks ago.

Called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, it’s based on the idea that a fetus at 20 weeks’ gestation can feel pain.\\n\\n“The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act will protect the voiceless, the vulnerable, and the marginalized,\" said Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), the House majority leader, in a statement in September (the House passed the bill in early October). \"It will protect those children who science has proven can feel pain.” While the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate because of the 60 votes required, President Donald Trump has promised to sign the it if it passes; during the campaign, he said such a bill “would end painful late-term abortions nationwide.”\\n\\nIn fact, the best available science shows that fetuses probably cannot feel pain until well after 20 weeks. Advocates of abortion rights say 20-week bans at the state level have harmed women, forcing them to travel to another state, often at great expense, to get the care they seek. And opponents of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act fear that, even if it never passes, it will ultimately spread dangerous misinformation.\\n\\nThe Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is not based on accepted science\\n\\nThe bill, sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), would ban abortions after 20 weeks nationwide, except in cases of rape, incest, or a threat to the life of the mother. A doctor who performed an abortion after 20 weeks, except in those cases, could face up to five years in prison. Women seeking abortions would not be penalized under the bill.\\n\\nThe text of the bill includes a section on the science of fetal pain, which states that “there is substantial medical evidence that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain at least by 20 weeks after fertilization, if not earlier.”\\n\\nHowever, the general scientific consensus is that no such evidence exists. “There’s actually conclusive evidence that shows that the neurologic structures in a fetus aren’t completely laid down and working yet until much further along in pregnancy, we think even the third trimester,” said Jennifer Conti, a clinical assistant professor and OB-GYN at Stanford University and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. Twenty weeks, she said, “is just an arbitrary limit set in place by politicians that has no medical or scientific backing.”\\n\\nThe most comprehensive look at fetal pain to date was a literature review published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2005. According to the review, the structures needed for fetuses to feel pain begin to develop between 23 and 30 weeks’ gestation, and studies of premature babies suggest they can’t feel pain until 29 or 30 weeks. While this review is now 12 years old, it still holds true — “no research since its publication has contradicted its findings,” wrote Mark S. DeFrancesco on behalf of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2015.\\n\\nThe bill makes a number of claims that contradict scientific consensus. For instance, the bill states that “after 20 weeks, the unborn child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human, for example, by recoiling.” However, according to the group Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH) at the University of California, San Francisco, “limb withdrawal occurs even in full-term babies in response to non-painful tactile sensations, including light touch. Thus the appearance of limb withdrawal on ultrasound represents a reflex rather than a response to pain.”\\n\\nThe bill, said Amy Friedrich-Karnik, senior federal policy adviser at the Center for Reproductive Rights, is “basically relying on junk science.”\\n\\nThis bill isn’t new — and we’ve already seen some of its effects\\n\\nThe Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act previously passed the House in 2015, as Jessie Hellmann notes at the Hill, but failed in the Senate. Similar bans have also passed in more than a dozen states.\\n\\nPeople seek abortions after 20 weeks for a variety of reasons. One patient who came to Conti seeking an abortion said that a clinic the previous week had told her she was 12 weeks pregnant. But the clinic turned out to be a crisis pregnancy center that had given her incorrect information — she was actually 21 weeks along. “Essentially her care was sabotaged,” Conti said — and under a 20-week ban, she would have been unable to get an abortion.\\n\\nPatients can also be pushed to get abortions later in pregnancy by financial or logistical problems, like difficulty getting to a clinic or getting together the money for the procedure. In states with 20-week bans already in place, patients who need later abortions typically have to travel to another state, said Friedrich-Karnik. That can cause enormous financial strain, she said. But “to imagine a ban like this nationwide and to think that no one could even have the opportunity to go to another state to get the care is frightening.”\\n\\nThe bill passed the House by a vote of 237-189. It probably will not pass the Senate, Hellmann writes, where it would need a 60-vote majority. Republicans may be using Monday’s vote as a way to put pressure on Democratic senators in red states, like Claire McCaskill (D-MO) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Hellmann noted in January. Both voted against the 20-week ban in 2015, and anti-abortion activists hope a vote against the bill this year will make the senators vulnerable in November’s elections.\\n\\nEven if it never becomes federal law, Conti said, the bill can still cause harm. “By even putting this issue on a national platform,” she said, “you’re misleading the American people.”\\n\\n“You’re really providing false and dangerous information that is affecting millions of women,” she added.', 'A move to shift power away from the New York Federal Reserve Bank is finding some powerful friends in Congress amid lingering worries that a key part of the central bank is too cozy with Wall Street.\\n\\nTwo Republicans running the banking committees have both said they plan to explore proposals from the outspoken, former Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher that would roll back a long-standing provision that gives the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank an automatic position as vice chairman of a powerful committee and weaken New York’s oversight of Wall Street banks.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nThe politics may be ripe for chipping away at the power of the Federal Reserve, uniting liberals who want to crack down on Wall Street, Republicans who don’t like the Fed’s easy money policies and libertarians who are suspicious of the Fed altogether.\\n\\nThe move also reflects some regional rivalries within the Fed — the New York Federal Reserve Bank often overshadows other regional banks, and Fisher, known as a rabble rouser in Federal Reserve politics, has been lobbying for a change to the power structure.\\n\\nBanking Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) and House Financial Services Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) say they’re open to reducing the power of the New York Fed, and the move has the potential to appeal to Democrats who have been critical of the Fed, like Sen.

Mark Warner (D-Va.), a moderate who said he hasn’t taken a position on the proposals yet, said, “I do think there’s been some legitimate questions of the role of the New York Fed.”\\n\\nFisher, who retired Thursday after 10 years at the Dallas Fed, wants to yank the New York Fed’s permanent position as vice chair of the all-powerful Federal Open Market Committee, the panel charged with making monetary policy decisions, which met Wednesday.\\n\\nWhile the New York Fed president could still participate in monetary policy discussions, he or she would no longer always get a vote. Fisher suggested the job should rotate among the regional Federal Reserve Banks every two years.\\n\\nThe move would upend the current structure, as the New York Fed has had a lock on that spot since 1936, thanks largely to its role as the infrastructure, which supplies the trading desk that carries out the Fed’s monetary policy decisions.\\n\\nFisher is also proposing that other regional Fed banks oversee some of the Wall Street giants in a move aimed at addressing criticism the New York Fed missed warning signs of the financial crisis, is too soft on Wall Street and holds too much power and influence at the Fed.\\n\\n“The greatest concern appears to be the problem of regulatory capture by the largest and most powerful institutions,” Fisher said in a February speech in New York laying out his plan.\\n\\nWall Street critics have been suspicious of the New York Fed since it and its then leader, Timothy Geithner, played a key role in responding to the 2008 financial crisis and the bailouts that entailed.\\n\\nLate last year its current president, William Dudley, was hauled before the Senate Banking Committee after reports from ProPublica and NPR’s This American Life that focused on a New York Fed examiner who said her warnings about certain business practices and deals at Goldman Sachs were ignored or brushed aside by her superiors. She provided recordings of her dealings with Fed officials to back up her case.\\n\\n“We’ve got on tape higher-ups at the New York Fed calling off the regulators,” Warren told Dudley at the November hearing. “And I’m just asking the same kind of question — is there a cultural problem at the New York Fed? I think the evidence suggests that there is.”\\n\\nFormer Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher. | AP photo\\n\\nThe two most powerful lawmakers on financial policy say they are closely looking at Fisher’s proposal.\\n\\n“I’m going to take a very serious look at that proposal,” said Hensarling. Hensarling said his panel will soon be working on another package of changes to reshape the Federal Reserve and “ensure we have a predictable rules-based monetary policy that works for working Americans. But anything that Richard Fisher proposes is going to get a very serious review from our committee.”\\n\\nSimilarly, Shelby told reporters last week he plans to pursue the proposal.\\n\\n“This is 2015 and things have changed,” said Shelby, who is quietly working on a Senate legislative package. “We have a shift in population. Everything used to be in New York and a lot of it’s not.”\\n\\nPart of the idea’s popularity may also be that it’s coming from Fisher, who is a strange political animal.\\n\\nHe ran for U.S. Senate as a conservative Democrat back in 1993 — which he now calls his “midlife crisis” moment, losing to former Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas). He worked in the Carter and Clinton Administrations and later worked for Henry Kissinger’s consulting firm, before joining the Dallas Fed. He also spent much of the 1990s running his own investment firm.\\n\\nSome Republicans like Fisher, because he often bucked the majority on the Fed, opposing the continued expansion of economic stimulus measures, which he called “monetary Ritalin” for the markets. Fisher is considered a “hawk,” a monetary conservative who worries most about inflation, which jives with the thinking of Republicans and their policies.\\n\\n“I have the highest regard for Richard Fisher, he’ll certainly be missed, his voice on monetary policy,” said Hensarling, who represents part of Dallas, although not Fisher.\\n\\nFisher is also known for being one of the louder voices calling for regulators to chop up the giant megabanks into smaller banks. And two years ago, he took an unprecedented step for a Fed president of attending the an annual gathering of conservatives, Conservative Political Action Conference, to make the case for breaking up Wall Street giants.\\n\\nThe big question now is whether his proposals can make it into legislative text.\\n\\nWhile Shelby likes the idea, other senators on his committee, including Republican Bob Corker and Democrats Jack Reed and Heidi Heitkamp said they’re not ready to weigh in. For his part, Reed has a different bill to require the president of the New York Fed to be presidentially appointed and confirmed by Congress rather than selected by its board.\\n\\nHowever, the ranking Democrat on the panel, Sen. Sherrod Brown, is cool to the proposal and said he doesn’t think Fisher’s proposal “changes much.” And Sen. Bob. Menendez (D-N.J.) said he has concerns about shifting power away from the New York Fed.\\n\\n“I think the New York Fed plays an important role in the Fed system. And I don’t take lightly to some of the changes being discussed,” Menendez said. “Some of what I’ve seen is too far reaching.”\\n\\nWhen POLITICO asked about the proposal in a press conference recently, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said she thinks the current system “works well,” and that there were good reasons for the current structure giving New York a permanent spot on the FOMC. But she added it was up to Congress.\\n\\nThe Dallas Federal Reserve said Fisher was unavailable to comment in his last week on the job, but a spokesman confirmed Fisher has been fielding questions from lawmakers on the hill on his proposal.\\n\\nAnd Fisher is reportedly thrilled that there’s interest in this idea, said Camden Fine, president and CEO of the Independent Community Bankers of America, which is also pushing for Fisher’s proposal. Fine said he spoke with Fisher just last week about the idea, which “would balance the Federal Reserve,” and reflect that “economic centers are no longer concentrated on Manhattan island,” Fine said.\\n\\nFisher also assured Fine that his retirement from the Dallas Fed won’t dampen his enthusiastic voice for pushing his proposals. “He’s not going anywhere,” Fine said.\\n\\nFollow @politico', 'BuzzFeed was once notorious for traffic-generating “listicles,” but has since become an impressive outlet for deep investigative journalism under editor-in-chief Ben Smith. That outlet was prominently in the news this week thanks to its “bombshell” story about President Trump and Michael Cohen: a story that, like so many others of its kind, blew up in its face, this time when the typically mute Robert Mueller’s office took the extremely rare step to label its key claims “inaccurate.” But in homage to BuzzFeed’s past viral glory, following are the top ten worst media failures in two-plus-years of Trump/Russia reporting. They are listed in reverse order, as measured by the magnitude of the embarrassment, the hysteria they generated on social media and cable news, the level of journalistic recklessness that produced them, and the amount of damage and danger they caused. This list was extremely difficult to compile in part because news outlets (particularly CNN and MSNBC) often delete from the internet the video segments of their most embarrassing moments. Even more challenging was the fact that the number of worthy nominees is so large that highly meritorious entrees had to be excluded, but are acknowledged at the end with (dis)honorable mention status. Note that all of these “errors” go only in one direction: namely, exaggerating the grave threat posed by Moscow and the Trump circle’s connection to it. It’s inevitable that media outlets will make mistakes on complex stories. If that’s being done in good faith, one would expect the errors would be roughly 50/50 in terms of the agenda served by the false stories. That is most definitely not the case here. Just as was true in 2002 and 2003, when the media clearly wanted to exaggerate the threat posed by Saddam Hussein and thus all of its “errors” went in that direction, virtually all of its major “errors” in this story are devoted to the same agenda and script: 10.

But then they kept diluting the story with editor’s notes – to admit that the malware was found on a laptop not connected to the U.S. electric grid at all – until finally acknowledging, days later, that the whole story was false, since the malware had nothing to do with Russia or with the U.S. electric grid:\\n\\nBreaking: Russian hackers penetrated U.S. electricity grid through a utility in Vermont https://t.co/LED11lL7ej — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) December 31, 2016\\n\\nNEW: \"One of the world\\'s leading thugs, [Putin] has been attempting to hack our electric grid,\" says VT Gov.

But then teams of neurologists began calling into doubt that these personnel had suffered any brain injuries at all – that instead they appear to have experienced collective psychosomatic symptoms – and then biologists published findings that the “strange sounds” the U.S. “diplomats” reported hearing were identical to those emitted by a common Caribbean male cricket during mating season.\\n\\nAn @NBCNews exclusive: After more than a year of mystery, Russia is the main suspect in the sonic attacks that sickened 26 U.S. diplomats and intelligence officials in Cuba. @MitchellReports has the latest. pic.twitter.com/NEI9PJ9CpD — TODAY (@TODAYshow) September 11, 2018\\n\\nWow >> U.S. has signals intelligence linking the sonic attacks on Americans in Cuba and China to *Russia* https://t.co/FbNla0vu9W — Andrew Desiderio (@desiderioDC) September 11, 2018\\n\\nFollowing NBC report about sonic attacks, @SenCoryGardner renews calls for declaring Russia a state sponsor of terror https://t.co/wrnubfecom — Niels Lesniewski (@nielslesniewski) September 11, 2018\\n\\n5.

There were, however, two problems with this story: first, CNN got caught blatantly lying when its reporters claimed that “contacted by CNN, one of Cohen’s attorneys, Lanny Davis, declined to comment” (in fact, Davis was one of CNN’s key sources, if not its only source, for this story), and second, numerous other outlets retracted the story after the source, Davis, admitted it was a lie.

Donald Trump Jr. Was Offered Advanced Access to the WikiLeaks Email Archive (CNN/MSNBC) The morning of December 9, 2017, launched one of the most humiliating spectacles in the history of the U.S. media. With a tone so grave and bombastic that it is impossible to overstate, CNN went on the air and announced a major exclusive: Donald Trump, Jr. was offered by email advanced access to the trove of DNC and Podesta emails published by WikiLeaks – meaning before those emails were made public. Within an hour, MSNBC’s Ken Dilanian, using a tone somehow even more unhinged, purported to have “independently confirmed” this mammoth, blockbuster scoop, which, they said, would have been the smoking gun showing collusion between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks over the hacked emails (while the YouTube clips have been removed, you can still watch one of the amazing MSNBC videos here). There was, alas, just one small problem with this massive, blockbuster story: it was totally and completely false. The email which Trump, Jr. received that directed him to the WikiLeaks archive was sent after WikiLeaks published it online for the whole world to see, not before. Rather than some super secretive operative giving Trump, Jr. advanced access, as both CNN and MSNBC told the public for hours they had confirmed, it was instead just some totally pedestrian message from a random member of the public suggesting Trump, Jr. review documents the whole world was already talking about. All of the anonymous sources CNN and MSNBC cited somehow all got the date of the email wrong. To date, when asked how they both could have gotten such a massive story so completely wrong in the same way, both CNN and MSNBC have adopted the posture of the CIA by maintaining complete silence and refusing to explain how it could possibly be that all of their “multiple, independent sources” got the date wrong on the email in the same way, to be as incriminating – and false – as possible. Nor, needless to say, will they identify their sources who, in concert, fed them such inflammatory and utterly false information. Sadly, CNN and MSNBC have deleted most traces of the most humiliating videos from the internet, including demanding that YouTube remove copies. But enough survives to document just what a monumental, horrifying, and utterly inexcusable debacle this was. Particularly amazing is the clip of the CNN reporter (see below) having to admit the error for the first time, as he awkwardly struggles to pretend that it’s not the massive, horrific debacle that it so obviously is:\\n\\nKnowingly soliciting or receiving anything of value from a foreign national for campaign purposes violates the Federal Election Campaign Act.

The job market suddenly looks a lot weaker than economists\\' had thought.\\n\\nHiring slumped sharply in December, as the economy added only 74,000 jobs, according to the government. This was the weakest month for job growth since January 2011 and came as a huge surprise to economists, who were expecting an addition of 193,000 jobs.\\n\\nFor all of 2013, the economy added 2.2 million jobs -- on par with 2012\\'s gains.\\n\\nSome economists believe December\\'s weak job gains could be a fluke, given other solid data recently.

That sector lost 16,000 jobs in December.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the unemployment rate fell to 6.7% in December, but the drop came mainly from workers leaving the labor force.\\n\\nJob market dropouts could be doing other things, like retiring, enrolling in educational programs or taking care of relatives. But many have simply given up hope of finding work.\\n\\nOnly 62.8% of the adult population is participating in the labor market now -- meaning they either have a job or are looking for one. That matches the lowest level since 1978.\\n\\nRelated: \\'I just want a job\\'\\n\\nIn the job market\\'s 2007 heyday, unemployment was under 5%, but in the two years that followed, the recession wiped out 8.7 million jobs. To this day, not all those jobs have returned.\\n\\n\"We\\'re going to have a long-term unemployment crisis for a long time,\" said Heidi Shierholz, economist with the Economic Policy Institute.\\n\\nAlong those lines, CNNMoney has talked to several people who have been unemployed for a while. Jamie May has been looking for a job for more than a year. Formerly a senior manager for a corporate housing company, she had a comfortable six-figure salary before the recession hit. But since then has been laid off three times.\\n\\n\"There are days I\\'m numb,\" she said. \"The mental toll -- the depression -- the feeling of being unworthy and unwanted, after being highly successful. I just want a job.\"\\n\\nBased in Austin, Texas, she has submitted applications for positions around the country, and has even indicated she would be willing to take jobs in the $30,000 to $40,000 range.\\n\\n\"The feedback is -- \\'you\\'re great, you have the credentials, but we want someone who knows the local market.\\' Or, \\' we\\'re concerned you\\'ll leave when the economy picks up and you get a better offer,\\'\" she said.\\n\\nFred Royal in Houston used to work as an administrative assistant for a grocery chain. He lost his job in March, and gets the same message in interviews.\\n\\n\"Many have said they think I will leave for a better paying job,\" he said. \"Better paying job? I can\\'t even get one job.\"\\n\\nRelated: Where the unemployed are being cut off\\n\\nBoth May and Royal were among the 1.3 million Americans who received their final check in federal unemployment benefits last week after Congress agreed on a budget that left out the recession-era program. Democrats are pushing for an extension of the program, but Republicans insist on finding a way to pay for it through cost-cutting elsewhere.\\n\\nThe haggling over budget cuts versus aid to the still fragile economy exemplifies the ongoing tension between Washington policymakers.\\n\\nWhile Congress has largely focused on reducing government spending, the Federal Reserve has been pumping trillions of dollars into the economy in an attempt to help the job market.\\n\\nFed Chairman Ben Bernanke will end his second term at the central bank later this month without reaching his goal of \"full employment.\"\\n\\n\"The recovery clearly remains incomplete,\" he said in a speech last week, blaming part of the problem on government policy. \"Excessively tight near-term fiscal policies have likely been counterproductive,\" he said.\\n\\nThe federal government has cut 98,000 jobs over the past three years, not including the Postal Service, which is independently funded but has also been slashing jobs. The Postal Service workforce is around its lowest level since the 1960s.\\n\\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\\'s Analytics forecasts it could take until the end of 2016 to get to a 5.5% unemployment rate. Shierholz calculates it could take even longer to get to a pre-recession job market -- when unemployment was below 5%.\\n\\n\"Even if we did have 200,000 jobs a month, we would need five years to get there,\" she said.\\n\\nAre you unemployed? Share your story with CNNMoney\\'s Annalyn Kurtz.', \"“The goal is not just to make the tax code more progressive, but also to obtain adequate revenue to finance progressive spending programs,” said Peter Orszag, a vice chairman at Citigroup and a former White House budget director. “Making the tax code more progressive but locking into a vastly inadequate revenue base is not doing the notion of progressivity overall any favors.”\\n\\nAccording to calculations by the independent Tax Policy Center, if Congress did nothing and all tax increases took effect at the end of the year, the hit would be broad but the brunt of it would fall on high-income households. Taxpayers in the bottom quintile of the income distribution would see a $412 bigger tax bill. For the top 0.1 percent, the average increase would be $633,946.\\n\\nOnly a small handful of policy voices on the left are making the case for the tax cuts to fully expire. In part, that is because the economy is still growing slowly, and tax increases have the potential to weaken it. But it is also partly because of structural changes in the economy.\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\n“This is about math and values,” Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said in an e-mail. “Our first priority needs to be extending tax cuts for the middle class. At a time when we need to cut our debt and are asking everyone to chip in, we simply can’t afford to continue extending all of the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.”\\n\\nThe Congressional Budget Office has found that between 1979 and 2007, the top 1 percent of households saw their inflation-adjusted income grow 275 percent. For the bottom 20 percent, it grew just 18 percent, and federal tax and transfer programs also did less and less to reduce income inequality over that period.\\n\\nThe mounting concentration of wealth is even more dramatic. A recent Economic Policy Institute study found that between 1983 and 2010 about three-quarters of all new wealth accrued to the wealthiest 5 percent of households. Over the same period, the bottom 60 percent actually became poorer.\\n\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Moreover, it has led Democrats to expand the “middle class” to encompass the vast majority of taxpayers, with families earning as much as $300,000 a year unlikely to see their taxes go up.\\n\\n“The causes of the massive rise in inequality that we’ve seen that have caused stagnation for the middle class — stagnation at best — for the past 20 or 30 years are not likely to abate,” said Alan B. Krueger, the chairman of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers. “If they’re caused by globalization and skill-biased technological change, they’re likely to continue or accelerate.”\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nLast week, President Obama visited the Virginia home of Tiffany and Richard Santana, a high school teacher and an employee at a car dealership, to make the case. “They’re keeping it together, they’re working hard, they’re meeting their responsibilities,” Mr. Obama said of the Santanas. “For them to be burdened unnecessarily because Democrats and Republicans aren’t coming together to solve those problems gives you a sense of the costs on personal terms.”\\n\\nMr. Obama’s argument for raising revenue from high-income households and keeping taxes low on middle-income households long predates the recession or his time in the White House. Aides say the position stems in part from his belief that long-term economic changes have rewarded the rich and punished many others.\\n\\nBut limiting tax increases to just a small fraction of households might mean raising too little revenue over the long term to finance the programs that Democrats also fiercely want to preserve — Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare, education, supports for lower-income working families and infrastructure, among others, some policy experts on the left say.\\n\\n“It’s perfectly reasonable for the White House to begin collecting more revenue from folks who have done by far the best in pretax terms,” said Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a former economist for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “But ultimately we can’t raise the revenue we need only on the top 2 percent.”\", 'Story highlights Liz Cheney, running for U.S. Senate, declared opposition to same-sex marriage\\n\\nCheney\\'s sister, who is in a same-sex marriage, says Liz is on the wrong side of history\\n\\nRuben Navarrette: Liz Cheney should recognize that same-sex marriage is about freedom\\n\\nHe says his brother, who is gay, persuaded him to change his view on marriage\\n\\nRepublicans portray themselves as the party of family values. Yet, in Wyoming, one prominent group of right wing kinfolk will spend the holidays embroiled in a family feud.\\n\\nYou don\\'t get to choose your family. Still, family members might choose a destructive lifestyle that puts them at odds with loved ones. They make others uncomfortable, and hurt those who love them. These people are often thinking only of themselves, and they haven\\'t considered the consequences of their behavior.\\n\\nLiz Cheney is one of these people. And the destructive lifestyle she has chosen is that of a politician.\\n\\nThe Republican Senate candidate from Wyoming is running to the right of Republican incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi. And because that might not be so easy to do, whenever the challenger offers an opinion on a topic, it\\'s difficult to know if she\\'s speaking from the heart -- or pandering to the lowest common denominator.\\n\\nAn independent political group calling itself the American Principles Fund, which is defending Enzi, recently launched an ad attacking Cheney for opposing a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and supporting the decision of the State Department to give benefits to same-sex partners of employees.\\n\\nRuben Navarrette Jr.\\n\\nThis week, while calling on Enzi to denounce the ad and labeling it \"gutter politics,\" Cheney stood by those earlier positions. During an interview on \"Fox News Sunday,\" she said:\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. If people are in a same-sex relationship and they want their partner to be able to have health benefits or be designated as a beneficiary on their life insurance, there\\'s no reason we shouldn\\'t do that.\"\\n\\nNonetheless, that ad puts Cheney in a tight spot, and given that Wyoming is a very conservative state and given that she\\'s trying to position herself on the far right of the spectrum, she can\\'t be seen as soft on same-sex marriage.\\n\\nThus, in the same interview, she made clear that she doesn\\'t favor allowing same-sex couples to wed and that she supports \"the traditional definition of marriage.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s a position that Cheney has long held. That is part of the problem. In a country where, as public opinion polls make clear, the opinion of so many Americans on same-sex marriage is rapidly evolving due in large part to the fact that young Americans consider this a nonissue, it would have been good to see some personal growth from Cheney.\\n\\nBesides, she should tread lightly on this subject. Why? Because blood is thicker than votes. And because Michael Corleone was right, and -- even in the rough and tumble of politics -- you \"don\\'t ever take sides with anyone against the family.\"\\n\\nAnd, for the Cheney family, this issue is personal. Liz\\'s sister, Mary, is in a same-sex marriage and has two children with her wife and longtime companion, Heather Poe.\\n\\n\"I love Mary very much. I love her family very much. This is just an issue in which we disagree,\" Cheney said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\\n\\nMary Cheney wasn\\'t having any of it. Not long after the interview, she posted this rebuttal on Facebook:\\n\\n\"Liz -- this isn\\'t just an issue on which we disagree -- you\\'re just wrong -- and on the wrong side of history.\"\\n\\nMary also shared a post by Poe, who was likewise bothered by Liz\\'s comments. It read:\\n\\n\"I was watching my sister-in-law on Fox News Sunday (yes Liz, in fifteen states and the District of Columbia you are my sister-in-law) and was very disappointed to hear her say \\'I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage....\\n\\n\"Liz has been a guest in our home, has spent time and shared holidays with our children, and when Mary and I got married in 2012 -- she didn\\'t hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us.\\n\\n\"To have her now say she doesn\\'t support our right to marry is offensive to say the least.\"\\n\\nHere is what Liz Cheney missed: To many proponents of marriage equality, the very idea of \"traditional marriage\" is offensive. You see, tradition is the antithesis of progress. It was once tradition that women didn\\'t have the right to vote, and African-Americans used separate restrooms, and U.S.-born Mexican-Americans were swept up in immigration sweeps. Those things had to change, and they did. In those instances, Americans decided that tradition should take a back seat to things like fairness, justice and equality.\\n\\nThis year, Christmas dinner at the Cheney house is bound to be awkward. The kids are fighting, and that sort of thing always hurts the parents most of all.\\n\\n\"This is an issue we have dealt with privately for many years, and we are pained to see it become public,\" Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife, Lynne, said Monday in a statement.\\n\\nThey insisted that Liz Cheney has \"always treated her sister and her sister\\'s family with love and respect, exactly as she should have done.\" And, they said, \"Compassion is called for, even when there is disagreement about such a fundamental matter.\"\\n\\nThe Cheneys know something about compassion. Over the years, they have been remarkably graceful and supportive toward Mary Cheney and her family. Dick Cheney has challenged conservatives in his own party by saying that gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry and that -- despite calls for a federal ban on same-sex marriage -- the issue should be handled at the state level.\\n\\nI know something about what Liz Cheney is going through. As recently as 14 years ago, I was opposed to same-sex marriage and supported the watered-down alternative: civil unions. I thought this was a battle that wasn\\'t worth fighting and that gay activists should focus their attention elsewhere.\\n\\nHowever, my younger brother, who is gay, wouldn\\'t let me get away with it. He challenged me. He told me I was wrong. He forced me to be a better person. I changed my view, and came to understand that Americans can\\'t have a two-tiered system, where some of us enjoy the right to marry the people we love while our brothers and sisters and cousins are denied that right, based on nothing more than sexual orientation. It\\'s discrimination with all its ugliness.\\n\\nIn the end, this is where we should arrive. Not just because you love your brother, or your sister, but because, just as importantly, you love your country. And you understand what America stands for above all else: freedom.\\n\\nFor all of us. Or none of us.', 'Even for someone who’s shunned the public eye and spoken solely through indictments for the past year and a half, Robert Mueller has been uncharacteristically quiet in recent weeks. This is, of course, by design—Justice Department guidelines stipulate that prosecutors should avoid taking any major steps close to elections. And unlike former F.B.I. director James Comey, those who’ve worked with Mueller expected him to hew closely to D.O.J. protocol. “The one thing I am confident of is that he is going to make sure that he doesn’t do anything on the timing front that would interfere with the midterm elections,” Glenn Kirschner, a former homicide prosecutor who reported to Mueller in the 1990s, told me last month. “It wouldn’t surprise me if the indictment went completely radio silent between now and the midterms.”\\n\\nThough it was preordained, Mueller’s silence has nevertheless raised expectations as to what he might deliver once ballots are cast. Citing two U.S. officials, Bloomberg reported early Wednesday that he is expected to issue reports on two critical aspects of the D.O.J. investigation into Russian interference shortly after midterm elections. Specifically, Mueller is expected to release his findings on whether Donald Trump obstructed justice, and if there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, according to one official that spoke with the outlet. (Trump and his campaign have denied any wrongdoing.)\\n\\nThis timeline raises several questions about the future of the Russia investigation. For one thing, it’s unclear whether such a report would mark the end of the inquiry. Per Bloomberg, Mueller is under pressure from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to wrap up his investigation as “expeditiously as possible.” But if a blue wave sweeps Democrats to a majority in the House, the political calculus for Rosenstein could change. The No. 2 Justice Department official, who took over the Russia probe after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself last year, has come under frequent attacks from Trump and the president’s allies in the House. But such pressure would likely dissipate if Democrats won back the chamber.\\n\\nOf course, how long Rosenstein will remain in control of the probe is also an open question. For weeks, reports have circulated that Trump is likely to fire Sessions after the midterms—rumors the president has made little effort to tamp down. Republican senators—who were once largely united in their defense of their former colleague from Alabama—have seemingly resigned themselves to the attorney general’s ouster. If Trump appoints someone to replace Sessions who manages to survive a Senate confirmation, that person could then take over from Rosenstein.\\n\\nRosenstein’s fate, too, is unknown. After The New York Times reported last month that Rosenstein suggested officials secretly record Trump and discussed a plan to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office, the deputy attorney general reportedly offered to resign from his post. Trump later said he would prefer if Rosenstein remained in his post, and the two have since appeared to mend ties. But speculation remains that Trump may fire Rosenstein after the midterms as well.\\n\\nWhat is clear is that one of the most consequential chapters in the Mueller investigation will follow the midterm elections. Between now and November 6, Kirschner told me, the special counsel could issue “satellite indictments” for fringe players in the Russia saga, such as former Trump adviser and longtime Republican operative Roger Stone, but any bombshells will have to wait. By then, Trump could have very little to lose. With midterms in the rearview mirror, the stakes for both the president and the Republican Party could change dramatically. Trump, his businesses, and his administration are all but guaranteed to face heightened scrutiny if Democrats win back the House, but the G.O.P. is predicted to hold on to its majority in the Senate, meaning impeachment will likely remain a liberal pipe dream. Trump, meanwhile, will have newfound latitude to curtail the Russia investigation—without the fear of repercussions at the ballot box.', '(CNN) A day after a terrorist mowed down dozens of people celebrating Bastille Day in the coastal French city of Nice, investigators dug into the life of the man they say was the killer: A 31-year-old delivery driver and Nice resident who was born in Tunisia.\\n\\nAuthorities said Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel drove a rented, refrigerated truck weighing about 20 tons into crowds along a roughly 2-kilometer stretch of Promenade des Anglais on Thursday night, killing 84 people -- including 10 children and adolescents -- and injuring 202 others.\\n\\nThe attack ended when police shot into the truck, killing Bouhlel, French prosecutor François Molins said Friday.\\n\\nOf the injured, 52 were in critical condition, and 25 were in a coma, Molins said.

They think his attacks on Marco Rubio are doing more harm than good. And they worry that, at the end, all he will have accomplished is the destruction of the Bush family brand.\\n\\nThe big-money supporters fueling Jeb Bush’s super PAC have found their boogeyman: Mike Murphy, a sharp-witted, Twitter-obsessed veteran GOP ad man who runs Right to Rise.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nIf Bush’s campaign ends with anything other than the GOP nomination, blame is certain to be widespread. But that donors and GOP operatives are already sniping at Murphy before the first votes are cast demonstrates the depth of frustration and displeasure with the Bush-world loyalist.\\n\\n“It looks like they’re blowing the whole thing up, like even if Jeb can’t win, they’re not going to let anyone else win either,” said a Florida Bush backer and Right to Rise donor who worked on Bush’s gubernatorial campaigns and in his administration. “You might as well light all of this money on fire. Most of all, they’re hurting the reputation of a really great man.”\\n\\nPOLITICO interviewed nearly two dozen Right to Rise donors and Bush supporters, and all blamed Murphy for a super PAC strategy that has failed to boost their struggling candidate. Multiple advisers to the Right to Rise super PAC concede privately that the $40 million spent on positive ads aimed at telling Bush’s story has yielded no tangible dividends.\\n\\nAmong the many and varied complaints, several Republicans close to the Bush campaign have questioned the PAC’s decision to let John Kasich own the airwaves in New Hampshire this fall, allowing the Ohio governor to get a foothold in a state where Bush must perform well to keep his White House bid alive. Others faulted Right to Rise for spending so much money on telling Bush’s story and not changing tactics immediately after Donald Trump entered the race and began stoking the groundswell of anti-establishment sentiment and defined Bush — lastingly — as “low energy.”\\n\\n“At a time when so many voters are anti-establishment and angry at the government, the last thing you should say in all of your campaign ads is ‘I am a former governor with a great record of governing,’” said Joe Culotta, a former Republican Party of Florida consultant who is supporting Rubio. “Don\\'t get me wrong, I respect Gov. Bush and totally agree that he did great things in Florida. But to voters, that translates to ‘I have a lot of experience in being part of the establishment and the government that you all hate.’”\\n\\nThese sour feelings about Murphy’s management of Right to Rise mark a dramatic turn for a group that came out of the gate in stunning fashion, raising a record $103 million last summer and setting a breakneck pace that many, a year ago, thought couldn’t be matched.\\n\\nThat initial success coincided with Murphy’s re-emergence on the national political scene after he had been semiretired from politics, living in California and sitting out the 2012 presidential election. Long close to Bush, it surprised some when he was selected to lead the super PAC instead of playing a direct role inside the campaign. But Murphy quickly wooed donors and set in motion the strategy that reflected the general Republican consensus that Bush would be the easy front-runner and likely Republican nominee.\\n\\nThat all changed, and quickly, when Trump announced his candidacy and Bush revealed his weaknesses on the campaign trail. The whisper campaign about Right to Rise burning through money with little to show for it began shortly after that.\\n\\nThis isn’t the first time Murphy’s campaign spending has been questioned. After success helping to run Arnold Schwarzenegger’s first bid for governor in California, Murphy was criticized for overspending on Meg Whitman’s failed gubernatorial run. In an unusual business arrangement, Whitman made a $1 million investment in Murphy’s production company just months before he began working for her campaign. She eventually spent $144 million of her own money on the failed campaign.\\n\\nVeteran California political operative Don Sipple, who brought Murphy onto the Schwarzenegger campaign, laughed when asked about Murphy’s involvement with high price-tag campaigns.\\n\\n“Murphy was doing the Meg Whitman campaign so he knows how to spend money,” Sipple said, noting that Right to Rise\\'s “return on investment is seriously elusive.”\\n\\n“Whether it’s the Jeb campaign or the super PAC concept, all of that has been based on conventional wisdom and past political activities, which is not valid for 2016, it seems,” Sipple said of Murphy’s spending strategy at Right to Rise.\\n\\nRight to Rise spokesman Paul Lindsay defended Murphy and said the super PAC is sticking to its playbook. “Mike is focused on the same thing everyone in our organization is focused on: supporting Jeb and getting him elected,” Lindsay wrote in an email. “Our metrics for that goal are votes and delegates.”\\n\\nSo far, Right to Rise has spent $58.8 million, according to ad-tracking data from SMG Delta and reported by NBC News, and doesn’t have plans to drop off anytime soon. Seeing little return on the positive ads, the super PAC shifted recently to negative contrast spots to weaken the establishment candidates sitting ahead of Bush in the polls.\\n\\nBut that does not explain why the group sent mailers featuring a video player showing a 15-minute documentary to Bush supporters in New Hampshire, Iowa and to a select group of donors and finance prospects over the weekend. Right to Rise is expected to also send the mailer to some Republican leaders in South Carolina.\\n\\nWhile Right to Rise spokesman Lindsay dismissed criticism of the video mailer investment, saying the group sent 300 copies of the video mailer for just “a few thousand dollars in total,” it was part of a series of line-item expenditures that donors worry won’t help Bush.\\n\\nWeeks earlier, for example, Right to Rise purchased advertising space on billboards in a few early voting states featuring a Bush quote in white letters against a red background: “Donald Trump is unhinged,” it read. Rankled by what they saw as more wasteful spending, a handful of Bush supporters in Florida began emailing around a photoshopped image of the billboard but with a different quote: “Light all the donor money on fire.” It was attributed to Murphy.\\n\\nWhile Murphy’s critics have been vocal, the jury is out on whether some of his tactics and investments will ultimately prove successful. So far the super PAC’s spending has had almost no positive impact on Bush’s poll numbers, nationally or in the early voting states. Since Labor Day, Bush has not cracked 11 percent in any poll of New Hampshire Republican voters, according to HuffPollster’s tracker. Trump, Rubio, John Kasich, Ted Cruz and Ben Carson have all run ahead of him.\\n\\nBut on Wednesday, a new survey from CNN/WMUR put Bush and Rubio even at 10 percent.\\n\\nAnd for its part, the Bush campaign thinks the ads have helped buoy their candidate.\\n\\n\"It is clear from the momentum we are seeing in the ground in the early states that ads echoing Jeb\\'s optimistic, conservative vision from the stump are having an impact and moving the needle in this race,\" said Kristy Campbell of the Bush campaign.\\n\\nYet without some dramatic improvement in Bush’s position, donors say Murphy’s strategy might be doing nothing more than harming Rubio at precisely the moment the GOP could be rallying around an alternative to Trump or Cruz. Those Right to Rise donors who know Bush personally also worry about Murphy’s slash and burn tactics affecting the former governor’s legacy.\\n\\n“It’s painful, because we’re watching something happen that no one envisioned happening. We all wanted it to be Jeb, but if it can’t be Jeb, at some point, doesn’t reality have to set in?” one donor said.\\n\\nLindsay defended Right to Rise’s decision to go on the offensive against Bush’s rivals. “The sequence of our strategy began with informing voters about Jeb’s successful record as governor of Florida, and it has shifted to comparing that record with those of his opponents,” he said. “We\\'re not distracted by anonymous critics from rival campaigns who are rattled because their candidates’ records are being vetted.\"\\n\\nIn New Hampshire, where Bush’s campaign has consistently felt more optimistic about his prospects than the polling indicates it should, staffers have started to voice more pessimism about the super PAC under Murphy.\\n\\n“He was supposed by the artillery and the cavalry, and instead he has just fired duds,” said a Bush staffer.\\n\\n“We haven’t seen the Jeb Bush we all grew up on, a hard-core conservative. That’s not who we saw on the campaign trail for the first few months until recently,” another Republican said, summing up the mood of staff. “To the extent that wasn’t happening until recently, I have to believe it wasn’t Jeb. That rhetoric was coming from Mike Murphy.”\\n\\nFor its part, the Bush campaign and the super PAC have often used similar language. And one Bush aide said that it shouldn’t be surprising that the super PAC is engaging in attack ads to show a contrast with the other candidates.\\n\\nMurphy has long been a polarizing figure in Republican politics. After dropping out of college to focus on politics full-time, he was involved in a slew of political campaigns. He’s advised Republicans like John McCain, Rick Lazio, Tommy Thompson and Lamar Alexander.\\n\\nHe was a founder of DC Navigators before starting the political consulting firm Revolution Agency.\\n\\nHis involvement with Bush world goes back to President George H.W. Bush’s 1992 presidential bid, in which he served as an adviser before leaving the campaign. He also served as a consultant for Jeb Bush’s successful 1998 and 2002 gubernatorial races.\\n\\nEven Murphy’s friends concede that his personality can be an acquired taste.\\n\\nGOP lobbyist David Carmen, a friend for more than two decades, described Murphy as being the “Bill Belichick of GOP politics,” referring to the longtime head coach of the New England Patriots.\\n\\n“And what I mean by that is [Belichick] is famous for his sort of taciturn behavior and the phrase ‘Do your job’,” Carmen said. “I think Mike feels that everyone should just do their job, and he spends all night every night, all day every day, thinking about every possible contingency and formulation about what might occur in a given campaign.”\\n\\n“That comes across to some people as off-putting, but that is who he is,” Carmen said. “He is a genius of the mechanics of politics. He’s always been that way.”\\n\\nOne major difference — Belichick has won four Super Bowls and Murphy still hasn’t claimed a presidential campaign victory.\\n\\nMarc Caputo contributed to this report.\\n\\n', 'On Friday, one of Michael Flynn’s closest deputies on the National Security Council was denied clearance. | Getty CIA freezes out top Flynn aide The agency denied a security clearance for a key aide to the National Security Adviser — ratcheting up tensions between Flynn and the intel community.\\n\\nA top deputy to national security adviser Michael Flynn was rejected for a critical security clearance, effectively ending his tenure on the National Security Council and escalating tensions between Flynn and the intelligence community.\\n\\nThe move came as Flynn’s already tense relationships with others in the Trump administration and the intelligence community were growing more fraught after reports that Flynn had breached diplomatic protocols in his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nOn Friday, one of Flynn’s closest deputies on the NSC, senior director for Africa Robin Townley, was informed that the Central Intelligence Agency had rejected his request for an elite security clearance required for service on the NSC, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation.\\n\\nThat forced Townley, a former Marine intelligence officer who had long maintained a top secret-level security clearance, out of his NSC post, explained the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive personnel matters.\\n\\nOne of the sources said the rejection was approved by Mike Pompeo, President Donald Trump’s CIA director, and that it infuriated Flynn and his allies.\\n\\nBoth sources said the CIA did not offer much explanation for why Townley’s request for so-called “Sensitive Compartmented Information” clearance was rejected. But the sources said that Flynn and his allies believe it was motivated by Townley’s skepticism of the intelligence community’s techniques — sentiments shared by Flynn.\\n\\n“They believe this is a hit job from inside the CIA on Flynn and the people close to him,” said one source, who argued that some in the intelligence community feel threatened by Flynn and his allies. “Townley believes that the CIA doesn’t run the world,\" the source said.\\n\\nSpokespeople for the NSC and the CIA declined to comment. Townley and the White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nRep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, dismissed as “baloney” any suggestion that the clearance was denied because the intelligence community was trying to brush back Flynn.\\n\\nTrump and Flynn “see treachery everywhere they go,” Schiff said, adding “if a security clearance is denied, it’s for a reason.” Intelligence agencies tend to be careful in rejecting security clearances because “they know they’re going to have to justify it,\" Schiff concluded.\\n\\nOne person close to Trump said that, within the White House, Flynn is regarded by some as waging “a jihad against the intelligence community.” This person said Flynn is blamed by some people around Trump for trying to turn the new president against the intelligence community during the campaign and transition period, when Trump was openly skeptical about U.S. intelligence findings that Russia meddled in the election to try to help his campaign and damage that of his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nFlynn’s own ties to Russia, a leading U.S. geopolitical foe, also have come under scrutiny.\\n\\nTrump’s critics cited Flynn’s paid speech in Russia and dinner with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2015 as evidence of ties between the Kremlin and Trump’s inner circle.\\n\\nAnd the FBI has been looking into Flynn’s December communications with Russia\\'s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak.\\n\\nFlynn had maintained that those communications did not include discussion of U.S. sanctions levied against Russia for hacking into Democratic electronic communications during the 2016 presidential race.\\n\\nBut The Washington Post on Thursday reported that sanctions were in fact discussed, citing nine top current and former officials at multiple agencies.\\n\\nDemocrats on Friday seized on the report, calling for Flynn to be suspended and pleading with Republicans to investigate him. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, said he had \"grave questions\" about Flynn\\'s honesty — and whether other White House officials were aware of his communications with Kislyak.\\n\\nInside the Trump administration, the ranks of Flynn’s critics seem to be growing — and becoming emboldened.\\n\\nA White House official said there had been concerns about Flynn\\'s calls to the Russian ambassador, which weren\\'t known by all of Trump\\'s top advisers and aides. The official said Flynn is not particularly close to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson or Defense Secretary James Mattis.\\n\\nSomeone close to Trump said \"a lot of people are gunning for Flynn, but I think the president likes him.\"\\n\\n\"The president thinks he\\'s loyal and has expertise,\" this person said. \"Among others, there\\'s this perception he is wild, outside the box, not suited for the office.”\\n\\nA senior Trump official played down the idea that Flynn may be in danger, saying he remained in contact with top Trump officials and Cabinet secretaries.\\n\\nTrump, in a Friday afternoon gaggle aboard Air Force One, said he was unaware of the report that Flynn had discussed the sanctions with the Russian ambassador but said he would \"look into that.\"', 'Story highlights Former Gov.

And in turn, it will offer Clinton a crucial opening to once and for all shake the pervasive narrative that her rival -- even as he lags behind in the delegate count -- continues to enjoy real momentum; tens of thousands of Sanders supporters rallied in Washington Square Park in Manhattan Wednesday night.\\n\\nIn a sign of the mounting pressure for both candidates, over the past few weeks, their exchanges on the campaign trail have grown increasingly bitter. Sanders has publicly questioned Clinton\\'s judgment and credibility, while Clinton has hit back by accusing her rival of being inexperienced and promoting an unrealistic platform.\\n\\nNext week\\'s contest will also be an especially personal one for both Democratic hopefuls.\\n\\nClinton, who served as the state\\'s senator for eight years, currently has a home in Chappaqua and chose to base her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn. Sanders, meanwhile, was born and raised in Brooklyn and still has a thick New York accent.\\n\\nBoth candidates are also insistent that they are best equipped to take on Republican front-runner Donald Trump -- another New Yorker.\\n\\nHere is to watch when the two square off:\\n\\nThings could get nasty\\n\\nThursday\\'s Democratic debate could be the feistiest yet.\\n\\nOver the past few weeks, Clinton and Sanders have ramped up their attacks, hitting each other harder on both character and policy. The new tenor of the race is in stark contrast to the earliest stages of the race, when the two candidates were cordial and made painstaking efforts to avoid going after each other.\\n\\nSanders, in particular, prided himself in running a positive campaign, constantly reminding voters that he had never run a negative ad in his political career.\\n\\nBut with the Democratic race dragging on into the spring, fresh tensions are bubbling up to the surface.\\n\\nPointing to issues like Clinton\\'s ties to Wall Street and her vote for the Iraq War, Sanders said over the weekend that when it comes to Clinton\\'s judgment, \"something is clearly lacking.\" The senator also went on to tell CNN\\'s Jake Tapper that he found Clinton\\'s recent remarks about young voters -- in which she said they sometimes buy into incorrect information and \"don\\'t do their own research\" -- to be \"a little bit condescending .\"\\n\\nThings grew even more heated when the Sanders campaign put out a press release questioning Clinton\\'s credibility this week -- an attack that was met with ferocious pushback.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s be very clear.

She was elected here.\\n\\nFor each, Tuesday\\'s contest is something of a homecoming. And with 247 delegates at stake, the stakes are higher than ever. Clinton is expected to come out on top, but with momentum at his back after winning six out of the last seven contests, Sanders believes New York could provide a chance for him to prove that he can stay in the race.\\n\\n\"I am enormously proud to be the senator from Vermont, but I have not forgotten where I was born and that is Brooklyn,\" Sanders told a crowd in Brooklyn last week. \"I think we have the campaign that has the momentum. ... And, with your help, we will win New York.\"\\n\\nA Sanders victory here would be a huge psychological blow toun the Clinton campaign, which has posited that the state is solidly her territory. Sanders\\' advisers are basing their strategy on convincing superdelegates that he can overtake Clinton over time, and victory here would help him make his case. However, with Clinton\\'s lead in pledged delegates, her team knows that Sanders not only needs to win at least 56 percent of the remaining delegates to catch up.\\n\\nThursday\\'s debate will be the largest platform yet for Clinton and Sanders to make their case to a state that could be pivotal in the race. Look for both of them to make major appeals to Democratic voters here based on their personal backgrounds.\\n\\nWall Street in the backdrop\\n\\nJust across the river from the site of Thursday\\'s CNN debate looms something that has engulfed the 2016 Democratic race: Wall Street.\\n\\nVowing to break up the big banks and railing against the outsized role of Wall Street in the American political system are at the core of Sanders\\' campaign. His unlikely bid for president has attracted a massive following in large part because of his populist message and promises to help poor and lower-income families.\\n\\nBut the fight between Clinton and Sanders over Wall Street has not only unfolded over policy disagreements.\\n\\nSanders has consistently used the financial industry to paint Clinton as an establishment insider in the pocket of special interests. He has slammed the former secretary of state for accepting donations from financial institutions, suggesting that she is beholden to big-money interests.\\n\\nOne major Wall Street bank has found itself in the middle of this flashpoint: Goldman Sachs.\\n\\nAt issue are three speeches Clinton made to Goldman Sachs, for which she was paid $675,000. Sanders has repeatedly called on Clinton to release the transcripts from those speeches, saying the public has a right to know what she said in those private settings.\\n\\nClinton said she would only do so if all of her rivals running for president are also held to the same standards.\\n\\nCan Sanders get specific?\\n\\nRecently, Clinton has found a fresh line of attack against Sanders on the issue of Wall Street.\\n\\nAsked whether she thinks her connections to Wall Street will play a more central role in the debate now that the race has come to New York, Clinton told reporters this week: Bring it on.\\n\\n\"Let it happen. I have a record. As your senator, I spoke out. I called for changes. I have the best policy toward dealing with what needs to happen to prevent Wall Street from ever wrecking Main Street again,\" she said. \"Sen. Sanders couldn\\'t even answer questions about whatever his plan is so we\\'ll talk.\"\\n\\nIn an extensive interview with the New York Daily News, Sanders struggled to answer in detail questions about financial reform -- one of the pillars of his campaign. Clinton seized on the interview to raise questions about Sanders\\' readiness to be president.\\n\\n\"Really, what that goes to is for voters to ask themselves can he deliver what he\\'s talking about,\" she said\\n\\nWill Obama\\'s admission haunt Clinton?\\n\\nPresident Barack Obama made a candid admission over the weekend: his administration wasn\\'t adequately prepared to handle the fall of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi.\\n\\n\"Probably failing to plan for the day after what I think was the right thing to do in intervening in Libya,\" Obama said in a Fox News interview when asked about the biggest mistake of his presidency.\\n\\nThe United States helped oust Gadhafi in 2011. As secretary of state, Clinton was a major actor in those efforts and as a presidential candidate has remained a defender of U.S actions in Libya. But her tenure at the State Department has been a significant vulnerability for Clinton: Republicans and critics have persistently criticized her handling of the 2012 attacks at a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, which killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens.\\n\\nSanders, for his part, has more broadly targeted Clinton\\'s views on regime change. This tension could resurface Thursday night if Clinton chooses to defend Obama administration\\'s engagement in Libya.\\n\\nFossil fuel money\\n\\nA key fight between Sanders and Clinton spilled out into the open with the recent release of a video showing Clinton angrily responding to a climate activist who accused her of accepting \"fossil fuel money\" while the candidate shook hands with supporters after an event.\\n\\nWhen the activist, who is affiliated with environmentalist groups Greenpeace and 350 Action, asked if Clinton would \"reject\" funds from those industries, Clinton responded that she did not accept money directly from fossil fuel companies—an action that is illegal anyway, since corporations can\\'t directly contribute to political campaigns—but that she did take money from individual donors who work in those industries. \"I\\'m so sick of the Sanders\\' campaign lying about me. I\\'m sick of it,\" Clinton said.\\n\\nIn truth, oil and gas industry employees have donated to both Clinton and Sanders. Clinton has received more than $300,000; Sanders about $50,000.\\n\\nBut Sanders has not backed down from the attack line, and his campaign has pointed to \"lobbyists and bundlers for the industry\" who have donated to Clinton and donations to super PACs supporting Clinton.\\n\\n\"Secretary Clinton owes us an apology. We were not lying. We were telling the truth,\" Sanders said during a rally on April 1 in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.\\n\\nAlthough the candidates and their surrogates have answered questions about the issue since Clinton\\'s altercation with the climate activist, Thursday\\'s debate could be the first time they address it with one another directly in public. If Sanders confronts Clinton on it, it could be an opportunity for Clinton to try to put the attack to rest before a large audience.', 'Mr. Trump could lose support as delegates become free to vote as they please.\\n\\nMost states “bind” their delegates to candidates based on primary results. But most delegates are released if no candidate wins a majority in an initial vote at the convention, so those who were bound to Mr. Trump could shift their support.

None of that was a match for the magnetic pull of the anti-vaccine delusion.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAre we inherently gullible? Research says no: Most adults have well-functioning machinery for detecting baloney, but there’s a common bug in the machine. Faced with a novel idea or new circumstances, we gravitate to information that fits our already existing beliefs. As Sherlock Holmes put the problem: “Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.” This bug has always been exploited by people seeking money, power — or both. But with the rise of social media, the world’s propagandists, con artists and grifters find their search for suckers easier than ever.\\n\\nWitness the grubby exercise known as “#Plandemic.” The risible video is the work of an opportunistic Internet filmmaker whose projects include a clip about his 5-year-old son’s discovery of “the truth” about the wealthy sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In his latest film, he advances the conspiracy theory that Anthony S. Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, billionaire Bill Gates and various other malefactors are spreading a manmade novel coronavirus because they enjoy making people sick and hope to profit on an eventual vaccine. Or some similar nonsense along those lines. And there’s more: Beaches were closed to keep Americans away from the “microbes” in seawater that protect against covid-19.\\n\\nIt won’t do to shrug and say, well, no one’s going to believe that. Not when the creator of Sherlock Holmes believes in fairies and gnomes. A coronavirus conspiracy is mild B.S. compared with the great conspiracy theory of 2016, the weapons-grade hooey known as #Pizzagate. In that viral sensation, important political figures supposedly ran a child-abuse ring out of the basement of a pizzeria that, by the way, doesn’t have a basement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPeople believe in a “#Plandemic” because it fits into existing convictions. A lot of people already believe — not without reason — that pharmaceutical companies cash in on suffering. Many people have heard that government labs do research on biological weapons. All true. Government has hemorrhaged credibility in recent years — even with regard to veteran public servants such as Fauci. All of these mind-sets are potential vectors for the viral #plandemic.\\n\\nChastened by #Pizzagate in 2016, when digital media giants slumbered while their platforms spread madness, Facebook, YouTube and Vimeo shut down access to #Plandemic and cleansed their websites of its toxic traces. By the time they pulled it, though, more than 8 million people had already seen or shared the video.\\n\\nThis is vexing, for it suggests that — despite all their algorithms — the tech behemoths are ineffectual when it comes to filtering B.S. from the nation’s atmosphere. By the time they finally flipped the kill switch, the video and its contents were long gone into the ether, where the spread continued through copies and allusions until a new video can be slipped past the gatekeepers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf the likes of Facebook, with its vast resources, can’t handle the hokum that proliferates through social media, what’s a nation to do? Laws restricting free speech can be a slippery slope; I don’t think we ought to start in that direction. Instead, we need a more discriminating and better-informed audience for social media. Americans need to understand that they are being actively targeted for disinformation campaigns by people and forces pursuing their own agendas. Conspiracy-monger Alex Jones wants to sell them overpriced nutritional supplements. Anti-vaxxers are hawking books and miracle cures. Vladimir Putin and the mandarins of Beijing are pushing the decline of the United States and the death of the Western alliance.\\n\\nSome want your money. Some want your mind. Citizenship in the Internet era demands a heightened commitment to mental hygiene and skepticism. We have to learn that the information that fits neatly into our preconceptions is precisely the information we must be wary of.

Jason Burnett, a member of the Packard Foundation board of trustees and grandson of an HP co-founder, expressed concerns about Fiorina\\'s priorities, stating that she \"put herself ahead of the interests of the company.\" Former HP communications director Roy Verley echoed similar sentiments, saying Fiorina\\'s self-promotion and \"cult of Carly\" led to alienation among colleagues.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Fiorina\\'s supporters, such as Leslie Shedd, her press secretary, emphasized her accomplishments at HP, including doubling revenue, tripling innovation, and quadrupling cash flow. Shedd cited tech leaders like Tom Perkins and Craig Barrett, who defended Fiorina\\'s handling of the Compaq merger.\\n\\nFiorina\\'s campaign has already generated significant attention, with some critics warning that her past mistakes will continue to haunt her. \"She takes the Silicon Valley motto that it\\'s \\'OK to fail\\' a tad too literally,\" wrote the San Jose Mercury News editorial board. Despite these concerns, Fiorina\\'s campaign has garnered some support from early backers, including tech entrepreneur Aaron Ginn, who praised her conviction and philosophical underpinnings.\\n\\nFiorina\\'s presidential bid is expected to test whether her business credentials and personal story will resonate with voters. Her message will focus on her experiences as a woman in a male-dominated industry, her leadership skills, and her ability to navigate the complex world of technology.', \"Virginia's Primary Results: A Battle Ahead in the Governor's Mansion\\n\\nThe Virginia primary elections have set the stage for a highly contested governor's race in November, as incumbent Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam secured an easy win on the Democratic side and former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie barely edged out Donald Trump-backed Corey Stewart. The results have sent shockwaves through Richmond and Washington, with implications for both parties heading into the 2018 midterm elections.\\n\\nOn the Democratic side, Northam's victory was seen as a validation of his campaign's message, which focused on unity and a rejection of President Trump's divisive rhetoric. However, the race was closer than expected, with Perriello, a progressive candidate, gaining ground in the final stretch. The high Democratic turnout, with over 520,000 votes cast, underscores the party's enthusiasm and activism in the era of Trump.\\n\\nFor Republicans, the results are a warning sign of their own challenges ahead. Gillespie's narrow victory has raised questions about the party's ability to win over voters who are turned off by Trump's rhetoric, particularly among suburban and urban areas. Stewart's surprisingly strong performance suggests that the Trump effect remains a potent force in Virginia, where the president won the primary last year.\\n\\nThe primary results also had implications for the 2020 election cycle, with Gov. Terry McAuliffe's national ambitions receiving a boost from Northam's victory. The governor's popularity among the Democratic base was a key factor in Northam's win, and his national stature has increased as a result. Trump, too, saw a boost from Stewart's strong showing, which may help him build momentum heading into 2020.\\n\\nThe results are also reminiscent of Eric Cantor's surprise loss in 2014, which marked a turning point for the Republican Party. Gillespie's close call has forced party leaders to re-evaluate their positioning ahead of the 2018 midterms, as well as the 2020 presidential election.\\n\\nOverall, the Virginia primary results offer a glimpse into the challenges and opportunities facing both parties in the era of Trump, and the importance of grassroots activism and message-based campaigns in the 2018 midterm elections.\", 'Title: UC Graduate Students\\' Unprecedented Wildcat Strike Gains Support, Calls for Cost-of-Living Adjustment\\n\\nA group of graduate students at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), has been on an unprecedented wildcat strike since February 10, refusing to teach, hold office hours, or perform other work until their demands for a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) are met. The strike has drawn widespread attention and garnered support from faculty, students, and community members across the state.\\n\\nThe graduate students, who earn $2,400 a month, or around $21,000 a year, are seeking a COLA of $1,412 a month to help alleviate the burden of housing costs in one of the most expensive cities in the country. According to a report, over 50% of renter households in Santa Cruz County are considered rent-burdened, spending more than 30% of their income on rent.\\n\\nThe strike has been met with resistance from the university administration, which has threatened to fire students if they don\\'t call off the strike. However, the students have remained resolute, with some even risking arrest during a confrontation with police on February 12. The crackdown, which resulted in 17 students being forcibly arrested and suspended for two weeks, has only emboldened the strikers, who are demanding a fair solution to the housing crisis.\\n\\nThe strike has also gained support from faculty members, who have urged the university to halt disciplinary measures and open a direct line of communication. Some have joined students at the picket line, and the Santa Cruz City Council has voted unanimously to endorse the students\\' demands. The executive board of the Council of UC Faculty Associations, representing faculty on all 10 UC campuses, has also issued an open letter of support, urging a resolution.\\n\\nThe strike has also garnered attention from outside the university, with over 2,000 non-UCSC faculty across the country signing a noncooperation pledge to boycott UCSC until it provides a more equitable standard of living. City bus drivers in Santa Cruz have refused to cross the picket, and even Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has tweeted his support for the strikers.\\n\\nThe strike is seen as a critical moment in the fight for affordable housing and a fair living wage. Steven McKay, an associate professor of sociology and director of the UCSC Center for Labor Studies, notes that the problem is not unique to UCSC, but rather a symptom of a broader crisis in the funding of public higher education in California. \"California is as flush as ever,\" he says. \"It has a $20 billion surplus in its budget. The strike is a real opportunity for UC to lead on a much bigger national issue: the funding of public higher education.\"\\n\\nAs the strike enters its fifth day, the students remain resolute, with a vote scheduled for Friday to determine how to proceed. While some are considering submitting grades, others are determined to continue the fight for a fair solution to the housing crisis. The strike has become a powerful symbol of the struggle for affordable housing and a fair living wage, with far-reaching implications for the future of higher education in California.', \"**Title:** Climate Change Advocates March in Thousands, Emphasizing Urgent Need for Action\\n\\nNew York, NY - In a demonstration of global solidarity and urgency, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of New York on Sunday to demand immediate action on climate change. The massive rally, part of a global movement, brought together individuals from around the world, including those directly impacted by the crisis, to sound a collective call to action.\\n\\nAs the world grapples with numerous pressing global issues, many may be tempted to overlook climate change. However, for those experiencing its devastating effects, such as rising sea levels, increased natural disasters, and irreparable loss of ecosystems, the reality of climate change is anything but ignored.\\n\\nThe march, which stretched through Central Park and Midtown Manhattan, featured a diverse range of participants, including those from the Marshall Islands, Tibet, China, West Virginia, and Arizona, all united in their quest for a cleaner, more sustainable future. Participants of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities came together to emphasize the urgency of climate action, calling for a reduction in harmful carbon emissions, real targets based on science, and a shift towards clean industry.\\n\\nThe rally also highlighted the personal stories of those already affected by climate change, including those who have lost homes, livelihoods, and even loved ones due to natural disasters exacerbated by global warming. These personal accounts served as a poignant reminder of the human toll of climate change and the need for collective action.\\n\\nDespite the gravity of the situation, the atmosphere at the march was one of hope and determination. Participants waved signs, sang songs, and danced in the streets, sending a message to world leaders that they are watching and waiting for decisive action.\\n\\nAs the world looks towards the upcoming UN climate summit, the message from Sunday's march is clear: urgent action is needed to mitigate the devastating effects of climate change. With technology and popular support already in place, it is time for those in power to listen and take decisive action to ensure a livable future for generations to come.\", 'Congressional Committee Requests Six Years of Trump\\'s Tax Returns\\n\\nThe House Ways and Means Committee has formally requested six years of President Donald Trump\\'s tax returns, sparking a potential legal battle that could drag on for months or even years. The move is a significant step in the Democratic-led Congress\\'s efforts to hold the president accountable and shed light on his business dealings.\\n\\nThe request, made by Committee Chairman Richard Neal, is rooted in a little-known IRS code that allows the committee to request tax returns and other financial information from the president. The committee is seeking returns from 2013 to 2018, a period that covers Trump\\'s business career and presidency.\\n\\nThe move is seen as a bid to establish whether Trump has any conflicts of interest that bear on his official duties and to see whether he is getting payments from foreign states in violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution. Democrats have also justified the effort as a way to examine how much Trump and his businesses benefited from the massive GOP tax reform law.\\n\\nThe request is not without precedent, as no president has released their tax returns since Gerald Ford in 1974. However, Trump has resisted releasing his returns, citing an ongoing audit.\\n\\nTrump has shrugged off the request, saying that \"until such time as I\\'m not under audit I would not be inclined to do that.\" Republicans are likely to argue that the request is an example of unreasonable scrutiny by Democrats, while Democrats see it as a necessary step to hold the president accountable.\\n\\nThe request has sparked a heated debate, with some calling it a fishing expedition and others seeing it as a necessary step to ensure transparency. The controversy is likely to continue, with the Trump administration already signaling plans to challenge the request in court.\\n\\nThe drama has also drawn in key members of the Trump administration, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has hinted that he may not comply with the request. The fight could become a cause celebre that works its way through the court system and even reaches the Supreme Court.\\n\\nThe request has significant implications for the ongoing investigation into Trump\\'s financial dealings, which has already been criticized for its lack of transparency. The controversy is likely to continue, with both sides dug in and determined to emerge victorious.', 'Amtrak Train Derailment: Speed May Have Played a Role\\n\\nA fatal derailment of an Amtrak train in Philadelphia has left seven people dead and over 200 injured. The train, carrying over 238 passengers and five crew members, derailed on Tuesday night while traveling from Washington to New York City.\\n\\nPreliminary data indicates that the train was traveling at a speed exceeding 100 mph when it entered a curve with a 50 mph speed limit. Mayor Michael Nutter has criticized the engineer, saying that he was \"reckless and irresponsible\" for exceeding the speed limit. However, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) member Robert Sumwalt has cautioned against making assumptions about the cause of the crash, saying that the investigation is still ongoing.\\n\\nThe train\\'s engineer, Brandon Bostian, was injured and refused to cooperate with police, who are trying to determine whether he was distracted or fatigued at the time of the crash. Authorities have also obtained a search warrant for Bostian\\'s phone records to investigate whether he was distracted.\\n\\nThe investigation is still in its early stages, but officials are looking at several factors, including the condition of the track, the train\\'s maintenance record, and the speed at which the train was traveling. The stretch of track where the train derailed was not equipped with an automated speed control system, which could have prevented the accident.\\n\\nThe derailment has caused significant disruptions to Amtrak\\'s service in the Northeast, with many passengers forced to make alternative travel arrangements. The cause of the crash is still unknown, but officials are working to determine what happened and how to prevent similar accidents in the future.', \"**Senate Set to Vote on Bill Banning Abortions After 20 Weeks, Despite Lack of Scientific Consensus**\\n\\nThe US Senate is set to hold a procedural vote on Monday on a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks nationwide, sparking a debate about the scientific consensus on fetal pain. The bill, known as the Pain-Cable Unborn Child Protection Act, is sponsored by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and aims to protect fetuses deemed capable of feeling pain.\\n\\nProponents of the bill, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), argue that the legislation will protect vulnerable and marginalized individuals. However, critics argue that the bill is based on outdated and inaccurate scientific information, and could have serious consequences for women seeking abortion services.\\n\\nAccording to Dr. Jennifer Conti, a clinical assistant professor and OB-GYN at Stanford University, there is no conclusive evidence to support the claim that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has also stated that the development of fetal pain structures occurs much later in pregnancy, around 23-30 weeks.\\n\\nThe bill has been passed by the House but is unlikely to gain the necessary 60 votes in the Senate. However, some have expressed concern that even if the bill does not become law, it can still perpetuate misinformation and harm women seeking abortion services.\\n\\nProponents of reproductive rights argue that the bill could lead to dangerous and unnecessary travel for women seeking abortion services. For instance, one patient who came to Dr. Conti seeking an abortion was told she was 12 weeks pregnant, only to discover that she was actually 21 weeks along after a clinic gave her incorrect information. Under the proposed bill, she would have been unable to get an abortion.\\n\\nAdvocates of the bill also point out that some states have already passed similar legislation, but opponents argue that these bans have been shown to harm women by forcing them to travel long distances for care.\\n\\nThe debate surrounding the bill highlights the complexity of the issue and the need for accurate and evidence-based information. While some argue that the bill is a necessary step to protect the most vulnerable members of society, others believe it is a misguided and dangerous attempt to regulate a woman's body.\", 'FEDERAL RESERVE REFORM PROPOSALS GAIN STEAM ON CAPITOL HILL\\n\\nA proposal to shift power away from the New York Federal Reserve Bank has gained momentum on Capitol Hill, with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers expressing interest in exploring the idea. The plan, championed by former Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher, aims to reduce the influence of the New York Fed, which has long been a hub of financial activity.\\n\\nThe proposal would eliminate the permanent position of the New York Fed president as vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the panel responsible for making monetary policy decisions. Instead, the position would rotate among regional Federal Reserve banks every two years. Fisher also suggests that other regional banks oversee some Wall Street giants to address concerns about the New York Fed\\'s close ties to Wall Street.\\n\\nThe idea has attracted support from both sides of the aisle, with Senator Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) and Representative Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) expressing openness to the proposal. Democrats such as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Representative Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) have also expressed interest, citing concerns about the New York Fed\\'s close ties to Wall Street and its potential to favor large banks.\\n\\nThe proposal has been met with skepticism from some lawmakers, however, with Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) expressing concerns about shifting power away from the New York Fed. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) has also expressed reservations, stating that the proposal does not significantly change the current system.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve Chair, Janet Yellen, has expressed support for the current system, stating that it \"works well\" and that there are good reasons for giving the New York Fed a permanent spot on the FOMC. However, she noted that the ultimate decision lies with Congress.\\n\\nThe proposal is seen as part of a broader effort to reform the Federal Reserve and address concerns about its close ties to Wall Street. The Independent Community Bankers of America, a trade group, has also backed Fisher\\'s proposal, stating that it would \"balance the Federal Reserve\" and reflect the shifting economic landscape.\\n\\nFisher, who retired from the Dallas Fed last week, is reportedly thrilled about the interest in his proposal and plans to continue advocating for it. His proposal may face an uphill battle, but it has already generated significant attention and debate on Capitol Hill.', '**Headline:** \"Ten Notable Media Failures in the Trump/Russia Story\"\\n\\n**Introduction:** In recent years, media outlets have made several embarrassing mistakes while covering the Trump-Russia story. This list highlights ten instances where journalism went awry, with exaggerations, inaccuracies, and unverifiable claims being made. These errors, which predominantly favor one agenda, underscore the importance of critical thinking and fact-checking in journalism.\\n\\n**1. RT Hacked Into and Took Over C-SPAN**\\n\\nOn June 12, 2017, Fortune reported that RT had hacked into C-SPAN\\'s online feed, claiming C-SPAN confirmed the hacking. However, C-SPAN\\'s subsequent investigation revealed that the hacking was not true.\\n\\n**2. Russian Hackers Invaded the U.S. Electricity Grid**\\n\\nOn December 30, 2016, the Washington Post reported that Russian hackers had penetrated the U.S. electricity grid through a utility in Vermont. However, further investigation showed that the malware was not connected to the U.S. grid and had no connection to Russia.\\n\\n**3. A New, Deranged, Anonymous Group Declared Mainstream Political Sites to be Russian Propaganda Outlets**\\n\\nThe Washington Post published a story on November 24, 2016, claiming that 200 websites were peddling Russian propaganda. However, the source behind the report, PropOrNot, remained anonymous, and its methodology was questionable.\\n\\n**4. Trump Aide Anthony Scaramucci Involved in a Russian Hedge Fund Under Senate Investigation**\\n\\nOn June 22, 2017, CNN reported that Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci was involved with the Russian Direct Investment Fund, under Senate investigation. The story was later retracted, and the three reporters responsible left the network.\\n\\n**5. Russia Attacked U.S. “Diplomats” at the Cuban Embassy Using a Super-Sophisticated Sonic Microwave Weapon**\\n\\nOn September 11, 2017, NBC News and MSNBC reported that Russia was behind attacks on U.S. personnel at the Cuban Embassy using a sonic or microwave weapon. However, scientists called into doubt the attacks\\' veracity, and the story has not been confirmed.\\n\\n**6. Paul Manafort Visited Julian Assange Three Times in the Ecuadorian Embassy**\\n\\nOn November 27, 2018, the Guardian reported that Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort visited Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. However, no concrete evidence or video recordings support this claim, and the Guardian has refused to provide answers.\\n\\n**7. CNN Explicitly Lied About Lanny Davis Being Its Source**\\n\\nOn July 27, 2018, CNN published a story claiming that Michael Cohen was prepared to tell Robert Mueller that President Trump knew in advance about the Trump Tower meeting. CNN later admitted that its reports were false and refused to retract the story.\\n\\n**8. Robert Mueller Possesses Internal Emails and Witness Interviews Proving Trump Directed Cohen to Lie to Congress**\\n\\nOn January 18, 2019, BuzzFeed reported that President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower meeting. However, Robert Mueller\\'s office disputed the report, calling its key claims \"inaccurate.\"\\n\\n**9. Donald Trump Jr. Was Offered Advanced Access to the WikiLeaks Email Archive**\\n\\nOn December 9, 2017, CNN reported that Donald Trump Jr. was offered advanced access to the WikiLeaks email archive. However, the email was sent after the archive was made public, and Trump Jr. was not given exclusive access.\\n\\n**10. Trump Created a Secret Internet Server to Covertly Communicate with a Russian Bank**\\n\\nThis article mentions various rumors and speculation about President Trump\\'s connections to Russia, but no concrete evidence supports these claims.\\n\\nThese ten instances highlight the importance of fact-checking and critical thinking in journalism. It is crucial to verify information and sources before publishing to avoid spreading misinformation and damaging credibility.', 'Job Market Shows Signs of Weakening, But Some Economists Don\\'t See Cause for Alarm\\n\\nThe latest employment report revealed a significant slowdown in job growth, with the economy adding just 74,000 jobs in December, far below expectations. This marks the weakest month for job growth since January 2011. However, some economists are cautioning against reading too much into the numbers, citing other indicators that suggest the labor market is still on track.\\n\\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate fell to 6.7% in December, but this decline was largely due to workers leaving the labor force rather than finding new jobs. The labor force participation rate, which measures the percentage of the adult population employed or actively looking for work, has been declining since 2007 and now stands at its lowest level since 1978.\\n\\nSome experts point to unusually cold weather in certain regions as a possible factor in the weak job growth. The construction industry, which was heavily affected by the harsh weather, lost 16,000 jobs in December.\\n\\nDespite the disappointing job growth numbers, many economists remain optimistic about the overall state of the job market. \"Just about every other measure of job growth suggests that employers are either hiring or intending to hire, extending hours and laying off fewer people,\" said Tim Hopper, chief economist for TIAA-CREF.\\n\\nOthers argue that the unemployment rate is a poor measure of the job market\\'s health, as it only reflects those actively looking for work. Many people who have given up on their job search are not counted in the statistics.\\n\\n\"I think we\\'re going to have a long-term unemployment crisis for a long time,\" said Heidi Shierholz, economist with the Economic Policy Institute. \"We\\'re not going to get back to the pre-recession job market anytime soon.\"\\n\\nThe experiences of individuals who have been unemployed for extended periods highlight the challenges many face in finding new employment. Jamie May, a former senior manager who has been jobless for over a year, described the emotional toll of being unemployed, saying, \"I just want a job.\"\\n\\nThe debate over job market trends and the effectiveness of government policies in supporting workers will likely continue, as the labor market remains a crucial indicator of the overall state of the economy.', 'Tax Debate Rages On: Progressivity vs. Adequate Revenue\\n\\nThe debate surrounding the expiration of tax cuts has sparked a heated discussion about the balance between progressivity and adequate revenue. While some advocate for making the tax code more progressive, others argue that the economic climate and structural changes in the economy make it crucial to maintain current tax levels.\\n\\nAccording to the Tax Policy Center, the expiration of tax cuts would disproportionately affect high-income households, with those in the top 0.1 percent facing an average increase of $633,946. On the other hand, those in the bottom quintile of the income distribution would see a $412 increase. This disparity has sparked concerns about the impact on the economy and the need for a balanced approach.\\n\\nSome Democrats argue that while the goal of making the tax code more progressive is important, it is crucial to ensure that the revenue generated is adequate to fund essential programs like Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare. The Congressional Budget Office has found that between 1979 and 2007, the top 1 percent of households saw their inflation-adjusted income grow 275 percent, while the bottom 20 percent grew just 18 percent. This growing wealth inequality has led some to argue that even if the economy returns to Clinton-era growth rates, the poor and middle class may not be able to stomach a return to Clinton-era tax rates.\\n\\nThe White House has made the case for raising revenue from high-income households and keeping taxes low on middle-income households, citing the need to address long-term economic changes that have rewarded the rich and punished many others. However, some policy experts argue that limiting tax increases to just a small fraction of households might not generate enough revenue to finance the programs that Democrats want to preserve.\\n\\nAs the debate continues, it is essential to consider both sides of the argument and the complex interplay between progressivity and adequate revenue. While making the tax code more progressive is crucial for reducing income inequality, it is equally important to ensure that the revenue generated is sufficient to fund essential programs and address the needs of all taxpayers.', '**Wyoming Senator Candidate Liz Cheney Stands Firm on Same-Sex Marriage Despite Family Feud**\\n\\nIn the midst of the holiday season, a family feud has emerged within the prominent Cheney family, with Senatorial candidate Liz Cheney drawing criticism from her sister, Mary, and her wife, Heather Poe, over her stance on same-sex marriage.\\n\\nMary Cheney, who is in a same-sex marriage, took to social media to express her disappointment and disagreement with her sister\\'s views, stating that Liz is \"just wrong\" and \"on the wrong side of history.\" The issue has sparked a heated debate, with some arguing that Liz\\'s opposition to same-sex marriage is a departure from her family\\'s long-standing support for LGBTQ+ rights.\\n\\nIn an interview on Fox News Sunday, Liz Cheney reiterated her stance, stating that she does not believe in same-sex marriage and supports the traditional definition of marriage. Her sister and her family have been vocal about their disagreement, with Mary and Heather sharing their personal story and experiences on social media.\\n\\nThis controversy has brought to light the complex and often challenging nature of family dynamics, particularly when it comes to issues that are deeply personal and emotional. The Cheneys, a family known for their conservative values, have historically been supportive of LGBTQ+ rights, with Dick Cheney having spoken out in favor of same-sex marriage and challenging his own party\\'s stance on the issue.\\n\\nThe debate surrounding same-sex marriage highlights the ongoing evolution of public opinion on the topic, with many young Americans considering it a non-issue. However, for those who identify as LGBTQ+, this issue is about freedom and equality, as well as the importance of personal growth and understanding.\\n\\nIn this vein, the American Principles Fund, an independent political group, has launched an ad criticizing Liz Cheney for her stance, stating that she is standing in the way of progress and fairness for all Americans. While Liz Cheney has stood firm in her beliefs, her sister and family have made it clear that this issue is personal and goes beyond politics.\\n\\nAs Americans, we are reminded that even the most personal and sensitive issues can spark intense debate and disagreement. Ultimately, it is crucial that we approach these discussions with empathy, understanding, and a commitment to the values of freedom, equality, and compassion.', 'Special Counsel Mueller\\'s Silence Raises Anticipation for Upcoming Election\\n\\nIn the midst of the ongoing Russian interference investigation, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has remained relatively quiet in recent weeks, adhering to Justice Department guidelines that prohibit major actions close to elections. While this uncharacteristic silence has generated speculation about what Mueller might reveal once the midterms are over, sources suggest that he is expected to issue reports on two critical aspects of the investigation, including whether President Trump obstructed justice and if there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.\\n\\nThe upcoming election results will likely shape the future of the Russia investigation. If Democrats win back the House, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\\'s political calculus could change, potentially leading to a renewed push to wrap up the investigation. On the other hand, if Republicans maintain their majority, the political pressure on Rosenstein could ease.\\n\\nFurthermore, the fate of Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions remains uncertain. Rumors have circulated about Trump firing Sessions after the midterms, which could lead to a replacement who might take over the Russia probe. Rosenstein\\'s future is also uncertain, as he reportedly offered to resign after a New York Times report revealed his suggestion to secretly record Trump and discuss invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office. Despite Trump\\'s recent statement that he would prefer Rosenstein to remain in his post, speculation remains that Trump may still fire him.\\n\\nWhile Mueller\\'s silence has raised anticipation for what he might reveal after the election, it is unclear if his reports will mark the end of the investigation. Sources suggest that he may issue \"satellite indictments\" for fringe players in the Russia saga, such as former Trump adviser Roger Stone, in the coming weeks. Ultimately, the stakes for both President Trump and the Republican Party will change dramatically after the midterms, with the possibility of heightened scrutiny and increased latitude to curtail the investigation.', 'Title: French City of Nice Mourns After Deadly Truck Attack on Bastille Day Celebrations\\n\\nThe city of Nice, France, is in mourning after a devastating truck attack on Bastille Day celebrations, leaving at least 84 people dead and over 200 injured. The attack, which occurred on the evening of July 14, was carried out by a 31-year-old Tunisian-born resident of Nice who drove a rented truck into a crowded area of the city.\\n\\nThe driver, Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, was identified by fingerprints found in the truck, and was killed by police as they tried to stop him. The attack was the deadliest in France since the November 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people.\\n\\nThe victims of the attack included 10 children and adolescents, as well as 28 children who remain hospitalized. The attack also left hundreds of people injured, with 52 in critical condition and 25 in a coma. President Francois Hollande described the attack as an \"unspeakable act\" and vowed that France would \"overcome all trials.\"\\n\\nThe attack occurred just as the Bastille Day celebrations were ending, with the crowds dispersing after a fireworks display. Witnesses described the scene as chaotic, with the truck plowing through the crowds and the driver firing a gun several times. The police eventually shot the driver and brought the attack to an end.\\n\\nThe attack has left the city of Nice and the French people in shock, with many taking to social media to express their grief and solidarity. The French government has declared a national mourning period from Saturday to Monday, and has extended its state of emergency, which was set to expire later this month.\\n\\nThe attack has also raised questions about how the driver was able to breach security at the event. The French Interior Minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said that the police are investigating the incident and are working to identify any possible connections to terrorist organizations.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the attack, French authorities are providing support to the victims and their families, and are working to secure the city of Nice and prevent any future attacks. The people of Nice are coming together to mourn the loss of life and to support those affected by the attack.', 'Title: Criticism Mounts Against Right to Rise, Super PAC Backing Jeb Bush\\n\\nThe campaign to elect Jeb Bush as the next President of the United States has been marred by criticism and disappointment. The criticism has been directed towards Mike Murphy, the mastermind behind the Right to Rise super PAC, which has spent millions of dollars on advertisements and messaging aimed at boosting Bush\\'s chances of winning. Despite the significant investment, the ads have failed to deliver the desired results.\\n\\nDonors and supporters of Bush have expressed frustration and concern about Murphy\\'s strategy, which has focused on highlighting Bush\\'s successful record as governor of Florida rather than adapting to the shifting political landscape. They worry that the super PAC\\'s tactics are more likely to harm Bush\\'s reputation and legacy than help him win the election.\\n\\nOne major concern is the decision to spend money on direct mailers and video mailers, which some view as a waste of resources. The mailers were sent to Bush supporters in key states, including New Hampshire and Iowa, as well as to a select group of donors and finance prospects. The cost of the mailers was reportedly \"a few thousand dollars\" but some see it as a frivolous expense.\\n\\nOthers have criticized Murphy\\'s strategy for not adapting quickly enough to the changing political landscape. Trump\\'s entry into the race and his anti-establishment message have shaken up the political landscape, making it difficult for Bush to gain traction. Critics argue that Murphy\\'s approach has been too focused on touting Bush\\'s record as governor, rather than addressing the concerns and issues of today.\\n\\nThe criticism has also been directed towards Murphy\\'s personality and management style, which some find off-putting or ineffective. Despite his reputation as a genius of politics, Murphy\\'s inability to adapt to changing circumstances has raised questions about his ability to lead the super PAC.\\n\\nThe Right to Rise super PAC has spent $58.8 million so far, and there is no indication that it will stop anytime soon. However, the lack of results and the growing criticism from donors and supporters may lead to changes in its strategy. The fate of the Bush campaign and the legacy of Jeb Bush hang in the balance, and the decision on whether to stick with Murphy or seek new leadership remains to be seen.', 'Security Clearance Rejection Sparks Tensions Between Flynn and Intelligence Community\\n\\nA top deputy to National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was denied a crucial security clearance, forcing him to leave his post on the National Security Council (NSC). The rejection has heightened tensions between Flynn and the intelligence community, already strained due to reports of Flynn\\'s conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States.\\n\\nRobin Townley, senior director for Africa on the NSC, had requested an elite security clearance known as \"Sensitive Compartmented Information\" clearance. However, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) rejected his application, citing unspecified reasons. The move has sparked concerns about Flynn\\'s relationships with the intelligence community and his ability to carry out his duties as National Security Adviser.\\n\\nFlynn and his allies believe the rejection is a \"hit job\" from within the CIA, fueled by skepticism of the intelligence community\\'s techniques. One source close to Flynn described the move as an attempt to discredit him and his associates. However, Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, dismissed the notion as \"baloney,\" stating that intelligence agencies are thorough in their review process.\\n\\nThe controversy has also raised questions about Flynn\\'s own ties to Russia. Flynn\\'s previous employment in Russia and his dinner with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2015 have raised eyebrows. Additionally, the FBI is investigating Flynn\\'s December communications with Russia\\'s ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, which some claim may have involved discussions about US sanctions imposed on Russia.\\n\\nThe White House has refused to comment on the matter, while Flynn\\'s allies believe he is being unfairly targeted by the intelligence community. One White House official noted that Flynn is not particularly close to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson or Defense Secretary James Mattis, but acknowledged concerns about Flynn\\'s calls to the Russian ambassador, which were not shared with all of Trump\\'s top advisors and aides.\\n\\nDespite the controversy, Flynn remains in contact with top Trump officials and Cabinet secretaries, and a senior Trump official downplayed the idea that Flynn may be in danger. The situation is likely to continue to unfold as the administration grapples with the implications of Flynn\\'s actions and the intelligence community\\'s concerns.', 'Headline: Republican Candidates Vie for South Carolina Congressional Seat in Contentious Primary\\n\\nA 16-way battle is underway in South Carolina\\'s 1st Congressional District, where former Governor Mark Sanford is seeking a second chance to represent the district he previously represented. However, Sanford\\'s bid is not without controversy, given his infamous affair that led to his resignation as governor.\\n\\nSanford\\'s return to politics comes after a stint on the Appalachian Trail, where he initially claimed to be hiking while secretly traveling to Argentina to continue his extramarital affair. In a recent interview, Sanford expressed his desire for redemption, acknowledging that some people may never forgive him.\\n\\nSanford\\'s opponents, including Teddy Turner, son of CNN founder Ted Turner, are not making it easy for him. Turner has seen a surge in internal polling and has been the target of attack ads linking him to one of his father\\'s ex-wives, Jane Fonda.\\n\\nOn the Democratic side, Elizabeth Colbert Busch, the sister of comedian and TV host Stephen Colbert, is expected to be a strong contender in the general election. While some may view her candidacy as a joke, Colbert Busch is determined to make a serious run and emphasize the importance of this election.\\n\\nOther notable candidates include State Sen. Larry Grooms, who has received significant local endorsements and boasts a strong campaign team. The winner of this primary will likely face off against Colbert Busch in the general election.\\n\\nThe campaign season has been marked by intense competition and negative ads, but one observer notes that Sanford\\'s honesty about his personal struggles has made him more relatable to voters.\\n\\n\"The fact that he\\'s admitted his mistakes and is asking for forgiveness is refreshing,\" said John Avlon, a CNN political contributor. \"Down here, people appreciate honesty and humility.\"\\n\\nThe election is just around the corner, with voters deciding on June 26. Stay tuned to see who will emerge victorious in this crowded and contentious race.', \"**Democratic Presidential Candidates Face Off in Crucial New York Primary**\\n\\nThe democratic presidential primary debate is heating up, with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders set to square off in a critical contest in New York on April 19. The stakes are high, with both candidates seeking to sway voters and lock up crucial delegates in the state where they both have deep roots.\\n\\nClinton, who served as New York's senator for eight years, currently has a home in Chappaqua and chose to base her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn. Sanders, on the other hand, was born and raised in Brooklyn and still has a strong connection to the city. Both candidates are emphasizing their personal ties to the state and their ability to take on Republican front-runner Donald Trump, another New Yorker.\\n\\nAs the race narrows, the candidates have become increasingly aggressive, with Sanders questioning Clinton's judgment and credibility and Clinton hitting back at Sanders' lack of experience and unrealistic policy proposals. The debate is expected to be the most heated yet, with both candidates making major appeals to Democratic voters.\\n\\nThe financial industry has been a major point of contention, with Sanders repeatedly accusing Clinton of being beholden to big-money interests and accepting donations from Wall Street. Clinton has pushed back, saying she has a strong record of advocating for financial reform and that Sanders is trying to divide voters with false attacks.\\n\\nThe stakes are high for both candidates. Clinton is trying to maintain her delegate lead and secure the nomination, while Sanders is looking to make a strong push in New York and prove he can stay in the race. A win in the state would be a significant psychological blow to Clinton's campaign, which has posited that New York is solidly her territory.\\n\\nThe debate is also expected to touch on several other key issues, including the controversy surrounding Clinton's speeches at Goldman Sachs, her views on Wall Street and financial reform, and her handling of the Benghazi attack. Sanders has questioned Clinton's judgment and criticized her acceptance of donations from Wall Street, while Clinton has hit back at Sanders' lack of experience and criticized his plan to break up the big banks.\\n\\nWith the debate just days away, both candidates are under pressure to make their cases to voters and convince them that they are the best equipped to take on Trump in the general election. Will the debate provide a turning point in the race, or will one candidate emerge with a clearer advantage? Only time will tell.\", 'As the Republican Party\\'s delegate selection process reaches its climax, Donald Trump\\'s grip on the nomination may begin to slip. While the real estate mogul has secured the support of many delegates, a significant number of them are still free to vote for their candidate of choice, and some may shift their allegiance if no candidate wins a majority.\\n\\nCurrently, Trump\\'s closest competitors, including Senator Ted Cruz and Governor John Kasich, are working to secure the support of more delegates and build momentum. If neither Trump nor his rivals win a majority of delegates in the initial rounds of voting, the contest may go to subsequent rounds, potentially giving more delegates the freedom to vote as they please.\\n\\nSome states have already begun releasing their delegates, making it possible for Trump\\'s opponents to capitalize on his potential weaknesses. California, with its large delegate haul, is a key state that could make a significant impact on the outcome.\\n\\nAdditionally, the \"eight-state rule,\" which requires a candidate to win more than 50% of delegates in at least eight states, remains in place. While Trump has already met this requirement, changes to the rule could still put his opponents back in the running.\\n\\nThe selection of delegates will play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the nomination process. Candidates are already working to get their supporters elected as delegates, with the hope that they will vote for them once they are unbound.\\n\\nWhile Trump\\'s campaign has secured a significant number of delegates, his opponents are not giving up. As the process unfolds, it\\'s unclear whether he will ultimately emerge as the nominee, or if another candidate will seize the opportunity to challenge his dominance.', 'Title: The Dark Side of Human Nature: How Conspiracy Theories Thrive in the Digital Age\\n\\nIn today\\'s digitally driven world, it\\'s easier than ever for misinformation to spread like wildfire, and conspiracy theories to flourish. The rise of social media has given a platform to people who peddle falsehoods, and a receptive audience to those who are willing to believe. But why do we fall prey to such nonsense? Is it because we\\'re inherently gullible, or are there other factors at play?\\n\\nResearch suggests that our brains are wired to detect baloney, but we often allow our existing beliefs to influence what we accept as truth. As Sherlock Holmes once said, \"Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.\" This cognitive bias can be exploited by those seeking to make a profit or gain power.\\n\\nThe #Plandemic video is a recent example of how easily false information can spread. This video claims that Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, and others are behind the COVID-19 pandemic, a conspiracy theory that has been thoroughly debunked. But the harm isn\\'t just the misinformation itself; it\\'s the erosion of trust in credible sources and the manipulation of people\\'s emotions.\\n\\nSocial media platforms like Facebook and YouTube have struggled to keep up with the spread of misinformation. While they have taken steps to remove content that violates their policies, the problem persists. In fact, a recent video claiming to expose the \"truth\" about COVID-19 reached over 8 million views before being taken down.\\n\\nSo, what can we do to stop the spread of misinformation? Rather than restricting free speech, we need a more discerning audience. Americans need to understand that they are being targeted by disinformation campaigns, and that not everything that fits their existing beliefs is true. We must learn to be skeptical and demand extraordinary proof for extraordinary claims.\\n\\nAs astronomer Carl Sagan once said, \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.\" In this digital age, it\\'s more important than ever to stay vigilant and committed to mental hygiene. By recognizing the tactics used by those who spread misinformation, we can better protect ourselves and others from their influence.'], 'labels': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}\n"
