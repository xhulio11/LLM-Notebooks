            "\n",
            "In a surprise turn of events, the intellectual epicenter of conservatism in the United States is not Washington, D.C., but California. The Claremont Colleges, located on the eastern edge of Los Angeles County, were the birthplace of intellectual Trumpism and the \"Flight 93 Election\" - an influential essay published in the Claremont Review of Books that stated that electing Trump was the only way to save the country.\n",
            "\n",
            "Conservatives living and working in California view themselves as philosophically, culturally, and demographically under siege, and the political movement they are ideating, advocating, and building reflects that fully. This strain of conservatism takes its spirit from Andrew Breitbart's saying that \"politics is downstream of culture.\" Conservative podcast host Michael Knowles, a trained actor and native New Yorker who got his start in politics working on a Republican campaign his sophomore year at Yale, and who wrote a best-selling book called Reasons to Vote for Democrats: A Comprehensive Guide (the pages inside the book are largely blank), told me that California conservatism was more of an \"anti-ideology,\" one largely based on kulturkampf, not policy.\n",
            "\n",
            "California conservatives also have the mentality and the unanimity of a people under threat. In California, and across much of the country, conservatives view themselves - despite a massive and constant media presence and nationwide control over all three branches of the federal government - as isolated, comparatively weak, and always chasing power, never in power.\n",
            "\n",
            "As Ben Domenech wrote in the Federalist: \"If the right really did have overwhelming political power, it would be running roughshod. Outside of the realm of taxes and regulation, it's hard to see that. Obamacare is still mostly the law of the land. Planned Parenthood is still mostly funded. Education policy is still nibbling at the edges of reform. Curbing public sector unions is limited to a few states. Republican success in New England and Maryland and elsewhere has led to the election of quite a few governors, but where's their big achievements besides managing things a little more cheaply?\"\n",
            "\n",
            "But now the conservatism of California - the conservatism of isolation and powerlessness, the discourse that comes from people who believe their views will never become the view - is one of the most powerful forces in American politics.\n",
            "\n",
            "California's conservatives are enjoying themselves. When we spoke, Knowles told me, \"For the first time in my lifetime, these days, conservatives are the ones who are having fun. Conservatives kind of seem like the cool guys, and the left kind of seems like the scolds.\" His viewpoint matches much of what I heard and saw from conservatives in California - because no state-level votes or congressional seats depend on them, they can say whatever they want with aplomb. There's no nostalgia for the past; the good times are now.\n",
            "\n",
            "But what the future holds for a movement that appears largely united by its opposition is anyone's guess. The California-style politics - in short, a laser focus on culture, immigration, and race - that helped Trump win the White House have not healed the schisms within the Republican Party, nor have they defanged their liberal opponents.\n",
            "\n",
            "Perhaps that's the real strength of California-style conservatives: By feeling like a besieged minority lacking in real power, they can enjoy the best of both worlds, shirking the responsibilities of governance while still wielding real power.."
