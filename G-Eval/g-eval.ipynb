      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has tightened the rules on ministers accepting gifts and hospitality, after a row over senior Labour figures receiving freebies. Ministers will not be banned from accepting gifts but the ministerial code has been updated to require them to consider the \"need to maintain the public's confidence in the standards of propriety\" when deciding whether to do so. A register of gifts received by ministers will now also be published monthly, rather than quarterly. Since winning power in July, Sir Keir and other cabinet ministers have faced criticism for accepting gifts from wealthy donors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Last month, Sir Keir paid back more than £6,000 worth of gifts and hospitality he had received since becoming prime minister, including tickets to see Taylor Swift, following the backlash. He has also faced scrutiny for receiving thousands of pounds of clothes from Labour peer and donor Lord Alli, who has gifted clothing to a number of ministers as well as the PM's wife. Since then, Downing Street has said Sir Keir, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Chancellor Rachel Reeves will no longer accept donations of clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The updated ministerial code states that it is a \"well-established and recognised rule that ministers should not accept any gifts, hospitality or service which would, or might reasonably appear to, compromise their judgement or place them under an obligation to people or organisations that might try inappropriately to influence their work in government\". The same principle applies to members of a minister's family. However, it points out that ministers have a responsibility to represent the government and their duties will sometimes require them to attend events where hospitality may be offered. The code adds that it is \"primarily a matter of judgement for ministers who are personally responsible for deciding how to act\" in relation to accepting gifts. The monthly register will include details and the value of gifts worth more than £140, as well as hospitality, received and given by ministers in their ministerial capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "It comes as the latest list of ministers' interests revealed the prime minister is renting out his family home in north London after moving into Downing Street. Sir Keir is not the first prime minister to do so - David Cameron also rented out his family home and Theresa May rented out a flat she owned in central London. The list includes any relevant private interests which could be perceived to give rise to a conflict with a minister's public duties. It will now be published more regularly - quarterly rather than twice a year.\n",

Ministers will not be banned from accepting gifts but the ministerial code has been updated to require them to consider the \"need to maintain the public\\'s confidence in the standards of propriety\" when deciding whether to do so. A register of gifts received by ministers will now also be published monthly, rather than quarterly. Since winning power in July, Sir Keir and other cabinet ministers have faced criticism for accepting gifts from wealthy donors.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nLast month, Sir Keir paid back more than £6,000 worth of gifts and hospitality he had received since becoming prime minister, including tickets to see Taylor Swift, following the backlash. He has also faced scrutiny for receiving thousands of pounds of clothes from Labour peer and donor Lord Alli, who has gifted clothing to a number of ministers as well as the PM\\'s wife. Since then, Downing Street has said Sir Keir, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Chancellor Rachel Reeves will no longer accept donations of clothes.\\n\\nThe updated ministerial code states that it is a \"well-established and recognised rule that ministers should not accept any gifts, hospitality or service which would, or might reasonably appear to, compromise their judgement or place them under an obligation to people or organisations that might try inappropriately to influence their work in government\". The same principle applies to members of a minister\\'s family. However, it points out that ministers have a responsibility to represent the government and their duties will sometimes require them to attend events where hospitality may be offered. The code adds that it is \"primarily a matter of judgement for ministers who are personally responsible for deciding how to act\" in relation to accepting gifts. The monthly register will include details and the value of gifts worth more than £140, as well as hospitality, received and given by ministers in their ministerial capacity.\\n\\nIt comes as the latest list of ministers\\' interests revealed the prime minister is renting out his family home in north London after moving into Downing Street. Sir Keir is not the first prime minister to do so - David Cameron also rented out his family home and Theresa May rented out a flat she owned in central London. The list includes any relevant private interests which could be perceived to give rise to a conflict with a minister\\'s public duties. It will now be published more regularly - quarterly rather than twice a year.', actual_output=\"**New Rules on Gifts to Ministers Come into Effect in Effort to Maintain Public Trust**In a move aimed at strengthening transparency and accountability, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has updated the ministerial code to outline new rules on gifts and hospitality for ministers. The revised guidelines emphasize the importance of maintaining public trust in the propriety of ministerial conduct.Under the updated code, ministers will no longer be banned from accepting gifts, but they will be required to consider whether such gifts might reasonably appear to compromise their judgment or create an obligation to outside influences.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other cabinet ministers had faced criticism for accepting gifts, including tickets to see Taylor Swift and thousands of pounds of clothes from a Labour peer and donor. In response, Sir Keir repaid over £6,000 worth of gifts and hospitality, and the government has since restricted ministers from accepting donations of clothes.The updated code acknowledges that ministers have a responsibility to maintain the public's trust in their propriety.
